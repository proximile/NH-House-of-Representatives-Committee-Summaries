00:13:00.389 --> 00:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
okay I'd like to welcome the public to
 
00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
our meeting today this is the education
 
00:13:06.269 --> 00:13:06.279 align:start position:0%
funding committee and we are here today
 
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
looking at 14 bills of which we broke
 
00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:11.839 align:start position:0%
them down into categories as they're
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
listed and I I'll go through that in a
 
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
second and we will be taking some e
 
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
executive sessions throughout the day um
 
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
after we finish these various categories
 
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
for the members on the committee here
 
00:13:28.949 --> 00:13:28.959 align:start position:0%
what we have you have the bill lineup
 
00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
That that we have for today the agenda
 
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
you can see the first four bills HB 717
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
742 773 and 603 are all related to
 
00:13:41.519 --> 00:13:42.829 align:start position:0%
742 773 and 603 are all related to
special

00:13:42.829 --> 00:13:42.839 align:start position:0%
special
 
00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
education so what we're going to be
 
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
doing is we're going to be discussing
 
00:13:49.949 --> 00:13:49.959 align:start position:0%
these bills then we're going to be we
 
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
know that on March 4 we have to move a
 
00:13:56.509 --> 00:13:56.519 align:start position:0%
bill forward dealing with special
 
00:13:59.949 --> 00:13:59.959 align:start position:0%
education these are early bills and so
 
00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:02.120 align:start position:0%
one of them will be used as the vehicle
 
00:14:05.829 --> 00:14:05.839 align:start position:0%
to go forward and then we will also try
 
00:14:10.269 --> 00:14:10.279 align:start position:0%
to uh perhaps retain a bill to work on
 
00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
it because this this particular issue
 
00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:14.600 align:start position:0%
and I met with several folks yesterday
 
00:14:16.829 --> 00:14:16.839 align:start position:0%
represent luno and and representative
 
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
Earth and and um the issue of special
 
00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
education Aid formly catastrophic age is
 
00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
huge and you're all familiar with the
 
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
formula now when 3 and 1/2 times 3 and
 
00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:35.720 align:start position:0%
1/2 x times up to 10 that's becomes
 
00:14:38.829 --> 00:14:38.839 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the combination of the
 
00:14:42.189 --> 00:14:42.199 align:start position:0%
state and and the local 8020 but the
 
00:14:45.069 --> 00:14:45.079 align:start position:0%
first three and a half is that of the
 
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
local $770,000 roughly if used 20,000 as
 
00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:50.199 align:start position:0%
the average per pupil
 
00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:53.560 align:start position:0%
cost and we're trying to identify if we
 
00:14:56.269 --> 00:14:56.279 align:start position:0%
moved the
 
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the Lo local down to
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
up to 2 and a half or three a lesser
 
00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:06.680 align:start position:0%
amount than now what would that what
 
00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
would that entail what would it include
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
as far as numbers of
 
00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:12.839 align:start position:0%
students it's very difficult to find
 
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
that information out and quite frankly
 
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
we haven't been able to get an accurate
 
00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:20.519 align:start position:0%
number on that Doe does not have that
 
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
when you have that breakoff three and a
 
00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
half times going forward you're talking
 
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
about the catastrophic agid you're
 
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
talking about those 800 students
 
00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
that are are very expensive students in
 
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
terms of costing out special education
 
00:15:38.189 --> 00:15:38.199 align:start position:0%
but if you try to build back finding out
 
00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
how many kids would be in that two and a
 
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
half to three and a half level we start
 
00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
seeing that curved all a sudden Spike go
 
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
really high because that's where the
 
00:15:50.749 --> 00:15:50.759 align:start position:0%
other 30,000 kids are that have IEPs in
 
00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:52.959 align:start position:0%
that category there and going backwards
 
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
but the majority are start somewhere
 
00:15:56.829 --> 00:15:56.839 align:start position:0%
starting to be down that two times two
 
00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
and a half times and so we bring it back
 
00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
down that way what are we going to do to
 
00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
the upper end of States proportion it's
 
00:16:06.509 --> 00:16:06.519 align:start position:0%
going to be we're going to see
 
00:16:09.189 --> 00:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
projections in the future go Way Beyond
 
00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
the 50 million mark up above 60 million
 
00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
and we have Mark here today which can
 
00:16:16.509 --> 00:16:16.519 align:start position:0%
help us out a little bit but that's not
 
00:16:19.309 --> 00:16:19.319 align:start position:0%
his baileywick either he his baileywick
 
00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
is that of trying to help with the
 
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
financial numbers he does not work for
 
00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:27.759 align:start position:0%
the special ed department so um that's
 
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
where we stand right here here so if we
 
00:16:32.749 --> 00:16:32.759 align:start position:0%
look at these bills right now first of
 
00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
are there any questions on the process
 
00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:35.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to take those four first
 
00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:38.360 align:start position:0%
four bills then we go into the next
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
three bills we notice they're all swep
 
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
bills and we will deal with the issue of
 
00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
swep do we how do we address the swep
 
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
issue which we know is a very huge issue
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
in this state the next five bills listed
 
00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
some May six but five down through
 
00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:00.079 align:start position:0%
772 are dealing with our adequate
 
00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:02.440 align:start position:0%
formula and so we're going to take these
 
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
groups the last one the the the five 675
 
00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
Bill we will take up but that also deals
 
00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
some issues Beyond just the adequacy
 
00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
talks about a cap and other such things
 
00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
and 510 is a bill which deals with due
 
00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:21.640 align:start position:0%
processes separate from the issue of
 
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
funding for this students in this regard
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
of special education or or swep or the
 
00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:29.320 align:start position:0%
foundation formula
 
00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:31.880 align:start position:0%
so without spinning our Wheels a whole
 
00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
lot more I'd like to go right back to
 
00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
the top the first four bills right now
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
and look at 717 742 773 and 603 let's
 
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
first what 717 does it says goes from 3
 
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
and 1/2 time 3 and 1/2x and breaks it
 
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
down to
 
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
three that's the general Twist of that
 
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
bill it's one which just looks at the
 
00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:12.200 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
formula and it would go up to three
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
times then three times to 10 times and
 
00:18:21.549 --> 00:18:21.559 align:start position:0%
10 times Beyond 100% to the
 
00:18:24.789 --> 00:18:24.799 align:start position:0%
state so backing It Off from three and
 
00:18:27.149 --> 00:18:27.159 align:start position:0%
A2 to three we're not sure what that
 
00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:29.240 align:start position:0%
would cost mark do you have any
 
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
information that could help
 
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:33.400 align:start position:0%
us understand that a little bit better I
 
00:18:35.669 --> 00:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
know we played with numbers all day
 
00:18:35.679 --> 00:18:38.909 align:start position:0%
know we played with numbers all day
yesterday

00:18:38.909 --> 00:18:38.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
um does everybody is everybody familiar
 
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
with Mark
 
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:46.360 align:start position:0%
here he's a frequent flyer here from doe
 
00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning Mark Mello Bureau
 
00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
of school Finance um uh yeah chairman
 
00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
ladin and nhed met um just to discuss
 
00:18:55.669 --> 00:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
this issue this has been an ongoing
 
00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
issue as far
 
00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
as data once you hit
 
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
$70,000 uh $70,000 in special education
 
00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:05.720 align:start position:0%
special education expenditures you
 
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
submit claims to the uh Bureau of
 
00:19:10.669 --> 00:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
special education for reimbursement so
 
00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
we have data on any costs that are above
 
00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:16.360 align:start position:0%
70,000 because you can get paid for it
 
00:19:18.789 --> 00:19:18.799 align:start position:0%
any cost below 70,000 wouldn't make its
 
00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
way to the Department of Education so we
 
00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
don't know the exercise um that I
 
00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:25.880 align:start position:0%
believe the Bureau of special education
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
is working on I don't know if they'll be
 
00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
successful and the exercise we walked
 
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
through chairman lad with um was could
 
00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
we make any sort of forecast about how
 
00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
many students might exist within that
 
00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
cost range of 3 to 3.5 or 2.5 to
 
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
3.5 and uh what we're struggling with is
 
00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
we know there's 800 at 800 out of around
 
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
31,000 students 800 a very small amount
 
00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
that have cost above
 
00:19:56.909 --> 00:19:56.919 align:start position:0%
3.5 so we know there's a lot of students
 
00:20:00.789 --> 00:20:00.799 align:start position:0%
around 31,000 or so that are below that
 
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
but where they fall and what bucket they
 
00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
fall into we are trying to
 
00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
forecast what the slope might be or what
 
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
the curve might be we expect more
 
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
students to be on that lower end uh less
 
00:20:12.789 --> 00:20:12.799 align:start position:0%
students to be on that higher end and
 
00:20:14.149 --> 00:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
we're we're trying to come up with a
 
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
number that we feel like we could
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
present to you um but um I don't want to
 
00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:20.360 align:start position:0%
be pessimistic here but I wouldn't keep
 
00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:22.360 align:start position:0%
my hopes up I think this is really hard
 
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
for us to do um so the Bureau of special
 
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
education is looking into that to see if
 
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
they can give you a count of where we
 
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
think how claims would come in that 3 to
 
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
3.5 or 2.5 to 3.5 but the the basic
 
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
answer is we don't know um can we come
 
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:39.640 align:start position:0%
up with an estimate that might be
 
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable maybe so that's where we're
 
00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
at with that there and when you talk
 
00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:48.559 align:start position:0%
about this it's sort of like this you
 
00:20:51.029 --> 00:20:51.039 align:start position:0%
can see you know on on this this is 10
 
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
times over here getting down to three
 
00:20:56.029 --> 00:20:56.039 align:start position:0%
and a half times you go down lower and
 
00:20:59.950 --> 00:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
you can see how this line spikes right
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
up and so we having a hard time figuring
 
00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
out what these costs are so represent
 
00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:08.200 align:start position:0%
Lun did you have a question or you know
 
00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
add to a conversation yeah no no a
 
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
question for Mark so thank you very much
 
00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chair how is the um um how how is the
 
00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:18.799 align:start position:0%
average the Statewide average cost per
 
00:21:18.799 --> 00:21:19.870 align:start position:0%
average the Statewide average cost per
pupil

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
pupil
 
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:24.200 align:start position:0%
calculated um so um there's the one used
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
for special education Aid yes yeah the
 
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
one we're talking about right um so um
 
00:21:31.269 --> 00:21:31.279 align:start position:0%
the special education one it's an
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
estimate and so we do um we basically do
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
um we look at
 
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
ms22 budgets and we do kind of a budget
 
00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:41.960 align:start position:0%
an uh budget to actual analysis and we
 
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:43.480 align:start position:0%
send that to the special education
 
00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:46.120 align:start position:0%
Bureau so it's a forecast of where we
 
00:21:48.029 --> 00:21:48.039 align:start position:0%
think the actual cost per pup based on
 
00:21:50.909 --> 00:21:50.919 align:start position:0%
the doe 25s is going to land we try to
 
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
mimic that by looking at budget to
 
00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
actual from the previous year and then
 
00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
apply those percentages essentially out
 
00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
there's more to it than that but
 
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
essentially and and and our estimates
 
00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:02.799 align:start position:0%
have come within a pretty pretty close
 
00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
Okay so so just to be just to be clear
 
00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:09.640 align:start position:0%
the the the average cost per um make
 
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
sure I get the language right here uh
 
00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:14.360 align:start position:0%
the estimated State average expenditure
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
per pupil um includes special education
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
expenditures correct okay thank you any
 
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
other yes represent
 
00:22:28.909 --> 00:22:28.919 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you uh so one thing we
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
should one number we could get is if you
 
00:22:34.909 --> 00:22:34.919 align:start position:0%
took the most recent catastrophic a
 
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
distribution and you just changed the
 
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
three and 1/2 to three so that's going
 
00:22:43.789 --> 00:22:43.799 align:start position:0%
to tell you one number and then we know
 
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
that any new ones that would be coming
 
00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:49.000 align:start position:0%
on because we're dropping the number
 
00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:51.640 align:start position:0%
would be fairly small I do have that
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
number so if we go to let's see how
 
00:22:55.789 --> 00:22:55.799 align:start position:0%
quickly I can do it but if we go from
 
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
3.5 to 2.5 at a minimum Bas on those 8
 
00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:03.320 align:start position:0%
uh 57 students we know we have cost for
 
00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
we cover everything after 70k so if we
 
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
were going to cover everything 80% of
 
00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
50k to 70k which would be 2.5x to
 
00:23:16.029 --> 00:23:16.039 align:start position:0%
3.5x um I calculated that to be 13.6
 
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
million so at a minimum you're paying
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
13.6 million to go down to the
 
00:23:24.909 --> 00:23:24.919 align:start position:0%
2.5x but just follow up yes go ahead so
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
but this bill is three and you just told
 
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
me yeah so let me do three see if I can
 
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
do three real quick I think you can do
 
00:23:34.029 --> 00:23:34.039 align:start position:0%
half of that is that maybe yeah it would
 
00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:36.799 align:start position:0%
be yeah the Del the variance yeah okay
 
00:23:36.799 --> 00:23:41.950 align:start position:0%
be yeah the Del the variance yeah okay
yeah

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:43.549 align:start position:0%
 
6.8

00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559 align:start position:0%
6.8
 
00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
representa is something I apologize for
 
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
blurting out out of turn I uh got
 
00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
excited hearing data um so you were
 
00:23:55.789 --> 00:23:55.799 align:start position:0%
saying Mark that uh and thank you for
 
00:23:58.630 --> 00:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
being here that that 13.8 million that
 
00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
you were talking about would just be the
 
00:24:02.909 --> 00:24:02.919 align:start position:0%
C for the students that are already over
 
00:24:06.029 --> 00:24:06.039 align:start position:0%
3.5 correct it does not include the new
 
00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:09.039 align:start position:0%
students who would start popping up in
 
00:24:10.669 --> 00:24:10.679 align:start position:0%
that data set that's correct that number
 
00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:13.240 align:start position:0%
is a minimum minimum funding point just
 
00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to understand what we're working
 
00:24:16.669 --> 00:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
with thank
 
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
you this is what you're talking about
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
that you get now Jen can we get some
 
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
copies this made please uh enough for
 
00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:24.830 align:start position:0%
copies this made please uh enough for
the

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
committee back to back shows how this
 
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
much reprend
 
00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:24:39.789 --> 00:24:39.799 align:start position:0%
for helping us with
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
this I'm probably asking the obvious but
 
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
I guess I need to hear it verified so
 
00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
districts do
 
00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
not track or have the numbers that we're
 
00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
talking about they can't tell us how
 
00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
many students are in the 2 and a half
 
00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
times the estimated average or
 
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
three times estimated average uh so so
 
00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
you could do a so the department could
 
00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
do a survey where we ask districts for
 
00:25:07.789 --> 00:25:07.799 align:start position:0%
that information um it would be
 
00:25:09.669 --> 00:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
voluntary information and they wouldn't
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
receive funding for it so the you could
 
00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:14.200 align:start position:0%
ask the bureau Bureau of special
 
00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
education to go through that exercise um
 
00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
they would be basically doing a survey
 
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
and districts would if they filled out
 
00:25:22.029 --> 00:25:22.039 align:start position:0%
the survey I believe they could answer
 
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
that question so short answer to that is
 
00:25:27.029 --> 00:25:27.039 align:start position:0%
no the department does not have that the
 
00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
short answer is we've not done that no
 
00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:30.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of that survey being
 
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
done yes yes you may so I understand the
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
department doesn't have that
 
00:25:36.389 --> 00:25:36.399 align:start position:0%
information but my question is do the
 
00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
districts already have that information
 
00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
they're just not required to share it so
 
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
they could go through the exercise
 
00:25:46.909 --> 00:25:46.919 align:start position:0%
how they could go through the exercise
 
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh the data they ultimately have the
 
00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
students and the cost um um I don't know
 
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
how readily available it be or if
 
00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
they've already have it I'm not sure
 
00:25:58.029 --> 00:25:58.039 align:start position:0%
they have the data I just don't know how
 
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
EAS they can grab it and report it thank
 
00:26:06.269 --> 00:26:06.279 align:start position:0%
you yes represent Ricky so I I um have
 
00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:09.240 align:start position:0%
just a so are we
 
00:26:12.669 --> 00:26:12.679 align:start position:0%
talking 2.5 times or three times because
 
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
the bill says three times but so are we
 
00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
or are we just trying to make talk in
 
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
general we could be talking two and a
 
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
half three three and a half whatever
 
00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
this just how this whole thing works or
 
00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't work or doesn't yes thanks and
 
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
then yes represent yeah so thanks very
 
00:26:35.669 --> 00:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair and and so Mark um um
 
00:26:39.389 --> 00:26:39.399 align:start position:0%
uh I I think I personally I I think it
 
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
would be a a good request from the um a
 
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
good ask from the Department to
 
00:26:46.389 --> 00:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
districts to try to get a better
 
00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
understanding as to as to um the um you
 
00:26:52.389 --> 00:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
know how the how the costs would go down
 
00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
to and I don't know pick a number that
 
00:26:57.389 --> 00:26:57.399 align:start position:0%
that the chair has you know talked about
 
00:26:58.990 --> 00:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
you know two or 2 and a half or
 
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
something like that maybe deeper than
 
00:27:03.149 --> 00:27:03.159 align:start position:0%
than we're going to go but at least we
 
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
can cover that and try to model what
 
00:27:07.789 --> 00:27:07.799 align:start position:0%
that what that curve uh actually looks
 
00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:13.240 align:start position:0%
like but but um it you know it seems it
 
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
it seems unlikely to me that that
 
00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:19.240 align:start position:0%
districts would have access to that data
 
00:27:20.389 --> 00:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
already because you know that would
 
00:27:24.909 --> 00:27:24.919 align:start position:0%
require tracking cost by
 
00:27:27.909 --> 00:27:27.919 align:start position:0%
student by individual and and so I I
 
00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:30.559 align:start position:0%
guess how how do districts know when
 
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
right now when to start tracking costs
 
00:27:35.669 --> 00:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
on a per student basis because obviously
 
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
they're expecting reimbursement when
 
00:27:40.669 --> 00:27:40.679 align:start position:0%
they when they or 80% coverage once they
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
exceed three and a half times but but
 
00:27:44.909 --> 00:27:44.919 align:start position:0%
how do they know when they've gotten to
 
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
three and a half times are they cross
 
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
yeah at what threshold do they so so
 
00:27:50.389 --> 00:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
definitely the Bureau of special
 
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
education and the field could give you
 
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
more detailed information but
 
00:27:55.789 --> 00:27:55.799 align:start position:0%
mechanically uh this Bureau of special
 
00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
education publishes that standard early
 
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:01.480 align:start position:0%
before the school year starts or sorry
 
00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
now let me think about the mechanics of
 
00:28:05.549 --> 00:28:05.559 align:start position:0%
it yeah they give them advanced notice
 
00:28:07.789 --> 00:28:07.799 align:start position:0%
of that number so they've been flagged
 
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
as far as hey when your cost rece start
 
00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:12.200 align:start position:0%
70,000 yeah they're aware of that number
 
00:28:13.509 --> 00:28:13.519 align:start position:0%
and then the number doesn't change that
 
00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:15.240 align:start position:0%
much year-over-year so they know the
 
00:28:17.549 --> 00:28:17.559 align:start position:0%
program so whatever systems districts
 
00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:20.120 align:start position:0%
develop locally to flag high cost
 
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:22.200 align:start position:0%
students okay to be queued up for that
 
00:28:26.029 --> 00:28:26.039 align:start position:0%
invoicing process ejected by ejected by
 
00:28:26.039 --> 00:28:26.909 align:start position:0%
invoicing process ejected by ejected by
the

00:28:26.909 --> 00:28:26.919 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
department and there's got to be common
 
00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
Data Systems available which I think
 
00:28:35.909 --> 00:28:35.919 align:start position:0%
they're working on that right now we're
 
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
in a transition stage right now and so
 
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
and also separating out some of those
 
00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:44.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid costs too within that system
 
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
well and transportation and
 
00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
transportation that's exactly right so
 
00:28:51.509 --> 00:28:51.519 align:start position:0%
but there are some that are and when
 
00:28:53.149 --> 00:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
they come for three and a half they say
 
00:28:55.149 --> 00:28:55.159 align:start position:0%
oh we're there some of those costs
 
00:28:58.669 --> 00:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
within are not accepted so that when
 
00:29:00.149 --> 00:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
when a district with three and a half
 
00:29:02.029 --> 00:29:02.039 align:start position:0%
less submits all this stuff to they're
 
00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:03.640 align:start position:0%
all going to have to be reviewed to see
 
00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
if they do make that
 
00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
Mark yeah reps spilsbury so everything
 
00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:13.640 align:start position:0%
with respect to data which would
 
00:29:16.509 --> 00:29:16.519 align:start position:0%
inform you know our decisions about
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
spending uh operates on a lag time even
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
today uh the doe doesn't get the figures
 
00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:25.960 align:start position:0%
uh relative to the three and a half
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
threshold and reimbursement until the
 
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
end of the year MH almost anything that
 
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
we do is probably likely to have a
 
00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
2-year transition just before we'd start
 
00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
to see meaningful data I think there's a
 
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
couple of different ways of getting
 
00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
there and I think we have a pretty
 
00:29:44.509 --> 00:29:44.519 align:start position:0%
strong consensus that uh if we're going
 
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
to manage this better we're going to
 
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
need better data one way would be to
 
00:29:52.909 --> 00:29:52.919 align:start position:0%
just simply pass a law that requires the
 
00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
district to submit this even though it's
 
00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
a burden on them and they're getting
 
00:29:59.630 --> 00:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
nothing for it and and that might be uh
 
00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:02.120 align:start position:0%
a difficult uh
 
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
uptake uh another way is uh you know to
 
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
start plan ahead and look at the
 
00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:11.640 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um reimbursement uh systems
 
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
which I understand are going through a
 
00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:17.320 align:start position:0%
uh a transition into a new much more
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
integrated uh approach and uh if
 
00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
districts have to comply with the
 
00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.630 align:start position:0%
districts have to comply with the
Medicaid

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
requirements then we can piggy back off
 
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
of that perhaps Sy on further degree a
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
third one I suppose you know in in some
 
00:30:35.149 --> 00:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
ways we're all fundamentally
 
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with is to just leap into
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
the dark um so one way to find out how
 
00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
many students and uh we we know what
 
00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:47.960 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here if we're
 
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
talking two and a half times is a
 
00:30:54.269 --> 00:30:54.279 align:start position:0%
$20,000 band loow the threshold from
 
00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:56.360 align:start position:0%
approximately 70 to
 
00:30:59.230 --> 00:30:59.240 align:start position:0%
50 so how do you leap into the dark
 
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
right and and you don't know how to
 
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:04.360 align:start position:0%
budget it what it's going to cost one
 
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
way to do that is to uh to change the
 
00:31:10.669 --> 00:31:10.679 align:start position:0%
percentage of the cost share so for
 
00:31:13.549 --> 00:31:13.559 align:start position:0%
example I'm very open to the idea of
 
00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:16.360 align:start position:0%
lowering the threshold but I wouldn't be
 
00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:18.799 align:start position:0%
willing to lower the Threshold at an 80%
 
00:31:18.799 --> 00:31:19.669 align:start position:0%
willing to lower the Threshold at an 80%
State

00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
State
 
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
share would 50% be the appropriate uh
 
00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
division for that next lower tier
 
00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:30.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps to atable but a way of getting
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
to the data would be to lower the
 
00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:37.240 align:start position:0%
threshold to 2 and2 and put in something
 
00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
like a 10% State share so that the
 
00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:43.880 align:start position:0%
districts are getting something but
 
00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
we're hedging our bets until we get the
 
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
data so you don't just want to throw
 
00:31:52.029 --> 00:31:52.039 align:start position:0%
that thought out there to to to to take
 
00:31:55.149 --> 00:31:55.159 align:start position:0%
the step at a lower threshold but put it
 
00:31:58.590 --> 00:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
at an extraordinarily lower threshold
 
00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:00.679 align:start position:0%
in a transitionary phase and then you
 
00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
will get the data at least down that far
 
00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury is talking
 
00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:05.480 align:start position:0%
about a component that we have not
 
00:32:08.509 --> 00:32:08.519 align:start position:0%
talked about is between 3.5x the cost
 
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
per pupil and 10x we pay 80% of that so
 
00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:14.200 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to pay 100% of that that's
 
00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:16.559 align:start position:0%
a number we know that would cost $10
 
00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:19.039 align:start position:0%
million so if you wanted to increase the
 
00:32:20.629 --> 00:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
state's share you can increase
 
00:32:23.149 --> 00:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
Appropriations and fund that or if you
 
00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
want to decrease the state's share you
 
00:32:27.549 --> 00:32:27.559 align:start position:0%
could instead of 80% make it a lesser
 
00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:29.919 align:start position:0%
number Etc and you would spend less
 
00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
money um so that's another variable part
 
00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:34.360 align:start position:0%
of this formula and as representative
 
00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:37.000 align:start position:0%
spillsbury was saying uh uh bringing
 
00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
down from 2 3x 2 2.5x whatever you don't
 
00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
you could modify your share you don't
 
00:32:45.149 --> 00:32:45.159 align:start position:0%
have to pay state law determines how
 
00:32:46.509 --> 00:32:46.519 align:start position:0%
much of the state's going to pay
 
00:32:49.149 --> 00:32:49.159 align:start position:0%
currently it's 80% um our modeling is
 
00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
assuming 80% but that's another variable
 
00:32:53.549 --> 00:32:53.559 align:start position:0%
you can change Mark looking at your
 
00:32:58.350 --> 00:32:58.360 align:start position:0%
modeling and projecting out for FY 27
 
00:32:59.750 --> 00:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
and going
 
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
further and I'm not I'm not talking FY
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
26 I'm going out further um when that
 
00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
occurs and there I I I'm seeing a
 
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
likelihood of the number of students
 
00:33:17.389 --> 00:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
here increasing and the costs increasing
 
00:33:19.509 --> 00:33:19.519 align:start position:0%
right now we're at about $50 million and
 
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
I believe that what the governor's done
 
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
is basically put in $16 million to make
 
00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:27.519 align:start position:0%
that difference up between the 54 34 and
 
00:33:27.519 --> 00:33:28.950 align:start position:0%
that difference up between the 54 34 and
and

00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:32.269 --> 00:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
50 is there another way of doing this uh
 
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
in case that the costs for that cat Aid
 
00:33:40.669 --> 00:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
Spike that we can save the districts
 
00:33:44.509 --> 00:33:44.519 align:start position:0%
from having to deal with this pration
 
00:33:47.629 --> 00:33:47.639 align:start position:0%
amount which could be prated down to 30%
 
00:33:52.029 --> 00:33:52.039 align:start position:0%
or 60% or at 68% right now if we put
 
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
that pration amount at 100% or
 
00:33:59.710 --> 00:33:59.720 align:start position:0%
90% um is that way of also saving these
 
00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
districts in terms of and planning that
 
00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:05.720 align:start position:0%
we we know this is what the state budget
 
00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
is and we know that it's not going to
 
00:34:10.869 --> 00:34:10.879 align:start position:0%
come back to haunt us with a pration
 
00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
amount where we're not going to receive
 
00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
what we think we should be receiving and
 
00:34:15.629 --> 00:34:15.639 align:start position:0%
now we move to the other variable we
 
00:34:17.349 --> 00:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
haven't talked about um the budget
 
00:34:20.430 --> 00:34:20.440 align:start position:0%
appropriation and so um where special
 
00:34:21.629 --> 00:34:21.639 align:start position:0%
education Aid can get a little bit
 
00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
confusing is because you've got the
 
00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:27.320 align:start position:0%
80% State's liability number but then
 
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
you have the pration the pration is
 
00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:31.240 align:start position:0%
based on how much we budgeted and how
 
00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
much it cost us and if the budget
 
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
Appropriations don't match the full cost
 
00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
the full liability and that's what the
 
00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
governor has funded based on current
 
00:34:41.589 --> 00:34:41.599 align:start position:0%
data um we can talk about future data in
 
00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
a second but based on current data the
 
00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
cost of the liability to the state as
 
00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
established in RSA is going to be 50
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
million we had uh 34 million so we're 16
 
00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
million short so we had to Pro special
 
00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
education Bureau had to Pro uh Pro rate
 
00:35:01.589 --> 00:35:01.599 align:start position:0%
out down to 68% so they couldn't fund 50
 
00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:03.800 align:start position:0%
million because they had 34 million so
 
00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
they had to give everyone basically a
 
00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
hair cut down to 68% and then allocated
 
00:35:10.589 --> 00:35:10.599 align:start position:0%
out the cost there so what the governor
 
00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:13.240 align:start position:0%
has done is said she's allocated in her
 
00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:16.040 align:start position:0%
budget uh uh 16 million to bring us up
 
00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
to 15 50 million with the expectation if
 
00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:20.200 align:start position:0%
everything holds there would be no
 
00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
pration we would we' essentially get up
 
00:35:24.829 --> 00:35:24.839 align:start position:0%
to that 100% instead of being
 
00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
68% now what chairman lad is talking
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
about is could we do something um uh to
 
00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:31.960 align:start position:0%
modify that and division 2 has talked
 
00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
about this a little bit what you could
 
00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
do to always ensure you hit your number
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
is have an open warrant in the ETF so if
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
there is a $16 million shortfall then
 
00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
give uh the Department of Education
 
00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:46.280 align:start position:0%
authority to draw down that fund from
 
00:35:49.589 --> 00:35:49.599 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund to plug that um
 
00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
and then pration would would never exist
 
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
it would always fund the liability is
 
00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
established in RSA um not be limited to
 
00:35:58.349 --> 00:35:58.359 align:start position:0%
what is the budget appropriation so
 
00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:00.680 align:start position:0%
that's the mechanism there to address
 
00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:03.640 align:start position:0%
pration is essentially the ability to
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
access Appropriations outside of the
 
00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:07.839 align:start position:0%
budget so is
 
00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
that reference what represent luno put
 
00:36:13.069 --> 00:36:13.079 align:start position:0%
forth in his represent luno why don't
 
00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
you you have a bill too that does sort
 
00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:18.839 align:start position:0%
of that right right and and and look
 
00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:21.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and what's what's
 
00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:23.960 align:start position:0%
great about these packages of bills is
 
00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:26.200 align:start position:0%
that they provide a lot of different
 
00:36:29.589 --> 00:36:29.599 align:start position:0%
approaches to the to the solution so so
 
00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
um so what what Mark was just talking
 
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
about where where um where you eliminate
 
00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
the appropriation in the budget you
 
00:36:41.109 --> 00:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
change the law to have the um the
 
00:36:44.109 --> 00:36:44.119 align:start position:0%
state's liability to special education
 
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
Aid paid directly from the education
 
00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
trust fund and then you have the
 
00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
Overflow clause which I think is common
 
00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
in in education trust fund where where
 
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
if the fund doesn't have the money
 
00:36:58.109 --> 00:36:58.119 align:start position:0%
enough money in it the governor shall
 
00:36:59.790 --> 00:36:59.800 align:start position:0%
issue a warrant to draw from
 
00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
unappropriate or available General funds
 
00:37:06.109 --> 00:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
to uh to fuel the education trust fund
 
00:37:08.309 --> 00:37:08.319 align:start position:0%
um and there's there's no pration so
 
00:37:10.109 --> 00:37:10.119 align:start position:0%
that's House Bill
 
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
742 um and that's so that that's an
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
option that would uh would eliminate the
 
00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
um the pration but I also I wanted to go
 
00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
back to what representative spillsbury
 
00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:24.640 align:start position:0%
was suggesting too in terms of maybe
 
00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
collecting some data from 2 and A2 to
 
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
three and a half and um and and you know
 
00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:34.040 align:start position:0%
providing a little bit of incentive to
 
00:37:36.309 --> 00:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
districts to collect and submit that
 
00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
data and um and and you know maybe
 
00:37:43.589 --> 00:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
rather than rather than a percentage you
 
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
know 10% or whatever put a dollar amount
 
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
in there as well as a pration clause so
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
that so that the the the state's
 
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
basically paying I don't know pick the
 
00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
number $10 million to to to or $5
 
00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:01.480 align:start position:0%
million to collect the data and um and
 
00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
and have it
 
00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:05.670 align:start position:0%
and have it
stretch

00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
um going down to uh you know whatever
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
whatever you there there there are
 
00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
several ways of handling this and
 
00:38:16.589 --> 00:38:16.599 align:start position:0%
there's also just setting the pration up
 
00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
a percentage high right right right so
 
00:38:22.109 --> 00:38:22.119 align:start position:0%
no I'm talking about just I think but
 
00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:24.040 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about in this
 
00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
discussion here is there's a lot of
 
00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:28.640 align:start position:0%
information we need to obtain from the
 
00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:31.640 align:start position:0%
districts MH and I don't think it's
 
00:38:34.829 --> 00:38:34.839 align:start position:0%
readily available and it they may have
 
00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
it but it has to be reviewed to ensure
 
00:38:39.069 --> 00:38:39.079 align:start position:0%
that it's good accurate information the
 
00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
invoices stack up to what is acceptable
 
00:38:42.589 --> 00:38:42.599 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
IEP and uh I I think what we have to do
 
00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:49.480 align:start position:0%
here is that within the time we have
 
00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
here to look at this this an early Bill
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to put something
 
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
forward but we're also going to have to
 
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
hold something back and look at this
 
00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
whole the whole nature of how we're what
 
00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
we're doing here in terms of making some
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
kind of recommendations and Gathering
 
00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:10.040 align:start position:0%
more information on how we're going to
 
00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
handle this I understood when we're
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
talking FY 27 or so this that number
 
00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
could Spike Beyond 50 million bucks and
 
00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
and we could be we could you know have
 
00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
skyrocketing Affairs if that 2 and 1/2
 
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
to three and A2 is really full of those
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
kids which crowd of we're now accepting
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
them we could end up burying the
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
education trust fund just like that and
 
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
not having a borrow take it out of the
 
00:39:40.069 --> 00:39:40.079 align:start position:0%
general fund uh and how how that goes so
 
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
the thing needs to be looked at so I
 
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
think we're going to have to do
 
00:39:44.589 --> 00:39:44.599 align:start position:0%
something we're going to have to pass
 
00:39:47.829 --> 00:39:47.839 align:start position:0%
something to whether it's the what
 
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
represent luno just said or it's later
 
00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
that pration bill we set the pration
 
00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:54.440 align:start position:0%
amount high or and I I personally am
 
00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
very fearful of backing off to two and a
 
00:39:58.430 --> 00:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
half or to three right now when we don't
 
00:40:01.069 --> 00:40:01.079 align:start position:0%
know what we're talking about but on the
 
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
other side with the pration stuff we we
 
00:40:06.589 --> 00:40:06.599 align:start position:0%
are trying to protect the Local District
 
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
from unfunded costs that are going to
 
00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:11.720 align:start position:0%
come to them so what would happen though
 
00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:13.640 align:start position:0%
if if these numbers really creased like
 
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
an FY 27 Mark if it jumped up to $65
 
00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
million if if it jumped up to 65 and you
 
00:40:24.349 --> 00:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
enacted an open warrant yeah you would
 
00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
be your your budget EST and you budgeted
 
00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:29.839 align:start position:0%
for 50 yeah you would be 15 million over
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
budget it would it it would yeah it
 
00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:33.400 align:start position:0%
would it would be a budget control issue
 
00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
as as you mentioned well how how would
 
00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
it how would it work if you had a
 
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
pration cap on there where the where the
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
appropriation was um was was less than
 
00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
what the uh what the statute would
 
00:40:48.349 --> 00:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
require would there would there be an
 
00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
open warrant um
 
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
to adjust the
 
00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:54.680 align:start position:0%
appropriation so I think what you're
 
00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
describing is so if there were if if the
 
00:40:59.550 --> 00:40:59.560 align:start position:0%
pration comes in at
 
00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
70% BEC or similar to this year uh um
 
00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:08.680 align:start position:0%
run a warrant up to 80% something like
 
00:41:10.589 --> 00:41:10.599 align:start position:0%
that then yeah that would be that would
 
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
be less that would cost the full 15
 
00:41:14.069 --> 00:41:14.079 align:start position:0%
million under that scenario so you it's
 
00:41:16.109 --> 00:41:16.119 align:start position:0%
it'd be splitting you know oh you'd have
 
00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:17.800 align:start position:0%
to have that language and
 
00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
statute um uh um yeah you would want to
 
00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
make it clear um because the department
 
00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:23.480 align:start position:0%
could has to be kind of black and white
 
00:41:25.069 --> 00:41:25.079 align:start position:0%
as far as giving out those funds I don't
 
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
think I I don't know unless you can get
 
00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
creative with the legislation I would
 
00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:31.160 align:start position:0%
think it's kind of uh um yeah you might
 
00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:34.040 align:start position:0%
have to study that does does 717 have
 
00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:37.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:38.870 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
77 is just dealing with the one thing of
 
00:41:46.349 --> 00:41:46.359 align:start position:0%
of the the three and a half to three
 
00:41:48.349 --> 00:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
right then there's another one which we
 
00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
have which is oh I'm sorry I'm talking
 
00:41:56.829 --> 00:41:56.839 align:start position:0%
about 773 773 yes 773 needs some work if
 
00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
we use it it it be easy work um and it
 
00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
may be the way we go for example if we
 
00:42:06.589 --> 00:42:06.599 align:start position:0%
rais the pration amount you know I was
 
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
looking let's say we had the $16 million
 
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
for short right now and if we had a
 
00:42:13.069 --> 00:42:13.079 align:start position:0%
pration amount of
 
00:42:17.349 --> 00:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
90% we be shallow quick math my head
 
00:42:19.309 --> 00:42:19.319 align:start position:0%
probably somewhere around $1.5
 
00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:23.720 align:start position:0%
million um that's palatable but
 
00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
68 68% is not
 
00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
so looking at and this is a bill
 
00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
representative Vlad introduced 773 I
 
00:42:33.069 --> 00:42:33.079 align:start position:0%
think you're missing a warrant in that
 
00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:35.240 align:start position:0%
Bill yes the warrant's not in this bill
 
00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
so we need the we need the open the the
 
00:42:39.549 --> 00:42:39.559 align:start position:0%
warrant language for sure yeah you need
 
00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:41.480 align:start position:0%
that you need to scratch out what's been
 
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
eliminated in line six
 
00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:46.430 align:start position:0%
eliminated in line six
through

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
n and you may want to play with the
 
00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:51.720 align:start position:0%
pration mount it says 85% there those
 
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
are easy amendments to guarantee that to
 
00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:55.720 align:start position:0%
guarantee a particular pration number
 
00:42:59.270 --> 00:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
you need a open warrant yeah right yeah
 
00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:00.109 align:start position:0%
you need a open warrant yeah right yeah
yes

00:43:00.109 --> 00:43:00.119 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:43:03.069 --> 00:43:03.079 align:start position:0%
representa if we are looking to um you
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
know kind of figure out the language
 
00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
that may be acceptable to the committee
 
00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
and you know finalize an amendment for
 
00:43:11.349 --> 00:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
the next time cu the time is short I
 
00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
would suggest that you know probably 773
 
00:43:16.549 --> 00:43:16.559 align:start position:0%
would be a good candidate for the sped
 
00:43:18.309 --> 00:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
uh you know the one that we just
 
00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:21.160 align:start position:0%
discussed which is um you
 
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
know allowing for
 
00:43:27.549 --> 00:43:27.559 align:start position:0%
that bottom to the pration where it
 
00:43:30.069 --> 00:43:30.079 align:start position:0%
cannot go past the specific amount
 
00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
adding in the language that repr luno
 
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
just mentioned well that's up to the
 
00:43:36.309 --> 00:43:36.319 align:start position:0%
committee but basically my concern on
 
00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:38.720 align:start position:0%
the finance side is what was just
 
00:43:41.349 --> 00:43:41.359 align:start position:0%
expressed that a fixed appropriation we
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
can work with but a open warrant is a
 
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
very risky thing since we've seen
 
00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:48.920 align:start position:0%
massive swings in this number so I
 
00:43:51.309 --> 00:43:51.319 align:start position:0%
cannot speak for how finance will look
 
00:43:53.829 --> 00:43:53.839 align:start position:0%
upon it if we take too much risk here
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
but you know giving something us
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
something to work with would be great
 
00:44:00.589 --> 00:44:00.599 align:start position:0%
and I think this has some of the
 
00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
components that you know would be useful
 
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
to try to address this at least make
 
00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
some progress in the short term because
 
00:44:08.549 --> 00:44:08.559 align:start position:0%
God knows right now we don't have enough
 
00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
data to fix it fix it you know part of
 
00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
what we are discussing so here here's a
 
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
thought that we use 773 as the vehicle
 
00:44:20.069 --> 00:44:20.079 align:start position:0%
and get an amendment made we agree on
 
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
that keep one of these bills maybe
 
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
represented as luno Bill as a retain
 
00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:27.160 align:start position:0%
motion so we have something to work on
 
00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
two how's that how's that sound I think
 
00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:35.960 align:start position:0%
we're good with that everybody putting
 
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
their heads up and down and okay so what
 
00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:42.440 align:start position:0%
we ought to do2 so what we will we'll do
 
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
is we'll we'll put a small group
 
00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:49.880 align:start position:0%
together here uh to repesent Luna I want
 
00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
you on that I want represent spillsbury
 
00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:55.160 align:start position:0%
on it repes you know uh representative
 
00:44:57.069 --> 00:44:57.079 align:start position:0%
uh you you can't do it can you Keith cuz
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
here you can't this is just a meat for
 
00:45:02.829 --> 00:45:02.839 align:start position:0%
fact we don't even have to do it as a
 
00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee we can just work this
 
00:45:06.829 --> 00:45:06.839 align:start position:0%
amendment up bring bring the amendment
 
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
back and act on that in March
 
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
4 and and so what we could do right now
 
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
is dump the other two and retain one and
 
00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
then we can get on to the next category
 
00:45:21.069 --> 00:45:21.079 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:24.280 align:start position:0%
budget can you just repeat what are the
 
00:45:29.069 --> 00:45:29.079 align:start position:0%
things we want to put to to amend it no
 
00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
what what we're not going to do anything
 
00:45:32.549 --> 00:45:32.559 align:start position:0%
with the amending right now we're going
 
00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
to get a I'll get a small group here
 
00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:37.240 align:start position:0%
together we'll put an amendment together
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
get that to everybody prior to March 4
 
00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
and and then we'll act on it on March 4
 
00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
I don't think we have you know we are
 
00:45:48.349 --> 00:45:48.359 align:start position:0%
limited with some time today so uh I
 
00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
think this that will work uh what I'd
 
00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:54.520 align:start position:0%
like to do is just take a a brief five
 
00:45:58.190 --> 00:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
minute caucus so the luno can explain to
 
00:46:00.069 --> 00:46:00.079 align:start position:0%
your people what we're doing it's sort
 
00:46:03.309 --> 00:46:03.319 align:start position:0%
of what we discussed the other day and I
 
00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:05.720 align:start position:0%
I will meet with this caucus right here
 
00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:07.640 align:start position:0%
we'll come back in about five minutes at
 
00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
you know five of 11 and and and dump two
 
00:46:17.109 --> 00:46:17.119 align:start position:0%
retain one and and not take any action
 
00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:19.839 align:start position:0%
on the other one until we
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:55.829 align:start position:0%
 
caucus

00:46:55.829 --> 00:46:55.839 align:start position:0%

uh uh approaches that we can get support
 
00:57:28.190 --> 00:57:28.200 align:start position:0%
for uh just Simply Having a bill that
 
00:57:31.870 --> 00:57:31.880 align:start position:0%

to three 3x uh three times uh on the

we don't have the data to to make a move
 
00:59:48.270 --> 00:59:48.280 align:start position:0%
to E3 or some other figure that's lower
 
00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:50.480 align:start position:0%

of um uh supporting school districts at
 
01:00:13.870 --> 01:00:13.880 align:start position:0%
lower um um with with with in some of
 
01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
the lower costs but they're still high

costs uh when it comes to the average
 
01:00:20.109 --> 01:00:20.119 align:start position:0%

amendment to a bill we might be able to
 
01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:34.920 align:start position:0%

there's there's the three bills I
 
01:04:47.390 --> 01:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
believe 527 that was represented
 
01:04:51.870 --> 01:04:51.880 align:start position:0%
fellow's bill um 739 was representative
 
01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:56.319 align:start position:0%
spilsbury's Bill 734
 
01:04:58.230 --> 01:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
was that was that your bill represent
 
01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
Ames yeah
 
01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:04.799 align:start position:0%
uh let's open up some general discussion
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:12.549 --> 01:05:12.559 align:start position:0%
discussion okay I I'd like to start off
 
01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
with the the the bottom Bill
 
01:05:19.390 --> 01:05:19.400 align:start position:0%
734 um this bill has a component in it
 
01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
which is interesting to me that we're
 
01:05:24.789 --> 01:05:24.799 align:start position:0%
dealing with the State education
 
01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
property tax and the amount that is paid
 
01:05:30.349 --> 01:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
by those in communities which don't have
 
01:05:30.359 --> 01:05:31.789 align:start position:0%
by those in communities which don't have
the

01:05:31.789 --> 01:05:31.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:05:37.390 --> 01:05:37.400 align:start position:0%
wherewithal to to you know pay that tax
 
01:05:39.870 --> 01:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
and so it it has it builds in something
 
01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
there in terms of where we have not had
 
01:05:45.870 --> 01:05:45.880 align:start position:0%
any discussion on and this is something
 
01:05:48.109 --> 01:05:48.119 align:start position:0%
that I think it's also a portion of the
 
01:05:50.430 --> 01:05:50.440 align:start position:0%
other bill which I'm going to try to you
 
01:05:52.349 --> 01:05:52.359 align:start position:0%
know get us to retain later on which is
 
01:05:54.990 --> 01:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
the luno bill in terms of the foundation
 
01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
formula which which is very very complex
 
01:05:58.789 --> 01:05:58.799 align:start position:0%
we haven't seen any spreadsheets yet but
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
it's very complex and there's a lot of
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
components in it with that are are
 
01:06:04.829 --> 01:06:04.839 align:start position:0%
interesting as well and and that we need
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
to have some time to discuss so you know
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
I'm asking that maybe on that particular
 
01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
un represent ames's Bill we take that up
 
01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
with the other Bill together in in a
 
01:06:21.349 --> 01:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
retain motion and put our time after we
 
01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:23.240 align:start position:0%
get rid of the stuff to division two and
 
01:06:25.309 --> 01:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
they can have fun with what we send them
 
01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
we will have some time to really dig
 
01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:30.079 align:start position:0%
into these critical policy areas which
 
01:06:32.349 --> 01:06:32.359 align:start position:0%
are impacting costing of education so
 
01:06:36.510 --> 01:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
that's my two cents on 734 represent
 
01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
Ames I think that's good sense uh and uh
 
01:06:44.710 --> 01:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
I certainly would support that and uh in
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
fact the uh other Bill
 
01:06:51.349 --> 01:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
772 has embedded in it this very same
 
01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:54.920 align:start position:0%
bill so they're already set up for
 
01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
working in that
 
01:06:59.670 --> 01:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
way so then let's spend our time dealing
 
01:07:02.910 --> 01:07:02.920 align:start position:0%
with uh 75 739 and
 
01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
527 uh represent spillsbury you're
 
01:07:08.789 --> 01:07:08.799 align:start position:0%
you're the maker of 739 can you explain
 
01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
a little
 
01:07:13.309 --> 01:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
bit yes so 739 as I said during the
 
01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
hearing was an effort to approach the
 
01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
swept the excess swept issue as narrowly
 
01:07:23.230 --> 01:07:23.240 align:start position:0%
and surgically as possible uh one way or
 
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
another of dealing with swept has been
 
01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
Ed in uh probably a half dozen of our
 
01:07:33.029 --> 01:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
bills um and I just have to say it again
 
01:07:36.630 --> 01:07:36.640 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm going to urge that we pass this
 
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
but I'm not a fan of swept and uh and I
 
01:07:43.230 --> 01:07:43.240 align:start position:0%
am sympathetic to the so-called donor
 
01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
towns um I would love it if we come up
 
01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
with an entirely different uh approach
 
01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
but in the mean time we've got the
 
01:07:52.589 --> 01:07:52.599 align:start position:0%
pening court decision and we've got our
 
01:07:55.950 --> 01:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
own sense that this isn't uh um
 
01:07:59.870 --> 01:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
it's not structured correctly so uh I
 
01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
think the money is there and uh as much
 
01:08:05.029 --> 01:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
as I hate to squeeze it out of a few
 
01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
towns um we can use it in other
 
01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
ways any further discussion represent
 
01:08:14.349 --> 01:08:14.359 align:start position:0%
luno sure thanks very much Mr chair um
 
01:08:17.950 --> 01:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I I I think moving forward with
 
01:08:20.829 --> 01:08:20.839 align:start position:0%
with with um with
 
01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
739 um uh makes sense I actually I I
 
01:08:26.829 --> 01:08:26.839 align:start position:0%
very much appreciate and and like the
 
01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
policy in
 
01:08:31.349 --> 01:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
734 uh as it relates to swep because it
 
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
gets rid of that sort of donor you know
 
01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
concept of if you've got excess you send
 
01:08:40.110 --> 01:08:40.120 align:start position:0%
it to the Dr 7 734 would have you know
 
01:08:43.349 --> 01:08:43.359 align:start position:0%
you you you collect it locally and send
 
01:08:47.470 --> 01:08:47.480 align:start position:0%
it all in um just like how other state
 
01:08:49.149 --> 01:08:49.159 align:start position:0%
taxes are collected whether it's
 
01:08:51.149 --> 01:08:51.159 align:start position:0%
business profits taxes you just you send
 
01:08:53.149 --> 01:08:53.159 align:start position:0%
it all in you don't you don't keep you
 
01:08:57.349 --> 01:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
don't retain um some of it so but um but
 
01:09:00.550 --> 01:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
I think 739 is a good um a good vehicle
 
01:09:02.910 --> 01:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
on this my my question would be though
 
01:09:06.189 --> 01:09:06.199 align:start position:0%
just to um with we we've got we've got
 
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
Mark and Bruce here just to make sure
 
01:09:11.910 --> 01:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
that the Dr has everything they need in
 
01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
this legislation so that they can um uh
 
01:09:18.269 --> 01:09:18.279 align:start position:0%
so that they can carry out that process
 
01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:21.400 align:start position:0%
and that um the uh the legisl the bill
 
01:09:26.669 --> 01:09:26.679 align:start position:0%
also has the necessary language to
 
01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
um I guess as far as anything that's
 
01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
needed by the department of Ed so so at
 
01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
this time maybe what we could do is
 
01:09:38.749 --> 01:09:38.759 align:start position:0%
invite Dr up if if there's anything they
 
01:09:40.189 --> 01:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
see in
 
01:09:43.269 --> 01:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
730 what 303
 
01:09:48.110 --> 01:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
7:34 in 7:39 7:39 yes 739 yes
 
01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:52.189 align:start position:0%
7:34 in 7:39 7:39 yes 739 yes
yes

01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:54.430 --> 01:09:54.440 align:start position:0%
that that isn't going to work or is
 
01:10:12.189 --> 01:10:12.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning chairman lad
 
01:10:16.189 --> 01:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh Bruce caner
 
01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
supervisor Municipal Bureau
 
01:10:23.830 --> 01:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
um I did it again
 
01:10:28.149 --> 01:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
SL sound check there we go that sounds
 
01:10:34.110 --> 01:10:34.120 align:start position:0%
good Bruce okay again good morning
 
01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
chairman lad members of the committee my
 
01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
name is Bruce canu supervisor of the
 
01:10:40.189 --> 01:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
municipal Bureau of Department of
 
01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:47.950 --> 01:10:47.960 align:start position:0%
739 I think that the analyst had noted
 
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
just a small question about now this is
 
01:10:54.510 --> 01:10:54.520 align:start position:0%
not my forte on the analysis section of
 
01:10:56.990 --> 01:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
a bill but it's it mentioned being
 
01:10:59.750 --> 01:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
deposited into the general fund and I
 
01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
think the legislation called for as it
 
01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
would be uh Dr depositing it with the
 
01:11:11.070 --> 01:11:11.080 align:start position:0%
treasury for the education trust
 
01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:12.590 align:start position:0%
treasury for the education trust
fund

01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
um is that correct other than that um
 
01:11:20.110 --> 01:11:20.120 align:start position:0%
didn't have any technical issues that I
 
01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:21.750 align:start position:0%
didn't have any technical issues that I
I

01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:11:25.510 --> 01:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
saw go ahead yeah so where where is that
 
01:11:26.990 --> 01:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
that technical correction it say right
 
01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
on the analysis right on the if I can if
 
01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
I can point to um
 
01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:34.910 align:start position:0%
I can point to um
line

01:11:34.910 --> 01:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:11:38.750 --> 01:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
2829 what this says is uh and pay it to
 
01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
the Department of Revenue Administration
 
01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
for deposit in the education trust fund
 
01:11:45.669 --> 01:11:45.679 align:start position:0%
right yeah right it was just it was a
 
01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:47.480 align:start position:0%
note that somebody said the analysis
 
01:11:49.709 --> 01:11:49.719 align:start position:0%
language said general fund that's it
 
01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
says right here in the analysis that's
 
01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
not that's not part of the law that's
 
01:11:55.390 --> 01:11:55.400 align:start position:0%
right okay so I said I think I think
 
01:11:56.790 --> 01:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
that would be a good thing to address in
 
01:11:59.550 --> 01:11:59.560 align:start position:0%
the committee report
 
01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
okay yeah oh the the the not the LBA
 
01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
analysis the the top yeah right yeah the
 
01:12:08.110 --> 01:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
very top
 
01:12:10.990 --> 01:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah just it's just incorrect that
 
01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
yeah but that's not the law though the
 
01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
law and thank you cuz I hadn't noticed
 
01:12:17.629 --> 01:12:17.639 align:start position:0%
it but we can address that very
 
01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
concisely that can be correct y yeah
 
01:12:22.110 --> 01:12:22.120 align:start position:0%
technical stuff anything further yes
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
represent McGuire thank you Mr chairman
 
01:12:28.149 --> 01:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
so one criticism I've heard of this bill
 
01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
is that the word excess is not defined
 
01:12:34.830 --> 01:12:34.840 align:start position:0%
in the law anywhere is that true and but
 
01:12:37.870 --> 01:12:37.880 align:start position:0%
it's sort of understood by the Dr what
 
01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:39.629 align:start position:0%
it's sort of understood by the Dr what
it

01:12:39.629 --> 01:12:39.639 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
means it is understood by Dr what for
 
01:12:46.270 --> 01:12:46.280 align:start position:0%
what it it means I think that's probably
 
01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
because we knew what it meant in in the
 
01:12:51.629 --> 01:12:51.639 align:start position:0%
past when the legislation was there and
 
01:12:51.639 --> 01:12:52.550 align:start position:0%
past when the legislation was there and
then

01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:12:57.189 --> 01:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
stricken um I'm not sure if if Mark who
 
01:12:58.990 --> 01:12:59.000 align:start position:0%
I know is behind me Mark do you have a
 
01:13:10.030 --> 01:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
discussion we're talking about excess
 
01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
definition of excess yeah it's funny you
 
01:13:16.110 --> 01:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
read these bills and you know exactly
 
01:13:17.910 --> 01:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
what they're trying to do so you kind of
 
01:13:20.189 --> 01:13:20.199 align:start position:0%
read between the lines as far as what
 
01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
what's there but yeah Clarity could be
 
01:13:23.350 --> 01:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
you could you could add a definition to
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
clarify that um at this moment in time I
 
01:13:29.790 --> 01:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
I might um as things go to D2 I would
 
01:13:31.390 --> 01:13:31.400 align:start position:0%
read through things more more carefully
 
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
as the as the bills get closer to the
 
01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
Finish Line to see if there's any Tech
 
01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
issues but at this moment in time I
 
01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
think um both departments would
 
01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
interpret it to mean exactly what we all
 
01:13:43.550 --> 01:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
think however if you're concerned about
 
01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
future legal litigation being clear um
 
01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't hurt anyone so you're going to
 
01:13:53.229 --> 01:13:53.239 align:start position:0%
kick the can down to Maguire at B2 and
 
01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
let them do it you could you could you
 
01:13:58.110 --> 01:13:58.120 align:start position:0%
Define excess and be very you could say
 
01:13:59.390 --> 01:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
you could add an amendment that says
 
01:14:01.669 --> 01:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
excess shall be the difference
 
01:14:03.550 --> 01:14:03.560 align:start position:0%
between um the difference between the
 
01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
cost of inadequate education and the SW
 
01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
swept warrant for that so for the record
 
01:14:08.990 --> 01:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
I think the interpretation question is
 
01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
pretty well settled by the fact that
 
01:14:12.149 --> 01:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
this restores prior
 
01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
law yeah yeah
 
01:14:17.189 --> 01:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
it um it's it's understood what it means
 
01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
but if you want to add Clarity there you
 
01:14:20.430 --> 01:14:20.440 align:start position:0%
could you could make an amendment to do
 
01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
that further
 
01:14:25.550 --> 01:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
discussion yes repes
 
01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
fellows so I it's not clear to
 
01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
me when when Dr is is is Dr supposed to
 
01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
tell them what the excess is that they
 
01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
need to remit because I'm thinking you
 
01:14:46.629 --> 01:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
don't know how much the excess is until
 
01:14:50.910 --> 01:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
you do the final calculation of adequacy
 
01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:53.800 align:start position:0%
Aid and so the department would of
 
01:14:56.830 --> 01:14:56.840 align:start position:0%
Education would need to tell Dr how much
 
01:15:00.510 --> 01:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
is the excess and that's right up close
 
01:15:04.070 --> 01:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
to when they're setting the tax rates so
 
01:15:08.149 --> 01:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:12.910 --> 01:15:12.920 align:start position:0%
timing representative oh yes um Dr would
 
01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
need to know you have to speak into the
 
01:15:19.669 --> 01:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
mic sorry now I can hear myself
 
01:15:23.070 --> 01:15:23.080 align:start position:0%
yes I will get used to this one of these
 
01:15:25.950 --> 01:15:25.960 align:start position:0%
times yes the ra would need to know the
 
01:15:29.390 --> 01:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
amount of the excess quote unquote in
 
01:15:32.590 --> 01:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
order to place that amount onto the
 
01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:35.149 align:start position:0%
order to place that amount onto the
respective

01:15:35.149 --> 01:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
respective
 
01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
warrant I think so follow up yes so the
 
01:15:42.750 --> 01:15:42.760 align:start position:0%
warrant the currently the warrant that
 
01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:47.320 align:start position:0%
Dr sends to the school districts is way
 
01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
before that it's is you know more than a
 
01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:52.390 align:start position:0%
before that it's is you know more than a
year

01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:15:55.990 --> 01:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
before the actual excess is even
 
01:15:58.470 --> 01:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
determined so are they supposed to do
 
01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:00.430 align:start position:0%
determined so are they supposed to do
two

01:16:00.430 --> 01:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:03.950 align:start position:0%
two
warrants

01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:07.669 --> 01:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
no as it would have been done when it
 
01:16:07.679 --> 01:16:09.070 align:start position:0%
no as it would have been done when it
was

01:16:09.070 --> 01:16:09.080 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:16:12.430 --> 01:16:12.440 align:start position:0%
done we would at
 
01:16:16.110 --> 01:16:16.120 align:start position:0%
Dr calculate the amount of State
 
01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:24.750 --> 01:16:24.760 align:start position:0%
municipality and at the same time alert
 
01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
that education to that so again I let's
 
01:16:31.189 --> 01:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
look at this in
 
01:16:35.229 --> 01:16:35.239 align:start position:0%
retrospect the the warrants that were
 
01:16:37.550 --> 01:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
issued last
 
01:16:42.910 --> 01:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:45.400 align:start position:0%
1 would have
 
01:16:49.870 --> 01:16:49.880 align:start position:0%
needed work by education to say with
 
01:16:53.550 --> 01:16:53.560 align:start position:0%
such a swept amount for a
 
01:16:57.510 --> 01:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
municipality we need you to tell us with
 
01:17:01.990 --> 01:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
that how much of it would exceed the the
 
01:17:04.510 --> 01:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal of the financial aid the adequacy
 
01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
aid then come back to us and say of that
 
01:17:11.550 --> 01:17:11.560 align:start position:0%
amount this amount is quote excess and
 
01:17:13.390 --> 01:17:13.400 align:start position:0%
then the warrant would have the language
 
01:17:16.110 --> 01:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
of the old warrants it would include
 
01:17:19.149 --> 01:17:19.159 align:start position:0%
that statement that the as calculated
 
01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
per statute the excess amount of X is to
 
01:17:26.070 --> 01:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
be uh forwarded to I don't remember the
 
01:17:27.550 --> 01:17:27.560 align:start position:0%
exact language although I do have an
 
01:17:30.629 --> 01:17:30.639 align:start position:0%
example with me here today if I need to
 
01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
so the timing would be a back and forth
 
01:17:36.910 --> 01:17:36.920 align:start position:0%
somewhere between it could be anywhere
 
01:17:40.709 --> 01:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
between say June and October
 
01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
1st so I think what and so and I think I
 
01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:44.920 align:start position:0%
know what representative fellow is
 
01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
talking about she's talking about the
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
instability in the ADM data is that what
 
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
you're referring
 
01:17:54.030 --> 01:17:54.040 align:start position:0%
to instability the ADM data between
 
01:17:56.030 --> 01:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
October and
 
01:17:59.709 --> 01:17:59.719 align:start position:0%
April so well yes because you you're
 
01:18:02.669 --> 01:18:02.679 align:start position:0%
doing the department puts out a
 
01:18:05.470 --> 01:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
preliminary at which is an estimate of
 
01:18:07.790 --> 01:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
what adequacy 8 is going to be for tax
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
setting right so that so that um they
 
01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:12.560 align:start position:0%
can you know towns can vote on their
 
01:18:14.430 --> 01:18:14.440 align:start position:0%
budget knowing about how much they're
 
01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
going to get but the actual excess you
 
01:18:19.709 --> 01:18:19.719 align:start position:0%
don't know until
 
01:18:23.189 --> 01:18:23.199 align:start position:0%
November right so it would be um there'
 
01:18:25.310 --> 01:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
be the budgeting process where no taxes
 
01:18:27.149 --> 01:18:27.159 align:start position:0%
have been levied it's all just uh
 
01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
theoretical for budgeting that's the
 
01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
first adequacy estimate and that
 
01:18:33.270 --> 01:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
estimate uh can be off by quite a bit
 
01:18:35.070 --> 01:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
because it's forecasting
 
01:18:38.790 --> 01:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
ADM um then once tax season starts it
 
01:18:40.510 --> 01:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
would be known once we collected the
 
01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
prior your ADM data it is known in
 
01:18:46.110 --> 01:18:46.120 align:start position:0%
September 1st after we've processed the
 
01:18:48.310 --> 01:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
data what is your adequacy going to be
 
01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
to that fisal year at that moment in
 
01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
time uh towns would know with um uh very
 
01:18:58.110 --> 01:18:58.120 align:start position:0%
very good certainty as far as what their
 
01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
excess swep payment is going to be we do
 
01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
that first September 1st calculation
 
01:19:04.189 --> 01:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
then we do an October 1st calculation
 
01:19:07.709 --> 01:19:07.719 align:start position:0%
for Dr so that we say we've given this
 
01:19:09.030 --> 01:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
out we've given out the assessment
 
01:19:11.350 --> 01:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
September 1st now we're happy for you to
 
01:19:13.149 --> 01:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
set taxes off this number because we're
 
01:19:16.590 --> 01:19:16.600 align:start position:0%
very confident in it but there's still
 
01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
issues where ADM data can change now the
 
01:19:22.350 --> 01:19:22.360 align:start position:0%
governor has introduced language um um
 
01:19:25.149 --> 01:19:25.159 align:start position:0%
that freezes ADM data so they can't be
 
01:19:27.790 --> 01:19:27.800 align:start position:0%
any movement in ADM data um this is an
 
01:19:29.870 --> 01:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
hb2 um which I know is not in this
 
01:19:32.510 --> 01:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
committee it's in finance but it freezes
 
01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
ADM data so once taxes are set an ADM is
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
determined uh EXs swept is determined it
 
01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
cannot change without a petition to the
 
01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education that's language
 
01:19:46.910 --> 01:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
in hb2 so that would solve any minor
 
01:19:50.149 --> 01:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
tinkering in the data after October 1st
 
01:19:52.270 --> 01:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
HB there's language in hb2 To address
 
01:19:55.310 --> 01:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
that but essentially we know what excess
 
01:19:59.310 --> 01:19:59.320 align:start position:0%
swept is September 1st of a fiscal year
 
01:20:05.310 --> 01:20:05.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:08.990 --> 01:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
available so so well we don't know
 
01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen with hb2 we don't
 
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
know if that'll be because that's
 
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
certainly concerning that um it that
 
01:20:19.629 --> 01:20:19.639 align:start position:0%
there would be a law that says we don't
 
01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
care if if the numbers are right or
 
01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
wrong we're just going to use whatever
 
01:20:25.790 --> 01:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
you gave us what
 
01:20:29.189 --> 01:20:29.199 align:start position:0%
whatever some whatever it was calculated
 
01:20:30.629 --> 01:20:30.639 align:start position:0%
which could have been a mistake on the
 
01:20:33.790 --> 01:20:33.800 align:start position:0%
part of the um School District or it
 
01:20:36.030 --> 01:20:36.040 align:start position:0%
could have been a mistake on the part of
 
01:20:37.669 --> 01:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education we're going
 
01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
to use it anyway yeah the hp2 language
 
01:20:42.790 --> 01:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
has a a petition process for if
 
01:20:45.030 --> 01:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
something does need to be rectified um
 
01:20:47.390 --> 01:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
it has to be um go through a public
 
01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
process instead of data sharing the
 
01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
normal data sharing process between U
 
01:20:54.430 --> 01:20:54.440 align:start position:0%
the department and the uh District Mr
 
01:20:56.629 --> 01:20:56.639 align:start position:0%
chair yes represent luno thank you very
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
much so so to to representive fellow's
 
01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
question though if the if the if the
 
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
language instead was rather than
 
01:21:06.149 --> 01:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
remitting the excess all of it was
 
01:21:08.189 --> 01:21:08.199 align:start position:0%
collected locally all of it was remitted
 
01:21:11.310 --> 01:21:11.320 align:start position:0%
to the to the Dr and uh and then the
 
01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
department calculated the adequacy Grant
 
01:21:16.229 --> 01:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
and that money was was transferred back
 
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
to the municipalities that would um um I
 
01:21:21.870 --> 01:21:21.880 align:start position:0%
mean I think your answer to it the the
 
01:21:25.550 --> 01:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
timing was was good anyway worked anyway
 
01:21:28.430 --> 01:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
but but that collecting it all remitting
 
01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
it all would also um you know is also a
 
01:21:36.390 --> 01:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:39.030 --> 01:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
right yes representative luno it's a
 
01:21:42.229 --> 01:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
different solution and it causes Dr to
 
01:21:46.910 --> 01:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
act differently if there is no excess to
 
01:21:50.430 --> 01:21:50.440 align:start position:0%
be mentioned then we'll just
 
01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
calculate the
 
01:21:56.550 --> 01:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities state educ property tax
 
01:21:59.229 --> 01:21:59.239 align:start position:0%
and it would be collected through the
 
01:22:02.669 --> 01:22:02.679 align:start position:0%
normal tax billing process the the
 
01:22:05.629 --> 01:22:05.639 align:start position:0%
payments is some would be something new
 
01:22:09.709 --> 01:22:09.719 align:start position:0%
and that that's the that's the need for
 
01:22:15.550 --> 01:22:15.560 align:start position:0%
some work on the revenue um system at Dr
 
01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
okay in the past that didn't exist so
 
01:22:20.189 --> 01:22:20.199 align:start position:0%
obviously it came in literally through
 
01:22:23.189 --> 01:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
the mail M um
 
01:22:25.229 --> 01:22:25.239 align:start position:0%
but so
 
01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
okay I I think that there's two ways of
 
01:22:30.270 --> 01:22:30.280 align:start position:0%
doing this right and and they both would
 
01:22:32.950 --> 01:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
work I want to go on right now if we can
 
01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
to the last portion on this this block
 
01:22:37.830 --> 01:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
of bills it's HP 527 that's represent
 
01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:43.430 align:start position:0%
of bills it's HP 527 that's represent
fellow's

01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:51.470 --> 01:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:54.590 --> 01:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
please um so what is the intent here
 
01:22:58.030 --> 01:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
because it says to remit the excess but
 
01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
is that the are you just putting a tax
 
01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
on the town or are you really expecting
 
01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
them to admit to um remit what was
 
01:23:12.270 --> 01:23:12.280 align:start position:0%
not remit the amount that was actually
 
01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
collected from that tax because we know
 
01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
not everybody pays their property tax
 
01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:25.070 --> 01:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
that thanks for that question
 
01:23:27.390 --> 01:23:27.400 align:start position:0%
representative fellows I don't know the
 
01:23:31.229 --> 01:23:31.239 align:start position:0%
answer to how Dr I can't speak for the
 
01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
agency on that matter as
 
01:23:38.750 --> 01:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
to again I'm drawing on
 
01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
History um it was expected here's what a
 
01:23:45.030 --> 01:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
warrant sounded
 
01:23:48.990 --> 01:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
like in November of 2000 I'll leave the
 
01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
town out in accordance with the
 
01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
provisions of RSA 763 as an enacted on
 
01:23:58.590 --> 01:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
November 3rd 1999 under chapter 338 laws
 
01:23:58.600 --> 01:23:59.750 align:start position:0%
November 3rd 1999 under chapter 338 laws
of

01:23:59.750 --> 01:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
1999 you are hereby required to assess
 
01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
the sum of
 
01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:06.149 align:start position:0%
the sum of
3,477

01:24:06.149 --> 01:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
3,477
 
01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
1898 for the 2001 State education
 
01:24:13.229 --> 01:24:13.239 align:start position:0%
property tax the amount above includes
 
01:24:16.030 --> 01:24:16.040 align:start position:0%
excess property taxes of $
 
01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:18.510 align:start position:0%
excess property taxes of $
61,7

01:24:18.510 --> 01:24:18.520 align:start position:0%
61,7
 
01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
73 per RSA 198 col 46 this excess
 
01:24:25.030 --> 01:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
education property tax payment is
 
01:24:26.830 --> 01:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
payable to the state of New Hampshire
 
01:24:29.870 --> 01:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
honor before March 15
 
01:24:32.669 --> 01:24:32.679 align:start position:0%
2002 such payment should be forwarded to
 
01:24:36.550 --> 01:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
and then the prior address of of Dr over
 
01:24:38.350 --> 01:24:38.360 align:start position:0%
on Chanel
 
01:24:42.229 --> 01:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
drive so the expectation was that the
 
01:24:45.030 --> 01:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
town would collect the taxes as
 
01:24:48.830 --> 01:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
everybody knows sometimes individual
 
01:24:51.430 --> 01:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
property taxes are not
 
01:24:54.070 --> 01:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
collected the amount to be remitted is
 
01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:55.790 align:start position:0%
collected the amount to be remitted is
still

01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
still
 
01:24:59.709 --> 01:24:59.719 align:start position:0%
expected the towns have the authority to
 
01:25:03.070 --> 01:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
lean property taxes that are not paid
 
01:25:05.470 --> 01:25:05.480 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately sometimes in the event
 
01:25:09.390 --> 01:25:09.400 align:start position:0%
of successive non-payment tax deeding
 
01:25:11.109 --> 01:25:11.119 align:start position:0%
process would
 
01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
occur but the expectation is you've been
 
01:25:16.430 --> 01:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
ordered to pay that
 
01:25:19.189 --> 01:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
amount now I can't speak for the history
 
01:25:21.550 --> 01:25:21.560 align:start position:0%
obviously and none of us have practiced
 
01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
this for a long long time so I don't
 
01:25:25.669 --> 01:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
have a spefic specific answer as to what
 
01:25:28.390 --> 01:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
would happen in this case it's not an
 
01:25:30.109 --> 01:25:30.119 align:start position:0%
individual taxpayer you're talking about
 
01:25:30.119 --> 01:25:31.590 align:start position:0%
individual taxpayer you're talking about
the

01:25:31.590 --> 01:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:25:33.790 --> 01:25:33.800 align:start position:0%
municipality represent spillsbury do you
 
01:25:37.189 --> 01:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
have some yeah in an effort to clarify
 
01:25:39.470 --> 01:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
what is the magnitude of this concern
 
01:25:41.310 --> 01:25:41.320 align:start position:0%
which I think is the towns might get
 
01:25:42.990 --> 01:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
squeezed if they don't have sufficient
 
01:25:44.430 --> 01:25:44.440 align:start position:0%
cash flow because they haven't collected
 
01:25:48.149 --> 01:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
all if we went back to the um process
 
01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
the alternative um in
 
01:25:54.990 --> 01:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
734 of having every community remit all
 
01:26:00.109 --> 01:26:00.119 align:start position:0%
of their swept than to have the Dr
 
01:26:02.070 --> 01:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
reconcile pardon me and distribute
 
01:26:04.750 --> 01:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
adequacy Aid that would compound your
 
01:26:07.510 --> 01:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
concern dramatically because now instead
 
01:26:10.430 --> 01:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
of a few towns sending only the excess
 
01:26:13.510 --> 01:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
every town would have to send all of it
 
01:26:15.910 --> 01:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh so you know this if anything
 
01:26:18.350 --> 01:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
minimizes your concern and I'm going to
 
01:26:20.830 --> 01:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
guess that a community that is remitting
 
01:26:24.030 --> 01:26:24.040 align:start position:0%
the excess has adequate reserves um from
 
01:26:26.350 --> 01:26:26.360 align:start position:0%
what they've otherwise collected I think
 
01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:27.990 align:start position:0%
what they've otherwise collected I think
another

01:26:27.990 --> 01:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:26:30.990 --> 01:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
incidental advantage of leaving uh the
 
01:26:33.669 --> 01:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
communities to collect and retain what
 
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
they're you know the amount that they're
 
01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
then do inadequacy is it gives them cash
 
01:26:41.350 --> 01:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
flow protection it probably helps cash
 
01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
management and avoid uh um tax
 
01:26:46.350 --> 01:26:46.360 align:start position:0%
anticipation notes and so
 
01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
on yes representative papich just in an
 
01:26:50.990 --> 01:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
effort to fully address the concerns of
 
01:26:52.470 --> 01:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
my colleague because I understand there
 
01:26:54.830 --> 01:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
are significant concerns I've been the
 
01:26:56.870 --> 01:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
town finance director for the town of
 
01:26:58.590 --> 01:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
wiam for six years and a half before
 
01:27:00.910 --> 01:27:00.920 align:start position:0%
serving here we dealt with those
 
01:27:02.990 --> 01:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
situations all the time and for the
 
01:27:05.350 --> 01:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
record the town of wiam has the smallest
 
01:27:07.629 --> 01:27:07.639 align:start position:0%
reserve of funds in the state by mile if
 
01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
you ask the Dr when they graph
 
01:27:11.430 --> 01:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
everybody's here and we are faring our
 
01:27:13.990 --> 01:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
corner corner all by ourselves we were
 
01:27:16.229 --> 01:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
at 300,000 reserves when I was the
 
01:27:19.910 --> 01:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
finance director and we manag fine the
 
01:27:22.669 --> 01:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
there are few people generally who don't
 
01:27:24.910 --> 01:27:24.920 align:start position:0%
pay prop property taxes if it's a
 
01:27:26.510 --> 01:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
recurring problem where lots of people
 
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
don't pay there are interest costs
 
01:27:30.550 --> 01:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
attached there is tax diding processes
 
01:27:33.430 --> 01:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
so towns who have those issues know how
 
01:27:35.830 --> 01:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
to manage them they they are a headache
 
01:27:37.790 --> 01:27:37.800 align:start position:0%
to the finance director but they really
 
01:27:39.510 --> 01:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be a headache to us because
 
01:27:42.109 --> 01:27:42.119 align:start position:0%
the towns have proven themselves over
 
01:27:44.430 --> 01:27:44.440 align:start position:0%
time to be very capable at managing that
 
01:27:45.990 --> 01:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
and at a point if you have incurring
 
01:27:47.669 --> 01:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
losses on that again there are ways to
 
01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
mitigate it you increase the budget by a
 
01:27:51.350 --> 01:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
little bit to accommodate those losses
 
01:27:53.870 --> 01:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
so for the purposes of this committee I
 
01:27:57.390 --> 01:27:57.400 align:start position:0%
want assure you my professional opinion
 
01:27:59.470 --> 01:27:59.480 align:start position:0%
is that it really shouldn't be something
 
01:28:01.030 --> 01:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
that weighs heavily on our minds we
 
01:28:03.510 --> 01:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
should focus on much bigger concerns
 
01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
over the you know fairness of this and
 
01:28:09.550 --> 01:28:09.560 align:start position:0%
so on and so forth thank you okay one
 
01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:11.030 align:start position:0%
so on and so forth thank you okay one
last

01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
last
 
01:28:14.430 --> 01:28:14.440 align:start position:0%
question so well it's not a question
 
01:28:16.470 --> 01:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
this is a work session can I just say
 
01:28:20.550 --> 01:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
what I think you sure go ahead so I I
 
01:28:23.470 --> 01:28:23.480 align:start position:0%
think if you have a Statewide tax then
 
01:28:24.830 --> 01:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
it's the
 
01:28:29.790 --> 01:28:29.800 align:start position:0%
state that should um not get Revenue
 
01:28:33.149 --> 01:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
that's not paid for that tax and it
 
01:28:36.629 --> 01:28:36.639 align:start position:0%
should not be the obligation of the town
 
01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
to make that payment on behalf of the
 
01:28:43.709 --> 01:28:43.719 align:start position:0%
taxpayer if we're talking about a state
 
01:28:46.910 --> 01:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
tax and the second thing I'd like to say
 
01:28:48.629 --> 01:28:48.639 align:start position:0%
is that I
 
01:28:52.390 --> 01:28:52.400 align:start position:0%
oppose the entire idea of there being a
 
01:28:54.990 --> 01:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
state property tax
 
01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.350 align:start position:0%
state property tax
because

01:28:56.350 --> 01:28:56.360 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:28:59.189 --> 01:28:59.199 align:start position:0%
municipalities have only one significant
 
01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
source of Revenue and that's the
 
01:29:04.910 --> 01:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
property tax if we let the state
 
01:29:08.070 --> 01:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
encroach on that source of
 
01:29:11.590 --> 01:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
Revenue then where does it stop you know
 
01:29:14.109 --> 01:29:14.119 align:start position:0%
it can't you know right now the amount
 
01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
might be somewhat
 
01:29:19.669 --> 01:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
manageable but if the state increases
 
01:29:22.030 --> 01:29:22.040 align:start position:0%
this if if if it's legitimate for the
 
01:29:24.950 --> 01:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
state to have a property tax then it's
 
01:29:26.830 --> 01:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
legitimate for the state to increase
 
01:29:29.149 --> 01:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
that property tax and so where do you
 
01:29:32.790 --> 01:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
stop do you double it do you triple it
 
01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
and then you can use that to pay for all
 
01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
of the cost of education is that the
 
01:29:39.629 --> 01:29:39.639 align:start position:0%
point of all the lawsuits that we've
 
01:29:43.270 --> 01:29:43.280 align:start position:0%
heard no of course not so I will not
 
01:29:46.189 --> 01:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
support this Bill thank you represent
 
01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:48.760 align:start position:0%
spillsbury uh I don't think I'm going to
 
01:29:50.510 --> 01:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
be able to persuade you otherwise but I
 
01:29:53.470 --> 01:29:53.480 align:start position:0%
would just say that the purpose of this
 
01:29:57.910 --> 01:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
bill is that until there is some
 
01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
alternative this bill is
 
01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
necessary any further discussion from
 
01:30:06.910 --> 01:30:06.920 align:start position:0%
the committee on this block of three
 
01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
bills okay so what we're going to do is
 
01:30:11.109 --> 01:30:11.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to take a brief caucus and
 
01:30:12.430 --> 01:30:12.440 align:start position:0%
then we're going to come back the idea
 
01:30:16.990 --> 01:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
that we want to look at is to retain 734
 
01:30:20.910 --> 01:30:20.920 align:start position:0%
as we discussed move 739 forward as it
 
01:30:24.910 --> 01:30:24.920 align:start position:0%
is and itl 527
 
01:30:28.189 --> 01:30:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:30.750 --> 01:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
discuss would you like to discuss it
 
01:30:32.590 --> 01:30:32.600 align:start position:0%
further go
 
01:30:37.310 --> 01:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
ahead I just I you can accept the
 
01:30:40.430 --> 01:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
statement that I just made as part of my
 
01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
um support for this bill but in addition
 
01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:48.719 align:start position:0%
to that this particular bill is revenue
 
01:30:54.390 --> 01:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
neutral it makes no change to any any
 
01:30:56.790 --> 01:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
the amount that any District would get
 
01:31:00.510 --> 01:31:00.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of adequacy Aid Grant from the
 
01:31:02.830 --> 01:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
state it just
 
01:31:06.430 --> 01:31:06.440 align:start position:0%
takes off the
 
01:31:10.109 --> 01:31:10.119 align:start position:0%
um for one thing it it's trans it's it
 
01:31:10.119 --> 01:31:11.270 align:start position:0%
um for one thing it it's trans it's it
creates

01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
creates
 
01:31:14.750 --> 01:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
transparency because it does we do not
 
01:31:16.750 --> 01:31:16.760 align:start position:0%
say we would not be saying anymore that
 
01:31:19.590 --> 01:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
we have a state property tax because
 
01:31:21.350 --> 01:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
most of the public thinks there really
 
01:31:23.390 --> 01:31:23.400 align:start position:0%
is a state property tax and the money is
 
01:31:27.830 --> 01:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:29.390 align:start position:0%
 
case

01:31:29.390 --> 01:31:29.400 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:31:31.830 --> 01:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
and I think it gives
 
01:31:36.350 --> 01:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
us it it it makes the um adequacy Aid
 
01:31:39.030 --> 01:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
more transparent and and and there's it
 
01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
just re basically reflects what we are
 
01:31:44.149 --> 01:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
doing right now and it gives us
 
01:31:46.070 --> 01:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to work with that local
 
01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:47.149 align:start position:0%
opportunity to work with that local
Revenue

01:31:47.149 --> 01:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
01:31:49.350 --> 01:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
contribution you know maybe change the
 
01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
formula for
 
01:31:54.950 --> 01:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
that okay any further discussion on on
 
01:31:56.709 --> 01:31:56.719 align:start position:0%
these bills so we're going to go into a
 
01:32:00.830 --> 01:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
f minute caucus come back and and we'll
 
01:32:22.830 --> 01:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:52.830 align:start position:0%

03:05:50.160 --> 03:05:52.950 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to go ahead with this
afternoon's

03:05:52.950 --> 03:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
afternoon's
 
03:05:55.750 --> 03:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
bills uh what I'm going to try to do
 
03:05:57.630 --> 03:05:57.640 align:start position:0%
here quickly if we can just get rid of
 
03:05:59.349 --> 03:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
one of these bills first and because
 
03:06:02.510 --> 03:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
it's the bill that deals with the um
 
03:06:04.590 --> 03:06:04.600 align:start position:0%
community college system in the in the
 
03:06:08.349 --> 03:06:08.359 align:start position:0%
higher education University system um
 
03:06:10.830 --> 03:06:10.840 align:start position:0%
I'd like to jump down and take 510
 
03:06:13.790 --> 03:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
quickly and we have received
 
03:06:16.710 --> 03:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
information uh from from uh folks that
 
03:06:18.389 --> 03:06:18.399 align:start position:0%
work at the higher education
 
03:06:20.830 --> 03:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
institutions and regarding their code of
 
03:06:23.389 --> 03:06:23.399 align:start position:0%
ethics and numerous issues which we had
 
03:06:28.750 --> 03:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
not had a chance to look at um and this
 
03:06:33.429 --> 03:06:33.439 align:start position:0%
bill uh comes to us and I I just my my
 
03:06:35.110 --> 03:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
gut is I don't think we're ready to go
 
03:06:37.070 --> 03:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
anywhere with it yet there's a lot of
 
03:06:39.110 --> 03:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
work that has to be done on this process
 
03:06:42.150 --> 03:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see a retention
 
03:06:46.269 --> 03:06:46.279 align:start position:0%

03:07:21.630 --> 03:07:21.640 align:start position:0%
are there any people here on the
 
03:07:23.710 --> 03:07:23.720 align:start position:0%
committee which would object to a
 
03:07:26.670 --> 03:07:26.680 align:start position:0%
retention on this bill that's 510 the
 
03:07:26.680 --> 03:07:27.910 align:start position:0%
retention on this bill that's 510 the
last

03:07:27.910 --> 03:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
last
 
03:07:31.469 --> 03:07:31.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:34.269 --> 03:07:34.279 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor I expect you to go anywh you
 
03:07:35.950 --> 03:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
want to go vote your conscience in that
 
03:07:40.110 --> 03:07:40.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:42.630 --> 03:07:42.640 align:start position:0%
else so we we know where we're going to
 
03:07:46.030 --> 03:07:46.040 align:start position:0%
go on that pardon
 
03:07:49.510 --> 03:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
me yes per I just I just repeat that
 
03:07:54.469 --> 03:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
it's um I did I'm sorry um I have all of
 
03:07:57.469 --> 03:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
the D process within the university
 
03:08:00.070 --> 03:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
system and they're very strong I don't
 
03:08:04.030 --> 03:08:04.040 align:start position:0%
see the need to we we saw that other
 
03:08:07.190 --> 03:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
stuff that Shannon sent us as well and
 
03:08:09.309 --> 03:08:09.319 align:start position:0%
this is from the University too that
 
03:08:12.710 --> 03:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
yeah I I I I get that uh and there
 
03:08:14.670 --> 03:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
there's so much information received
 
03:08:16.389 --> 03:08:16.399 align:start position:0%
with everything going on I haven't had
 
03:08:18.510 --> 03:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
time to read through it all and I like
 
03:08:18.520 --> 03:08:20.070 align:start position:0%
time to read through it all and I like
to

03:08:20.070 --> 03:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:08:23.830 --> 03:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
and represent suppos right at the end of
 
03:08:26.990 --> 03:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
last week's um session representative
 
03:08:31.750 --> 03:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
lad and uh representative Pap Muller and
 
03:08:34.349 --> 03:08:34.359 align:start position:0%
I um met with representatives for both
 
03:08:36.550 --> 03:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
systems and asked for information we've
 
03:08:38.269 --> 03:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
gotten a massive amount within the last
 
03:08:39.910 --> 03:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
week has not yet been shared with the
 
03:08:41.830 --> 03:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
committee and I think it more than
 
03:08:44.110 --> 03:08:44.120 align:start position:0%
justifies a retain and maybe a
 
03:08:46.510 --> 03:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to digest it all okay well
 
03:08:50.630 --> 03:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
I can I say my my opinion is that the
 
03:08:52.670 --> 03:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
whole principle having the legislature
 
03:08:55.190 --> 03:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
right internal policies for the public
 
03:08:57.469 --> 03:08:57.479 align:start position:0%
high edit system is a really bad
 
03:09:02.190 --> 03:09:02.200 align:start position:0%
practice to follow um and and and and
 
03:09:05.550 --> 03:09:05.560 align:start position:0%
that may result slippery slope of of a
 
03:09:08.150 --> 03:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh that's that's looking at
 
03:09:10.790 --> 03:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
this uh and and and as a retained bill
 
03:09:12.870 --> 03:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
it may be that that committee sees that
 
03:09:14.269 --> 03:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
and makes that
 
03:09:16.229 --> 03:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
recommendation that it's a slippery
 
03:09:16.239 --> 03:09:18.469 align:start position:0%
recommendation that it's a slippery
slope

03:09:18.469 --> 03:09:18.479 align:start position:0%
slope
 
03:09:21.670 --> 03:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so if we're going to go that
 
03:09:23.710 --> 03:09:23.720 align:start position:0%
way we can dispose of this bill right
 
03:09:26.670 --> 03:09:26.680 align:start position:0%
now if everybody's good with
 
03:09:29.389 --> 03:09:29.399 align:start position:0%
that okay would you please somebody make
 
03:09:31.550 --> 03:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
a motion here to
 
03:09:34.870 --> 03:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
retain representative McGuire yeah I'll
 
03:09:36.870 --> 03:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
move to retain and is there a second
 
03:09:39.110 --> 03:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
second okay so representative McGuire
 
03:09:42.190 --> 03:09:42.200 align:start position:0%
second by Rend spillsbury to retain 510
 
03:09:45.309 --> 03:09:45.319 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the
 
03:09:48.630 --> 03:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
maker well I I do think there's this is
 
03:09:51.229 --> 03:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
an important bill but it's complicated
 
03:09:53.950 --> 03:09:53.960 align:start position:0%
and uh it's not as urgent as as our
 
03:09:57.630 --> 03:09:57.640 align:start position:0%
other stuff right so retain seems
 
03:10:00.429 --> 03:10:00.439 align:start position:0%
right yeah it's not imperative that be
 
03:10:00.439 --> 03:10:01.750 align:start position:0%
right yeah it's not imperative that be
done

03:10:01.750 --> 03:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
done
 
03:10:04.190 --> 03:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
today um any further
 
03:10:06.750 --> 03:10:06.760 align:start position:0%

into the other group now HP 550 563 651
 
03:11:31.469 --> 03:11:31.479 align:start position:0%
769 and
 
03:11:34.469 --> 03:11:34.479 align:start position:0%
772 that last one there 675 I'm holding
 
03:11:38.590 --> 03:11:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:41.550 --> 03:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
separately uh I did pass out information
 
03:11:43.790 --> 03:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
this is just basically the funding
 
03:11:46.550 --> 03:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
formula we're going to have to look at
 
03:11:49.990 --> 03:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
and I just just like to um in regard to
 
03:11:53.150 --> 03:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
I'm going to look at 563 here first
 
03:11:55.429 --> 03:11:55.439 align:start position:0%
seeing that has some of these components
 
03:12:05.510 --> 03:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:09.870 --> 03:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
it okay 563 has those components and the
 
03:12:12.750 --> 03:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
first component that we in the costing
 
03:12:16.510 --> 03:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
areas is your base cost and on line
 
03:12:20.349 --> 03:12:20.359 align:start position:0%
seven of 563 it identifies
 
03:12:23.750 --> 03:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
4266 as the base cost for
 
03:12:26.190 --> 03:12:26.200 align:start position:0%
Education everybody should have in front
 
03:12:32.030 --> 03:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:36.590 --> 03:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
here okay this sheet reflects the
 
03:12:36.600 --> 03:12:37.950 align:start position:0%
here okay this sheet reflects the
formula

03:12:37.950 --> 03:12:37.960 align:start position:0%
formula
 
03:12:43.070 --> 03:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
used back in 2008 but then updated it uh
 
03:12:46.710 --> 03:12:46.720 align:start position:0%
to 42 uh on on the front side where it
 
03:12:50.590 --> 03:12:50.600 align:start position:0%
says features and the First Column and
 
03:12:53.229 --> 03:12:53.239 align:start position:0%
going across you'll see one two three
 
03:12:57.030 --> 03:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
over where there's a sum of uh uh uh
 
03:12:59.550 --> 03:12:59.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:02.550 --> 03:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
$425 that is of those that are beginning
 
03:13:05.229 --> 03:13:05.239 align:start position:0%
teachers are starting this is the
 
03:13:08.429 --> 03:13:08.439 align:start position:0%
average of those salaries as developed
 
03:13:10.790 --> 03:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
by our Our People
 
03:13:13.469 --> 03:13:13.479 align:start position:0%
upstairs and from the doe website so
 
03:13:13.479 --> 03:13:15.910 align:start position:0%
upstairs and from the doe website so
it's

03:13:15.910 --> 03:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:18.349 --> 03:13:18.359 align:start position:0%
$425 with with a
 
03:13:21.229 --> 03:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
33% increase due to benefits you can see
 
03:13:22.910 --> 03:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
that that that starting teacher would be
 
03:13:22.920 --> 03:13:24.269 align:start position:0%
that that that starting teacher would be
around

03:13:24.269 --> 03:13:24.279 align:start position:0%
around
 
03:13:26.510 --> 03:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
5665 we have some teachers starting in
 
03:13:28.150 --> 03:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
the state at
 
03:13:31.550 --> 03:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
$31,000 and some at60 something th000
 
03:13:33.550 --> 03:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
it's it's way off the charts in terms
 
03:13:36.150 --> 03:13:36.160 align:start position:0%
whether you're from Hanover or you're
 
03:13:39.269 --> 03:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
some some poor
 
03:13:41.670 --> 03:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
Community the same thing is done all the
 
03:13:43.990 --> 03:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
way down through the uh those
 
03:13:47.309 --> 03:13:47.319 align:start position:0%
individuals which were in in uh area
 
03:13:48.670 --> 03:13:48.680 align:start position:0%
such as instructional materials
 
03:13:50.830 --> 03:13:50.840 align:start position:0%
technology Etc that was used to
 
03:13:55.269 --> 03:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
determine what are the costs of a uh of
 
03:13:59.150 --> 03:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
the base cost for Education back in 2008
 
03:14:01.550 --> 03:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
use the same formula and it comes out
 
03:14:05.309 --> 03:14:05.319 align:start position:0%
with the changes and updating them and
 
03:14:07.150 --> 03:14:07.160 align:start position:0%
it's not perfect I'll be the first one
 
03:14:10.030 --> 03:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
to admit that and it may not include all
 
03:14:12.830 --> 03:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
the things which you may see as a need
 
03:14:16.510 --> 03:14:16.520 align:start position:0%
under 193 e2a but these are the same
 
03:14:16.520 --> 03:14:17.910 align:start position:0%
under 193 e2a but these are the same
components

03:14:17.910 --> 03:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
components
 
03:14:20.389 --> 03:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
that were part of the formula back then
 
03:14:22.110 --> 03:14:22.120 align:start position:0%
so they are the same components right
 
03:14:24.670 --> 03:14:24.680 align:start position:0%
now that are right before you here it
 
03:14:27.469 --> 03:14:27.479 align:start position:0%
comes out the $4,260
 
03:14:29.429 --> 03:14:29.439 align:start position:0%
going on
 
03:14:32.990 --> 03:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
down the differentiated Aid has three
 
03:14:35.469 --> 03:14:35.479 align:start position:0%
categories as you know free and reduced
 
03:14:37.550 --> 03:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
meals English language learner and
 
03:14:40.229 --> 03:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
special education services they're
 
03:14:43.150 --> 03:14:43.160 align:start position:0%
estimated at the by the Department of
 
03:14:45.670 --> 03:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
Education to be in your spreadsheets for
 
03:14:49.590 --> 03:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
the area of free and reduce meals at
 
03:14:51.790 --> 03:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
$2,393 that's what they have estimated
 
03:14:53.190 --> 03:14:53.200 align:start position:0%
we just take the figures and put it
 
03:14:54.269 --> 03:14:54.279 align:start position:0%
right in
 
03:14:57.469 --> 03:14:57.479 align:start position:0%
here for the English language learner
 
03:14:59.950 --> 03:14:59.960 align:start position:0%
the same thing occurred there uh it was
 
03:15:02.830 --> 03:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
800 by taking your 2% increase or
 
03:15:07.910 --> 03:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
whatever it is um it comes out to 832
 
03:15:10.750 --> 03:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
and that's what's been estimated by
 
03:15:13.550 --> 03:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
department on the other side though down
 
03:15:16.269 --> 03:15:16.279 align:start position:0%
below that you can see that there's a
 
03:15:17.710 --> 03:15:17.720 align:start position:0%
cost in the
 
03:15:21.469 --> 03:15:21.479 align:start position:0%
part C below that that this all would be
 
03:15:23.670 --> 03:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
changed and this have to be amended to
 
03:15:27.790 --> 03:15:27.800 align:start position:0%
include a category which Deals Only with
 
03:15:30.910 --> 03:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
um special education differentiated
 
03:15:33.590 --> 03:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
Aid that takes you to that second sheet
 
03:15:37.830 --> 03:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:41.550 --> 03:15:41.560 align:start position:0%
here did you get a copy of
 
03:15:46.110 --> 03:15:46.120 align:start position:0%
this it should be staple two staple two
 
03:15:46.120 --> 03:15:49.269 align:start position:0%
this it should be staple two staple two
yes

03:15:49.269 --> 03:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:53.070 --> 03:15:53.080 align:start position:0%
you have the color no that's right um my
 
03:15:57.349 --> 03:15:57.359 align:start position:0%
absent house has it um on that sheet
 
03:16:00.229 --> 03:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
right there it looks at differentiated
 
03:16:04.429 --> 03:16:04.439 align:start position:0%
Aid as it could be calculated and the
 
03:16:08.189 --> 03:16:08.199 align:start position:0%
current projected cost would be
 
03:16:12.150 --> 03:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
$2,185 this projects a cost out at
 
03:16:15.910 --> 03:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
$3,078 how do we arrive at that the 13
 
03:16:18.950 --> 03:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
category areas from autism down to
 
03:16:20.510 --> 03:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
through disabilities and emotional
 
03:16:23.670 --> 03:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
handicap and and multiple disabilities
 
03:16:25.670 --> 03:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
and jumping down through speech and
 
03:16:27.670 --> 03:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
speech language and traumatic brain
 
03:16:30.670 --> 03:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
injury visually impaired you can see
 
03:16:34.229 --> 03:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
that the case loads vary amongst which
 
03:16:37.750 --> 03:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
IEPs you can see that a speech language
 
03:16:40.510 --> 03:16:40.520 align:start position:0%
uh teacher can have as many as
 
03:16:43.269 --> 03:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
48 kids to one on their case loads you
 
03:16:44.830 --> 03:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
look at Asha and that's what they show
 
03:16:47.429 --> 03:16:47.439 align:start position:0%
you is the max American speech and
 
03:16:47.439 --> 03:16:48.670 align:start position:0%
you is the max American speech and
hearing

03:16:48.670 --> 03:16:48.680 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:16:51.309 --> 03:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
Association um but then you look at some
 
03:16:52.870 --> 03:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
of the other categories it's much much
 
03:16:55.150 --> 03:16:55.160 align:start position:0%
lower because of the time that requires
 
03:16:57.269 --> 03:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
to support those students it's not
 
03:16:59.309 --> 03:16:59.319 align:start position:0%
perfect but it's another way of looking
 
03:17:02.469 --> 03:17:02.479 align:start position:0%
at this so that then we take the number
 
03:17:05.269 --> 03:17:05.279 align:start position:0%
of students and we know that there are
 
03:17:07.990 --> 03:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
are are um
 
03:17:12.070 --> 03:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:15.510 --> 03:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
13,469 IEP students in our state
 
03:17:17.510 --> 03:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
breaking them down
 
03:17:19.590 --> 03:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
you can see how many are in each speech
 
03:17:22.670 --> 03:17:22.680 align:start position:0%
language you can see there's 10,235 kids
 
03:17:25.229 --> 03:17:25.239 align:start position:0%
there in that one category so they add
 
03:17:27.189 --> 03:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
up to that that
 
03:17:29.389 --> 03:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
total then when you divide it by the
 
03:17:31.030 --> 03:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
case load you can see how many teachers
 
03:17:33.830 --> 03:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
you would need Statewide autism it' be
 
03:17:37.070 --> 03:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
311 in that category what we're trying
 
03:17:40.189 --> 03:17:40.199 align:start position:0%
to arrive at is what is the cost for uh
 
03:17:42.429 --> 03:17:42.439 align:start position:0%
autism you can see it's the cost is 20
 
03:17:45.349 --> 03:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
million plus dollars it's different for
 
03:17:47.429 --> 03:17:47.439 align:start position:0%
all the 13 categories as you go down
 
03:17:49.469 --> 03:17:49.479 align:start position:0%
seeing that some total would be $98
 
03:17:54.469 --> 03:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
million using this we currently fund uh
 
03:17:57.189 --> 03:17:57.199 align:start position:0%
the education different differentiated
 
03:18:00.950 --> 03:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
Aid at $68.7 million this formula
 
03:18:03.710 --> 03:18:03.720 align:start position:0%
increases more money for special
 
03:18:06.590 --> 03:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
education if you were to take and divide
 
03:18:08.030 --> 03:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
by the number of
 
03:18:13.550 --> 03:18:13.560 align:start position:0%
kids which we will have in FY 26 it's on
 
03:18:16.070 --> 03:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
the bottom part there uh because there's
 
03:18:18.110 --> 03:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
two numbers we used in this one was from
 
03:18:21.750 --> 03:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
FY 23 on were projected for FY 26 down
 
03:18:25.630 --> 03:18:25.640 align:start position:0%
FY 26 it would come out to
 
03:18:29.269 --> 03:18:29.279 align:start position:0%
$3,078 per average case load average
 
03:18:33.150 --> 03:18:33.160 align:start position:0%
case load and that would be an increase
 
03:18:34.710 --> 03:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
of $28
 
03:18:37.389 --> 03:18:37.399 align:start position:0%
million if we if we did something like
 
03:18:38.870 --> 03:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
this or we could just leave it the way
 
03:18:38.880 --> 03:18:39.910 align:start position:0%
this or we could just leave it the way
it

03:18:39.910 --> 03:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:18:43.630 --> 03:18:43.640 align:start position:0%
is um going across the formula further
 
03:18:47.150 --> 03:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
to the right you come across out of the
 
03:18:48.790 --> 03:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
the areas on the left hand side of the
 
03:18:52.870 --> 03:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
formula again are non-targeted monies
 
03:18:55.429 --> 03:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
they all couple into this pot of money
 
03:18:57.349 --> 03:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
which the school district gets base cost
 
03:18:58.870 --> 03:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
and the three differentiated a
 
03:19:02.349 --> 03:19:02.359 align:start position:0%
categories that's totaled up and that is
 
03:19:04.550 --> 03:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
nontargeted money which Goes to School
 
03:19:06.710 --> 03:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
District on the right hand side of the
 
03:19:09.990 --> 03:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
formula find extraordinary needs Grant
 
03:19:14.630 --> 03:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
which is targeted money it's a grant and
 
03:19:16.750 --> 03:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
you also have a column we call hold
 
03:19:18.469 --> 03:19:18.479 align:start position:0%
harmless it's not here on any sheet you
 
03:19:19.710 --> 03:19:19.720 align:start position:0%
have in front of you you may have it on
 
03:19:19.720 --> 03:19:20.550 align:start position:0%
have in front of you you may have it on
a

03:19:20.550 --> 03:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:19:23.510 --> 03:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet and so this proposal right
 
03:19:26.830 --> 03:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
here proposes that and it was using the
 
03:19:30.790 --> 03:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
$28 million that came from the SWAT but
 
03:19:32.550 --> 03:19:32.560 align:start position:0%
we're finding now that there's some
 
03:19:35.110 --> 03:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
issues with that seeing that the warrant
 
03:19:36.990 --> 03:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
articles and all that timing are already
 
03:19:40.269 --> 03:19:40.279 align:start position:0%
being done and that would all have to be
 
03:19:42.590 --> 03:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
changed so this the part where the
 
03:19:44.269 --> 03:19:44.279 align:start position:0%
differentiator would probably start in
 
03:19:49.750 --> 03:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
FY 27 FY 26 would remain uh as it's
 
03:19:52.910 --> 03:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
proposed there that's basically it we
 
03:19:55.670 --> 03:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
have some other options though available
 
03:19:57.670 --> 03:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
to us how to use the extraordinary needs
 
03:20:01.670 --> 03:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
money that's $184 million and they hold
 
03:20:05.110 --> 03:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
harmless roughly another $50 million
 
03:20:06.950 --> 03:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
adding the two together you have $250
 
03:20:09.269 --> 03:20:09.279 align:start position:0%
million of which then you can start
 
03:20:10.990 --> 03:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
taking instead of using extraordinary
 
03:20:13.189 --> 03:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
needs which is based upon equalized
 
03:20:15.269 --> 03:20:15.279 align:start position:0%
property valuation per pupil multiplied
 
03:20:17.309 --> 03:20:17.319 align:start position:0%
by the number of free and reduced in
 
03:20:20.510 --> 03:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
that District to get that money we have
 
03:20:22.389 --> 03:20:22.399 align:start position:0%
other ways fiscal capacity which deals
 
03:20:24.349 --> 03:20:24.359 align:start position:0%
with equalized value a property
 
03:20:27.189 --> 03:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
valuation and all students in the
 
03:20:30.349 --> 03:20:30.359 align:start position:0%
municipality so there's an income way
 
03:20:33.710 --> 03:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
that you know and and and and the we
 
03:20:37.469 --> 03:20:37.479 align:start position:0%
called it free and relief once um
 
03:20:40.030 --> 03:20:40.040 align:start position:0%
there's several ways so this is really
 
03:20:42.710 --> 03:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
open and and it's open for discussion
 
03:20:44.790 --> 03:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
right now what route we take and what
 
03:20:47.309 --> 03:20:47.319 align:start position:0%
route given our revenues we can afford
 
03:20:47.319 --> 03:20:48.389 align:start position:0%
route given our revenues we can afford
to

03:20:48.389 --> 03:20:48.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:20:51.469 --> 03:20:51.479 align:start position:0%
take y yeah repr luno thanks very much
 
03:20:54.110 --> 03:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thanks for um for
 
03:20:59.750 --> 03:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
introducing um um 563 again to us and um
 
03:21:01.349 --> 03:21:01.359 align:start position:0%
and you know there's a lot of there's a
 
03:21:03.990 --> 03:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
lot of dials you can turn yeah um on
 
03:21:07.189 --> 03:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
this and I think um representative lad
 
03:21:09.870 --> 03:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
has identified uh the special education
 
03:21:12.910 --> 03:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
dial when it comes to the um calculation
 
03:21:14.870 --> 03:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
of the cost of inadequate education I
 
03:21:17.110 --> 03:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
think that's appropriate uh
 
03:21:19.150 --> 03:21:19.160 align:start position:0%
it would be great if we could um
 
03:21:22.670 --> 03:21:22.680 align:start position:0%
increase the differentiate Factor by an
 
03:21:24.950 --> 03:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
additional $28 million starting with the
 
03:21:28.630 --> 03:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
first year in the in the 2627 budget but
 
03:21:31.269 --> 03:21:31.279 align:start position:0%
I think um given what what uh what we
 
03:21:33.790 --> 03:21:33.800 align:start position:0%
learned this morning with some timing uh
 
03:21:35.950 --> 03:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
of some things I think introducing it
 
03:21:39.630 --> 03:21:39.640 align:start position:0%
for FY 27 makes a lot of sense uh when
 
03:21:43.429 --> 03:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
the availability of $28 million um might
 
03:21:46.070 --> 03:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
be there uh through the uh the excess
 
03:21:48.150 --> 03:21:48.160 align:start position:0%
weep uh coming back to the education
 
03:21:51.189 --> 03:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
trust fund um but um I'll tell you what
 
03:21:55.030 --> 03:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
what I'm what I'm very interested about
 
03:21:59.750 --> 03:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
interested in is um is is looking to to
 
03:22:03.070 --> 03:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
evolve the extraordinary needs Grant
 
03:22:06.510 --> 03:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
from you know this this complicated
 
03:22:10.229 --> 03:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
connection of of um of access to
 
03:22:12.349 --> 03:22:12.359 align:start position:0%
resources which is the equalized
 
03:22:15.990 --> 03:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
valuation and the the additional costs
 
03:22:19.189 --> 03:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
that that districts bear when when
 
03:22:22.110 --> 03:22:22.120 align:start position:0%
educating kids students from lwi income
 
03:22:24.550 --> 03:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
backgrounds rather than combining those
 
03:22:27.110 --> 03:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
into a single factor is really to treat
 
03:22:30.389 --> 03:22:30.399 align:start position:0%
those two factors uh independently and
 
03:22:32.070 --> 03:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
access to resources if you don't have
 
03:22:33.950 --> 03:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
access to resources it's hard to put on
 
03:22:35.790 --> 03:22:35.800 align:start position:0%
a program to begin with you don't need
 
03:22:38.229 --> 03:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
to make it more difficult by by adding
 
03:22:41.229 --> 03:22:41.239 align:start position:0%
another Factor onto it um so by breaking
 
03:22:43.910 --> 03:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
it into the two into individual
 
03:22:46.189 --> 03:22:46.199 align:start position:0%
components fiscal capacity disparity
 
03:22:48.870 --> 03:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
Grant free introduced price lunch Grant
 
03:22:51.150 --> 03:22:51.160 align:start position:0%
I think makes a lot of sense and I think
 
03:22:54.150 --> 03:22:54.160 align:start position:0%
if we could take the the um the
 
03:22:57.389 --> 03:22:57.399 align:start position:0%
approximately 134 $140
 
03:23:01.389 --> 03:23:01.399 align:start position:0%
million um I'm sorry $240 million uh
 
03:23:03.590 --> 03:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
that are currently comprise the
 
03:23:05.510 --> 03:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant plus the hold
 
03:23:08.189 --> 03:23:08.199 align:start position:0%
harmless and uh split that between
 
03:23:11.830 --> 03:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity and uh and a
 
03:23:15.030 --> 03:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh a loow income uh uh Grant based on
 
03:23:16.150 --> 03:23:16.160 align:start position:0%
the number of kids in the free and
 
03:23:18.469 --> 03:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
reduced price launch program uh I think
 
03:23:21.349 --> 03:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
that makes a lot of sense and uh and you
 
03:23:25.429 --> 03:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
know to be to be spoton on the numbers
 
03:23:28.389 --> 03:23:28.399 align:start position:0%
maybe um maybe a place to look at would
 
03:23:32.150 --> 03:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
be U 184 million um going to fiscal
 
03:23:36.110 --> 03:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
capacity disparity and 50 million uh to
 
03:23:37.790 --> 03:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
the uh the enhanced free and reduced
 
03:23:40.910 --> 03:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
price lunch uh lowi income Grant uh and
 
03:23:43.269 --> 03:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
that would um that would
 
03:23:45.750 --> 03:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
I that that would essentially I think
 
03:23:49.510 --> 03:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
use the the um the the monies that are
 
03:23:51.429 --> 03:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
presently allocated to extraordinary
 
03:23:54.030 --> 03:23:54.040 align:start position:0%
needs and the whole harmless but but I'd
 
03:23:57.189 --> 03:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
want to see how that how that models out
 
03:24:00.590 --> 03:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
and and how that affects um cities and
 
03:24:02.429 --> 03:24:02.439 align:start position:0%
towns around the state because one of
 
03:24:04.429 --> 03:24:04.439 align:start position:0%
the things the extraordinary needs Grant
 
03:24:07.469 --> 03:24:07.479 align:start position:0%
did when it came into play two years ago
 
03:24:11.590 --> 03:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh is um is is replace the stabilization
 
03:24:17.269 --> 03:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
grant that had been been there for um uh
 
03:24:19.750 --> 03:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
a decade or more I
 
03:24:22.349 --> 03:24:22.359 align:start position:0%
think come on back unfortunately I have
 
03:24:24.070 --> 03:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
to leave briefly for another committee
 
03:24:27.630 --> 03:24:27.640 align:start position:0%
but uh I very strongly endorse the the
 
03:24:28.830 --> 03:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
comments that you just made
 
03:24:30.710 --> 03:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
representative luno and i' I'd like to
 
03:24:32.950 --> 03:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
see those numbers as well okay great
 
03:24:36.309 --> 03:24:36.319 align:start position:0%
thank so going a little further uh
 
03:24:38.630 --> 03:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
represent F you you've worked with you
 
03:24:40.750 --> 03:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
know the people across the
 
03:24:44.309 --> 03:24:44.319 align:start position:0%
street and and we're hearing that we
 
03:24:46.469 --> 03:24:46.479 align:start position:0%
have we know we have $184 million
 
03:24:49.710 --> 03:24:49.720 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs and then we have
 
03:24:55.429 --> 03:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:58.070 --> 03:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
harmless and I just heard represent luno
 
03:25:00.950 --> 03:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
say okay let's put a weighted amount in
 
03:25:04.389 --> 03:25:04.399 align:start position:0%
the fiscal capacity and have the smaller
 
03:25:07.590 --> 03:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
amount roughly 4750
 
03:25:13.349 --> 03:25:13.359 align:start position:0%
million go go into the fnr side have you
 
03:25:14.990 --> 03:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
done any kind of spread sheaks like this
 
03:25:17.950 --> 03:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
and how's that how's that challenge Us
 
03:25:20.030 --> 03:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of trying to put a budget
 
03:25:22.590 --> 03:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
together the short answer is no but can
 
03:25:24.990 --> 03:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
I ask representative luno a question
 
03:25:28.269 --> 03:25:28.279 align:start position:0%
sure so I understood the put all the
 
03:25:31.309 --> 03:25:31.319 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs into the disparity
 
03:25:34.309 --> 03:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
what was the second part the 50 million
 
03:25:37.070 --> 03:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
part oh was was from the hold harmless
 
03:25:39.030 --> 03:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
and it would go into I know that but
 
03:25:42.830 --> 03:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
into what into into a a a grant tied to
 
03:25:45.229 --> 03:25:45.239 align:start position:0%
the number of of of students from
 
03:25:48.389 --> 03:25:48.399 align:start position:0%
lowincome amilies that uh that that are
 
03:25:51.510 --> 03:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
in a district and um based on fnr or
 
03:25:53.269 --> 03:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
something else well no based on fnr
 
03:25:55.590 --> 03:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
because that's how we how we identify
 
03:25:57.870 --> 03:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
okay the number of these kids right now
 
03:26:00.030 --> 03:26:00.040 align:start position:0%
and it's exactly the same factor we use
 
03:26:02.150 --> 03:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
in the left side of the formula with in
 
03:26:04.429 --> 03:26:04.439 align:start position:0%
the adequacy calculation but this would
 
03:26:09.870 --> 03:26:09.880 align:start position:0%
be a a um uh this would be a you know
 
03:26:13.750 --> 03:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
right half of the formula rant um but is
 
03:26:16.070 --> 03:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
it the extraordinary needs just limited
 
03:26:18.269 --> 03:26:18.279 align:start position:0%
to 50 million or more narrowly targeted
 
03:26:20.950 --> 03:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
or is it another calculation no no it's
 
03:26:23.070 --> 03:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's basically it's the it's the
 
03:26:26.309 --> 03:26:26.319 align:start position:0%
it's the it's the two it's replacing the
 
03:26:27.990 --> 03:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
two grants that are in there right now
 
03:26:29.790 --> 03:26:29.800 align:start position:0%
the extraordinary needs and the whole
 
03:26:34.110 --> 03:26:34.120 align:start position:0%
hold harmless um and wait wait can I
 
03:26:35.510 --> 03:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
explain it to you what what he's trying
 
03:26:39.710 --> 03:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
to do we have the extraordinary needs
 
03:26:42.070 --> 03:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
what we want to do is put that into the
 
03:26:44.229 --> 03:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity I got that
 
03:26:46.550 --> 03:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
part okay the other part the hold heart
 
03:26:49.910 --> 03:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
would go into a called relief Aid or
 
03:26:52.790 --> 03:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
Relief Fund and that's staying on the
 
03:26:55.790 --> 03:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
right hand side and it's it's allocated
 
03:26:59.910 --> 03:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
based upon the fnr formula we have which
 
03:27:01.830 --> 03:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
fnr formula that we have the
 
03:27:03.950 --> 03:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs one the one that's
 
03:27:05.670 --> 03:27:05.680 align:start position:0%
on the left hand side no no no just
 
03:27:08.389 --> 03:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
sheer the the student count number of
 
03:27:10.389 --> 03:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
students the percent so take the 50
 
03:27:12.349 --> 03:27:12.359 align:start position:0%
million or whatever it is divide by the
 
03:27:14.349 --> 03:27:14.359 align:start position:0%
total number of students in the state
 
03:27:16.870 --> 03:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
and then allocate it that way y yeah
 
03:27:19.309 --> 03:27:19.319 align:start position:0%
per per District per student per
 
03:27:21.070 --> 03:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
District yeah but wouldn't that just be
 
03:27:23.710 --> 03:27:23.720 align:start position:0%
addition in addition to the left side
 
03:27:28.150 --> 03:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
numbers um yeah I mean it it would but
 
03:27:29.950 --> 03:27:29.960 align:start position:0%
it stays on the right side because it's
 
03:27:32.590 --> 03:27:32.600 align:start position:0%
not calculated as as um okay it's part
 
03:27:34.710 --> 03:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
of the adequacy form okay so back to my
 
03:27:36.990 --> 03:27:37.000 align:start position:0%
original answer it's still no I hadn't
 
03:27:38.870 --> 03:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
actually model that but but you're right
 
03:27:41.189 --> 03:27:41.199 align:start position:0%
it would be supplemental to to that got
 
03:27:44.030 --> 03:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
it so okay I can't speak directly that
 
03:27:44.990 --> 03:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
although you probably have an idea what
 
03:27:46.309 --> 03:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
that does since you've got on the left
 
03:27:47.910 --> 03:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
that already but I can speak to the
 
03:27:51.189 --> 03:27:51.199 align:start position:0%
other um essentially
 
03:27:53.590 --> 03:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
substituting the fiscal capacity
 
03:27:54.990 --> 03:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
disparity at approach to the
 
03:27:58.389 --> 03:27:58.399 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs approach um and well
 
03:28:00.429 --> 03:28:00.439 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to debate the merits of
 
03:28:02.229 --> 03:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
either one but the the problem is
 
03:28:03.710 --> 03:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
switching like that you'll jumble
 
03:28:05.950 --> 03:28:05.960 align:start position:0%
everything up and you'll have some towns
 
03:28:07.590 --> 03:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
going way up you know some towns going
 
03:28:09.910 --> 03:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
way down you know some towns you know
 
03:28:11.429 --> 03:28:11.439 align:start position:0%
that's why I think it's worth modeling
 
03:28:12.870 --> 03:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
it's worth taking a look at what how
 
03:28:14.670 --> 03:28:14.680 align:start position:0%
that calculation okay let me just tell
 
03:28:16.429 --> 03:28:16.439 align:start position:0%
you something else another approach that
 
03:28:20.790 --> 03:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
I considered in the hopes of not Bing
 
03:28:22.710 --> 03:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
things up completely and it still might
 
03:28:24.790 --> 03:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
create a problem for my other hat when
 
03:28:26.910 --> 03:28:26.920 align:start position:0%
I'm in finance but putting that aside
 
03:28:30.590 --> 03:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
for the moment um rather than trying to
 
03:28:34.429 --> 03:28:34.439 align:start position:0%
totally upend the extraordinary needs
 
03:28:38.229 --> 03:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
model um but moving towards the fiscal
 
03:28:41.830 --> 03:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
capacity disparity model
 
03:28:46.189 --> 03:28:46.199 align:start position:0%
uh I I model so it the the the change
 
03:28:48.950 --> 03:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
that we made last by Anum really
 
03:28:50.710 --> 03:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
dramatically impacted
 
03:28:55.070 --> 03:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
negatively Five Towns so what I did was
 
03:28:57.750 --> 03:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
model specifically targeting
 
03:29:00.830 --> 03:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
money towards those five towns this like
 
03:29:03.550 --> 03:29:03.560 align:start position:0%
Charles toown Berlin
 
03:29:05.550 --> 03:29:05.560 align:start position:0%
Claremont the other two are escaping off
 
03:29:06.710 --> 03:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
top my head right now but I can look
 
03:29:11.429 --> 03:29:11.439 align:start position:0%
them up um and so that's one piece and
 
03:29:14.710 --> 03:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
the other part of that was specifically
 
03:29:17.590 --> 03:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
targeting the largest
 
03:29:21.510 --> 03:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
District uh capping it negatively so
 
03:29:24.269 --> 03:29:24.279 align:start position:0%
that's Manchester going down um I'm sure
 
03:29:25.750 --> 03:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
you're this committee is probably pretty
 
03:29:28.950 --> 03:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
aware that the changes you made last
 
03:29:33.950 --> 03:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
bium rocketed Manchester's uh adequacy
 
03:29:36.469 --> 03:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
way up um to the detriment of many other
 
03:29:39.590 --> 03:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
towns across the state gred does that
 
03:29:41.229 --> 03:29:41.239 align:start position:0%
kind of answer your question as far as I
 
03:29:42.630 --> 03:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
can go with
 
03:29:45.630 --> 03:29:45.640 align:start position:0%
it repres Luna or should I talk to Mr
 
03:29:48.750 --> 03:29:48.760 align:start position:0%
chairman so my question then by doing
 
03:29:51.469 --> 03:29:51.479 align:start position:0%
the form me that you're indicating one
 
03:29:54.189 --> 03:29:54.199 align:start position:0%
last thing so the impact of that overall
 
03:29:56.590 --> 03:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
yeah is an increase over the banum okay
 
03:29:59.630 --> 03:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
of $55 million and that does not include
 
03:30:02.590 --> 03:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
not doing the sped increase in the first
 
03:30:04.309 --> 03:30:04.319 align:start position:0%
uh year as you I think we're just
 
03:30:07.030 --> 03:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
discussing here this the left side sped
 
03:30:08.030 --> 03:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
increase which I think you were
 
03:30:09.750 --> 03:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
discussing here if I if I heard things
 
03:30:13.630 --> 03:30:13.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:16.910 --> 03:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so you're indicating then that for
 
03:30:20.309 --> 03:30:20.319 align:start position:0%
FY 27 it would be that 50 million
 
03:30:23.750 --> 03:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
increase there you plus the 28 if we no
 
03:30:27.830 --> 03:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
no the $55 million is over the
 
03:30:30.469 --> 03:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
banum okay and it includes the special
 
03:30:31.750 --> 03:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
education increase you were talking
 
03:30:34.710 --> 03:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
about for both years and then this other
 
03:30:36.389 --> 03:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
thing I described the other two things I
 
03:30:38.550 --> 03:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
described for one year the last the 20
 
03:30:41.510 --> 03:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
27 year does that make sense I'm not
 
03:30:42.830 --> 03:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
following the for both years because I
 
03:30:44.630 --> 03:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
think I didn't get can you say that
 
03:30:46.389 --> 03:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
again please yeah so let's just talk
 
03:30:48.590 --> 03:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
about the left side first yes
 
03:30:53.930 --> 03:30:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:53.940 --> 03:30:59.630 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:30:59.630 --> 03:30:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:04.150 --> 03:31:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:06.630 --> 03:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
that why don't you go further and ask a
 
03:31:07.910 --> 03:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
little bit more about what you're trying
 
03:31:10.349 --> 03:31:10.359 align:start position:0%
to drive at I'm trying to follow the
 
03:31:13.550 --> 03:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
discussion so are we looking at the
 
03:31:17.710 --> 03:31:17.720 align:start position:0%
current adequacy Aid in discussing
 
03:31:20.309 --> 03:31:20.319 align:start position:0%
changes to
 
03:31:23.429 --> 03:31:23.439 align:start position:0%
that based on right now it seems to be
 
03:31:25.389 --> 03:31:25.399 align:start position:0%
some kind of discussion about
 
03:31:29.110 --> 03:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
extraordinary grants versus yes so
 
03:31:32.990 --> 03:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
there's versus two things was it there's
 
03:31:35.269 --> 03:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant and that's on
 
03:31:37.110 --> 03:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
the those are grants on the right hand
 
03:31:41.349 --> 03:31:41.359 align:start position:0%
side of the formula they total $184
 
03:31:43.830 --> 03:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
million on the left hand side we have
 
03:31:46.349 --> 03:31:46.359 align:start position:0%
what we call the adequacy understand yes
 
03:31:48.110 --> 03:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
okay so what we're talking about what
 
03:31:49.590 --> 03:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
are we going to do are we going to keep
 
03:31:52.550 --> 03:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
the extraordinary needs Grant monies
 
03:31:54.830 --> 03:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
intact the way they are right now based
 
03:31:58.309 --> 03:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
upon that formula or are we going to try
 
03:32:00.229 --> 03:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
to Target those monies those are
 
03:32:03.269 --> 03:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
targeted Monies to better support some
 
03:32:07.229 --> 03:32:07.239 align:start position:0%
of those property poor towns so so does
 
03:32:09.870 --> 03:32:09.880 align:start position:0%
that mean we're looking at the you know
 
03:32:10.910 --> 03:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
like I've got the column here
 
03:32:16.030 --> 03:32:16.040 align:start position:0%
extraordinary 800 1884 million and the
 
03:32:18.510 --> 03:32:18.520 align:start position:0%
the two options we're kind of looking at
 
03:32:21.469 --> 03:32:21.479 align:start position:0%
keeping it the way it is or doing
 
03:32:25.150 --> 03:32:25.160 align:start position:0%
something that instead of dividing it by
 
03:32:28.150 --> 03:32:28.160 align:start position:0%
free and reduced just dividing it by
 
03:32:32.830 --> 03:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
regular student count ADM okay okay so
 
03:32:34.189 --> 03:32:34.199 align:start position:0%
there's really three
 
03:32:37.110 --> 03:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
options okay on the right side but
 
03:32:38.710 --> 03:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
before I get to that let me just clarify
 
03:32:40.910 --> 03:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
the left side because some of my totals
 
03:32:42.429 --> 03:32:42.439 align:start position:0%
include the whole package so let me just
 
03:32:43.590 --> 03:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
clarify what happened on the left side
 
03:32:45.830 --> 03:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
and then I'll move to the right side so
 
03:32:49.229 --> 03:32:49.239 align:start position:0%
on the left side chairman lad described
 
03:32:52.790 --> 03:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
increasing the per pupil per student per
 
03:32:54.950 --> 03:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
special education student by about
 
03:32:58.309 --> 03:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
$884 okay so and I think I just heard it
 
03:32:59.309 --> 03:32:59.319 align:start position:0%
just correct me if I'm wrong to
 
03:33:00.830 --> 03:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
represent a lab but I thought somebody
 
03:33:02.990 --> 03:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
you you indicated that we could not
 
03:33:04.950 --> 03:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
apply that in the first year because of
 
03:33:07.429 --> 03:33:07.439 align:start position:0%
problems with the whole thing with Dr
 
03:33:11.110 --> 03:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
and all that is that yeah that's what I
 
03:33:13.110 --> 03:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
understand our conversation just for
 
03:33:14.830 --> 03:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
lunch I just want to be very clear yeah
 
03:33:18.429 --> 03:33:18.439 align:start position:0%
okay all right so in the in the dollars
 
03:33:20.670 --> 03:33:20.680 align:start position:0%
I'm going to give you I have not yet
 
03:33:23.269 --> 03:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
made that subtraction in other words I
 
03:33:25.429 --> 03:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
included the sped increase for both
 
03:33:27.590 --> 03:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
years so that'll be a net subtraction
 
03:33:29.189 --> 03:33:29.199 align:start position:0%
when we get to that point now let me
 
03:33:32.070 --> 03:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
move to the right side okay now what I
 
03:33:33.870 --> 03:33:33.880 align:start position:0%
heard here and representative lad will
 
03:33:36.070 --> 03:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
interrupt me if I'm or chairman lad if I
 
03:33:37.510 --> 03:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
State this
 
03:33:40.710 --> 03:33:40.720 align:start position:0%
incorrectly the discussion Senator on
 
03:33:42.790 --> 03:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
taking extraordinary needs out
 
03:33:46.110 --> 03:33:46.120 align:start position:0%
completely and putting back in fiscal
 
03:33:48.630 --> 03:33:48.640 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid in its place as it existed
 
03:33:50.269 --> 03:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
two years
 
03:33:54.630 --> 03:33:54.640 align:start position:0%
ago so that's that's what I I need to
 
03:33:57.269 --> 03:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
understand what is that say that one
 
03:34:00.950 --> 03:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
more time explain what that is explain
 
03:34:03.349 --> 03:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
oh oh oh oh oh my
 
03:34:05.510 --> 03:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
gosh um I figured you'd know better than
 
03:34:08.150 --> 03:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
I since you've been on here um do you
 
03:34:10.150 --> 03:34:10.160 align:start position:0%
know the actual details of the formula
 
03:34:12.189 --> 03:34:12.199 align:start position:0%
sure I mean I mean I can I can I can
 
03:34:15.990 --> 03:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
speak to the extraordinary needs Grant
 
03:34:18.590 --> 03:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
oh sure sure so fiscal capacity
 
03:34:20.910 --> 03:34:20.920 align:start position:0%
disparity Grant would would would
 
03:34:24.870 --> 03:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
basically start with with a um it's it's
 
03:34:31.070 --> 03:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:35.030 --> 03:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
to cities and towns based on their
 
03:34:37.990 --> 03:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
equalized property value per pupil okay
 
03:34:40.870 --> 03:34:40.880 align:start position:0%
so so and it would it would at its
 
03:34:45.349 --> 03:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
highest point be go the highest Grant
 
03:34:48.790 --> 03:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
amount per pupil uh would go to go to
 
03:34:50.750 --> 03:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
the towns with the lowest equalized
 
03:34:52.950 --> 03:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
property value per pupil and then that
 
03:34:57.750 --> 03:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
would taper to zero um over over some
 
03:35:00.830 --> 03:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
range and the range I I think that
 
03:35:02.910 --> 03:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
representative lad and I have used in
 
03:35:06.710 --> 03:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
the past take you to right around the
 
03:35:09.030 --> 03:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
state average equalized property value
 
03:35:12.110 --> 03:35:12.120 align:start position:0%
per pupil is that right represent Medi
 
03:35:14.590 --> 03:35:14.600 align:start position:0%
yeah Medi yeah the the yeah yeah median
 
03:35:18.389 --> 03:35:18.399 align:start position:0%
not the not the average median and um
 
03:35:22.710 --> 03:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
and um and then um and and and basically
 
03:35:25.950 --> 03:35:25.960 align:start position:0%
the the the amount the the grant amount
 
03:35:28.550 --> 03:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
for each one of those slivers uh would
 
03:35:31.309 --> 03:35:31.319 align:start position:0%
be uh you know obviously defined by the
 
03:35:34.469 --> 03:35:34.479 align:start position:0%
area that um of of that of that of that
 
03:35:37.150 --> 03:35:37.160 align:start position:0%
line and and U Mickey will easily
 
03:35:40.950 --> 03:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
calculate that first so I understand
 
03:35:43.110 --> 03:35:43.120 align:start position:0%
when now that you explain it I remember
 
03:35:45.670 --> 03:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
what what it looks like it's got It's it
 
03:35:47.830 --> 03:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
hits a bottom level and it hits a top
 
03:35:50.269 --> 03:35:50.279 align:start position:0%
level and it slides per pup in the
 
03:35:52.349 --> 03:35:52.359 align:start position:0%
middle and there's no Cliff do you
 
03:35:55.710 --> 03:35:55.720 align:start position:0%
remember what the total cost of that was
 
03:35:57.189 --> 03:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
we can set the total cost to be whatever
 
03:35:59.670 --> 03:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
we want it to be right just well what
 
03:36:02.229 --> 03:36:02.239 align:start position:0%
was it two years
 
03:36:04.910 --> 03:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
ago I can't remember less than 184
 
03:36:07.349 --> 03:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
million I would contend yeah well the
 
03:36:10.110 --> 03:36:10.120 align:start position:0%
the hund so so two years ago to be clear
 
03:36:12.590 --> 03:36:12.600 align:start position:0%
the the 184 million didn't replace
 
03:36:14.469 --> 03:36:14.479 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity replace
 
03:36:14.479 --> 03:36:17.630 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity replace
stabilization

03:36:17.630 --> 03:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:19.030 --> 03:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
you know the history better than I do at
 
03:36:21.229 --> 03:36:21.239 align:start position:0%
some point FAL capacity was in there and
 
03:36:26.830 --> 03:36:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:29.910 --> 03:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
around3 that was years ago no that was
 
03:36:32.309 --> 03:36:32.319 align:start position:0%
two years ago okay well they stole from
 
03:36:33.830 --> 03:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
they stole from the left but it was set
 
03:36:35.870 --> 03:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
many years ago it was set it was set
 
03:36:38.150 --> 03:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
many years ago but it was replaced two
 
03:36:40.429 --> 03:36:40.439 align:start position:0%
years ago correct in the um in the in
 
03:36:43.389 --> 03:36:43.399 align:start position:0%
the budget but but understand this
 
03:36:45.189 --> 03:36:45.199 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity as he just
 
03:36:47.830 --> 03:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
described is based on something as
 
03:36:50.070 --> 03:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
opposed to stabilization all that they
 
03:36:51.309 --> 03:36:51.319 align:start position:0%
were they were sort of constants that
 
03:36:53.229 --> 03:36:53.239 align:start position:0%
were scrapped out so if you understand
 
03:36:55.150 --> 03:36:55.160 align:start position:0%
physical capacity disparity Aid you got
 
03:36:58.349 --> 03:36:58.359 align:start position:0%
that okay all I want to say is I did not
 
03:37:01.830 --> 03:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
I I have modeled that one for one
 
03:37:05.550 --> 03:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
between extraordinary needs versus
 
03:37:08.910 --> 03:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
physical capacity disparity Aid and it
 
03:37:12.550 --> 03:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
it totally flips all kinds of things I
 
03:37:15.830 --> 03:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
don't mean flips like but like
 
03:37:18.830 --> 03:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
everything and as soon as you do that
 
03:37:21.110 --> 03:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
some towns are
 
03:37:23.469 --> 03:37:23.479 align:start position:0%
dramatically reduced some towns are
 
03:37:25.070 --> 03:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
dramatically increased and as I
 
03:37:26.590 --> 03:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
understand again this is just my
 
03:37:28.269 --> 03:37:28.279 align:start position:0%
understanding from all past years with
 
03:37:30.269 --> 03:37:30.279 align:start position:0%
you all U is that you don't generally
 
03:37:32.910 --> 03:37:32.920 align:start position:0%
want to have negative amounts going out
 
03:37:36.469 --> 03:37:36.479 align:start position:0%
to towns so I can model what you just
 
03:37:37.830 --> 03:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
asked for and I would glad to have that
 
03:37:40.070 --> 03:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
done but what I did model was something
 
03:37:42.710 --> 03:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
that I was an attempt to not have it
 
03:37:46.070 --> 03:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
Tipsy Topsy everything and yet address
 
03:37:48.830 --> 03:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
the big problem which was those towns
 
03:37:50.469 --> 03:37:50.479 align:start position:0%
who were most
 
03:37:53.550 --> 03:37:53.560 align:start position:0%
dramatically impacted negatively when
 
03:37:55.550 --> 03:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
physical capacity went away or if it
 
03:37:58.189 --> 03:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
comes back and the towns I was targeting
 
03:38:02.429 --> 03:38:02.439 align:start position:0%
were the and so instead of the um notion
 
03:38:05.950 --> 03:38:05.960 align:start position:0%
of you know going from the median down I
 
03:38:07.990 --> 03:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
went specifically to the bottom Five
 
03:38:10.830 --> 03:38:10.840 align:start position:0%
Towns okay which I can which we can do
 
03:38:13.269 --> 03:38:13.279 align:start position:0%
by the just by adjusting what the cut
 
03:38:15.510 --> 03:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
offs are in the in the in the in the
 
03:38:18.830 --> 03:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
figures in the amounts and in doing that
 
03:38:21.510 --> 03:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
just targeting those towns and at the
 
03:38:24.150 --> 03:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
same time another change that well not
 
03:38:25.950 --> 03:38:25.960 align:start position:0%
another change the change that was made
 
03:38:27.950 --> 03:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
regarding the extraordinary needs Grant
 
03:38:29.870 --> 03:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
two years ago
 
03:38:29.880 --> 03:38:31.469 align:start position:0%
two years ago
dramatically

03:38:31.469 --> 03:38:31.479 align:start position:0%
dramatically
 
03:38:33.870 --> 03:38:33.880 align:start position:0%
increased Manchester and Nash and I
 
03:38:35.229 --> 03:38:35.239 align:start position:0%
think a couple other cities but really
 
03:38:40.429 --> 03:38:40.439 align:start position:0%
Manchester a lot and so cap that Capp
 
03:38:42.510 --> 03:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
what they got so reduced it what they
 
03:38:45.189 --> 03:38:45.199 align:start position:0%
got going forward by about $10 million
 
03:38:48.309 --> 03:38:48.319 align:start position:0%
roughly $12 million maybe um to count to
 
03:38:51.389 --> 03:38:51.399 align:start position:0%
help offset the the changes I just
 
03:38:52.790 --> 03:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
described to fiscal capacity of
 
03:38:58.790 --> 03:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:01.030 --> 03:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
good so what are you telling me about
 
03:39:03.630 --> 03:39:03.640 align:start position:0%
the five towns what happens to them
 
03:39:05.590 --> 03:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
they're the ones who got the big the
 
03:39:07.510 --> 03:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity Aid was
 
03:39:10.710 --> 03:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
applied to them they go down and they go
 
03:39:13.110 --> 03:39:13.120 align:start position:0%
up they go down they go
 
03:39:16.030 --> 03:39:16.040 align:start position:0%
up they get more money and
 
03:39:17.790 --> 03:39:17.800 align:start position:0%
extraordinary no the extraordinary is
 
03:39:20.110 --> 03:39:20.120 align:start position:0%
still there extraordinary is not not in
 
03:39:21.590 --> 03:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
in the model I described I did not want
 
03:39:24.429 --> 03:39:24.439 align:start position:0%
to take extraordinary away because it
 
03:39:27.670 --> 03:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
would so so grossly change everything
 
03:39:29.950 --> 03:39:29.960 align:start position:0%
else so the idea was hold every other
 
03:39:32.790 --> 03:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
Town constant except for Manchester
 
03:39:34.750 --> 03:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
which went down and these five towns
 
03:39:36.550 --> 03:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
that went
 
03:39:40.349 --> 03:39:40.359 align:start position:0%
up okay does that make sense yeah so so
 
03:39:43.630 --> 03:39:43.640 align:start position:0%
you're adding you're adding in
 
03:39:47.670 --> 03:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
essentially the fiscal capacity to Five
 
03:39:50.830 --> 03:39:50.840 align:start position:0%
Towns just making a new column oh fiscal
 
03:39:53.830 --> 03:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
capacity only for Five Towns
 
03:39:56.469 --> 03:39:56.479 align:start position:0%
yes did you look at the per pupil amount
 
03:39:58.550 --> 03:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
when you made these changes this this
 
03:40:00.389 --> 03:40:00.399 align:start position:0%
isn't not per pupil this is on the right
 
03:40:04.349 --> 03:40:04.359 align:start position:0%
side I'm asking you did did you look at
 
03:40:09.830 --> 03:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:11.710 --> 03:40:11.720 align:start position:0%
scenarios I guess I'm not quite sure in
 
03:40:14.469 --> 03:40:14.479 align:start position:0%
what context you're asking that this was
 
03:40:16.950 --> 03:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
targeted Aid
 
03:40:19.269 --> 03:40:19.279 align:start position:0%
right anyway do you understand this what
 
03:40:22.550 --> 03:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
I did um
 
03:40:25.590 --> 03:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
so okay so you're you're only changing
 
03:40:25.600 --> 03:40:26.870 align:start position:0%
so okay so you're you're only changing
Five

03:40:26.870 --> 03:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
Five
 
03:40:30.910 --> 03:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
Towns six and Manchester make six oh six
 
03:40:33.550 --> 03:40:33.560 align:start position:0%
okay okay now let me just finish let me
 
03:40:36.469 --> 03:40:36.479 align:start position:0%
just finish okay so the impact of that
 
03:40:39.110 --> 03:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
was as follows this is what I wanted to
 
03:40:42.830 --> 03:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
get to the increase total increase of
 
03:40:45.469 --> 03:40:45.479 align:start position:0%
the formula over the two years it's
 
03:40:47.189 --> 03:40:47.199 align:start position:0%
about $55
 
03:40:49.429 --> 03:40:49.439 align:start position:0%
million and as I said at the very
 
03:40:53.630 --> 03:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
beginning that does not exclude applying
 
03:40:55.590 --> 03:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
the extra funding of special education
 
03:40:58.229 --> 03:40:58.239 align:start position:0%
on the Le hand side in the first year
 
03:41:00.510 --> 03:41:00.520 align:start position:0%
okay so that's all I wanted to say and
 
03:41:01.990 --> 03:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
anything else can be modeled as well
 
03:41:04.269 --> 03:41:04.279 align:start position:0%
that was just what the approach I
 
03:41:08.630 --> 03:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
took so we just tried so $55 million
 
03:41:09.830 --> 03:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
over the
 
03:41:13.830 --> 03:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
banum to to impact six
 
03:41:17.510 --> 03:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
towns no no no and all the special
 
03:41:20.309 --> 03:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
education on the left hand side as
 
03:41:23.269 --> 03:41:23.279 align:start position:0%
well oh the increases per pupil on the
 
03:41:25.149 --> 03:41:25.159 align:start position:0%
left-and side for special education for
 
03:41:27.590 --> 03:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
both years
 
03:41:30.710 --> 03:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
okay that was $884 roughly I think
 
03:41:33.030 --> 03:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
chairman lad mentioned per student in
 
03:41:34.750 --> 03:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
each of the yeah so how much was his
 
03:41:36.990 --> 03:41:37.000 align:start position:0%
special ed that was I I I can't break it
 
03:41:38.870 --> 03:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
down to my I think he said $28 million
 
03:41:40.790 --> 03:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
was it the amount that we're allocating
 
03:41:42.750 --> 03:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
for special education the
 
03:41:44.750 --> 03:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
extra no I think she wants in total
 
03:41:47.910 --> 03:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
don't you was it oh oh the total cost
 
03:41:50.030 --> 03:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
was uh
 
03:41:50.040 --> 03:41:51.590 align:start position:0%
was uh
96

03:41:51.590 --> 03:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
96
 
03:41:55.950 --> 03:41:55.960 align:start position:0%
million oh additional cost 28.1 million
 
03:41:58.910 --> 03:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
for both years or one year that's for
 
03:42:02.630 --> 03:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
one year so double that then so
 
03:42:04.469 --> 03:42:04.479 align:start position:0%
something's not quite right with his
 
03:42:07.670 --> 03:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
map he's in education what can I
 
03:42:11.550 --> 03:42:11.560 align:start position:0%
say 28.1 yeah but currently we're
 
03:42:16.950 --> 03:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
spending 68.7 million per year
 
03:42:19.790 --> 03:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
this would increase to
 
03:42:22.469 --> 03:42:22.479 align:start position:0%
96 whoa whoa whoa whoa Hy hang on hang
 
03:42:25.269 --> 03:42:25.279 align:start position:0%
on hang on um all my numbers are with
 
03:42:26.870 --> 03:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
respect to the governor's budget since
 
03:42:28.429 --> 03:42:28.439 align:start position:0%
that's what we're working off of I think
 
03:42:29.710 --> 03:42:29.720 align:start position:0%
he's looking
 
03:42:32.309 --> 03:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
at projections from last year or
 
03:42:34.750 --> 03:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
something so when you say special ed are
 
03:42:36.830 --> 03:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
you talking about catastrophic
 
03:42:38.670 --> 03:42:38.680 align:start position:0%
or okay I'm just talking about the
 
03:42:39.950 --> 03:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
governor's everything all my numbers
 
03:42:41.469 --> 03:42:41.479 align:start position:0%
compared to so this is the governor's
 
03:42:43.269 --> 03:42:43.279 align:start position:0%
budget adequacy line if you go into the
 
03:42:45.389 --> 03:42:45.399 align:start position:0%
budget you'll see that line in there
 
03:42:50.990 --> 03:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:01.309 --> 03:43:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:05.030 --> 03:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
paper so in the governor's budget it's
 
03:43:09.670 --> 03:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
one this is FY FY 26
 
03:43:13.149 --> 03:43:13.159 align:start position:0%
1.08 billion doll for the first year and
 
03:43:17.149 --> 03:43:17.159 align:start position:0%
$ 1.08 billion for the second
 
03:43:21.429 --> 03:43:21.439 align:start position:0%
year right so the the numbers for what I
 
03:43:24.429 --> 03:43:24.439 align:start position:0%
just tried to describe to you
 
03:43:29.389 --> 03:43:29.399 align:start position:0%
1.17 billion for the first year and 1.11
 
03:43:42.510 --> 03:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:45.630 --> 03:43:45.640 align:start position:0%
year and if we left and if we left the
 
03:43:47.910 --> 03:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant as it
 
03:43:51.469 --> 03:43:51.479 align:start position:0%
is and we also had the increase for
 
03:43:54.309 --> 03:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
special education differentiated Aid
 
03:43:56.030 --> 03:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
which is the amount of
 
03:43:59.750 --> 03:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
$3,078 per kid raising that line item up
 
03:44:05.110 --> 03:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
to 96.8 million the cost would be $1.07
 
03:44:05.120 --> 03:44:07.429 align:start position:0%
to 96.8 million the cost would be $1.07
N9

03:44:07.429 --> 03:44:07.439 align:start position:0%
N9
 
03:44:11.070 --> 03:44:11.080 align:start position:0%
billion so it's pretty
 
03:44:13.790 --> 03:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
close um quick quick quick question
 
03:44:17.189 --> 03:44:17.199 align:start position:0%
represent on that explanation so so what
 
03:44:19.309 --> 03:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
you just talked about was for um for the
 
03:44:24.510 --> 03:44:24.520 align:start position:0%
two years FY 26 and FY 27 and um so uh
 
03:44:27.590 --> 03:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
and I just want to clarify for for
 
03:44:31.429 --> 03:44:31.439 align:start position:0%
particularly FY 26 but but looking for
 
03:44:34.429 --> 03:44:34.439 align:start position:0%
both years too particularly for FY
 
03:44:38.269 --> 03:44:38.279 align:start position:0%
26 where um where we've got um school
 
03:44:40.870 --> 03:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
districts in the next number of weeks
 
03:44:44.510 --> 03:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
voting on budgets for their FY 26 that
 
03:44:46.189 --> 03:44:46.199 align:start position:0%
that none of the the districts would be
 
03:44:49.189 --> 03:44:49.199 align:start position:0%
receiving less money from the state than
 
03:44:51.389 --> 03:44:51.399 align:start position:0%
what has already been estimated in the
 
03:44:52.990 --> 03:44:53.000 align:start position:0%
in the current under current law is that
 
03:44:55.710 --> 03:44:55.720 align:start position:0%
correct so the changes I described did
 
03:44:58.149 --> 03:44:58.159 align:start position:0%
not affect the first year at all okay
 
03:45:00.710 --> 03:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
it's exactly what it was the only
 
03:45:02.990 --> 03:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
difference was it did have additional
 
03:45:04.389 --> 03:45:04.399 align:start position:0%
monies for the special education
 
03:45:06.550 --> 03:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
addition money yeah I want to make sure
 
03:45:08.309 --> 03:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
that nobody's getting less than what
 
03:45:11.870 --> 03:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
they built their budgets around and
 
03:45:13.429 --> 03:45:13.439 align:start position:0%
unless the formulas you guys already had
 
03:45:15.349 --> 03:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
made it go down I that I can't speak but
 
03:45:17.189 --> 03:45:17.199 align:start position:0%
I I did not change it it's whatever
 
03:45:20.469 --> 03:45:20.479 align:start position:0%
right right all I affected was yeah FY
 
03:45:27.870 --> 03:45:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:30.030 --> 03:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
okay and I'll be happy to look at this
 
03:45:33.229 --> 03:45:33.239 align:start position:0%
f&amp;r thing the the f&amp;r thing is kind of a
 
03:45:36.429 --> 03:45:36.439 align:start position:0%
result of we had a bill it was
 
03:45:38.469 --> 03:45:38.479 align:start position:0%
1583 last
 
03:45:40.830 --> 03:45:40.840 align:start position:0%
year and
 
03:45:43.990 --> 03:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
1583 took the monies which we're talking
 
03:45:46.389 --> 03:45:46.399 align:start position:0%
about the extraordinary need
 
03:45:50.349 --> 03:45:50.359 align:start position:0%
monies and it broke it up amongst fiscal
 
03:45:52.349 --> 03:45:52.359 align:start position:0%
capacity faity
 
03:45:56.189 --> 03:45:56.199 align:start position:0%
Aid and relief
 
03:45:58.750 --> 03:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
funding now relief
 
03:46:01.750 --> 03:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
funding in a mun municipality which had
 
03:46:06.469 --> 03:46:06.479 align:start position:0%
48% or more of their population as
 
03:46:11.429 --> 03:46:11.439 align:start position:0%
fnr would get $800 per pupil then it
 
03:46:13.910 --> 03:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
came down that scale to where you're at
 
03:46:18.110 --> 03:46:18.120 align:start position:0%
12% or more you got 200 that's how we
 
03:46:21.269 --> 03:46:21.279 align:start position:0%
split that up there and then the fiscal
 
03:46:23.790 --> 03:46:23.800 align:start position:0%
capacity was done as you've
 
03:46:25.550 --> 03:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
explained so that's why I thought
 
03:46:28.030 --> 03:46:28.040 align:start position:0%
physical capacity was in there last last
 
03:46:29.429 --> 03:46:29.439 align:start position:0%
year because you guys did it last year
 
03:46:31.389 --> 03:46:31.399 align:start position:0%
and then the Senate SP that out there is
 
03:46:33.030 --> 03:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
there's two different another fund there
 
03:46:35.110 --> 03:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
that we weren't even talking
 
03:46:38.189 --> 03:46:38.199 align:start position:0%
about so I guess what I'd like to find
 
03:46:41.670 --> 03:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
out is how's that all work Dan excuse me
 
03:46:41.680 --> 03:46:42.670 align:start position:0%
out is how's that all work Dan excuse me
represent

03:46:42.670 --> 03:46:42.680 align:start position:0%
represent
 
03:46:45.670 --> 03:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
McGuire I you can call me Dan
 
03:46:50.550 --> 03:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
um in general I dislike cliffs in
 
03:46:55.070 --> 03:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
formulas if you're over 800 you get X if
 
03:46:57.990 --> 03:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
you're below 800 you get zero right like
 
03:47:01.110 --> 03:47:01.120 align:start position:0%
this I like ramps just to be clear
 
03:47:02.710 --> 03:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
everything I described is ramps I
 
03:47:04.550 --> 03:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
understand but he just said no that was
 
03:47:09.349 --> 03:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
ramps between 12% and 48% there was a
 
03:47:15.229 --> 03:47:15.239 align:start position:0%
ramp okay up to the ceiling of 800 and
 
03:47:18.309 --> 03:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
once you got to the 48% you were at that
 
03:47:20.269 --> 03:47:20.279 align:start position:0%
ceiling that's all we had when you at
 
03:47:23.309 --> 03:47:23.319 align:start position:0%
the floor the bottom was for you know
 
03:47:26.309 --> 03:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
started at 12 200 and I think it went up
 
03:47:28.189 --> 03:47:28.199 align:start position:0%
through there that it was just a ramp
 
03:47:32.030 --> 03:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
okay all right good so anyways because
 
03:47:35.070 --> 03:47:35.080 align:start position:0%
because then people on the edge right
 
03:47:38.110 --> 03:47:38.120 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's very bad okay second
 
03:47:40.710 --> 03:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
thing is we always say like it's a
 
03:47:44.830 --> 03:47:44.840 align:start position:0%
phrase free and reduced do we ever say
 
03:47:46.750 --> 03:47:46.760 align:start position:0%
free should be one amount and reduced
 
03:47:48.429 --> 03:47:48.439 align:start position:0%
should be some other amount I mean cuz
 
03:47:50.630 --> 03:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
clearly somebody who gets a free lunch
 
03:47:53.229 --> 03:47:53.239 align:start position:0%
is less wealthy than somebody with a
 
03:47:57.110 --> 03:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch yeah yeah 130% 185% but in
 
03:47:58.670 --> 03:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
this one that we're just qualifying all
 
03:48:01.229 --> 03:48:01.239 align:start position:0%
it's the same that's my point is
 
03:48:03.670 --> 03:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be better since we have I I
 
03:48:06.070 --> 03:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
assume those numbers are available to
 
03:48:08.510 --> 03:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
say the grant for free is slightly
 
03:48:10.750 --> 03:48:10.760 align:start position:0%
bigger and the other one is is less you
 
03:48:10.760 --> 03:48:12.269 align:start position:0%
bigger and the other one is is less you
know

03:48:12.269 --> 03:48:12.279 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:48:15.950 --> 03:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
so to be to be more Target you know more
 
03:48:17.990 --> 03:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
accurately taret so I can I can tell you
 
03:48:20.630 --> 03:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
about that that the reason that I think
 
03:48:23.189 --> 03:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
it's that I assume it's never been
 
03:48:26.950 --> 03:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
broken apart into two is because the the
 
03:48:30.229 --> 03:48:30.239 align:start position:0%
reduced part is only something like
 
03:48:34.469 --> 03:48:34.479 align:start position:0%
15% of the whole the vast majority of
 
03:48:37.349 --> 03:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
kids who are either free and reduced is
 
03:48:37.359 --> 03:48:40.950 align:start position:0%
kids who are either free and reduced is
mostly

03:48:40.950 --> 03:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:44.950 --> 03:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
free so where we are we're at the point
 
03:48:46.349 --> 03:48:46.359 align:start position:0%
where we can look at some of those other
 
03:48:48.349 --> 03:48:48.359 align:start position:0%
bills which are there chairman could I
 
03:48:52.429 --> 03:48:52.439 align:start position:0%
respond to that yes so that may be true
 
03:48:54.990 --> 03:48:55.000 align:start position:0%
Statewide but there might be
 
03:48:55.000 --> 03:48:56.550 align:start position:0%
Statewide but there might be
locations

03:48:56.550 --> 03:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
locations
 
03:49:00.349 --> 03:49:00.359 align:start position:0%
where everyone's free and 50% are
 
03:49:03.110 --> 03:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
reduced you know other ones right so
 
03:49:05.189 --> 03:49:05.199 align:start position:0%
it's not like every location would have
 
03:49:09.070 --> 03:49:09.080 align:start position:0%
the same split
 
03:49:11.990 --> 03:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
yeah just I I would suggest if you're
 
03:49:15.590 --> 03:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
interested in looking at the in incomes
 
03:49:18.870 --> 03:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
of the family then you look at income
 
03:49:20.830 --> 03:49:20.840 align:start position:0%
because there is census data that will
 
03:49:24.189 --> 03:49:24.199 align:start position:0%
tell you by Town um median household
 
03:49:27.189 --> 03:49:27.199 align:start position:0%
income and median family income and I
 
03:49:29.389 --> 03:49:29.399 align:start position:0%
would suggest median as opposed to
 
03:49:31.389 --> 03:49:31.399 align:start position:0%
average or obvious
 
03:49:33.870 --> 03:49:33.880 align:start position:0%
reasons if that's what you want to do
 
03:49:37.149 --> 03:49:37.159 align:start position:0%
really you should be using those numbers
 
03:49:40.630 --> 03:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
and they have been used in the past
 
03:49:43.710 --> 03:49:43.720 align:start position:0%
so thank you we still use those numbers
 
03:49:46.309 --> 03:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
like that for building
 
03:49:49.429 --> 03:49:49.439 align:start position:0%
and we we used those numbers back there
 
03:49:53.149 --> 03:49:53.159 align:start position:0%
in the esbrook days when we looked at
 
03:49:55.950 --> 03:49:55.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity that com that
 
03:49:58.550 --> 03:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
had a double component within it medium
 
03:50:01.030 --> 03:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
family income and then they look at the
 
03:50:03.429 --> 03:50:03.439 align:start position:0%
quartiles and then they had the fiscal
 
03:50:06.429 --> 03:50:06.439 align:start position:0%
Capac uh the the valuation of property
 
03:50:07.990 --> 03:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
on the other side it was a combination
 
03:50:10.550 --> 03:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
it was a blending extraordinary needs
 
03:50:13.510 --> 03:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
Grant went the other way and now we're
 
03:50:15.469 --> 03:50:15.479 align:start position:0%
trying to see is there of getting back
 
03:50:19.550 --> 03:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
to where we can get both income and and
 
03:50:22.950 --> 03:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
property there in this formula
 
03:50:26.030 --> 03:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
somehow I I think yeah yeah could I
 
03:50:28.950 --> 03:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
suggesting something along those lines
 
03:50:32.349 --> 03:50:32.359 align:start position:0%
um you know I think it's I I think it's
 
03:50:35.269 --> 03:50:35.279 align:start position:0%
certainly important to you know if we're
 
03:50:38.309 --> 03:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
looking to to shift away from
 
03:50:41.110 --> 03:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs into you know more
 
03:50:44.269 --> 03:50:44.279 align:start position:0%
more separate U type grants recognizing
 
03:50:47.149 --> 03:50:47.159 align:start position:0%
the differ between fiscal capacity and
 
03:50:49.750 --> 03:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
um and and students that that come from
 
03:50:53.590 --> 03:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
low income uh backgrounds but but also
 
03:50:55.990 --> 03:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
recognizing I think as as as
 
03:50:58.710 --> 03:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
representative Earth pointed out that um
 
03:51:02.349 --> 03:51:02.359 align:start position:0%
that that could create some sizable
 
03:51:06.389 --> 03:51:06.399 align:start position:0%
changes for for some districts and that
 
03:51:09.189 --> 03:51:09.199 align:start position:0%
we may want to take a look at I mean if
 
03:51:11.590 --> 03:51:11.600 align:start position:0%
if we're going to move in a in a
 
03:51:14.750 --> 03:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
direction like that talk about the the
 
03:51:18.030 --> 03:51:18.040 align:start position:0%
total sum of money um which I think
 
03:51:19.910 --> 03:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
we're where did we say we're
 
03:51:23.110 --> 03:51:23.120 align:start position:0%
at two sorry 234
 
03:51:27.070 --> 03:51:27.080 align:start position:0%
235 million between um extraordinary
 
03:51:29.110 --> 03:51:29.120 align:start position:0%
needs and the hold harmless something
 
03:51:32.269 --> 03:51:32.279 align:start position:0%
like that 184 plus 47 so let's let's
 
03:51:34.269 --> 03:51:34.279 align:start position:0%
just just let's just pick the number
 
03:51:38.750 --> 03:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
right right so so uh
 
03:51:38.760 --> 03:51:40.469 align:start position:0%
right right so so uh
230

03:51:40.469 --> 03:51:40.479 align:start position:0%
230
 
03:51:44.990 --> 03:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
31 million that we carve that up in in
 
03:51:47.830 --> 03:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
three ways um two parts for the grant
 
03:51:50.630 --> 03:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
and then one uh one one piece for the to
 
03:51:54.389 --> 03:51:54.399 align:start position:0%
make sure that um that that districts
 
03:51:58.630 --> 03:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
aren't you know getting any surprise
 
03:52:01.229 --> 03:52:01.239 align:start position:0%
um I I support that you know the
 
03:52:02.630 --> 03:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
weighting it heavier with the fiscal
 
03:52:06.630 --> 03:52:06.640 align:start position:0%
capacity disparity a maybe 2/3 1/3
 
03:52:09.229 --> 03:52:09.239 align:start position:0%
or just work the numbers that's what we
 
03:52:11.990 --> 03:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:14.830 --> 03:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
do so we're
 
03:52:16.429 --> 03:52:16.439 align:start position:0%
so we're not going to have an amendment
 
03:52:17.950 --> 03:52:17.960 align:start position:0%
today this oh no no no we're not going
 
03:52:18.870 --> 03:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
to have an amendment we're going to have
 
03:52:20.710 --> 03:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
to work an amendment out here but what
 
03:52:24.349 --> 03:52:24.359 align:start position:0%
we've got to do is that um we're going
 
03:52:25.830 --> 03:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
to have to decide we're going to have
 
03:52:29.670 --> 03:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
one bill taking this forward right and I
 
03:52:33.189 --> 03:52:33.199 align:start position:0%
would suggest we use 563 to do that and
 
03:52:38.630 --> 03:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:41.750 --> 03:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
772 that would all 772 would match up
 
03:52:41.760 --> 03:52:43.030 align:start position:0%
772 that would all 772 would match up
with

03:52:43.030 --> 03:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:52:46.630 --> 03:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
734 MH I agree with
 
03:52:50.110 --> 03:52:50.120 align:start position:0%
that and then the other bills then we
 
03:52:53.710 --> 03:52:53.720 align:start position:0%
could just dispose of I I would I would
 
03:52:57.990 --> 03:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
suggest may maybe also retaining
 
03:53:02.830 --> 03:53:02.840 align:start position:0%
651 um it it's you know it it turns the
 
03:53:05.349 --> 03:53:05.359 align:start position:0%
dials in the in the current Formula it
 
03:53:07.550 --> 03:53:07.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't it doesn't extend beyond it I
 
03:53:10.309 --> 03:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
wouldn't call it uh any sort of Reform
 
03:53:13.670 --> 03:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
package or anything like that um but it
 
03:53:17.469 --> 03:53:17.479 align:start position:0%
also in includes the um the the
 
03:53:19.389 --> 03:53:19.399 align:start position:0%
necessary resource elements that we
 
03:53:19.399 --> 03:53:20.830 align:start position:0%
necessary resource elements that we
talked

03:53:20.830 --> 03:53:20.840 align:start position:0%
talked
 
03:53:23.110 --> 03:53:23.120 align:start position:0%
about essentially covers the same
 
03:53:25.070 --> 03:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
characteris it it covers the same
 
03:53:27.070 --> 03:53:27.080 align:start position:0%
characteristics as as we had with here
 
03:53:28.790 --> 03:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
but you have some other components
 
03:53:31.870 --> 03:53:31.880 align:start position:0%
within that's worth a discussion and
 
03:53:34.309 --> 03:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
course also has the cost jumping from 41
 
03:53:37.389 --> 03:53:37.399 align:start position:0%
to 7 it was it was really there to
 
03:53:41.910 --> 03:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
illuminate um how how how just applying
 
03:53:44.590 --> 03:53:44.600 align:start position:0%
one size fits-all numbers come coming
 
03:53:47.309 --> 03:53:47.319 align:start position:0%
from the conval case uh how that would
 
03:53:50.630 --> 03:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
how that would play out in a in a you
 
03:53:52.670 --> 03:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
know in the existing one-size fits-all
 
03:53:55.670 --> 03:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
funding formula I I think it'd be wiser
 
03:53:58.550 --> 03:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
doing rather than I I don't mind the the
 
03:54:01.950 --> 03:54:01.960 align:start position:0%
part that's down on lines 15 through 25
 
03:54:04.710 --> 03:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
I think that's good stuff but
 
03:54:09.630 --> 03:54:09.640 align:start position:0%
uh your other bills 772
 
03:54:11.910 --> 03:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
incorporates much of this I don't know
 
03:54:14.149 --> 03:54:14.159 align:start position:0%
if it has the um the well it doesn't
 
03:54:15.950 --> 03:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
have the specific figures of 7 no
 
03:54:18.229 --> 03:54:18.239 align:start position:0%
because it's not based on base cost
 
03:54:19.349 --> 03:54:19.359 align:start position:0%
right right well it doesn't have that
 
03:54:20.950 --> 03:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
and I don't think it's got the necessary
 
03:54:23.110 --> 03:54:23.120 align:start position:0%
resource elements I don't remember well
 
03:54:24.750 --> 03:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
that say yeah the resource elements I
 
03:54:26.910 --> 03:54:26.920 align:start position:0%
have no problem with right right I do
 
03:54:29.750 --> 03:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
have a problem with the 7,300 no no
 
03:54:32.830 --> 03:54:32.840 align:start position:0%
I'm so but go ahead represent spillsbury
 
03:54:35.030 --> 03:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
it it does seem to me that if we're
 
03:54:37.110 --> 03:54:37.120 align:start position:0%
going to take action on
 
03:54:41.750 --> 03:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
563 it renders this bill Moot and if we
 
03:54:44.670 --> 03:54:44.680 align:start position:0%
want to uh import uh the language you
 
03:54:48.750 --> 03:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
got here onlines uh 18 to 25 into 563
 
03:54:52.510 --> 03:54:52.520 align:start position:0%
then okay that's an option all
 
03:54:55.550 --> 03:54:55.560 align:start position:0%
right well I have a problem with
 
03:54:57.950 --> 03:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
that I have a problem putting that in
 
03:54:57.960 --> 03:54:59.269 align:start position:0%
that I have a problem putting that in
the

03:54:59.269 --> 03:54:59.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:55:02.469 --> 03:55:02.479 align:start position:0%
563 because there's a lot of items
 
03:55:06.149 --> 03:55:06.159 align:start position:0%
here which if you try to match it up
 
03:55:07.990 --> 03:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
with what we have coming out of that
 
03:55:10.830 --> 03:55:10.840 align:start position:0%
original formula they go above and
 
03:55:13.309 --> 03:55:13.319 align:start position:0%
beyond yeah
 
03:55:15.309 --> 03:55:15.319 align:start position:0%
okay and and then you're going to have
 
03:55:17.550 --> 03:55:17.560 align:start position:0%
for example the discussion about the
 
03:55:19.830 --> 03:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
nurse is the nurse part of adequacy or
 
03:55:23.429 --> 03:55:23.439 align:start position:0%
not that's a conversation worth having
 
03:55:26.590 --> 03:55:26.600 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't match up to what we said
 
03:55:28.910 --> 03:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
before in statute comes up as an
 
03:55:31.309 --> 03:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
optional service cor correct and that's
 
03:55:33.469 --> 03:55:33.479 align:start position:0%
why I think you know retaining that at
 
03:55:35.710 --> 03:55:35.720 align:start position:0%
least provides some I don't mind
 
03:55:39.349 --> 03:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
retaining it that's all I'm suggesting
 
03:55:42.590 --> 03:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
thanks so let's try to get something
 
03:55:46.590 --> 03:55:46.600 align:start position:0%
done here represent McGuire on 563 are
 
03:55:50.229 --> 03:55:50.239 align:start position:0%
we keeping the ABC categories going no
 
03:55:51.389 --> 03:55:51.399 align:start position:0%
we're not that's going that's all going
 
03:55:53.630 --> 03:55:53.640 align:start position:0%
to be that's all amended out got in fact
 
03:55:55.750 --> 03:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
there's new amending language that's
 
03:55:57.349 --> 03:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
already been started oh thank you very
 
03:55:59.670 --> 03:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
much it's all
 
03:56:02.950 --> 03:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
gone so let's look at the top here and
 
03:56:04.950 --> 03:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
come through the bills here
 
03:56:07.229 --> 03:56:07.239 align:start position:0%
550 modifying the base cost of
 
03:56:07.239 --> 03:56:08.309 align:start position:0%
550 modifying the base cost of
inadequate

03:56:08.309 --> 03:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
inadequate
 
03:56:08.319 --> 03:56:10.510 align:start position:0%
inadequate
education

03:56:10.510 --> 03:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
education
 
03:56:23.189 --> 03:56:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:26.229 --> 03:56:26.239 align:start position:0%
that's similar to
 
03:56:30.630 --> 03:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
uh that's very close to the uh other
 
03:56:32.750 --> 03:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
bill you had represent
 
03:56:37.590 --> 03:56:37.600 align:start position:0%
luno what's that 550 is very close to
 
03:56:40.870 --> 03:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
651 651 has everything 550 has that's
 
03:56:45.670 --> 03:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
exactly right so we can it 550
 
03:56:47.710 --> 03:56:47.720 align:start position:0%
okay let's hear a motion somewhere
 
03:56:49.349 --> 03:56:49.359 align:start position:0%

03:56:52.710 --> 03:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
550 itl I'll I'll I'll make motion to

HB 772 are the most interesting bills
 
04:04:39.149 --> 04:04:39.159 align:start position:0%
that we have and both of them uh deserve
 
04:04:41.349 --> 04:04:41.359 align:start position:0%

motion I would like to uh uh defer over
 
04:06:32.630 --> 04:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
to representative herf who has an
 
04:06:34.590 --> 04:06:34.600 align:start position:0%
amendment and I think that will redirect
 
04:06:36.830 --> 04:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
our conversation okay and I'll ask uh
 
04:06:38.590 --> 04:06:38.600 align:start position:0%
represent McGuire first though because
 
04:06:41.189 --> 04:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
he made the second uh do you care to
 
04:06:44.030 --> 04:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
speak to it um
 
04:06:47.750 --> 04:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
well I I find this bill very
 
04:06:50.389 --> 04:06:50.399 align:start position:0%
attractive um
 
04:06:55.429 --> 04:06:55.439 align:start position:0%
because I I am strongly in favor of the
 
04:06:59.070 --> 04:06:59.080 align:start position:0%
Rand decision and this um like the bill
 
04:07:03.990 --> 04:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
we had earlier um it corresponds to that
 
04:07:04.000 --> 04:07:07.030 align:start position:0%
we had earlier um it corresponds to that
um

04:07:07.030 --> 04:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:12.189 --> 04:07:12.199 align:start position:0%
and but I also think that we need this
 
04:07:16.510 --> 04:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
um this limit on on spending of schools
 
04:07:21.030 --> 04:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
I mean in in my town um when I moved
 
04:07:27.950 --> 04:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
there 17 years ago 18 um it uh our our
 
04:07:31.990 --> 04:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
mill rate was um
 
04:07:36.830 --> 04:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
maybe1 15 $16 and now it's $10 more you
 
04:07:39.630 --> 04:07:39.640 align:start position:0%
know and and it it feels like it hasn't
 
04:07:42.710 --> 04:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
been the town it's been the school so we
 
04:07:45.710 --> 04:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
need some rols on spending and this
 
04:07:47.389 --> 04:07:47.399 align:start position:0%
would give us
 
04:07:51.670 --> 04:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
them okay uh represent you're recognized
 
04:07:54.750 --> 04:07:54.760 align:start position:0%

amendment it's pretty easy to explain it
 
04:08:31.109 --> 04:08:31.119 align:start position:0%
is picking off section
 
04:08:35.630 --> 04:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
three from the original Bill and only
 
04:08:38.790 --> 04:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
section three and this is the component
 
04:08:42.189 --> 04:08:42.199 align:start position:0%
that restricts the growth of a school
 
04:08:47.269 --> 04:08:47.279 align:start position:0%

04:08:59.830 --> 04:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
okay further discussion just a clarify
 
04:09:02.710 --> 04:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
that means starting on line 26 on the
 
04:09:04.309 --> 04:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
first page and carrying to the second
 
04:09:04.319 --> 04:09:09.149 align:start position:0%
first page and carrying to the second
page

04:09:09.149 --> 04:09:09.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:11.830 --> 04:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
yeah the uh I should make one
 
04:09:14.510 --> 04:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
modification of what I said
 
04:09:17.510 --> 04:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
it does make one change in that section
 
04:09:20.070 --> 04:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
that section refers to time the original
 
04:09:22.550 --> 04:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
section refers to time frames of three
 
04:09:24.710 --> 04:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
years and there are four places where
 
04:09:26.070 --> 04:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
that was that where that reference
 
04:09:28.149 --> 04:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
occurs and in the amendment that has
 
04:09:30.510 --> 04:09:30.520 align:start position:0%
been changed to five years okay that's
 
04:09:31.870 --> 04:09:31.880 align:start position:0%

original bill in section three has a
 
04:09:43.550 --> 04:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
number of references to time frames
 
04:09:45.070 --> 04:09:45.080 align:start position:0%
three years there's actually four
 
04:09:47.309 --> 04:09:47.319 align:start position:0%
references in there for that three-year
 
04:09:49.429 --> 04:09:49.439 align:start position:0%

04:10:26.630 --> 04:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
are trying to accomplish uh here but um
 
04:10:29.070 --> 04:10:29.080 align:start position:0%
but I think this is a number one a a
 
04:10:33.030 --> 04:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
really dangerous methodology to to
 
04:10:36.109 --> 04:10:36.119 align:start position:0%
essentially lock in place a school
 
04:10:40.710 --> 04:10:40.720 align:start position:0%
district's um um uh per pupil budget and
 
04:10:43.429 --> 04:10:43.439 align:start position:0%
and let me explain why that is a lot of
 
04:10:46.149 --> 04:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
it has to do with with the way the state
 
04:10:48.510 --> 04:10:48.520 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire has um has been funding
 
04:10:51.550 --> 04:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
its public schools and um some of it is
 
04:10:54.269 --> 04:10:54.279 align:start position:0%
actually because of of the way the um
 
04:10:56.229 --> 04:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
the Statewide education property tax
 
04:10:59.910 --> 04:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
works as well but um but in the very
 
04:11:02.790 --> 04:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
quickly in the nutshell um New
 
04:11:05.950 --> 04:11:05.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's per pupil cost by District
 
04:11:09.149 --> 04:11:09.159 align:start position:0%
range from a low of $177,000 per pupil
 
04:11:11.550 --> 04:11:11.560 align:start position:0%
in Manchester to a high of
 
04:11:15.870 --> 04:11:15.880 align:start position:0%
$44,000 per pupil in um in Newcastle so
 
04:11:17.830 --> 04:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
by passing something like this what
 
04:11:20.550 --> 04:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
we're saying is you know what Newcastle
 
04:11:21.990 --> 04:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
you know what Waterville Valley you know
 
04:11:25.229 --> 04:11:25.239 align:start position:0%
what Bartlett you know what Littleton
 
04:11:27.910 --> 04:11:27.920 align:start position:0%
you know what
 
04:11:30.630 --> 04:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
um you know what you can do you can you
 
04:11:33.349 --> 04:11:33.359 align:start position:0%
can keep putting on a super strong
 
04:11:35.870 --> 04:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
educational program uh because you've
 
04:11:38.630 --> 04:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
always had that that program funded in
 
04:11:41.070 --> 04:11:41.080 align:start position:0%
your budget a lot of the reason because
 
04:11:42.670 --> 04:11:42.680 align:start position:0%
of the way the Statewide education
 
04:11:44.670 --> 04:11:44.680 align:start position:0%
property tax is collected and how the
 
04:11:47.550 --> 04:11:47.560 align:start position:0%
excess is retained locally so Newcastle
 
04:11:49.750 --> 04:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
this is great you can you can keep that
 
04:11:51.309 --> 04:11:51.319 align:start position:0%
up but
 
04:11:53.990 --> 04:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester Newport
 
04:11:57.590 --> 04:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
Pittsfield Berlin Claremont towns that
 
04:12:01.030 --> 04:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
have struggled to find the resources
 
04:12:04.790 --> 04:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
necessary to have a a competitive budget
 
04:12:06.790 --> 04:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
competitive for hiring teachers
 
04:12:09.550 --> 04:12:09.560 align:start position:0%
competitive for hiring staff compe
 
04:12:11.870 --> 04:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
competitive to attract families to move
 
04:12:14.349 --> 04:12:14.359 align:start position:0%
into um IND their communities
 
04:12:16.590 --> 04:12:16.600 align:start position:0%
competitive so that the students have
 
04:12:18.590 --> 04:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
access to the program of studies
 
04:12:20.670 --> 04:12:20.680 align:start position:0%
necessary so they can be competitive out
 
04:12:23.750 --> 04:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
in a worldwide Global Marketplace it
 
04:12:27.309 --> 04:12:27.319 align:start position:0%
basically locks these communities and
 
04:12:30.910 --> 04:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
and Ian we we all know who they are on
 
04:12:32.670 --> 04:12:32.680 align:start position:0%
you know when we you know when we talk
 
04:12:34.950 --> 04:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
about them Manchester Newport Pittsfield
 
04:12:37.750 --> 04:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
Claremont Berlin um and there's a lot of
 
04:12:40.790 --> 04:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
others around the the the state too so
 
04:12:43.389 --> 04:12:43.399 align:start position:0%
and you can look up their per pupil
 
04:12:46.750 --> 04:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
expenses $177,000 for Manchester I can
 
04:12:50.910 --> 04:12:50.920 align:start position:0%
go right right down at here uh uh 20,000
 
04:12:55.429 --> 04:12:55.439 align:start position:0%
for where 21,000 for uh West Morland um
 
04:12:58.910 --> 04:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
16,000 for for Windam so it may actually
 
04:13:03.030 --> 04:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
have the um the the low um the low point
 
04:13:08.830 --> 04:13:08.840 align:start position:0%
on there but but it it locks in place um
 
04:13:13.109 --> 04:13:13.119 align:start position:0%
uh these these budgets with huge OPP
 
04:13:15.990 --> 04:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity gaps for students and I
 
04:13:19.349 --> 04:13:19.359 align:start position:0%
think if we're going to pick a time to
 
04:13:23.510 --> 04:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
to put in a a Statewide mandated budget
 
04:13:25.870 --> 04:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
cap we wouldn't want to do it when we've
 
04:13:30.429 --> 04:13:30.439 align:start position:0%
got so such um inequitable um you know
 
04:13:32.630 --> 04:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
funding in place right now I think we'd
 
04:13:35.189 --> 04:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
want to fix the funding have Equitable
 
04:13:37.229 --> 04:13:37.239 align:start position:0%
school funding and then we can talk
 
04:13:40.750 --> 04:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
about um um you know a budget cap but
 
04:13:43.349 --> 04:13:43.359 align:start position:0%
right now this locks in those inequities
 
04:13:45.910 --> 04:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
and uh and I I can't support the bill
 
04:13:47.269 --> 04:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
and I certainly can't support the
 
04:13:49.429 --> 04:13:49.439 align:start position:0%
amendment further
 
04:13:52.950 --> 04:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
discussion represent papich thank you Mr
 
04:13:54.830 --> 04:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
chair I shall be very
 
04:13:57.590 --> 04:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
brief I just wanted to point out for the
 
04:14:00.790 --> 04:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
record that under uh Roman the Roman
 
04:14:04.990 --> 04:14:05.000 align:start position:0%
numeral 4 letter B There is a mechanism
 
04:14:07.269 --> 04:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
to allow the exceeding of this cap
 
04:14:09.590 --> 04:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
through a 2/3 majority vote which is a
 
04:14:12.830 --> 04:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
high threshold to clear of course but it
 
04:14:15.030 --> 04:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
is meant to be a high threshold to clear
 
04:14:17.229 --> 04:14:17.239 align:start position:0%
and as a former School Board member in
 
04:14:20.670 --> 04:14:20.680 align:start position:0%
wiam when we struggled for over a decade
 
04:14:22.710 --> 04:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
to pass a construction
 
04:14:25.269 --> 04:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
project we learned from our mistakes and
 
04:14:27.630 --> 04:14:27.640 align:start position:0%
we managed to get the 60% that we needed
 
04:14:30.750 --> 04:14:30.760 align:start position:0%
deposit after a lot of work it's not
 
04:14:33.550 --> 04:14:33.560 align:start position:0%
locking it is making it harder to keep
 
04:14:36.750 --> 04:14:36.760 align:start position:0%
inflate B budgets absolutely but there
 
04:14:38.950 --> 04:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
are ways for people who want to catch up
 
04:14:42.189 --> 04:14:42.199 align:start position:0%
who get the support of their you know uh
 
04:14:50.030 --> 04:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:53.830 --> 04:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
you representative Damon thank you Mr
 
04:14:56.389 --> 04:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
chair I share representative Luna's
 
04:14:58.710 --> 04:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
grave concerns about this bill and I
 
04:15:03.990 --> 04:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
think the recognition that there is a
 
04:15:06.710 --> 04:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
2third majority vote to overturn the
 
04:15:06.720 --> 04:15:07.750 align:start position:0%
2third majority vote to overturn the
budget

04:15:07.750 --> 04:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:15:11.109 --> 04:15:11.119 align:start position:0%
cap is essentially a nons
 
04:15:13.950 --> 04:15:13.960 align:start position:0%
solution the towns that I represent and
 
04:15:15.790 --> 04:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
many others throughout the
 
04:15:19.830 --> 04:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
state that are the have not towns and
 
04:15:22.790 --> 04:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
currently have these inequitably low
 
04:15:25.670 --> 04:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
School budgets they barely managed to
 
04:15:27.550 --> 04:15:27.560 align:start position:0%
get a majority vote to pass their
 
04:15:30.229 --> 04:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
existing school budget now the idea that
 
04:15:32.950 --> 04:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
they would get a two-thirds vote to
 
04:15:36.630 --> 04:15:36.640 align:start position:0%
overcome a cap is completely unrealistic
 
04:15:38.429 --> 04:15:38.439 align:start position:0%
so they would be stuck with this cap
 
04:15:40.070 --> 04:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
they would be forever the have not
 
04:15:43.950 --> 04:15:43.960 align:start position:0%
school districts it's not reasonable at
 
04:15:49.670 --> 04:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:53.670 --> 04:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
Ames well no surprise I concur with my
 
04:15:56.950 --> 04:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
colleagues to my right here uh to my
 
04:16:00.630 --> 04:16:00.640 align:start position:0%
right right oh okay
 
04:16:04.429 --> 04:16:04.439 align:start position:0%
uh sure your right not your left I'm all
 
04:16:08.109 --> 04:16:08.119 align:start position:0%
mixed up today yeah after this after the
 
04:16:11.349 --> 04:16:11.359 align:start position:0%
discussions today on you know whatever
 
04:16:14.590 --> 04:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
anyway uh yeah yeah this is uh this is
 
04:16:18.710 --> 04:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
serious stuff and we're uh we we know
 
04:16:21.109 --> 04:16:21.119 align:start position:0%
that uh litigation
 
04:16:24.269 --> 04:16:24.279 align:start position:0%
is uh come and gone and right now we're
 
04:16:26.790 --> 04:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
a mesh in two cases we're waiting for
 
04:16:29.710 --> 04:16:29.720 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court to speak and uh they
 
04:16:33.309 --> 04:16:33.319 align:start position:0%
all derive from inequity from a sense of
 
04:16:36.070 --> 04:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh lack of fairness in the system that
 
04:16:44.109 --> 04:16:44.119 align:start position:0%
we have and th that sense of uh of uh
 
04:16:47.630 --> 04:16:47.640 align:start position:0%
this whole system not being fair has
 
04:16:51.070 --> 04:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
fueled these lawsuits we feel it in our
 
04:16:54.870 --> 04:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
our work uh seeking reelection we feel
 
04:16:58.149 --> 04:16:58.159 align:start position:0%
it in the letters that we all receive
 
04:17:00.229 --> 04:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:17:05.510 --> 04:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
to take a a turn now and put in the way
 
04:17:09.429 --> 04:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
of Reform a barrier yes the barrier can
 
04:17:13.269 --> 04:17:13.279 align:start position:0%
theoretically be overcome but in most
 
04:17:16.750 --> 04:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
places it will not be uh just because a
 
04:17:20.630 --> 04:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
2/3 threshold is really hard to get over
 
04:17:22.790 --> 04:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
and uh I don't think it's the right
 
04:17:24.510 --> 04:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
thing to do
 
04:17:27.950 --> 04:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
I there may be a time for this but it's
 
04:17:30.870 --> 04:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
after we do the work that uh we're
 
04:17:32.710 --> 04:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
facing right now we've got all these
 
04:17:34.870 --> 04:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
bills that have been come to us we've
 
04:17:37.750 --> 04:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
just managed to go through them and sort
 
04:17:41.070 --> 04:17:41.080 align:start position:0%
them out and that's good but uh we've
 
04:17:43.710 --> 04:17:43.720 align:start position:0%
got more work to to do
 
04:17:45.670 --> 04:17:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh this is a difficult budget year
 
04:17:48.469 --> 04:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
because of the uh drop in revenues and
 
04:17:50.950 --> 04:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
so we may not be able to do all that we
 
04:17:53.990 --> 04:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
want to do let's uh give this some time
 
04:17:56.510 --> 04:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
before we uh lock the door so to speak
 
04:18:01.469 --> 04:18:01.479 align:start position:0%
and and uh and freeze in the current
 
04:18:04.149 --> 04:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
inequities so that's I I'm definitely
 
04:18:07.830 --> 04:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
opposed to this thank you repr
 
04:18:10.670 --> 04:18:10.680 align:start position:0%
mean thank you Mr chairman I have I have
 
04:18:12.790 --> 04:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
some concerns with this too are we
 
04:18:17.590 --> 04:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
talking about capping the the the the
 
04:18:20.149 --> 04:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
taxes into town they say they can only
 
04:18:23.469 --> 04:18:23.479 align:start position:0%
tax this much increase this much and no
 
04:18:25.830 --> 04:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
more be the reason that I'm asking that
 
04:18:29.070 --> 04:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
question is when the town of penut hit
 
04:18:32.309 --> 04:18:32.319 align:start position:0%
with a 28% increase this year and last
 
04:18:34.469 --> 04:18:34.479 align:start position:0%
year on special ed they're not going to
 
04:18:36.990 --> 04:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
be able to cap the way that we're
 
04:18:39.070 --> 04:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
requiring them to cap there's no cap on
 
04:18:42.389 --> 04:18:42.399 align:start position:0%
the special budget there's no cap on the
 
04:18:46.149 --> 04:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
incre in the in the
 
04:18:49.109 --> 04:18:49.119 align:start position:0%
demand F disc ref
 
04:18:52.790 --> 04:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
fellows so one reason I can't support
 
04:18:57.269 --> 04:18:57.279 align:start position:0%
this bill is that um the appropriation
 
04:18:59.429 --> 04:18:59.439 align:start position:0%
that's made by a school district is an
 
04:19:02.189 --> 04:19:02.199 align:start position:0%
appropriation of re that spends revenues
 
04:19:06.389 --> 04:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
from all the sources so in essence if if
 
04:19:10.309 --> 04:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
this were in effect if the towns if if
 
04:19:12.710 --> 04:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
the state decided to give the towns more
 
04:19:14.750 --> 04:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
more money for their school districts or
 
04:19:17.030 --> 04:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
there was a Federal grant that gave more
 
04:19:18.990 --> 04:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
money to their school districts this
 
04:19:20.990 --> 04:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
could keep them from spending that that
 
04:19:24.510 --> 04:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
extra money because it's this is not
 
04:19:26.830 --> 04:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
capping what is raised from property
 
04:19:29.630 --> 04:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
taxes this is capping the appropriation
 
04:19:31.790 --> 04:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
which is the total
 
04:19:35.670 --> 04:19:35.680 align:start position:0%
budget and the other reason that I can't
 
04:19:38.389 --> 04:19:38.399 align:start position:0%
support it is if a town wants a property
 
04:19:41.469 --> 04:19:41.479 align:start position:0%
tax cap or a budget cap they they can do
 
04:19:43.469 --> 04:19:43.479 align:start position:0%
that there are statutes that enable them
 
04:19:45.750 --> 04:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
to do that it's not our business at the
 
04:19:48.710 --> 04:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
state level to be meddling how towns and
 
04:19:51.149 --> 04:19:51.159 align:start position:0%
cities manage their
 
04:19:53.830 --> 04:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
budgets thank you represent
 
04:19:58.510 --> 04:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
