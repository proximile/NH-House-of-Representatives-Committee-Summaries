good morning this is um environment
 
00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 align:start position:0%
agriculture committee and I would like
 
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 align:start position:0%
and I would request representative
 
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 align:start position:0%

all good morning
everyone

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 align:start position:0%
we're in we took a fi trip today we're
 
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
room on today's docket at 10 o'clock we
 
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 align:start position:0%
are working uh doing a um committee work
 
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
session to just sort of have a little
 
00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 align:start position:0%
discussion about um four bills that
 
00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.270 align:start position:0%
discussion about um four bills that
we've

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 align:start position:0%
we've
 
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 align:start position:0%
heard representative dsy please right
 
00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
there there you
 
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.030 align:start position:0%
there there you
go

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh so we have four bills that we're
 
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
going to uh just briefly
 
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.070 align:start position:0%
going to uh just briefly
discuss

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 align:start position:0%
um the first one is HB 1386 relative to
 
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the disposal of lithium ion
 
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 align:start position:0%
batteries in solid waste fac landfill
 
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 align:start position:0%
facilities composting facilities or
 
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 align:start position:0%
incinerators and um I just wanted to get
 
00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 align:start position:0%
a quick read from the committee members
 
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
who are here I know we have a a few who
 
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
will be absent today and um to who will
 
00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
be late but I I just wanted to get a
 
00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 align:start position:0%
quick read from our committee um
 
00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
regarding that bill I know
 
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
representative eel introduced the bill
 
00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:52.439 align:start position:0%
and also um had presented uh an
 
00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
amendment to that bill having to do with
 
00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
um noticing that um if if something gets
 
00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
thrown into the squash or into the
 
00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 align:start position:0%
incinerator or some other place in a
 
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 align:start position:0%
landfill by accident that there would be
 
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 align:start position:0%
uh you know they would be held harmless
 
00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
for um an inadvertent
 
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 align:start position:0%
action and um I just wanted to get an um
 
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
feedback from the committee on um on
 
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
this bill what you think if it needs any
 
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
other further amendments representative
 
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
Bixby yeah so um I think that the the
 
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 align:start position:0%
bill with the suggested amendment makes
 
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
sense and we had had some discussion
 
00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
about uh adding lithium batteries as
 
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 align:start position:0%
well as lithium ion batteries to that
 
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 align:start position:0%
and uh we got an email from uh
 
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 align:start position:0%
representative eel last night uh
 
00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 align:start position:0%
indicating that uh they're are
 
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
forwarding something from the uh
 
00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199 align:start position:0%
Northeast um the nrra I however that
 
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
comes out in uh so um suggesting that
 
00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 align:start position:0%
that might actually complicate things uh
 
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
because of the um in in terms of
 
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 align:start position:0%
educating people about how to separate
 
00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.199 align:start position:0%
the different items um I I think that it
 
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
makes sense you to um probably not go
 
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 align:start position:0%
into not adding the lithium because um
 
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
um I I think that you know people still
 
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
do sometimes separate out the lithium
 
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 align:start position:0%
batteries but I think that which is good
 
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
but it's um but I think that for the
 
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 align:start position:0%
purposes of this bill the bigger danger
 
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
is the lithium ion batteries because
 
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 align:start position:0%
they're more reactive I would agree
 
00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 align:start position:0%
thank you any other comment
 
00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:42.309 align:start position:0%
thank you any other comment
representative

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 align:start position:0%
Duty yeah correct me if I'm wrong but
 
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
when I went over the bill I noticed
 
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
there's an education piece but I didn't
 
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
notice a piece for collection so you
 
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
know I mean so I may be educated about
 
00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
not putting lithium ion batteries into
 
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
the waist stream but but you know is
 
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
there anything in this spill and I
 
00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:06.199 align:start position:0%
didn't see it uh for collection
 
00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479 align:start position:0%
sites I see the sponsor shaking her head
 
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 align:start position:0%
um I I did catch the uh testimony from
 
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
nhma n Hamshire Municipal Association
 
00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 align:start position:0%
who said that um many of the collection
 
00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 align:start position:0%
sites transfer stations already separate
 
00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
these things out and so they're okay
 
00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:38.919 align:start position:0%
with it with the bill as it
 
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
is represent Murray correct me if I'm
 
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:43.880 align:start position:0%
wrong uh as far as the educational piece
 
00:06:46.589 --> 00:06:46.599 align:start position:0%
too I know that education can also be
 
00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
defined as signage or those types of
 
00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
things that that's an educational
 
00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
component to the public and I think
 
00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:54.919 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion around uh
 
00:06:57.469 --> 00:06:57.479 align:start position:0%
third party entities that would be open
 
00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:00.520 align:start position:0%
to helping out with that M um through
 
00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
other organizations to help transfer
 
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:05.240 align:start position:0%
stations educate the public on what's
 
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
disposable and what should be kept out
 
00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:10.479 align:start position:0%
right and I also am aware that U Dees
 
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
has on their website also information
 
00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:16.639 align:start position:0%
about how to recycle certain things so
 
00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:18.759 align:start position:0%
yeah I think I think that that's going
 
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
to start filtering down and filtering
 
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
out to to the public so representative
 
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
gron uh yes ma'am I I support the bill
 
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
as amended
 
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
um the one thing that I was concerned
 
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
about was the addition of the lithium
 
00:07:37.469 --> 00:07:37.479 align:start position:0%
batteries but the word we got back to
 
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
add to representative bixby's comment
 
00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
was that they those are not a fire risk
 
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
um nearly as much as the other ones are
 
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.120 align:start position:0%
and so I'm I'm perfectly fine not adding
 
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
that in and going with the bill as
 
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:53.080 align:start position:0%
amended over okay represent
 
00:07:58.029 --> 00:07:58.039 align:start position:0%
kto thank you madam chair and I think uh
 
00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:00.639 align:start position:0%
being aware of lithon and ion and the
 
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:03.800 align:start position:0%
fire has it is extremely important um
 
00:08:05.589 --> 00:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
and I understand why they should not be
 
00:08:05.599 --> 00:08:06.270 align:start position:0%
and I understand why they should not be
in

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:06.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
landfills but my question is is what is
 
00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
the industry that is putting these
 
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:15.560 align:start position:0%
lithium ion batteries into the products
 
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
um are they looking for Alternatives and
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
other ways to uh because if these if
 
00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
people do not recycle these and we
 
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
continue because we pass this and say
 
00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
that they cannot be put in there doesn't
 
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
mean that the occasional one or few are
 
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
not going to be put in there and we're
 
00:08:39.389 --> 00:08:39.399 align:start position:0%
going to still end up having um these
 
00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:44.039 align:start position:0%
fires which are horrid um so is the
 
00:08:46.509 --> 00:08:46.519 align:start position:0%
industry looking for alternative energy
 
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
sources to get away from the lithium
 
00:08:51.509 --> 00:08:51.519 align:start position:0%
batteries ion batteries is my
 
00:08:53.829 --> 00:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
question I don't really know the answer
 
00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:57.800 align:start position:0%
to that um but I would hope that they
 
00:08:59.350 --> 00:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
would also put something on their
 
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:02.200 align:start position:0%
packaging to indicate that um there the
 
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:03.640 align:start position:0%
the batteries that are contained in
 
00:09:05.829 --> 00:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
there could are flammable yeah
 
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah I think that
 
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh the industry is
 
00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:13.519 align:start position:0%
um well there there are two things one
 
00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:16.399 align:start position:0%
is that there are uh there's Research
 
00:09:19.069 --> 00:09:19.079 align:start position:0%
into alternatives to lithiumion
 
00:09:21.389 --> 00:09:21.399 align:start position:0%
batteries I don't think
 
00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:24.440 align:start position:0%
that the there's going to be a rapid
 
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:27.640 align:start position:0%
change in the use of them because uh
 
00:09:30.829 --> 00:09:30.839 align:start position:0%
they are at this point a an established
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
technology that is known to work uh the
 
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
they if you look at when you get a
 
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
computer when you get a um a tablet when
 
00:09:42.269 --> 00:09:42.279 align:start position:0%
you get a uh a tool with a re
 
00:09:43.949 --> 00:09:43.959 align:start position:0%
rechargeable battery on it if you look
 
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
at it you see that it you says you know
 
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
recycle this properly don't you know
 
00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
don't landfill it uh so there and um
 
00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:57.160 align:start position:0%
places like Home Depot and flows have
 
00:09:59.910 --> 00:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
bins outside saying put lithium ion
 
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
batteries here uh so there
 
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:07.720 align:start position:0%
are there are uh efforts from the
 
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
industry to um make people aware of it I
 
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:15.880 align:start position:0%
think that if those efforts are then uh
 
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh Amplified by what we have by
 
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
education at the municipal level and at
 
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:23.800 align:start position:0%
the um the land you know the transfer
 
00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:32.200 align:start position:0%
help okay um representative
 
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you madam chair I could you
 
00:10:37.389 --> 00:10:37.399 align:start position:0%
could you remind me of the amendment
 
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:48.509 --> 00:10:48.519 align:start position:0%
1396 so this
 
00:10:48.519 --> 00:10:50.870 align:start position:0%
1396 so this
amendment

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
um is amendment 2024 d49
 
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:04.389 --> 00:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
basically um prohibits the disposal of
 
00:11:06.069 --> 00:11:06.079 align:start position:0%
wet cell and lithium ion batteries and
 
00:11:07.949 --> 00:11:07.959 align:start position:0%
electronic devices in any Solid Waste
 
00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:09.839 align:start position:0%
landfill facility or incinerator in New
 
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the amendment requires towns
 
00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste districts and owners
 
00:11:16.269 --> 00:11:16.279 align:start position:0%
operators of landfills and incinerators
 
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
to make educational materials available
 
00:11:21.069 --> 00:11:21.079 align:start position:0%
on the prohibition but it
 
00:11:21.079 --> 00:11:22.750 align:start position:0%
on the prohibition but it
also

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:27.160 align:start position:0%
um says that
 
00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:29.839 align:start position:0%
um that
 
00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:33.800 align:start position:0%
the these if any of these lithium ion
 
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
batteries do get put into the squash or
 
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
end up in the landfill that it's the the
 
00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:43.720 align:start position:0%
people doing that are not held liable
 
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
for that because they make people make
 
00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
know all right I think um I think we're
 
00:11:56.829 --> 00:11:56.839 align:start position:0%
okay then with with this amendment and
 
00:11:59.430 --> 00:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
probably not going to be adding in
 
00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
lithium batteries that might be
 
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
something for future legislation if we
 
00:12:08.069 --> 00:12:08.079 align:start position:0%
consider that I'm going to move on to HB
 
00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
1376 relative to prohibiting certain
 
00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
packaging from carrying the recycling
 
00:12:16.269 --> 00:12:16.279 align:start position:0%
logo anybody care to lend a comment
 
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
Bill not representative Bixby so um I I
 
00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
recognize that there's a feeling of
 
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
deception when uh you hear news reports
 
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
that things with the recycling logo
 
00:12:39.629 --> 00:12:39.639 align:start position:0%
aren't getting recycled but I think that
 
00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:42.680 align:start position:0%
the utility of those recycling logos far
 
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:46.360 align:start position:0%
outweighs the uh the perception of De of
 
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:50.360 align:start position:0%
deception so uh at our trans at transfer
 
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
stations all across the state people are
 
00:12:55.629 --> 00:12:55.639 align:start position:0%
encouraged to put their number ones in
 
00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:57.240 align:start position:0%
one container their number twos in
 
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
another container uh and so forth and
 
00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
you might not be able to put your number
 
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
seven some in a container but the fact
 
00:13:05.949 --> 00:13:05.959 align:start position:0%
that you can put the number one in your
 
00:13:08.269 --> 00:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
contain in that container means that
 
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
your municipality can uh get money for
 
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
those number ones uh and instead of
 
00:13:18.069 --> 00:13:18.079 align:start position:0%
having to pay a tipping fee on it if
 
00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
your municipality can get a A reduced
 
00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:23.800 align:start position:0%
cost disposal for the number twos
 
00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:26.360 align:start position:0%
instead of paying a larger tipping fee
 
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
and in some cases the same thing with
 
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
number five
 
00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
so the ability to sort that is an
 
00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
important Financial uh factor for
 
00:13:39.189 --> 00:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
municipal transfer stations uh it's not
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
as it's not a big it doesn't come into
 
00:13:44.189 --> 00:13:44.199 align:start position:0%
play when you have a a single sort
 
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
operation uh like some of our our larger
 
00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:48.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities have but it's really
 
00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
critical for our smaller municipalities
 
00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
that have transport stations to have
 
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
those logo logos to help people figure
 
00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
out where to put the the different types
 
00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
of plastic so I think this is I don't
 
00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:02.120 align:start position:0%
think this bill makes sense
 
00:14:05.629 --> 00:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
representative K thank you madam chair
 
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
um I will concur with uh representative
 
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
Bixby that I don't believe that this
 
00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
bill makes sense I think if you were
 
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
going to do something like this it would
 
00:14:15.509 --> 00:14:15.519 align:start position:0%
basically have to be done on the federal
 
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
level and I actually think that having a
 
00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:20.680 align:start position:0%
logo even though some of them may not be
 
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:23.240 align:start position:0%
as accurate as they should be we are
 
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
educating the consumer to look for them
 
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
um and therefore guiding them towards
 
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
the numbers also associated with those
 
00:14:33.069 --> 00:14:33.079 align:start position:0%
packaging um and to me that's
 
00:14:36.269 --> 00:14:36.279 align:start position:0%
educational um when it comes to
 
00:14:39.189 --> 00:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
recycling anyone else representative
 
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:42.680 align:start position:0%
Duty um yes thank you madam chair um yes
 
00:14:46.629 --> 00:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
I I agree with uh the previous comments
 
00:14:49.069 --> 00:14:49.079 align:start position:0%
uh when I read this bill I I would
 
00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:52.360 align:start position:0%
actually like to see um a different form
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
of this bill and and that is one kind of
 
00:14:59.350 --> 00:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
like that oversight by exception so that
 
00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:03.560 align:start position:0%
when when it appears that a company is
 
00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
deceptively labeling their product like
 
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
I mentioned about my bird seed
 
00:15:12.749 --> 00:15:12.759 align:start position:0%
containers okay that you know perhaps we
 
00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:16.759 align:start position:0%
have an an oversight agency the dees who
 
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
contacts the company or we have a law
 
00:15:21.949 --> 00:15:21.959 align:start position:0%
that makes it clear if you choose to put
 
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
a recycling logo on your product okay
 
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
that you are then responsible for
 
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
ensuring that that product can be
 
00:15:34.629 --> 00:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
recycled somewhere in that state okay
 
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that I don't think
 
00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
there would be a lot of complaints uh
 
00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:41.800 align:start position:0%
but I think companies should be held
 
00:15:45.389 --> 00:15:45.399 align:start position:0%
accountable when there's the appearance
 
00:15:48.749 --> 00:15:48.759 align:start position:0%
of recycling and yet you contact them
 
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
and there's nowhere to recycle it so so
 
00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
I would agree that I I do think this
 
00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
bill is something that should be done at
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
the federal level um but but that we
 
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
might want to look at something like
 
00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
that by exception next year okay thank
 
00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:08.519 align:start position:0%
you thank you okay represent ger thank
 
00:16:10.749 --> 00:16:10.759 align:start position:0%
you madam chair uh I agree with a lot of
 
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
what's been said and and as with a lot
 
00:16:16.949 --> 00:16:16.959 align:start position:0%
of the labeling bills that we get uh
 
00:16:20.269 --> 00:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
even when they are good ideas at at root
 
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
there's the larger problem of you know
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
one small state can't really dictate
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
kind of how companies label their their
 
00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:29.720 align:start position:0%
products uh will only say that I think
 
00:16:30.829 --> 00:16:30.839 align:start position:0%
that one of the arguments that
 
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan made which I think
 
00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
was a compelling one is that this would
 
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
give the Attorney General's office an
 
00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:40.600 align:start position:0%
instrument right it it doesn't mean that
 
00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
there has to be
 
00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
um you know rigorous enforcement but it
 
00:16:47.629 --> 00:16:47.639 align:start position:0%
does give the Attorney General's uh
 
00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:50.680 align:start position:0%
office a tool that they could use in
 
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
cases like representative Duty referred
 
00:16:55.749 --> 00:16:55.759 align:start position:0%
to to then write a letter to companies
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
and say look this law exists and it is
 
00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
unlawful in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
to provide this type of misinformation
 
00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
so I I understand and I agree with the
 
00:17:06.669 --> 00:17:06.679 align:start position:0%
direction that that we seem to be headed
 
00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
in but I do want to point out that I
 
00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919 align:start position:0%
think that was a good argument the
 
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan made about how a
 
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
law like this could be used thank you
 
00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.189 align:start position:0%
law like this could be used thank you
thank

00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:19.720 align:start position:0%
you all right why don't we um move on to
 
00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.029 align:start position:0%
you all right why don't we um move on to
HB

00:17:21.029 --> 00:17:21.039 align:start position:0%
HB
 
00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
1681 relative to the products labeled as
 
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
biodegradable or
 
00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:29.559 align:start position:0%
compostable and um I believe um
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative parshall who introduced
 
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
the bill he also brought with him some
 
00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
ideas for an amendment which would have
 
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
placed um the language in Commerce law
 
00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
and what I've been
 
00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.870 align:start position:0%
and what I've been
um

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
in educated about by our house clerk is
 
00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
that um we can't adopt an amendment that
 
00:17:59.710 --> 00:17:59.720 align:start position:0%
would Place uh this bill in a section of
 
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
law that we have no purview over so it
 
00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
seems to me that um and when I've had
 
00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
discussions with representative parall
 
00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
as well uh that he he has been advised
 
00:18:17.549 --> 00:18:17.559 align:start position:0%
to speak to the chair uh and ranking
 
00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
member and folks over at the Commerce uh
 
00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
committee to see if there's a bill that
 
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
his language can be placed in as an
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
amendment um baring that it's his
 
00:18:33.669 --> 00:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
language could be brought up to a a new
 
00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
bill next year um and with that I
 
00:18:39.549 --> 00:18:39.559 align:start position:0%
believe that we would have to itl the
 
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
bill as it is now and have him uh pursue
 
00:18:46.909 --> 00:18:46.919 align:start position:0%
that that Avenue representative Bixby
 
00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
yeah I'd like
 
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
to I'd like to thank our chair for
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
having contacted the clerk to
 
00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
determine what uh the rules are
 
00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
regarding uh
 
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
amending amending bills that would end
 
00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
up in a different committee's perview
 
00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:07.720 align:start position:0%
and I think that uh I I like the concept
 
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:09.640 align:start position:0%
of this bill I think that there need
 
00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
there need to be a few tweaks to it but
 
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
uh if if this committee can't uh by
 
00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
house rules put the right Amendment on
 
00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
the bill I think what we have to do is
 
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
uh move an itl on it and hope that
 
00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
there's some Bill that it could be added
 
00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:29.480 align:start position:0%
to in Commerce
 
00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
and if that doesn't work then try again
 
00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:34.280 align:start position:0%
next year or even maybe the Senate he
 
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
could approach a senator and put it on a
 
00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:38.360 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.669 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
too

00:19:40.669 --> 00:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:19:44.669 --> 00:19:44.679 align:start position:0%
okay all right and that leaves um HB oh
 
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative ger I missed
 
00:19:49.549 --> 00:19:49.559 align:start position:0%
you that's thank you very much wave your
 
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
arms uh I just as as a co-sponsor on
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
this bill as well I wanted to to agree
 
00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:57.400 align:start position:0%
that I I think that the section of the
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
law that represents Senator parshall is
 
00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:01.480 align:start position:0%
suggesting in his amendment makes sense
 
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
and I also appreciate the the work
 
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
you've done Madam chair and and seeing
 
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
what the possibilities are and that
 
00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:09.640 align:start position:0%
definitely those options make sense you
 
00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:11.480 align:start position:0%
know a bill that's in Commerce or a
 
00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:13.919 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill uh but it's probably not
 
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
something we can do anything about thank
 
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
you thank you all
 
00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
right okay so that leaves HB 154
 
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
relative to architectural paint
 
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:33.640 align:start position:0%
we have a um any comment about that
 
00:20:36.149 --> 00:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
representative Duty thank you madam
 
00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
chair um some other information has has
 
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
come to light and I want to thank our
 
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
researcher uh Kristen Grant uh for all
 
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
the information she provided so if
 
00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:50.200 align:start position:0%
you'll indulge me just a little bit um I
 
00:20:54.029 --> 00:20:54.039 align:start position:0%
W I had I had received um model
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
legislation from the American codings
 
00:20:59.870 --> 00:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
Association and the American codings
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
Association uh works with all paint
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and has all paint
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
manufacturers signed up for the um
 
00:21:12.029 --> 00:21:12.039 align:start position:0%
recycling of paint and they work through
 
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
an organization that was mentioned last
 
00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:18.440 align:start position:0%
week paint care okay um so I read the
 
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
bill that was presented to the committee
 
00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:23.400 align:start position:0%
in 2020 when I was a freshman I think a
 
00:21:26.149 --> 00:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
few others of us were freshman uh Bill
 
00:21:30.029 --> 00:21:30.039 align:start position:0%
HB 1570 and I said wow this bill sounds
 
00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:32.360 align:start position:0%
like the model legislation bill that I
 
00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
just read and in fact it was so
 
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
representative Parell and I had a a zoom
 
00:21:41.789 --> 00:21:41.799 align:start position:0%
meeting uh with uh American coding
 
00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
Association representative Heidi mcalli
 
00:21:48.269 --> 00:21:48.279 align:start position:0%
okay and what she did over the weekend
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
was take HB
 
00:21:54.669 --> 00:21:54.679 align:start position:0%
1570 and their current model
 
00:21:59.310 --> 00:21:59.320 align:start position:0%
legislation okay and and amended 1570
 
00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
with the model
 
00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
legislation um so I would hope and this
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
is going to be Revenue neutral so the
 
00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
way it works is that there will be
 
00:22:14.909 --> 00:22:14.919 align:start position:0%
locations in the in the state um that
 
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
will accept recycled paint uh they work
 
00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:19.480 align:start position:0%
Ace Hardware is one of them that they
 
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
work with and they work with some others
 
00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
okay and then the collection um or the
 
00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
collection spots work with paint C
 
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
okay to collect and recycle it um so the
 
00:22:36.269 --> 00:22:36.279 align:start position:0%
amount of money that's put on a can of
 
00:22:39.269 --> 00:22:39.279 align:start position:0%
paint somewhere between 75 cents and
 
00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:44.440 align:start position:0%
a135 a gallon is managed by paint care
 
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
the only role the state has probably
 
00:22:52.909 --> 00:22:52.919 align:start position:0%
Dees uh would be to review the plan and
 
00:22:56.269 --> 00:22:56.279 align:start position:0%
periodically over um again review the
 
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
plan and making sure that the program is
 
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
working um to the plan but any time that
 
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
Dees spends on this is reimbursed
 
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
through paint care so there should be no
 
00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal note so I guess I'm asking uh if
 
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
the committee would give us time to
 
00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:18.520 align:start position:0%
bring in an amendment for us to look at
 
00:23:20.909 --> 00:23:20.919 align:start position:0%
and see if we can move this bill forward
 
00:23:23.909 --> 00:23:23.919 align:start position:0%
yes I um my intention is to have this
 
00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:26.559 align:start position:0%
bill co go to our subcommittee our solid
 
00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
waste subcommittee Ed by representative
 
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
Murray the folks on that committee are
 
00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
representative brulard representative
 
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
Davis representative kulan
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
representative Penza representative NAB
 
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
representative sofikitis and
 
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:41.480 align:start position:0%
representative ger and they will look at
 
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
this bill um and discuss different
 
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
options and possibly hopefully come up
 
00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
with a workable Amendment because uh
 
00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:51.640 align:start position:0%
personally I think this bill has a lot
 
00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:55.240 align:start position:0%
of Merit um I would love to not see
 
00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
paint in our
 
00:23:59.149 --> 00:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
landfills um mixed with kitty litter and
 
00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
any other stuff so um yeah I'm I'm
 
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
hoping that uh our Solid Waste
 
00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:07.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee will um we'll take a look
 
00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
at this representative Bixby yeah so um
 
00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:15.640 align:start position:0%
a couple things one is that um I think
 
00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:18.520 align:start position:0%
that uh the solid waste subcommittee
 
00:24:22.029 --> 00:24:22.039 align:start position:0%
would be happy to uh to uh take
 
00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:23.960 align:start position:0%
advantage of the work that you've leg
 
00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
work you've already done uh the other is
 
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
that um um one of the things that we uh
 
00:24:32.789 --> 00:24:32.799 align:start position:0%
should make sure that we include in that
 
00:24:36.549 --> 00:24:36.559 align:start position:0%
discussion is uh some work with thees to
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that the collection mechanisms
 
00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:43.240 align:start position:0%
in the bill match the collection
 
00:24:45.389 --> 00:24:45.399 align:start position:0%
mechanisms that we have across the state
 
00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
already uh because one of the issues
 
00:24:50.389 --> 00:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
with with just going with model
 
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
legislation is sometimes the model
 
00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't take into account what's already
 
00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
on the ground in the state so I think
 
00:25:00.269 --> 00:25:00.279 align:start position:0%
that um working with the es would uh the
 
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee should work with the es
 
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
to uh include get their input on on be
 
00:25:09.269 --> 00:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
best methods in New Hampshire representa
 
00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
dsy uh yes thank you madam chair yeah
 
00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:13.960 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I for forgot to
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
say that um this piece of model
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
legislation which hopefully we can make
 
00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
work in in New Hampshire was is very
 
00:25:23.909 --> 00:25:23.919 align:start position:0%
important to the American codings
 
00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
Association um because the um paint man
 
00:25:32.789 --> 00:25:32.799 align:start position:0%
manufacturers do not want to um have 50
 
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
different pieces of legislation in in 50
 
00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
states so they back this legislation
 
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
because um they're trying to get it in a
 
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
number of states already in New England
 
00:25:47.789 --> 00:25:47.799 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that um that it's
 
00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:50.120 align:start position:0%
in Maine for the the only two states
 
00:25:52.669 --> 00:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
that don't use this piece of legislation
 
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
is Massachusetts and and New Hampshire
 
00:25:59.710 --> 00:25:59.720 align:start position:0%
so if we could have it uh if if we could
 
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
um model this legislation you know to
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
conform to what's already in what do we
 
00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
have uh four states yeah four states um
 
00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:13.880 align:start position:0%
you know then we could move then it's
 
00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:16.120 align:start position:0%
more of a regional and it works better
 
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
for just everybody so I just wanted to
 
00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
mention that okay thanks yeah thank you
 
00:26:22.029 --> 00:26:22.039 align:start position:0%
for your work on
 
00:26:24.789 --> 00:26:24.799 align:start position:0%
that represent B just to clarify one of
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
the things that I'm thinking about is is
 
00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
is just in terms of identifying pick uh
 
00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
the the depositor pickup locations for
 
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
the paint and not all states have the
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
same sort of transfer station system
 
00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
that we do but the transfer station is
 
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
you know if you don't have if the ace
 
00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
nearest Ace Hardware is 20 miles away
 
00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
and the transfer station is a mile away
 
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
you want to be able to drop at the
 
00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:50.360 align:start position:0%
transfer station so I just want to make
 
00:26:53.789 --> 00:26:53.799 align:start position:0%
sure that that sort of um infrastructure
 
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
is made use
 
00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
of represent Murray thank you madam
 
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
chair yeah to that point I think that
 
00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:02.440 align:start position:0%
this is definitely a worthy piece of
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
legislation to explore um the kitty
 
00:27:07.149 --> 00:27:07.159 align:start position:0%
litter not only
 
00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:09.880 align:start position:0%
isn't not an ideal way of disposing
 
00:27:11.389 --> 00:27:11.399 align:start position:0%
something into our landfills but it's
 
00:27:13.269 --> 00:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
also adding weight to something that
 
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
already exists and so I think if uh we
 
00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:19.000 align:start position:0%
can as a subcommittee move forward um
 
00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
and find something workable sounds like
 
00:27:23.549 --> 00:27:23.559 align:start position:0%
we're very close anyway based on how it
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
was presented so i' I'd be happy to work
 
00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
on that okay we just have to be mindful
 
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
that our um our bills have to be out of
 
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
21st so we have some time to get
 
00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
something good
 
00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
together all right any other questions
 
00:27:49.789 --> 00:27:49.799 align:start position:0%
comments okay so I think we will end our
 
00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
uh work session this morning for uh
 
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
those four bills we have a little bit of
 
00:27:59.430 --> 00:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
time between now and our first hearing
 
00:28:00.669 --> 00:28:00.679 align:start position:0%
uh at
 
00:28:06.909 --> 00:28:06.919 align:start position:0%
10:30 um I do want to um address two
 
00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
things just
 
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
briefly um one is I would remind our
 
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:13.919 align:start position:0%
committee members of course not
 
00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
everybody is here but I so I may have to
 
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
say it again um when we have our
 
00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
hearings I appreciate it if everybody um
 
00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:26.360 align:start position:0%
refrains from using their cell phones
 
00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:29.320 align:start position:0%
and texting and please pay attention to
 
00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:31.960 align:start position:0%
the folks who are testifying who have
 
00:28:34.909 --> 00:28:34.919 align:start position:0%
come sometimes a very long way to come
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
and speak with us so just as a matter of
 
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
courtesy and the other thing I um wanted
 
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
reiterate as this was a something that
 
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
was brought up in the last hearing
 
00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:53.039 align:start position:0%
regarding um state
 
00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
employees in their official capacity
 
00:28:58.669 --> 00:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
before any legisl ative meeting or
 
00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
hearing that yes indeed according to
 
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
section 90 RSA 98- Fon one um state
 
00:29:11.549 --> 00:29:11.559 align:start position:0%
employees and members of um state
 
00:29:16.389 --> 00:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
agencies do indeed have the right uh to
 
00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:20.200 align:start position:0%
promote or oppose directly or indirectly
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
any legislation pending or proposed
 
00:29:28.669 --> 00:29:28.679 align:start position:0%
before the general court and um that is
 
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
something that we should be cognizant
 
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
of and with that I will take a little
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:56.320 --> 00:33:38.710 align:start position:0%

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:41.669 --> 00:33:41.679 align:start position:0%
okay okay I'm going to open up the
 
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
hearing for HB
 
00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
1687 relative to disposal of
 
00:33:48.909 --> 00:33:48.919 align:start position:0%
construction and demolition debris from
 
00:33:52.669 --> 00:33:52.679 align:start position:0%
State construction projects and I invite
 
00:33:52.679 --> 00:33:54.389 align:start position:0%
State construction projects and I invite
representative

00:33:54.389 --> 00:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:33:56.629 --> 00:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
Clutier to introduce this bill good
 
00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
morning okay good morning Madam chair
 
00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:00.440 align:start position:0%
members of the ex uh environment and
 
00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
agriculture committee for the record I
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
state representative John cluder from
 
00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County district 6 which
 
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
comprises the communities of cin and
 
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
Claremont here today in strong support
 
00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:14.919 align:start position:0%
of House Bill
 
00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:17.839 align:start position:0%
1687 which would mandate that all state
 
00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
construction projects include a
 
00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
requirement that hazardous waste be
 
00:34:23.589 --> 00:34:23.599 align:start position:0%
separated from construction and
 
00:34:26.109 --> 00:34:26.119 align:start position:0%
demolition or CND debris at the
 
00:34:26.119 --> 00:34:27.430 align:start position:0%
demolition or CND debris at the
construction

00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
construction
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
prior to transport to a recycling
 
00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
committee or transfer station I
 
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
introduced this bill to strengthen new
 
00:34:37.109 --> 00:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
hamp's current environmental laws
 
00:34:39.629 --> 00:34:39.639 align:start position:0%
regarding how we and state government
 
00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:42.399 align:start position:0%
handle the separation of such waste from
 
00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:45.560 align:start position:0%
CND D debris generated from State
 
00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
constru construction projects I believe
 
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
that this separation of this way should
 
00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:53.560 align:start position:0%
be done at the actual construction site
 
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
not at any transfer station or recycling
 
00:34:58.270 --> 00:34:58.280 align:start position:0%
facility off often some distance away
 
00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:00.839 align:start position:0%
from the construction site as is often
 
00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
done now by mandating that such
 
00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
Separation on site we could reduce the
 
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
chances of hazardous way environmental
 
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
contamination of our air water and land
 
00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
as well as reduce the amount of time
 
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
transfer station or
 
00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:21.160 align:start position:0%
recycling employees are exposed to this
 
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
waste waste which usually contains
 
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
according to my understanding some
 
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
dangerous substances like Mercury and
 
00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
past furthermore I if House Bill 1687
 
00:35:35.829 --> 00:35:35.839 align:start position:0%
becomes law I would believe it would set
 
00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:37.960 align:start position:0%
a good example for New Hampshire's
 
00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:40.280 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions counties
 
00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities and school districts on
 
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
how to more safely handle the separation
 
00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:47.480 align:start position:0%
of hazardous waste from their
 
00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
construction and demolition debris
 
00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
generated by all of their construction
 
00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
projects in setting a good example state
 
00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
government should share its best
 
00:35:58.109 --> 00:35:58.119 align:start position:0%
practice practices in this waste
 
00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:00.280 align:start position:0%
handling so as to more thoroughly
 
00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:02.680 align:start position:0%
protect our precious environment as well
 
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
as even reduce costs finally I if I
 
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
believe this bill becomes law the state
 
00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
should share these safe separation
 
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
practices with private businesses and
 
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
nonprofits so as to ensure so as to
 
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
encourage them to do a better job in
 
00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
separating such waste from CND D
 
00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
debris frankly I mean I'm going to be
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
all put everybody on my cards on the
 
00:36:27.069 --> 00:36:27.079 align:start position:0%
table frankly I was inspired to
 
00:36:28.829 --> 00:36:28.839 align:start position:0%
introduce House Bill
 
00:36:31.069 --> 00:36:31.079 align:start position:0%
1687 because of a potential
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
environmental threat in my home
 
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
community of Claremont a potential
 
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
threat posed by a private waste handling
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
company or recycling facility called
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
Acuity management which wants permission
 
00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
from the City of Claremont to change the
 
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
type of recycling materials that his
 
00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
Claremont site can accept a site close
 
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
to many homes businesses and am traks
 
00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
railroad stations and an elementary
 
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
school permission that has so far been
 
00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
denied by The Claremont Zoning Board of
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
adjustment this denial is now the
 
00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
subject of a lawsuit against the City by
 
00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
Acuity I am concern concerned that if
 
00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
the city were to lose this lawsuit and
 
00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm not I'm not a lawyer so I'm not
 
00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
sure what their chances are there is
 
00:37:19.349 --> 00:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
presently no protection from the
 
00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
possible environmental hazards of of
 
00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:24.680 align:start position:0%
waste at all and this at least would
 
00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
guarantee waste from State construction
 
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
projects would not be unseparated be
 
00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:33.800 align:start position:0%
transferred to this facility and another
 
00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
thing waste that is going to be and I've
 
00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
been told as many as they want to do 50
 
00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
trucks a day I'm assume this is which I
 
00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
was almost fell out of my chair when I
 
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
heard this 50 trucks during the week
 
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
that could be trucked into A's
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
Industrial Boulevard site and this has
 
00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
got my city in an uproar and frankly I
 
00:37:57.790 --> 00:37:57.800 align:start position:0%
don't know if any anybody in my city
 
00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
that's that's in favor of the city's
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
opposed to it and the our entire
 
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
Claremont house delegation is opposed to
 
00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
what they want to do so and I this has
 
00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:09.880 align:start position:0%
been going on for nearly four years in
 
00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:11.560 align:start position:0%
fact I remember going to the first
 
00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
hearing which is held just prior to the
 
00:38:17.309 --> 00:38:17.319 align:start position:0%
pandemic in in early February of 2020 so
 
00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
this is an ongoing
 
00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
issue but I just want to give you some
 
00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
background so I want to be clear why I'm
 
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
doing this but not only for the rest of
 
00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
the state but for the benefit of my home
 
00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
community of Claremont in conclusion I'm
 
00:38:32.829 --> 00:38:32.839 align:start position:0%
more than happy to work with this
 
00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:34.760 align:start position:0%
committee to improve the bill with
 
00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:37.400 align:start position:0%
helpful amendments but I would urge you
 
00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:39.880 align:start position:0%
all eventually to give a positive
 
00:38:43.069 --> 00:38:43.079 align:start position:0%
recommendation to House Bill 1687 and
 
00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:44.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for listening thank
 
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:38:50.349 --> 00:38:50.359 align:start position:0%
cluder uh I I have a quick question um
 
00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
on line seven in this bill and first of
 
00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:54.440 align:start position:0%
all does does everyone in the committee
 
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
have a copy of the bill because if you
 
00:38:59.950 --> 00:38:59.960 align:start position:0%
you don't there are copies on the table
 
00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:03.990 align:start position:0%
you don't there are copies on the table
over

00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:07.960 align:start position:0%
there um so my question is on line seven
 
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
the contract shall include a requirement
 
00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
that all hazardous material it be
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
separated is there a definition of what
 
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
hazardous material is somewhere well I I
 
00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:25.430 align:start position:0%
hazardous material is somewhere well I I
I'll

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:34.309 align:start position:0%
 
ad

00:39:34.309 --> 00:39:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
can you put your mic on
 
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
pleasee that I'm still getting used to
 
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
these so I am you know there's a bit of
 
00:39:45.069 --> 00:39:45.079 align:start position:0%
a discrepancy the top page the cover
 
00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
page of the bill as you read it says
 
00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:48.870 align:start position:0%
page of the bill as you read it says
hazardous

00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
hazardous
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
waste text says hazardous material again
 
00:39:55.309 --> 00:39:55.319 align:start position:0%
if this committee wants to straighten
 
00:39:58.309 --> 00:39:58.319 align:start position:0%
this discrepancy out out and I'm open I
 
00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
mean I you know hazardous waste hasn't
 
00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
material I'm I'm very flexible on it but
 
00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
I am more than willing to work with the
 
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
committee with a helpful amendment to
 
00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
correct this discrepancy so that the
 
00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:12.520 align:start position:0%
bill is consistent both cover page and
 
00:40:14.309 --> 00:40:14.319 align:start position:0%
in the actual text I hope that help
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
answers your question yes thank you
 
00:40:19.349 --> 00:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
representative marray thank you um Madam
 
00:40:22.109 --> 00:40:22.119 align:start position:0%
chair um to that end I am curious I
 
00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
think the department I would like to
 
00:40:25.309 --> 00:40:25.319 align:start position:0%
hear from them because I do know that
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
the department defines hazardous
 
00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
material versus hazardous waste maybe
 
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
differently um and so um depending on
 
00:40:34.829 --> 00:40:34.839 align:start position:0%
those other things but I do have a
 
00:40:37.829 --> 00:40:37.839 align:start position:0%
question regarding um how you before you
 
00:40:40.829 --> 00:40:40.839 align:start position:0%
go on so then I would say that at some
 
00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:44.920 align:start position:0%
point we might want to uh refer to an
 
00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
RSA that has that definition in this
 
00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
particular bill I I yes and I not to
 
00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:54.520 align:start position:0%
debate the substance okay go ahead I'm
 
00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:55.960 align:start position:0%
sorry I didn't mean to no no no that's
 
00:40:59.109 --> 00:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
okay I was looking at 149 M Uh I that is
 
00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned at the end and I just want to
 
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
ensure that that covers the scope of any
 
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
of the materials okay sure um but my
 
00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
other may I yeah um my other question
 
00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
was whether or not you had envisioned uh
 
00:41:12.829 --> 00:41:12.839 align:start position:0%
a way to
 
00:41:16.109 --> 00:41:16.119 align:start position:0%
um how or temporarily sort the items
 
00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
that would be deemed hazardous on the
 
00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
construction site it sounds like Source
 
00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
separation is your goal so I was curious
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
if you had any thought as to how that
 
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
I'll admit not an expert on that
 
00:41:30.109 --> 00:41:30.119 align:start position:0%
hopefully you know I know Dees which
 
00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:31.480 align:start position:0%
just here to answer some of your
 
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
questions I don't know maybe if there's
 
00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
any construction people here no matter
 
00:41:36.309 --> 00:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
how they feel about the bill could give
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
us some
 
00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:41.560 align:start position:0%
insight uh but I'm more than happy to if
 
00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:43.400 align:start position:0%
we have to incorporating the bill what
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
best practices are I don't maybe it's
 
00:41:48.349 --> 00:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
more a question of rules uh if this bill
 
00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:51.880 align:start position:0%
becomes law uh I I'm more than open
 
00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:53.960 align:start position:0%
because I I the construction people I
 
00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
think would know how to do it
 
00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:57.109 align:start position:0%
think would know how to do it
representative

00:41:57.109 --> 00:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:41:59.870 --> 00:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm I'm not an expert so I'll
 
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
just that's my answer so hopefully that
 
00:42:05.069 --> 00:42:05.079 align:start position:0%
helps representative
 
00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
Katon uh yes representative thank you
 
00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
for your testimony for introducing this
 
00:42:12.829 --> 00:42:12.839 align:start position:0%
important bill uh the implication on
 
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
this bill then is that the construction
 
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
company transports that separated
 
00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:21.160 align:start position:0%
material to the appropriate site which
 
00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:24.280 align:start position:0%
isn't always the same site is that is
 
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
that the way I'm reading this
 
00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
yes as I understand it you know at the
 
00:42:31.309 --> 00:42:31.319 align:start position:0%
construction site as I understand it
 
00:42:33.829 --> 00:42:33.839 align:start position:0%
they have the CND debris and it's in
 
00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
most cases un unseparated and then they
 
00:42:39.829 --> 00:42:39.839 align:start position:0%
transfer it to a facility that would
 
00:42:42.349 --> 00:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
handle it and separate it and this is as
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
I understand what a wants to do in in my
 
00:42:48.069 --> 00:42:48.079 align:start position:0%
community I I can't speak for all
 
00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:50.200 align:start position:0%
companies but the concern is in
 
00:42:53.349 --> 00:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
Claremont that this hazardous Wass and
 
00:42:55.589 --> 00:42:55.599 align:start position:0%
I've been told as much many as 50 truck
 
00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
loads a day which again I I find
 
00:42:59.829 --> 00:42:59.839 align:start position:0%
unbelievable and I'm talking about
 
00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
during the week would come into
 
00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
Claremont with CND D debris including
 
00:43:07.309 --> 00:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste and we are we are
 
00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
concerned in Claremont that this poses a
 
00:43:13.829 --> 00:43:13.839 align:start position:0%
danger to our entire Community our homes
 
00:43:14.910 --> 00:43:14.920 align:start position:0%
our our
 
00:43:17.069 --> 00:43:17.079 align:start position:0%
businesses uh as I said an elementary
 
00:43:19.069 --> 00:43:19.079 align:start position:0%
school and an Amtrak railroad station
 
00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
which is nearby that our our
 
00:43:24.349 --> 00:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
Junction uh and it it right now they do
 
00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
handle various Rec recycling materials
 
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
but they really want to change the whole
 
00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
concept of how they run their business
 
00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
and the city is is adamant opposed
 
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
including the Zoning Board of
 
00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
adjustment uh and and so I am very
 
00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:42.680 align:start position:0%
concerned about this situation and I'm
 
00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:45.160 align:start position:0%
trying with this bill to help my city
 
00:43:47.069 --> 00:43:47.079 align:start position:0%
but also help the the rest of the state
 
00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
because I'm sure there are other places
 
00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
communities around the state that have
 
00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:53.720 align:start position:0%
environmental threats from the way
 
00:43:55.589 --> 00:43:55.599 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste or Hazard however you
 
00:43:59.069 --> 00:43:59.079 align:start position:0%
call it is is is separated from cons C
 
00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:00.520 align:start position:0%
and D debris so I don't know if I've
 
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
answered your question but hopefully
 
00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
some maybe the the department Dees or a
 
00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:07.480 align:start position:0%
construction person could further
 
00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
elaborate quick followup representative
 
00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
kraton okay then representative Bixby
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
the question still is those 50 trucks
 
00:44:17.549 --> 00:44:17.559 align:start position:0%
could go to 50 different locations based
 
00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:23.349 --> 00:44:23.359 align:start position:0%
carrying I suppose that's possible but
 
00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:25.640 align:start position:0%
and this is what I'm hearing from from
 
00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
and I ACU's proposal this is what I've
 
00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
read in in the in the press as many as
 
00:44:32.549 --> 00:44:32.559 align:start position:0%
50 which again I find unbelievable
 
00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:34.720 align:start position:0%
anyway it may not be 50 every day
 
00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:36.920 align:start position:0%
whatever it is right whatever it is they
 
00:44:39.069 --> 00:44:39.079 align:start position:0%
go to different locations thank you so
 
00:44:41.309 --> 00:44:41.319 align:start position:0%
much represent
 
00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:44.440 align:start position:0%
Bixby so uh couple of things one is
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
simply a clarification the on the front
 
00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
page where it says hazardous waste that
 
00:44:53.589 --> 00:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
is the uh OS analysis it is not actually
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
part of the bill uh okay but but um
 
00:44:59.510 --> 00:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
where it's where you have hazardous
 
00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
material in the bill uh we should have a
 
00:45:06.549 --> 00:45:06.559 align:start position:0%
uh sighting from the dees statutes to
 
00:45:09.109 --> 00:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
say to to reference their definition
 
00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:15.160 align:start position:0%
there um and uh I I think that um one of
 
00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
the you kind of covered this in your
 
00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:18.440 align:start position:0%
testimony but I think one of the
 
00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
important things is that uh the state
 
00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
projects are going to be a small
 
00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
fraction of the actual number of
 
00:45:27.309 --> 00:45:27.319 align:start position:0%
projects out there but I I I think that
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
um what you have in terms of you know
 
00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
this could be a model for it could be
 
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
Model Behavior if not putting a
 
00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:37.160 align:start position:0%
requirement of would you think would you
 
00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
consider having a broader requirement or
 
00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
would you just want to have this at the
 
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
state level a broad broadening the in
 
00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
scope of the bill yeah to cover what to
 
00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
Municipal there a part of me that is
 
00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
open but I just am I am concerned in the
 
00:45:58.430 --> 00:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
case of Municipal cons their debris
 
00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
could this be an unfunded mandate under
 
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
art article I believe 28a so I'm
 
00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
concerned about that without the state
 
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
paying for it as far as the private
 
00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
sector I don't know how the private
 
00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:13.160 align:start position:0%
sector would feel but I'm willing to I
 
00:46:14.549 --> 00:46:14.559 align:start position:0%
understand the some of the concerns of
 
00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
private contractors that they are trying
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
to do various construction projects now
 
00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:21.800 align:start position:0%
and costs have gone up as we are being a
 
00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
member of the public works and highways
 
00:46:25.309 --> 00:46:25.319 align:start position:0%
committee I well aware how much
 
00:46:27.549 --> 00:46:27.559 align:start position:0%
Construction costs have gone up and as
 
00:46:29.309 --> 00:46:29.319 align:start position:0%
the chair probably remembers as a member
 
00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
of the Sullivan County delegation we
 
00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
struggled with that when the cost of
 
00:46:35.589 --> 00:46:35.599 align:start position:0%
renovating are went up too so I'm
 
00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
careful I I well I really am concerned
 
00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
about I'm both concerned about our
 
00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
environment but I'm understand of adding
 
00:46:45.309 --> 00:46:45.319 align:start position:0%
to the cost right now so if we can have
 
00:46:48.109 --> 00:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
the state become a model and then sh do
 
00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
share its best practices with our
 
00:46:53.589 --> 00:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions and our private
 
00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
sector hopefully we'll all benefit and
 
00:46:59.030 --> 00:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll we'll cut cost and also
 
00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:00.680 align:start position:0%
protect our precious
 
00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:02.309 align:start position:0%
protect our precious
environment

00:47:02.309 --> 00:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
environment
 
00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
question yeah representative uh NAB was
 
00:47:08.549 --> 00:47:08.559 align:start position:0%
first and then we'll go over to you
 
00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:09.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:47:11.349 --> 00:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm just sort of
 
00:47:12.589 --> 00:47:12.599 align:start position:0%
trying to understand the underlying
 
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
issue and how the bill addresses it if
 
00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:17.240 align:start position:0%
um the private company in your town got
 
00:47:19.109 --> 00:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
permission to accept different types of
 
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
recycling materials does it matter how
 
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
they're sorted at the construction site
 
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
or do you still have the same imp of
 
00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:29.800 align:start position:0%
them being transported to your town so
 
00:47:31.549 --> 00:47:31.559 align:start position:0%
so thank
 
00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
you would hope that a and I'm just using
 
00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:38.440 align:start position:0%
the example that the ACU would bring in
 
00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:41.480 align:start position:0%
stuff that that is separated from
 
00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:43.400 align:start position:0%
private but that there's no requirement
 
00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
that that company do so but this at
 
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
least would would any hazardous material
 
00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
or Haz whatever you call from state
 
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
would the hazardous material would have
 
00:47:56.190 --> 00:47:56.200 align:start position:0%
to be separated before coming to the
 
00:47:59.190 --> 00:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
Acuity facility if this bill as as I in
 
00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
written and I intend it becomes law I
 
00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
mean I would hope the company inity
 
00:48:07.309 --> 00:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
would would would encourage good
 
00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
business practices but there is no
 
00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:12.920 align:start position:0%
requirement when it comes to private
 
00:48:16.589 --> 00:48:16.599 align:start position:0%
sector construction CND debris right now
 
00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:19.160 align:start position:0%
or what our municipalities gener I don't
 
00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
know if that answers your question but I
 
00:48:24.549 --> 00:48:24.559 align:start position:0%
I'm might consider going farther but I
 
00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:26.680 align:start position:0%
mean that's up to the Comm too because I
 
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
think we we have to proceed slowly at
 
00:48:32.109 --> 00:48:32.119 align:start position:0%
the moment I so um representative NAB
 
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
you may have a followup thank you madam
 
00:48:37.069 --> 00:48:37.079 align:start position:0%
chair I should have asked that out loud
 
00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:40.079 align:start position:0%
um so the material would still come to
 
00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
the facility it would just be separated
 
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
like State material State projects you
 
00:48:45.549 --> 00:48:45.559 align:start position:0%
could still have hazardous materials
 
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
come to the facility they just have
 
00:48:49.309 --> 00:48:49.319 align:start position:0%
would have been separated I mean could
 
00:48:51.349 --> 00:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
it could it be already separated I I
 
00:48:55.549 --> 00:48:55.559 align:start position:0%
suppose that's possible uh but I'm
 
00:48:58.069 --> 00:48:58.079 align:start position:0%
assuming that this m CN D debris is
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
going to come in you know and its
 
00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:03.400 align:start position:0%
hazardous part will be unseparated from
 
00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
the rest of it and they they're supposed
 
00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:07.640 align:start position:0%
to as I understand their proposal they
 
00:49:12.789 --> 00:49:12.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
Claremont okay um I think representative
 
00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:20.440 align:start position:0%
gerana then representative Duty and
 
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
then oh okay you want you want yeah
 
00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
you and you okay just wanted to to offer
 
00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:31.480 align:start position:0%
a point of information for the committee
 
00:49:34.309 --> 00:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
uh is that both hazardous waste and
 
00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:37.640 align:start position:0%
hazardous materials are defined and
 
00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
distinguished from one another in RSA
 
00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:42.390 align:start position:0%
distinguished from one another in RSA
147

00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
147
 
00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
B2 um and the the hazardous materials
 
00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
definition refers then to a set of
 
00:49:51.069 --> 00:49:51.079 align:start position:0%
federal uh guidelines so it would seem
 
00:49:53.789 --> 00:49:53.799 align:start position:0%
that that would be a really easy uh
 
00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
change to make in the bill and it does
 
00:49:58.349 --> 00:49:58.359 align:start position:0%
seem to be already well defined so if
 
00:50:00.349 --> 00:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
we're talking about separation of
 
00:50:03.549 --> 00:50:03.559 align:start position:0%
hazardous materials at the site uh as I
 
00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
said I I think that would be a pretty
 
00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
easy determination to make based on
 
00:50:10.589 --> 00:50:10.599 align:start position:0%
current RSA and the federal guidelines
 
00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
to which they
 
00:50:15.789 --> 00:50:15.799 align:start position:0%
refer your clarification
 
00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
representative representative sopak
 
00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:22.040 align:start position:0%
kitis um Welcome to our committee I'm
 
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
also from another uh Border Town
 
00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:27.880 align:start position:0%
Nashville so I'm just curious does
 
00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:38.069 --> 00:50:38.079 align:start position:0%
Vermont uh I I'm not sure we we and this
 
00:50:40.030 --> 00:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
you mean you're talking about trash in
 
00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:43.720 align:start position:0%
general Solid Waste well we we have a a
 
00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
transfer facility is my understanding
 
00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
right now the way it's run it only
 
00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
Claremont residents can use it at at one
 
00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
time and I don't want to get in this too
 
00:50:55.870 --> 00:50:55.880 align:start position:0%
much but we had an incinerate at that
 
00:50:58.390 --> 00:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
took waste from it was a big by state
 
00:50:59.710 --> 00:50:59.720 align:start position:0%
district but I don't really want to get
 
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
into that too much today but right now
 
00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
any and I'm not talking about
 
00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:07.240 align:start position:0%
construction and de demolition debris so
 
00:51:11.069 --> 00:51:11.079 align:start position:0%
much but it's all our waste and it has
 
00:51:13.069 --> 00:51:13.079 align:start position:0%
to be generated basically by Claremont
 
00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
residents or businesses you have to have
 
00:51:17.069 --> 00:51:17.079 align:start position:0%
a sticker to get get in if you want to
 
00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
actually use the
 
00:51:22.589 --> 00:51:22.599 align:start position:0%
facility uh but I it's just basically
 
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
our transfer station is is for claremon
 
00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
residents and businesses right now so I
 
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
don't know if that answers your question
 
00:51:30.670 --> 00:51:30.680 align:start position:0%
thank you it's perfect you're welcome
 
00:51:34.990 --> 00:51:35.000 align:start position:0%
represent dsy thank you madam chair um a
 
00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
a comment first I I normally park on the
 
00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
on the third level of the garage and as
 
00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:42.920 align:start position:0%
I was coming over the walkway I happened
 
00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
to look down and I think what I was
 
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
looking at was a huge dumpster full of
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
construction debris and and when I
 
00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:52.640 align:start position:0%
looked at it it was like how do you
 
00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:55.160 align:start position:0%
separate that I mean it was a mess but I
 
00:51:57.470 --> 00:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
ALS also have another question that's
 
00:51:59.549 --> 00:51:59.559 align:start position:0%
okay um in doing your research for the
 
00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:02.920 align:start position:0%
bill uh did you check out what uh other
 
00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
New England states are doing and the
 
00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:07.640 align:start position:0%
reason I'm asking it's been a while
 
00:52:11.230 --> 00:52:11.240 align:start position:0%
since I went to uh an EBC webinar but
 
00:52:13.589 --> 00:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
they they do have training sessions on
 
00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
construction and debris and the last one
 
00:52:19.829 --> 00:52:19.839 align:start position:0%
I went to I recognize I mean this is a a
 
00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
big problem especially in Massachusetts
 
00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
where I think they limit um they limit
 
00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
the amount of construction and debris so
 
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
I know this is going on in a number of
 
00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
states and if New Hampshire doesn't do
 
00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:33.720 align:start position:0%
anything we're going to be The Dumping
 
00:52:35.109 --> 00:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
Ground for all of this because it's a
 
00:52:35.119 --> 00:52:36.069 align:start position:0%
Ground for all of this because it's a
big

00:52:36.069 --> 00:52:36.079 align:start position:0%
big
 
00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
problem I agree we it could be a Dumping
 
00:52:42.190 --> 00:52:42.200 align:start position:0%
Ground representative uh one thing I
 
00:52:43.549 --> 00:52:43.559 align:start position:0%
know I haven't looked at how other
 
00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
states do it to be honest with you I am
 
00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
you know maybe I should but I'm
 
00:52:49.589 --> 00:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
concerned right now about our state but
 
00:52:51.870 --> 00:52:51.880 align:start position:0%
I realize that you might as a committee
 
00:52:54.030 --> 00:52:54.040 align:start position:0%
study what best practices of other
 
00:52:57.789 --> 00:52:57.799 align:start position:0%
states and that does remind me I that
 
00:52:59.910 --> 00:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
I've been told that the the demolition
 
00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
what is going on with the parking garage
 
00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:04.640 align:start position:0%
supposedly the state does separate
 
00:53:06.630 --> 00:53:06.640 align:start position:0%
hazardous materials from their
 
00:53:08.349 --> 00:53:08.359 align:start position:0%
construction and demolition debris but I
 
00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
haven't been able to confirm that uh
 
00:53:13.069 --> 00:53:13.079 align:start position:0%
maybe someone else here so actually they
 
00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
do do it so I don't think we you know
 
00:53:16.950 --> 00:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
because we're right next to the
 
00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:19.640 align:start position:0%
demolition for the parking garage at
 
00:53:23.069 --> 00:53:23.079 align:start position:0%
least we aren't exposed and I applaud
 
00:53:24.549 --> 00:53:24.559 align:start position:0%
whoever is doing if they're doing an
 
00:53:26.829 --> 00:53:26.839 align:start position:0%
environmental correct environmentally
 
00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
correct manner but we ought to have the
 
00:53:32.109 --> 00:53:32.119 align:start position:0%
same standards for all of our state uh
 
00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
and the only other thing I do want to
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
add supposedly to I have been told that
 
00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
the city of Lebanon separates has it
 
00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
from from its CN debris on its own they
 
00:53:43.870 --> 00:53:43.880 align:start position:0%
are not mandated so that's a example of
 
00:53:45.789 --> 00:53:45.799 align:start position:0%
one of our political subdivisions
 
00:53:48.430 --> 00:53:48.440 align:start position:0%
separating but again you this committee
 
00:53:51.390 --> 00:53:51.400 align:start position:0%
may want to confirm that
 
00:53:54.069 --> 00:53:54.079 align:start position:0%
so I I think you raised some very good
 
00:53:55.829 --> 00:53:55.839 align:start position:0%
points and I think thank you very much I
 
00:53:57.230 --> 00:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
hope I have answered your question
 
00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:59.870 align:start position:0%
hope I have answered your question
representative

00:53:59.870 --> 00:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:02.920 align:start position:0%
Penza so you sort of just answered my
 
00:54:06.030 --> 00:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
question um a little bit um in regards
 
00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
with the state you're you're saying that
 
00:54:11.589 --> 00:54:11.599 align:start position:0%
um from what you know and if we can
 
00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
confirm that that would be great um that
 
00:54:16.030 --> 00:54:16.040 align:start position:0%
they're already doing it on site during
 
00:54:18.069 --> 00:54:18.079 align:start position:0%
demolition or the legislative only okay
 
00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
I want to be clear about that you know
 
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
and I I can't speak I for other
 
00:54:24.549 --> 00:54:24.559 align:start position:0%
construction sites I assume they are not
 
00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
doing it but I you know I don't want to
 
00:54:30.069 --> 00:54:30.079 align:start position:0%
absolutely say yes or no
 
00:54:33.630 --> 00:54:33.640 align:start position:0%
question representative k i
 
00:54:36.349 --> 00:54:36.359 align:start position:0%
was thank you madam
 
00:54:41.950 --> 00:54:41.960 align:start position:0%
chair I understand this bill and um why
 
00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:43.000 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
important but I'm going to look at it um
 
00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
because I'm looking at uh the RSA that
 
00:54:51.309 --> 00:54:51.319 align:start position:0%
you referenced in here uh what
 
00:54:53.789 --> 00:54:53.799 align:start position:0%
construction and demolition debris
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
means and
 
00:54:58.910 --> 00:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
and what you're asking of is if someone
 
00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
is doing a remodeling job they usually
 
00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
bring in a dumpster on site to um put
 
00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
that debris into a
 
00:55:12.549 --> 00:55:12.559 align:start position:0%
container and it's specifically slated
 
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
for construction debris if they have to
 
00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
separate that on site you're asking them
 
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
to bring in exponentially 10 to 15
 
00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:27.640 align:start position:0%
containers and that cost would be
 
00:55:32.109 --> 00:55:32.119 align:start position:0%
exorbitant um not only to the
 
00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
homeowner because that's who the cost
 
00:55:37.589 --> 00:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
would get put on to but these businesses
 
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
would not be able to in some of these
 
00:55:42.190 --> 00:55:42.200 align:start position:0%
locations would not be able to
 
00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
accommodate that many containers so that
 
00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
the separation could be done how would
 
00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:48.760 align:start position:0%
you handle
 
00:55:51.710 --> 00:55:51.720 align:start position:0%
this okay your your point is well taken
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
and that's one reason that this bill
 
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.710 align:start position:0%
and that's one reason that this bill
targets

00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:55.720 align:start position:0%
targets
 
00:55:58.430 --> 00:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
uh basically State construction projects
 
00:56:02.029 --> 00:56:02.039 align:start position:0%
only it does not Target your own local
 
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
con of your own uh polit our own
 
00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions right it does not
 
00:56:09.349 --> 00:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
and this is the bill as written does not
 
00:56:12.029 --> 00:56:12.039 align:start position:0%
uh cover private construction projects
 
00:56:13.789 --> 00:56:13.799 align:start position:0%
you want to remodel your home your
 
00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
business or any company wants to do
 
00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:19.480 align:start position:0%
it as as I've written the bill or my
 
00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill is not to cover this
 
00:56:23.549 --> 00:56:23.559 align:start position:0%
right now because I think part of it we
 
00:56:26.309 --> 00:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
got to develop best practices and I
 
00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
think the state needs to act as a model
 
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
for SE such separation of materials from
 
00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:33.160 align:start position:0%
construction and demolition debris that
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
is my intent it just applies to State
 
00:56:40.349 --> 00:56:40.359 align:start position:0%
construction projects and uh that's uh
 
00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
what what my intent is anyway thank you
 
00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
for representative Penza I believe you
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
had a follow-up question did I neglect
 
00:56:49.630 --> 00:56:49.640 align:start position:0%
to say that I'm
 
00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
sorry go ahead if you have a follow-up
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
question to your previous
 
00:56:57.750 --> 00:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
one so just from having a husband that
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
works in this space um a lot of the
 
00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
stuff is already done um on a private
 
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
you know just to speak back to what
 
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
representative ktas says um you know
 
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
when you're even on a private level I
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
know you're not speaking on a private
 
00:57:14.190 --> 00:57:14.200 align:start position:0%
level you're talking about state level
 
00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:17.000 align:start position:0%
so did you realize that there is on on a
 
00:57:20.109 --> 00:57:20.119 align:start position:0%
private level you you can't just throw
 
00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
you know you're remodeling something you
 
00:57:22.589 --> 00:57:22.599 align:start position:0%
can't just throw a whole bunch of stuff
 
00:57:24.549 --> 00:57:24.559 align:start position:0%
in that dumpster doesn't work like that
 
00:57:24.559 --> 00:57:25.549 align:start position:0%
in that dumpster doesn't work like that
so

00:57:25.549 --> 00:57:25.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:28.109 --> 00:57:28.119 align:start position:0%
um you're realizing that piece so you're
 
00:57:30.549 --> 00:57:30.559 align:start position:0%
talking about maybe specifically those
 
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
hazardous materials that representative
 
00:57:37.589 --> 00:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
gerna was talking about that are very
 
00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
difficult maybe to separate once it gets
 
00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:41.640 align:start position:0%
to a location is that the intent of this
 
00:57:43.829 --> 00:57:43.839 align:start position:0%
bill because it would be hard to
 
00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
separate well in general just the
 
00:57:50.430 --> 00:57:50.440 align:start position:0%
materials that might you know are cause
 
00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
an environmental or health hazard that's
 
00:57:55.029 --> 00:57:55.039 align:start position:0%
that's the intent whether it's an and
 
00:57:57.870 --> 00:57:57.880 align:start position:0%
right now I'm trying to focus on the
 
00:58:01.109 --> 00:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
debris the hazardous material in state
 
00:58:03.630 --> 00:58:03.640 align:start position:0%
construction projects that's that's my
 
00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
intent now I don't I can't speak for the
 
00:58:07.789 --> 00:58:07.799 align:start position:0%
private sector maybe that's good news
 
00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
that the private sector all a lot of the
 
00:58:12.789 --> 00:58:12.799 align:start position:0%
con have to follow stringent laws and
 
00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
regulations but my focus is right now
 
00:58:19.829 --> 00:58:19.839 align:start position:0%
what is happening at at especially State
 
00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
construction projects and I think we
 
00:58:24.190 --> 00:58:24.200 align:start position:0%
need to frankly to strengthen our
 
00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
Environmental laws in respect to this
 
00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
area because I as I said I explain what
 
00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
my constituents may be facing if this
 
00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
project you know if the company wins
 
00:58:36.349 --> 00:58:36.359 align:start position:0%
this lawsuit what could be happening and
 
00:58:39.109 --> 00:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
I want to protect not only the people
 
00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
the state but my clont representative
 
00:58:46.430 --> 00:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
K thank you madam chair and in reading
 
00:58:51.490 --> 00:58:51.500 align:start position:0%
your bill you reference again RSA 149

[Music]
 
00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
M4 for
 
00:58:58.910 --> 00:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
d a and it defines what construction and
 
00:59:01.549 --> 00:59:01.559 align:start position:0%
demolition debris I've seen yeah I've SE
 
00:59:03.870 --> 00:59:03.880 align:start position:0%
I've read the definition
 
00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:05.910 align:start position:0%
I've read the definition
okay

00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:59:09.150 --> 00:59:09.160 align:start position:0%
now when I look at this and if you're
 
00:59:10.990 --> 00:59:11.000 align:start position:0%
looking at hazardous
 
00:59:13.549 --> 00:59:13.559 align:start position:0%
materials you're saying that all
 
00:59:15.309 --> 00:59:15.319 align:start position:0%
everything listed in here would be
 
00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
considered hazardous
 
00:59:20.309 --> 00:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
including no am I misunder
 
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
misinterpreting no thank
 
00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:25.349 align:start position:0%
misinterpreting no thank
you

00:59:25.349 --> 00:59:25.359 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:59:28.270 --> 00:59:28.280 align:start position:0%
representative um was some somebody had
 
00:59:30.029 --> 00:59:30.039 align:start position:0%
oh yeah representative Howard you had
 
00:59:32.230 --> 00:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
your hand up before no sorry no okay
 
00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
00:59:35.670 --> 00:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
chair um and thank you to the
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question I
 
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
just want to be clear that in addition
 
00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
to physical structure construction sites
 
00:59:43.309 --> 00:59:43.319 align:start position:0%
we are also through your bill
 
00:59:44.829 --> 00:59:44.839 align:start position:0%
potentially including Highway
 
00:59:47.589 --> 00:59:47.599 align:start position:0%
construction road construction I just
 
00:59:49.549 --> 00:59:49.559 align:start position:0%
want to be clear that what what we're
 
00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
talking about with State projects uh
 
00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
that's a good point I mean I did not
 
00:59:55.630 --> 00:59:55.640 align:start position:0%
clarify so I assume they would apply to
 
00:59:58.109 --> 00:59:58.119 align:start position:0%
road construction projects as well that
 
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
correct represent na thank you madam
 
01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:05.640 align:start position:0%
chair um this is maybe a naive question
 
01:00:07.029 --> 01:00:07.039 align:start position:0%
but I'm following up on representative
 
01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
ktoa is it separating non-hazardous and
 
01:00:12.789 --> 01:00:12.799 align:start position:0%
hazardous are there further would the
 
01:00:14.670 --> 01:00:14.680 align:start position:0%
Hazardous Waste be further separated
 
01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
into different categories my
 
01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:19.960 align:start position:0%
intent Bill uh would be to separate the
 
01:00:22.029 --> 01:00:22.039 align:start position:0%
hazardous material from the construction
 
01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
and Dem and uh and and basically then we
 
01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
the nonhazardous uh material you know
 
01:00:33.349 --> 01:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
could be I think what this company wants
 
01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
to do they want to separate and then
 
01:00:38.150 --> 01:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
ship out by rail uh the non
 
01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
non-hazardous material to other
 
01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:42.520 align:start position:0%
locations around the country too which
 
01:00:45.549 --> 01:00:45.559 align:start position:0%
is which a point of contention but the
 
01:00:48.069 --> 01:00:48.079 align:start position:0%
the point is to separate the hazardous
 
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
material from the non-hazardous material
 
01:00:54.549 --> 01:00:54.559 align:start position:0%
in the CND D debris and I just think
 
01:00:55.589 --> 01:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
think it should be done at the
 
01:00:57.990 --> 01:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
construction site to save cost to save
 
01:01:00.109 --> 01:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
exposure to trucks coming into a
 
01:01:02.829 --> 01:01:02.839 align:start position:0%
community to save the limit the amount
 
01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
of time that transfer station and
 
01:01:07.549 --> 01:01:07.559 align:start position:0%
recycling facility employees are exposed
 
01:01:09.549 --> 01:01:09.559 align:start position:0%
to this hazardous material because
 
01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
that's we can't get around for they are
 
01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
going to be exposed but I want to reduce
 
01:01:15.069 --> 01:01:15.079 align:start position:0%
them and I figure at the construction
 
01:01:15.079 --> 01:01:16.309 align:start position:0%
them and I figure at the construction
site

01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
site
 
01:01:18.510 --> 01:01:18.520 align:start position:0%
as okay and just so that we know what
 
01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
we're talking about um as representative
 
01:01:25.710 --> 01:01:25.720 align:start position:0%

01:01:35.069 --> 01:01:35.079 align:start position:0%
B2 uh number uh Roman numeral 8 says
 
01:01:37.589 --> 01:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
hazardous materials means those
 
01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:39.680 align:start position:0%

code Federal Regulations as amended and
 
01:02:19.150 --> 01:02:19.160 align:start position:0%
there is also in that um
 
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
statute a on Roman numeral 7 hazardous
 
01:02:27.069 --> 01:02:27.079 align:start position:0%
waste means a solid semi-solid liquid or
 
01:02:28.829 --> 01:02:28.839 align:start position:0%
contained gaseous waste or any
 
01:02:32.029 --> 01:02:32.039 align:start position:0%
combination of these wastes which
 
01:02:34.029 --> 01:02:34.039 align:start position:0%
because of their quantity concentration
 
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
or physical chemical or infectious
 
01:02:38.269 --> 01:02:38.279 align:start position:0%
characteristics may cause or contribute
 
01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
to an increase in mortality and there's
 
01:02:44.109 --> 01:02:44.119 align:start position:0%
a whole bunch more stuff but we do have
 
01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:47.240 align:start position:0%
the two separate and distinct
 
01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:49.960 align:start position:0%
definitions of hazardous waste versus
 
01:02:52.029 --> 01:02:52.039 align:start position:0%
hazardous materials I think we're
 
01:02:54.549 --> 01:02:54.559 align:start position:0%
probably with this build talking more
 
01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
about hazardous materials but I don't
 
01:03:00.029 --> 01:03:00.039 align:start position:0%
see any reason why we couldn't include a
 
01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
reference to both sections of this
 
01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:07.880 align:start position:0%
statute so anyway um any other questions
 
01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
for representative cluer representative
 
01:03:13.710 --> 01:03:13.720 align:start position:0%
gerana thank you madam chair uh so and
 
01:03:15.789 --> 01:03:15.799 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of thinking about something you
 
01:03:17.109 --> 01:03:17.119 align:start position:0%
just said a moment ago representative
 
01:03:19.349 --> 01:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
wouldn't this also lead to a more
 
01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
efficient uh process in the sense that
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
right I mean we can landfill
 
01:03:25.549 --> 01:03:25.559 align:start position:0%
construction debris
 
01:03:27.549 --> 01:03:27.559 align:start position:0%
for example some of our landfills in New
 
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with some of our with some of
 
01:03:33.349 --> 01:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
the um hazardous materials
 
01:03:37.309 --> 01:03:37.319 align:start position:0%
May likely uh have to be uh sent out of
 
01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
state so wouldn't it be a more efficient
 
01:03:42.549 --> 01:03:42.559 align:start position:0%
process to site to separate it on site
 
01:03:44.309 --> 01:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
and that way you can send construction
 
01:03:47.789 --> 01:03:47.799 align:start position:0%
debris directly to landfills that accept
 
01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:49.640 align:start position:0%
construction debris rather than having
 
01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
to go to an intermediary site where
 
01:03:55.230 --> 01:03:55.240 align:start position:0%
separation happens and then sending out
 
01:03:57.309 --> 01:03:57.319 align:start position:0%
materials in different directions from
 
01:03:59.789 --> 01:03:59.799 align:start position:0%
there yes I agree with you I think that
 
01:04:02.829 --> 01:04:02.839 align:start position:0%
would be my intent that if if if we do
 
01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
this right and I talked about best
 
01:04:07.549 --> 01:04:07.559 align:start position:0%
practices we could maybe more
 
01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
effectively and economically separate
 
01:04:12.510 --> 01:04:12.520 align:start position:0%
such material because part of I not only
 
01:04:14.510 --> 01:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
to protect our precious environment but
 
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
to reduce cost and so I I would agree
 
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
with you that that's the intent and I
 
01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
believe we we dealt with this issue way
 
01:04:24.670 --> 01:04:24.680 align:start position:0%
back in 2007 where I think we considered
 
01:04:26.510 --> 01:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
and passed a bill under then Governor
 
01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
Lynch to to ban the burning of CN D
 
01:04:32.750 --> 01:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
debris I'm as I understand it I vaguely
 
01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:34.760 align:start position:0%
remember so we've dealt with this before
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
and I want to go
 
01:04:40.269 --> 01:04:40.279 align:start position:0%
further because uh we we've I think got
 
01:04:42.190 --> 01:04:42.200 align:start position:0%
a landfill it now any we can't burn it
 
01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
anymore according to my understanding
 
01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any other
 
01:04:49.029 --> 01:04:49.039 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much
 
01:04:51.029 --> 01:04:51.039 align:start position:0%
representative cluder I appreciate you
 
01:04:53.269 --> 01:04:53.279 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill this morning thank
 
01:04:54.510 --> 01:04:54.520 align:start position:0%
you madam chair member members of the
 
01:04:57.630 --> 01:04:57.640 align:start position:0%
committee and I'm looking to call Katie
 
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
lejoy from Charlestown good morning and
 
01:05:12.789 --> 01:05:12.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
agriculture uh good morning uh my name
 
01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
is Katie lejoy I live in Charlestown I'm
 
01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
a nurse um I urge you to support this
 
01:05:25.029 --> 01:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
bill and um I've been en closed for the
 
01:05:27.630 --> 01:05:27.640 align:start position:0%
public record and for uh distribution
 
01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:30.200 align:start position:0%
among committee members uh two copies of
 
01:05:32.829 --> 01:05:32.839 align:start position:0%
a report from a Governor's commission
 
01:05:36.029 --> 01:05:36.039 align:start position:0%
that focused on um construction and
 
01:05:38.589 --> 01:05:38.599 align:start position:0%
Demolition and this commission was back
 
01:05:38.599 --> 01:05:40.349 align:start position:0%
Demolition and this commission was back
in

01:05:40.349 --> 01:05:40.359 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
2011 and um I had the honor of being
 
01:05:45.789 --> 01:05:45.799 align:start position:0%
part of that commission and helped write
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
this report I think you're going to find
 
01:05:51.269 --> 01:05:51.279 align:start position:0%
a lot of answers to your questions um in
 
01:05:51.279 --> 01:05:51.990 align:start position:0%
a lot of answers to your questions um in
the

01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:05:54.829 --> 01:05:54.839 align:start position:0%
report uh one of the big things I just
 
01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
want to point out when we're looking at
 
01:05:58.269 --> 01:05:58.279 align:start position:0%
what could be possibly in construction
 
01:06:00.349 --> 01:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
and demolition debris that is haard is
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
certainly lead based
 
01:06:06.750 --> 01:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
paint huge one um and we don't want that
 
01:06:10.589 --> 01:06:10.599 align:start position:0%
just coming into Claremont as uh
 
01:06:12.190 --> 01:06:12.200 align:start position:0%
representative cluer
 
01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
said um I believe this morning you each
 
01:06:18.829 --> 01:06:18.839 align:start position:0%
got an email with uh the web link to
 
01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
this report uh that I'm going to give
 
01:06:25.269 --> 01:06:25.279 align:start position:0%
you and um I also included a page from
 
01:06:28.309 --> 01:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
another report that uh has a duplicate
 
01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
graph of what's in the bigger report and
 
01:06:35.349 --> 01:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
um the that one is a colored graph that
 
01:06:39.549 --> 01:06:39.559 align:start position:0%
talks about how um uh Recycling and
 
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
waste reduction can um keep landfills
 
01:06:47.549 --> 01:06:47.559 align:start position:0%
the open for a longer time um proper
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
management of CN D protects us all and
 
01:06:53.069 --> 01:06:53.079 align:start position:0%
uh this is an important bill and I urge
 
01:06:54.589 --> 01:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
you to support it
 
01:06:56.549 --> 01:06:56.559 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thank you any
 
01:06:59.190 --> 01:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee um thank
 
01:07:01.269 --> 01:07:01.279 align:start position:0%
you seeing none I appreciate and if you
 
01:07:03.470 --> 01:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
have anything to hand out please U pass
 
01:07:06.309 --> 01:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
it by over there thank you by uh
 
01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
representative sofikitis
 
01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
next I'd like to call um John Tut Hill
 
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
from my hometown of
 
01:07:19.269 --> 01:07:19.279 align:start position:0%
aworth good morning re um Mr Tod Hill
 
01:07:21.109 --> 01:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
welcome to environment and agriculture
 
01:07:23.309 --> 01:07:23.319 align:start position:0%
morning Madam chairman um members of the
 
01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
committee it's pleasure to be here I'll
 
01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
be very brief I did uh submit u a letter
 
01:07:31.230 --> 01:07:31.240 align:start position:0%
with a copy actually of the 2011
 
01:07:34.190 --> 01:07:34.200 align:start position:0%
commission report um and I think
 
01:07:36.029 --> 01:07:36.039 align:start position:0%
listening to the discussion
 
01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
today um it's clear to me that probably
 
01:07:44.750 --> 01:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is going to need more study um
 
01:07:48.430 --> 01:07:48.440 align:start position:0%
I support the bill the intent is is very
 
01:07:49.950 --> 01:07:49.960 align:start position:0%
good and it is something that has been
 
01:07:51.549 --> 01:07:51.559 align:start position:0%
looked at for years but New Hampshire
 
01:07:54.109 --> 01:07:54.119 align:start position:0%
has not quite yet arrived at the point
 
01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
where we are
 
01:07:59.750 --> 01:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
discouraging um adequately mixed loads
 
01:08:03.150 --> 01:08:03.160 align:start position:0%
of waste um and that applies not just to
 
01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
construction and demolition waste but to
 
01:08:06.829 --> 01:08:06.839 align:start position:0%
all waste I mean it's sort of like the
 
01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
garbage can under your kitchen sink um
 
01:08:11.349 --> 01:08:11.359 align:start position:0%
if it's got paper in it and aluminum
 
01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
cans in it and you dump a you know a
 
01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
load of bacon grease and some coffee
 
01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
grounds on it the entire entire uh Bin
 
01:08:23.189 --> 01:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
of of valuable materials is basically no
 
01:08:25.149 --> 01:08:25.159 align:start position:0%
longer available and that's the same
 
01:08:27.189 --> 01:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
with construction and demolition debris
 
01:08:27.199 --> 01:08:28.950 align:start position:0%
with construction and demolition debris
bins

01:08:28.950 --> 01:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
bins
 
01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
um we always used to refer to it as the
 
01:08:33.349 --> 01:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
transfer station is the bin of Last
 
01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
Resort when you didn't know where to put
 
01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
something when it was maybe problematic
 
01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
um that's where you went and and that
 
01:08:42.070 --> 01:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
creates a lot of problems this is why in
 
01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:43.759 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County and in Claremont there
 
01:08:46.390 --> 01:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
is so much concern about a company that
 
01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:47.110 align:start position:0%
is so much concern about a company that
is

01:08:47.110 --> 01:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
proposing uh in in applications to Dees
 
01:08:53.550 --> 01:08:53.560 align:start position:0%
a 500 to 800 ton per day facility taking
 
01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
in in uh bins basically dumping them on
 
01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
a on a pad um pulling out perhaps some
 
01:09:03.789 --> 01:09:03.799 align:start position:0%
you know steel or high value materials
 
01:09:06.430 --> 01:09:06.440 align:start position:0%
to some extent on a very small site and
 
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
then loading it into train cars for
 
01:09:10.709 --> 01:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
shipment I believe in The Proposal that
 
01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
Dees is now rejected from
 
01:09:15.870 --> 01:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
2019 um I think it was actually
 
01:09:18.789 --> 01:09:18.799 align:start position:0%
technically rejected in 20120 as an
 
01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
administrative decision um but shipping
 
01:09:24.189 --> 01:09:24.199 align:start position:0%
in train cars out to Ohio were at the
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
time disposal fees were around $17 a ton
 
01:09:28.910 --> 01:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
what's happened in New Hampshire since
 
01:09:31.870 --> 01:09:31.880 align:start position:0%
the commission report is that uh there's
 
01:09:33.550 --> 01:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
a large company in eping for example
 
01:09:35.829 --> 01:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
that is doing a lot of processing and
 
01:09:37.709 --> 01:09:37.719 align:start position:0%
they as a private company can set their
 
01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
gate fees uh high enough for mixed loads
 
01:09:43.709 --> 01:09:43.719 align:start position:0%
that contractors uh are not going to
 
01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
bring in mixed loads that it becomes
 
01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
cost effective to do Source segregation
 
01:09:49.990 --> 01:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
on site um this is the same thing that
 
01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
the city of Lebanon did which pretty
 
01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
much dried up um the tonnage arriving at
 
01:09:56.709 --> 01:09:56.719 align:start position:0%
their facility which was using up
 
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
landfill space and had toxic um well
 
01:10:03.550 --> 01:10:03.560 align:start position:0%
issues with toxic uh materials which
 
01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
were impacting their leech a impacting
 
01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
their costs and when when that material
 
01:10:10.709 --> 01:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
was processed there was enough toxic
 
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
loading um in what are called the fines
 
01:10:14.950 --> 01:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
or what's left over after processing
 
01:10:16.669 --> 01:10:16.679 align:start position:0%
that it no longer met the standards for
 
01:10:18.910 --> 01:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
using as alternate daily cover at
 
01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
landfills which is a a common use for
 
01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
the residuals from the process C and D
 
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
streams so what the bill I think really
 
01:10:29.550 --> 01:10:29.560 align:start position:0%
is intending to do and it it really is
 
01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
sort of a model because it is only
 
01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
affecting State contracts for putting
 
01:10:34.990 --> 01:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
out to bid so everybody's on a Level
 
01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
Playing Field where you know a
 
01:10:38.430 --> 01:10:38.440 align:start position:0%
contractor is not going to come in to
 
01:10:40.149 --> 01:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
knock down a building like the doj
 
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
building next door um next
 
01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
door um and you know everybody's going
 
01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
to going to have to consider this in
 
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
putting together their bid package that
 
01:10:53.669 --> 01:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
we're going to do Source segregation yes
 
01:10:54.990 --> 01:10:55.000 align:start position:0%
yes there is some more labor yes there
 
01:10:57.030 --> 01:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
are some more bins there's some
 
01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
management um but in the long run um
 
01:11:03.270 --> 01:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
well some of the upfront costs may be
 
01:11:04.870 --> 01:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
more expensive I think that you are
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
actually benefiting the state um in a
 
01:11:09.709 --> 01:11:09.719 align:start position:0%
number of ways and hopefully at some
 
01:11:11.149 --> 01:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
point and this is why I think maybe some
 
01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
study would be a good idea we can look
 
01:11:16.189 --> 01:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
at ways to expand this uh out into the
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
marketplace and the private sector uh
 
01:11:20.830 --> 01:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
and to help municipalities do more
 
01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
Source segregation so that at a transfer
 
01:11:26.430 --> 01:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
station in a small town like ours with a
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
a very minimal budget you you're not
 
01:11:31.310 --> 01:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
simply just throwing everything into one
 
01:11:33.870 --> 01:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
bin and creating an expensive mess so
 
01:11:36.070 --> 01:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it at that for now and um I'm
 
01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
I'm glad that you're taking up this
 
01:11:39.229 --> 01:11:39.239 align:start position:0%
issue and I do support the bill but I
 
01:11:40.990 --> 01:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
think probably it is going to need some
 
01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
work in terms of definitions and and how
 
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
we sort of fit it into the state
 
01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
Contracting process thank you represent
 
01:11:52.870 --> 01:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
Bixby you yeah so um the you you
 
01:11:54.229 --> 01:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you think it might need
 
01:11:57.030 --> 01:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
more study but I'm wondering if the more
 
01:11:59.390 --> 01:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
study would be what's necessary in order
 
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
to expand it Beyond State projects and
 
01:12:05.110 --> 01:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
if uh simply doing a little bit of
 
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
clarification in terms of uh what we
 
01:12:09.709 --> 01:12:09.719 align:start position:0%
mean by hazardous waste by referencing
 
01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
the right rsas would turn this into a
 
01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
good bill uh as to to start the process
 
01:12:20.149 --> 01:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
and uh start providing that model rather
 
01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
than spending another year trying to
 
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
study it to get it perfect
 
01:12:25.709 --> 01:12:25.719 align:start position:0%
I would welcome that approach
 
01:12:28.149 --> 01:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
representative so thank you yes
 
01:12:28.159 --> 01:12:30.629 align:start position:0%
representative so thank you yes
representative

01:12:30.629 --> 01:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
fenza I am perplexed that this isn't
 
01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:36.280 align:start position:0%
already the case because in a sense if
 
01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
if you're not separating hazardous ways
 
01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
based upon what you said you're
 
01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
contaminating everything else correct
 
01:12:46.470 --> 01:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
yes and then when it goes to the
 
01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
facility you're then um putting all of
 
01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
those people that are now you know
 
01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
whatever separating that waste all those
 
01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
workers at risk as well but even of
 
01:12:59.750 --> 01:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
course the travel and all of those types
 
01:13:03.990 --> 01:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
of things um would you feel that I mean
 
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
do we even have an idea of what's going
 
01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
on right now a picture besides I know
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
this is brought up because of a specific
 
01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
issue in a region where this is at
 
01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
because this just seems perplexing that
 
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
this wouldn't already be the case well I
 
01:13:18.189 --> 01:13:18.199 align:start position:0%
mean there have been some materials
 
01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
representative such as asbestos uh
 
01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
mercury in some cases which are
 
01:13:23.950 --> 01:13:23.960 align:start position:0%
regulated and
 
01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:26.120 align:start position:0%
well uh New Hampshire does require
 
01:13:27.870 --> 01:13:27.880 align:start position:0%
demolition permits that's put back to
 
01:13:29.629 --> 01:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
the municipal level so you know towns
 
01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
under a thousand administratively that's
 
01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
simply not being followed up on so we
 
01:13:36.430 --> 01:13:36.440 align:start position:0%
still do see quite a lot of mixed waste
 
01:13:38.270 --> 01:13:38.280 align:start position:0%
going through the system I think the
 
01:13:40.990 --> 01:13:41.000 align:start position:0%
economic incentive is the important one
 
01:13:43.629 --> 01:13:43.639 align:start position:0%
but it's not strictly necessary and the
 
01:13:47.149 --> 01:13:47.159 align:start position:0%
proposal for example in Claremont um
 
01:13:49.189 --> 01:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
just the economics of it you know
 
01:13:51.750 --> 01:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
basically encourage us to continue with
 
01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
past bad practices of mixing wastes
 
01:13:57.149 --> 01:13:57.159 align:start position:0%
dumping loading and shipping away uh in
 
01:13:58.990 --> 01:13:59.000 align:start position:0%
this case out to very large landfills in
 
01:14:01.550 --> 01:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
Ohio where people are not necessarily
 
01:14:03.870 --> 01:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
supportive of that that
 
01:14:08.350 --> 01:14:08.360 align:start position:0%
process followup followup um so would
 
01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
you as a gauge for people that are
 
01:14:14.189 --> 01:14:14.199 align:start position:0%
working at um you know at landfills at
 
01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
transfer stations um the workers that
 
01:14:19.270 --> 01:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
are dealing with this day in and day out
 
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
um they would support something like
 
01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
this probably that would need to be a
 
01:14:24.669 --> 01:14:24.679 align:start position:0%
little tightened up cleaned up broader
 
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
because I think it should be for you
 
01:14:28.350 --> 01:14:28.360 align:start position:0%
know this should apply for private State
 
01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
everybody should have the same playing
 
01:14:31.950 --> 01:14:31.960 align:start position:0%
field right I think we need to get there
 
01:14:35.149 --> 01:14:35.159 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you representative Murray
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and this question
 
01:14:38.270 --> 01:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
may not be for you and if it's not then
 
01:14:39.750 --> 01:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
I'll direct it either to the prime
 
01:14:42.669 --> 01:14:42.679 align:start position:0%
sponsor or the department but I I I was
 
01:14:45.550 --> 01:14:45.560 align:start position:0%
curious about uh the RFP process um
 
01:14:48.910 --> 01:14:48.920 align:start position:0%
since their state run projects and would
 
01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
a disposal or uh any sort of requirement
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
plan for disposal be required in rfps
 
01:14:58.750 --> 01:14:58.760 align:start position:0%
that go out um that's sort of a question
 
01:15:01.110 --> 01:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
I had if there was any thought around
 
01:15:03.709 --> 01:15:03.719 align:start position:0%
that um I don't know much about that
 
01:15:05.189 --> 01:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
actually but I think there is pretty
 
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
standard language in in many um rfps and
 
01:15:11.310 --> 01:15:11.320 align:start position:0%
in contracts for how waste is going to
 
01:15:12.990 --> 01:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
be managed it's usually pretty simple
 
01:15:14.189 --> 01:15:14.199 align:start position:0%
that you're just going to follow all
 
01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
laws and
 
01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:18.229 align:start position:0%
laws and
regulations

01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
01:15:20.629 --> 01:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
um I I think it's been interesting
 
01:15:22.669 --> 01:15:22.679 align:start position:0%
watching the doj project next door
 
01:15:24.590 --> 01:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
because they are doing Source
 
01:15:26.629 --> 01:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
segregation I don't think that that was
 
01:15:28.709 --> 01:15:28.719 align:start position:0%
required and yet I've watched University
 
01:15:31.070 --> 01:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
projects where dormitories are being
 
01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
just just knocked down and the entire
 
01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
load just you know excavators dumping it
 
01:15:38.990 --> 01:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
right into bins those are mixed loads
 
01:15:41.070 --> 01:15:41.080 align:start position:0%
those are potentially contaminated loads
 
01:15:42.270 --> 01:15:42.280 align:start position:0%
those are the kind of things we don't
 
01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
want to see coming into Claremont
 
01:15:46.030 --> 01:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
because they can do it cheaply there so
 
01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
again if you had across the board
 
01:15:51.669 --> 01:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
regulation um everybody's basically
 
01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
bidding on the same project I've talked
 
01:15:55.390 --> 01:15:55.400 align:start position:0%
to people working for large Contracting
 
01:15:56.790 --> 01:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
companies like uh
 
01:15:59.870 --> 01:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
Dew um and they said yeah you know we
 
01:16:01.830 --> 01:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
we're prepared to do that and if if a
 
01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
client wants that we will do that but we
 
01:16:06.510 --> 01:16:06.520 align:start position:0%
cannot compete if we're going up against
 
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
companies that are simply doing tear
 
01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
downs and
 
01:16:13.550 --> 01:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
shipping okay followup I guess to my
 
01:16:15.149 --> 01:16:15.159 align:start position:0%
point I guess that was my thought was
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
maybe another Approach at this is
 
01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
requiring that Source separation in
 
01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
statute somewhere for All State projects
 
01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
that that is clearly enumerated in that
 
01:16:28.030 --> 01:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
process somewhere in addition to the
 
01:16:29.550 --> 01:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
other things that the prime sponsor is
 
01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
looking for yeah yeah Contracting is way
 
01:16:34.750 --> 01:16:34.760 align:start position:0%
outside of my realm thanks okay thank
 
01:16:37.550 --> 01:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
you representative Howard thank you
 
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
madam chair um if this I I I think that
 
01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
this bill should be expanded to Beyond
 
01:16:46.229 --> 01:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
just the state projects otherwise it's
 
01:16:48.830 --> 01:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
almost completely ineffective because
 
01:16:52.590 --> 01:16:52.600 align:start position:0%
what would compel a profit driven
 
01:16:55.470 --> 01:16:55.480 align:start position:0%
contract to um follow a model that was
 
01:16:57.870 --> 01:16:57.880 align:start position:0%
that would probably add expenses to it
 
01:17:00.669 --> 01:17:00.679 align:start position:0%
so um I guess my question or I'm not
 
01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
sure there's a question in there but um
 
01:17:05.629 --> 01:17:05.639 align:start position:0%
do you agree with me that it's would be
 
01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
less almost ineffective to do just a
 
01:17:12.070 --> 01:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
model program um I think it's somewhat
 
01:17:13.870 --> 01:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
symbolic but I also think it's important
 
01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:16.440 align:start position:0%
for the state to be showing that it is
 
01:17:19.310 --> 01:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
um committed to acting responsibly um
 
01:17:22.590 --> 01:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
and setting up a model so I I think is
 
01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative Bixby said perhaps you
 
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
you start small and and I think there's
 
01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
so much work being done right now in New
 
01:17:31.629 --> 01:17:31.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on the solid waste issue on a
 
01:17:34.229 --> 01:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
developing policy that yeah this is a
 
01:17:36.149 --> 01:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
sort of a dynamic and we're in a moment
 
01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
of opportunity right now we haven't seen
 
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
for 20 years so you know I think we need
 
01:17:43.149 --> 01:17:43.159 align:start position:0%
to keep working forward on
 
01:17:45.310 --> 01:17:45.320 align:start position:0%
this any other
 
01:17:47.390 --> 01:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr Tut Hill
 
01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time
 
01:17:52.229 --> 01:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
today I call Todd pisit from New
 
01:17:56.149 --> 01:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:56.159 --> 01:17:58.790 align:start position:0%
 
good

01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
morning good morning Madam chair members
 
01:18:03.030 --> 01:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
01:18:05.590 --> 01:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
is Todd pisit with the New Hampshire
 
01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste management Bureau and
 
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
I'm joined by Michael Nork who's also
 
01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
with Dees but he's with the solid waste
 
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
management Bureau so he can ask Solid
 
01:18:18.910 --> 01:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
Waste specific answer solid way specific
 
01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
questions um there's been a lot said
 
01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
here today first of all just just to be
 
01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
clear on the the definitions between
 
01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste and hazardous materials
 
01:18:30.629 --> 01:18:30.639 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste is something that is a
 
01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
waste already so it has to be a waste
 
01:18:36.550 --> 01:18:36.560 align:start position:0%
before it's a hazardous waste um and
 
01:18:38.229 --> 01:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
there are very specific
 
01:18:41.149 --> 01:18:41.159 align:start position:0%
definitions uh requirements to to make
 
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
something a hazardous waste as opposed
 
01:18:46.229 --> 01:18:46.239 align:start position:0%
to a solid waste hazardous materials is
 
01:18:47.310 --> 01:18:47.320 align:start position:0%
more of a
 
01:18:50.990 --> 01:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
do um definition it has to do with
 
01:18:52.590 --> 01:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
things that are transported over the
 
01:18:55.950 --> 01:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
road ways and that can include products
 
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
that are not
 
01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
waste uh importantly hazardous waste
 
01:19:03.189 --> 01:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
does not include things like asbest and
 
01:19:06.070 --> 01:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
pcbs because they are regulated on their
 
01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:07.430 align:start position:0%
pcbs because they are regulated on their
own

01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
own
 
01:19:11.070 --> 01:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
individually so things those are common
 
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
things at at at uh construction and
 
01:19:18.030 --> 01:19:18.040 align:start position:0%
demolition sites asbest and uh
 
01:19:20.750 --> 01:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
pcbs but to be clear uh the
 
01:19:22.470 --> 01:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
representative over here I didn't C your
 
01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:23.470 align:start position:0%
representative over here I didn't C your
name

01:19:23.470 --> 01:19:23.480 align:start position:0%
name
 
01:19:26.669 --> 01:19:26.679 align:start position:0%
um everything that this bill is looking
 
01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
to do is already in Rule and statute the
 
01:19:31.709 --> 01:19:31.719 align:start position:0%
Hazardous Waste rules that at New
 
01:19:35.669 --> 01:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire administrative rules EnV hw100
 
01:19:40.110 --> 01:19:40.120 align:start position:0%
through 1300 require any business or
 
01:19:43.270 --> 01:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
government entity that generates waste
 
01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
they're required to evaluate whether
 
01:19:48.390 --> 01:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
that waste is hazardous and if it's
 
01:19:50.430 --> 01:19:50.440 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste it needs to be kept
 
01:19:52.910 --> 01:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
separate on site managed very
 
01:19:57.189 --> 01:19:57.199 align:start position:0%
specifically labeling containers safety
 
01:19:59.790 --> 01:19:59.800 align:start position:0%
security and then transported on a
 
01:20:02.990 --> 01:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
manifest to a facility that is permitted
 
01:20:05.470 --> 01:20:05.480 align:start position:0%
to receive that either a transfer
 
01:20:07.229 --> 01:20:07.239 align:start position:0%
facility where it can be put on into
 
01:20:11.030 --> 01:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
another truck or a hazardous waste
 
01:20:14.350 --> 01:20:14.360 align:start position:0%
Transfer uh a tsdf a transfer storage
 
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
and disposal facility so if it's
 
01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste is generated on a site
 
01:20:22.430 --> 01:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
it needs to be separated out and shipped
 
01:20:24.830 --> 01:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
proper ly and disposed of properly there
 
01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
are no tdfs in New Hampshire so anything
 
01:20:30.350 --> 01:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
that can't uh be disposed of in New
 
01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has to go out of state ASB
 
01:20:34.669 --> 01:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
bestus doesn't fall on that but if you
 
01:20:38.229 --> 01:20:38.239 align:start position:0%
had a dumpster full of uh demolition
 
01:20:41.149 --> 01:20:41.159 align:start position:0%
debris on a site and as bestus got into
 
01:20:43.950 --> 01:20:43.960 align:start position:0%
that dumpster the entire dumpster is as
 
01:20:46.350 --> 01:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
bestus contaminated material and would
 
01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
have to it would be cost prohibitive for
 
01:20:52.470 --> 01:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
a a demolition company to do that so I I
 
01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
don't think that um I I think that
 
01:20:56.709 --> 01:20:56.719 align:start position:0%
everything this bill is trying to
 
01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:00.199 align:start position:0%
accomplish already happens but I I may
 
01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
be I may be reading the bill incorrectly
 
01:21:05.470 --> 01:21:05.480 align:start position:0%
but I think that the bill is just adding
 
01:21:07.950 --> 01:21:07.960 align:start position:0%
one sentence to an already existing
 
01:21:11.990 --> 01:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
statue and it is basically saying that
 
01:21:14.910 --> 01:21:14.920 align:start position:0%
when a state contract for demolition is
 
01:21:17.870 --> 01:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
engaged in that that contract needs to
 
01:21:21.030 --> 01:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
say that that that those hazardous
 
01:21:23.669 --> 01:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
materials need to be separated on site
 
01:21:26.189 --> 01:21:26.199 align:start position:0%
again that's already required to be done
 
01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
but I think adding that language to a
 
01:21:31.709 --> 01:21:31.719 align:start position:0%
contract just helps with compliance with
 
01:21:36.149 --> 01:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:38.430 --> 01:21:38.440 align:start position:0%
exist represent
 
01:21:40.950 --> 01:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
Penza thank you so much for clarifying
 
01:21:42.750 --> 01:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
that would you be willing to work with
 
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of this bill um because if
 
01:21:47.590 --> 01:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
this is about a contract that they have
 
01:21:49.950 --> 01:21:49.960 align:start position:0%
that seems as if it's a little bit
 
01:21:53.189 --> 01:21:53.199 align:start position:0%
imminent um that this cont contractor
 
01:21:56.110 --> 01:21:56.120 align:start position:0%
could be told that this contract
 
01:21:59.950 --> 01:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
violates you know state law right I I I
 
01:22:02.390 --> 01:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to um Madam chair you you
 
01:22:04.390 --> 01:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier something about when
 
01:22:06.709 --> 01:22:06.719 align:start position:0%
you read the definitions of the rules
 
01:22:08.750 --> 01:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
you suggested maybe we could add
 
01:22:10.750 --> 01:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste and and I hadn't thought
 
01:22:12.870 --> 01:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
about that but it might make sense to
 
01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
just change that line to say anyone who
 
01:22:18.110 --> 01:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
generates waste must separate hazardous
 
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
waste and hazardous materials again
 
01:22:21.790 --> 01:22:21.800 align:start position:0%
that's just sort of off the cuff I
 
01:22:24.590 --> 01:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
haven't thought about that but
 
01:22:30.270 --> 01:22:30.280 align:start position:0%
yeah I I I believe I would um amend this
 
01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
to say hazardous waste or and or
 
01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:34.550 align:start position:0%
to say hazardous waste or and or
hazardous

01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
hazardous
 
01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
materials because I mean clearly either
 
01:22:42.149 --> 01:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
of those things could occur uh when
 
01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:44.639 align:start position:0%
you're uh in the middle of demol you
 
01:22:47.550 --> 01:22:47.560 align:start position:0%
know demolishing a building right or
 
01:22:50.149 --> 01:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
structure whatever representative Howard
 
01:22:52.189 --> 01:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um so you said
 
01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
that the these rules already exist and
 
01:22:56.590 --> 01:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
that's across the whole span of of state
 
01:22:58.750 --> 01:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
public contracts to private contracts
 
01:23:01.669 --> 01:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
yes yeah any any business or government
 
01:23:04.030 --> 01:23:04.040 align:start position:0%
entity that generates waste must
 
01:23:05.470 --> 01:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
determine whether that waste is
 
01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
Katon thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:23:19.470 --> 01:23:19.480 align:start position:0%
for testimony and clarifying I'm
 
01:23:23.149 --> 01:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
just so it's already in statute yes
 
01:23:25.629 --> 01:23:25.639 align:start position:0%
and rules and
 
01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
rules so even if we added waste Andor
 
01:23:34.149 --> 01:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
material all we're doing is directing
 
01:23:37.709 --> 01:23:37.719 align:start position:0%
that it's in the contract right the way
 
01:23:39.470 --> 01:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
I read this the way I read this bill
 
01:23:41.790 --> 01:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
it's just changing contract language
 
01:23:44.350 --> 01:23:44.360 align:start position:0%
it's not requiring something new to be
 
01:23:45.910 --> 01:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
done it's just changing contract
 
01:23:48.830 --> 01:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
language that in my opinion might
 
01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
improve compliance with the already
 
01:23:52.510 --> 01:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
existing rules okay thank you so much
 
01:23:56.590 --> 01:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
okay represent Bixby all right so um it
 
01:24:00.669 --> 01:24:00.679 align:start position:0%
sounds like uh on on one level this has
 
01:24:04.229 --> 01:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
already been covered but uh do would you
 
01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
support the bill going forward as a way
 
01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
of uh improving compliance uh for
 
01:24:11.189 --> 01:24:11.199 align:start position:0%
something that's already in rules well I
 
01:24:12.830 --> 01:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
I haven't talked to the commissioner
 
01:24:15.189 --> 01:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
about whether or not DS would support or
 
01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
or not support anything but personally
 
01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
that's my opinion that that uh
 
01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
compliance could improve if that
 
01:24:23.110 --> 01:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
language is in
 
01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
contract and uh a followup followup so
 
01:24:32.950 --> 01:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
uh there was uh so the the the bill just
 
01:24:35.590 --> 01:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
aims at State contracts but if the rules
 
01:24:37.669 --> 01:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
already cover private contracts do you
 
01:24:40.950 --> 01:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
think it would make sense to expand the
 
01:24:43.189 --> 01:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
bill to cover private to required in
 
01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
private contracts or would that be
 
01:24:47.950 --> 01:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
opening up a a nest of possible
 
01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
complications that would yeah I'd have
 
01:24:52.030 --> 01:24:52.040 align:start position:0%
to look at the bill again but my my
 
01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:53.310 align:start position:0%
to look at the bill again but my my
understanding

01:24:53.310 --> 01:24:53.320 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:24:55.669 --> 01:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
is that the bill is is just amending an
 
01:24:58.229 --> 01:24:58.239 align:start position:0%
already existing RSA and I don't know
 
01:25:00.390 --> 01:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
how complicated we want to get with
 
01:25:03.510 --> 01:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
amending that RSA go ahead I just wanted
 
01:25:06.030 --> 01:25:06.040 align:start position:0%
to add that the the RSA that this amends
 
01:25:07.830 --> 01:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
is uh directed at Department of
 
01:25:09.790 --> 01:25:09.800 align:start position:0%
administrative services so it would it
 
01:25:11.310 --> 01:25:11.320 align:start position:0%
would only govern the contracts that
 
01:25:13.229 --> 01:25:13.239 align:start position:0%
department of administrative Services is
 
01:25:15.430 --> 01:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
responsible for um so making an
 
01:25:17.109 --> 01:25:17.119 align:start position:0%
amendment that covers businesses
 
01:25:19.350 --> 01:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't fit with the the
 
01:25:22.990 --> 01:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
overall uh content of that statute
 
01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
follow up so uh just we we heard
 
01:25:31.070 --> 01:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
testimony that um that there was the
 
01:25:33.310 --> 01:25:33.320 align:start position:0%
that the doj product is Project is being
 
01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
very well done and that some University
 
01:25:37.950 --> 01:25:37.960 align:start position:0%
projects have not been as well done
 
01:25:40.590 --> 01:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
would the department of of uh would
 
01:25:42.870 --> 01:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
would the department of administrative
 
01:25:45.189 --> 01:25:45.199 align:start position:0%
Services be overseeing those University
 
01:25:50.950 --> 01:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:53.629 --> 01:25:53.639 align:start position:0%
division um thank you uh representative
 
01:25:56.390 --> 01:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
Bix for the question I think it's a
 
01:25:59.270 --> 01:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
question of whether the department uh is
 
01:26:00.990 --> 01:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
providing oversight at the site of
 
01:26:03.270 --> 01:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
generation of the waste is that is that
 
01:26:06.510 --> 01:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
a fair characterization of your
 
01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
question so is essentially um it has to
 
01:26:14.910 --> 01:26:14.920 align:start position:0%
more to do with uh how broad the
 
01:26:17.189 --> 01:26:17.199 align:start position:0%
department of administrative Services
 
01:26:20.430 --> 01:26:20.440 align:start position:0%
reach over things that are state or
 
01:26:23.189 --> 01:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
state related is so
 
01:26:25.790 --> 01:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
would you would univers would the State
 
01:26:29.149 --> 01:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
University system fall under that their
 
01:26:31.229 --> 01:26:31.239 align:start position:0%
purview or would that be a separate
 
01:26:32.910 --> 01:26:32.920 align:start position:0%
thing that would need a separate it need
 
01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
to be in a separate section of law thank
 
01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
you for clarifying yeah that's a good
 
01:26:38.709 --> 01:26:38.719 align:start position:0%
question I I did before this hearing
 
01:26:42.109 --> 01:26:42.119 align:start position:0%
just look at RSA I believe it's RSA
 
01:26:45.910 --> 01:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
21 I forgot what the what the uh 21i 21i
 
01:26:48.590 --> 01:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
thank you um and it does specifically
 
01:26:51.590 --> 01:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
call out the State University system in
 
01:26:52.750 --> 01:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
kind of the introduction Rory language
 
01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:26:57.030 --> 01:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
statute and I just like to follow up on
 
01:26:59.550 --> 01:26:59.560 align:start position:0%
on that question that the example that
 
01:27:01.830 --> 01:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
was given about a what a dormatory
 
01:27:04.109 --> 01:27:04.119 align:start position:0%
that's just being demolished before any
 
01:27:05.950 --> 01:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
building is demolished they're required
 
01:27:09.149 --> 01:27:09.159 align:start position:0%
to file a permit with the air Resources
 
01:27:11.950 --> 01:27:11.960 align:start position:0%
Division of Dees that um that they're
 
01:27:13.669 --> 01:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
required to inspect for things like as
 
01:27:16.229 --> 01:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
Festus so I I can't speak much further
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
to that because I'm not in the air
 
01:27:19.510 --> 01:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
Resources Division but there is a
 
01:27:22.189 --> 01:27:22.199 align:start position:0%
process for evaluating as best as be
 
01:27:26.070 --> 01:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:29.790 --> 01:27:29.800 align:start position:0%
demolished okay um representative Penza
 
01:27:31.990 --> 01:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
Duty so just a quick question back to
 
01:27:38.590 --> 01:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
the bill so um so there would have to be
 
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
another RSA put in here because the RSA
 
01:27:43.510 --> 01:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
that is specific to that that is talking
 
01:27:46.629 --> 01:27:46.639 align:start position:0%
about those specific contracts are just
 
01:27:49.510 --> 01:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
underneath one area and under four state
 
01:27:51.870 --> 01:27:51.880 align:start position:0%
construction so because I'm saying it
 
01:27:54.430 --> 01:27:54.440 align:start position:0%
does make sense to have both you know
 
01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
private and state in here because it's
 
01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
already in um it's already in rules but
 
01:28:02.430 --> 01:28:02.440 align:start position:0%
this would have to be Rewritten because
 
01:28:04.229 --> 01:28:04.239 align:start position:0%
it's only talking about one specific
 
01:28:04.239 --> 01:28:05.950 align:start position:0%
it's only talking about one specific
statute

01:28:05.950 --> 01:28:05.960 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:28:08.350 --> 01:28:08.360 align:start position:0%
correct that's that's my understanding
 
01:28:10.830 --> 01:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
that this wouldn't um this would only
 
01:28:13.229 --> 01:28:13.239 align:start position:0%
apply to State
 
01:28:16.629 --> 01:28:16.639 align:start position:0%
contracts follow up follow up um my
 
01:28:19.590 --> 01:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
other question was about you um stated
 
01:28:22.709 --> 01:28:22.719 align:start position:0%
with resources how you have to before a
 
01:28:25.310 --> 01:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
demolition I know just a tiny bit about
 
01:28:27.790 --> 01:28:27.800 align:start position:0%
this so it's way more than just Aus any
 
01:28:30.229 --> 01:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
sort they have to evaluate any sort of
 
01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
hazardous materials that could be in
 
01:28:34.229 --> 01:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
that building to include you know with
 
01:28:36.709 --> 01:28:36.719 align:start position:0%
bricks and lead and all okay right I I
 
01:28:39.030 --> 01:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
was just using asbest as an example
 
01:28:40.669 --> 01:28:40.679 align:start position:0%
there's oil tanks in the basement they
 
01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
need to all that needs to be taken care
 
01:28:45.430 --> 01:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
of Representative
 
01:28:49.790 --> 01:28:49.800 align:start position:0%
Duty chair uh so uh does your division
 
01:28:53.310 --> 01:28:53.320 align:start position:0%
of EDS um Dees uh belong to the
 
01:28:55.070 --> 01:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
environmental Business Council and do
 
01:28:58.270 --> 01:28:58.280 align:start position:0%
you attend those meetings uh with their
 
01:29:00.629 --> 01:29:00.639 align:start position:0%
um construction debris
 
01:29:03.950 --> 01:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittees we have members uh we have
 
01:29:08.830 --> 01:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
employees who attend EBC uh meetings but
 
01:29:12.350 --> 01:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't think Mike does do you
 
01:29:13.830 --> 01:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
yeah in the solid waste Bureau we do
 
01:29:15.470 --> 01:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
have some staff that do monitor those
 
01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
events and and participate or have
 
01:29:20.830 --> 01:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
participated in the past okay just
 
01:29:24.030 --> 01:29:24.040 align:start position:0%
follow yeah could you speak um I I was
 
01:29:26.709 --> 01:29:26.719 align:start position:0%
really um delighted when I saw this bill
 
01:29:29.149 --> 01:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
because in the 5 years this is my sixth
 
01:29:30.669 --> 01:29:30.679 align:start position:0%
year that I've been here I don't think
 
01:29:32.709 --> 01:29:32.719 align:start position:0%
we've had any bills on construction
 
01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
debris and um you know I I'll just give
 
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
you an example I uh chair of the nashwa
 
01:29:40.910 --> 01:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission and we've been
 
01:29:42.830 --> 01:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
trying to get rid of railroad ties for
 
01:29:45.390 --> 01:29:45.400 align:start position:0%
three years um the railroad ties were
 
01:29:48.310 --> 01:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
used in the 1970s to you know create a
 
01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
trail and and they um and I mean it's
 
01:29:54.229 --> 01:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
been I mean they're still sitting there
 
01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
and we think we have someplace that'll
 
01:29:58.910 --> 01:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
take it and yada yada yada so I mean and
 
01:30:02.669 --> 01:30:02.679 align:start position:0%
and having attended some of those EBC um
 
01:30:05.229 --> 01:30:05.239 align:start position:0%
meetings um I mean it it just seems to
 
01:30:08.109 --> 01:30:08.119 align:start position:0%
me like this is a huge issue in New
 
01:30:11.030 --> 01:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
England um and if New Hampshire doesn't
 
01:30:14.270 --> 01:30:14.280 align:start position:0%
start to get ahead of it um we are and I
 
01:30:16.030 --> 01:30:16.040 align:start position:0%
think we already are The Dumping grounds
 
01:30:18.750 --> 01:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
I think um representative cluer what he
 
01:30:21.350 --> 01:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
was alluding to in Claremont is
 
01:30:24.070 --> 01:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
basically a private company that is
 
01:30:26.270 --> 01:30:26.280 align:start position:0%
accepting construction debris from
 
01:30:29.629 --> 01:30:29.639 align:start position:0%
probably out of state okay and disposing
 
01:30:32.229 --> 01:30:32.239 align:start position:0%
of it or or managing it somehow in in
 
01:30:35.470 --> 01:30:35.480 align:start position:0%
the Claremont area so could you um while
 
01:30:37.510 --> 01:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
you're here just speak to that broader
 
01:30:40.830 --> 01:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
issue so the committee might be uh able
 
01:30:42.790 --> 01:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
to understand better what our role could
 
01:30:44.350 --> 01:30:44.360 align:start position:0%
be in the
 
01:30:46.470 --> 01:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
future uh thank you representative Duty
 
01:30:47.950 --> 01:30:47.960 align:start position:0%
for the question I I'm happy to to
 
01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
address that to some degree I I
 
01:30:52.390 --> 01:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
think uh
 
01:30:54.030 --> 01:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
you know there are obviously challenges
 
01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
with Solid Waste Management in the state
 
01:30:56.830 --> 01:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire construction and
 
01:31:00.629 --> 01:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
demolition debris is no no exception um
 
01:31:02.629 --> 01:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
and I believe there was a testimony
 
01:31:03.709 --> 01:31:03.719 align:start position:0%
previously saying that there are
 
01:31:05.390 --> 01:31:05.400 align:start position:0%
facilities in New Hampshire that have
 
01:31:08.709 --> 01:31:08.719 align:start position:0%
been developed to encourage diversion of
 
01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
solid of uh construction and demolition
 
01:31:12.070 --> 01:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
debris so facilities like the one in
 
01:31:15.510 --> 01:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
eping uh that takes in construction and
 
01:31:17.229 --> 01:31:17.239 align:start position:0%
demolition debris but also separates out
 
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
certain components to be recycled or
 
01:31:22.990 --> 01:31:23.000 align:start position:0%
reused for for uh you know to to avoid
 
01:31:24.990 --> 01:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
disposal in the landfill to the extent
 
01:31:27.870 --> 01:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
possible um you know that's something
 
01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
that I think the department can say we
 
01:31:32.590 --> 01:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
would like to see more of that activity
 
01:31:34.390 --> 01:31:34.400 align:start position:0%
happening across the state but we need
 
01:31:36.149 --> 01:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
more infrastructure to make that happen
 
01:31:38.750 --> 01:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
so um you know there's definitely
 
01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
opportunities to increase recycling of
 
01:31:43.149 --> 01:31:43.159 align:start position:0%
construction and demolition debris uh
 
01:31:45.870 --> 01:31:45.880 align:start position:0%
but that also comes with challenges so I
 
01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
hope that that sort of addresses your
 
01:31:55.189 --> 01:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
so as I understand this particular um
 
01:32:07.669 --> 01:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:07.679 --> 01:32:09.629 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:32:09.629 --> 01:32:09.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:12.990 --> 01:32:13.000 align:start position:0%
requiring State contracts through this
 
01:32:16.030 --> 01:32:16.040 align:start position:0%
department of administrative Services
 
01:32:18.070 --> 01:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
statute um
 
01:32:21.390 --> 01:32:21.400 align:start position:0%
to uh separate hazardous waste hazardous
 
01:32:26.149 --> 01:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
mat material if we wanted to expand this
 
01:32:28.229 --> 01:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
out to
 
01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
require not only state but Municipal and
 
01:32:35.590 --> 01:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
County projects we would have to go to
 
01:32:39.390 --> 01:32:39.400 align:start position:0%
another part of Statute to possibly
 
01:32:41.950 --> 01:32:41.960 align:start position:0%
insert language to do
 
01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
that I I'm not I believe so but I'm not
 
01:32:48.830 --> 01:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not 100% sure okay I guess that's
 
01:32:51.950 --> 01:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
something we'll have to I would just add
 
01:32:54.629 --> 01:32:54.639 align:start position:0%
or somebody yeah I'm not clear that
 
01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
there is a state statute that governs
 
01:33:00.990 --> 01:33:01.000 align:start position:0%
contracts for counties or even just the
 
01:33:02.470 --> 01:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
private sector I'm not aware think there
 
01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:04.550 align:start position:0%
private sector I'm not aware think there
are

01:33:04.550 --> 01:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:33:09.030 --> 01:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
actually yeah yeah anyway just thinking
 
01:33:10.709 --> 01:33:10.719 align:start position:0%
out loud thank
 
01:33:13.629 --> 01:33:13.639 align:start position:0%
you any other questions or
 
01:33:16.550 --> 01:33:16.560 align:start position:0%

up this afternoon with our hearing for
 
03:03:46.600 --> 03:03:47.870 align:start position:0%
up this afternoon with our hearing for
HB

03:03:47.870 --> 03:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
HB
 
03:03:50.269 --> 03:03:50.279 align:start position:0%
1132 relative to permits for the
 
03:03:51.510 --> 03:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
sighting of new
 
03:03:54.269 --> 03:03:54.279 align:start position:0%
landfills and here to introduce the bill
 
03:03:57.030 --> 03:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
is representative mamila good afternoon
 
03:03:59.870 --> 03:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
and welcome good afternoon Madam chair

and good afternoon esteemed members of
 
03:04:05.070 --> 03:04:05.080 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm representative Linda

one um thank you for giving me this
 
03:04:14.349 --> 03:04:14.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh HB
 
03:04:19.269 --> 03:04:19.279 align:start position:0%
1132 is easy to support because the bill
 
03:04:21.750 --> 03:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
fills the Gap in our states already
 
03:04:24.750 --> 03:04:24.760 align:start position:0%
existing Brownfield incentive
 
03:04:27.590 --> 03:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
programs it will help ensure the future
 
03:04:29.630 --> 03:04:29.640 align:start position:0%
that future landfill development is
 
03:04:32.870 --> 03:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
cited in places with the potential to
 
03:04:35.710 --> 03:04:35.720 align:start position:0%
minimize negative impacts on the
 
03:04:37.830 --> 03:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
environment public health and the
 
03:04:39.190 --> 03:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
quality of

brownfields over Greenfield sites they

potential development on a Brownfield
 
03:09:53.910 --> 03:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
site for example the site could be much
 
03:09:55.750 --> 03:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
cheaper as a
 
03:09:58.550 --> 03:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
landfill the upside of considering
 
03:10:01.870 --> 03:10:01.880 align:start position:0%
Brownfield sites for other purposes such
 
03:10:05.309 --> 03:10:05.319 align:start position:0%
as solar arrays could offer unrealized

03:10:17.550 --> 03:10:17.560 align:start position:0%
as a matter of
 
03:10:21.150 --> 03:10:21.160 align:start position:0%
policy we as legislator legislators
 
03:10:23.950 --> 03:10:23.960 align:start position:0%
should prefer that Brownfield sites be
 
03:10:26.950 --> 03:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
considered for landfills or alternative
 
03:10:29.469 --> 03:10:29.479 align:start position:0%
projects like solar arrays instead of
 
03:10:32.750 --> 03:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
using Green Field sites our state's
 
03:10:36.030 --> 03:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
economy thrives in large part on the
 
03:10:39.429 --> 03:10:39.439 align:start position:0%
outdoor recre recreational opportunities
 
03:10:43.150 --> 03:10:43.160 align:start position:0%
that come from having as much pristine
 
03:10:46.990 --> 03:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
environment as we have our residents
 
03:10:49.870 --> 03:10:49.880 align:start position:0%
demand and deserve to have their health
 
03:10:53.070 --> 03:10:53.080 align:start position:0%
and quality of life protected we owe
 
03:10:56.590 --> 03:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
this to the environment to ourselves and
 
03:10:58.750 --> 03:10:58.760 align:start position:0%
especially to Future
 
03:11:01.269 --> 03:11:01.279 align:start position:0%
Generations thank you thank you
 
03:11:03.590 --> 03:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
representative massila
 
03:11:07.030 --> 03:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
um now do first of all do you have
 
03:11:10.750 --> 03:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
written copy of your okay my uh comp
 
03:11:13.590 --> 03:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
printer broke so I'll take my so she can
 
03:11:13.600 --> 03:11:14.469 align:start position:0%
printer broke so I'll take my so she can
take

03:11:14.469 --> 03:11:14.479 align:start position:0%
take
 
03:11:17.910 --> 03:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
that afterwards I have a question though
 
03:11:20.389 --> 03:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
in so far as like how would this work
 
03:11:23.190 --> 03:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
because as far as I
 
03:11:25.590 --> 03:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
understand um somebody buys a piece of
 
03:11:27.469 --> 03:11:27.479 align:start position:0%
land and decides they want to make a
 
03:11:30.469 --> 03:11:30.479 align:start position:0%
landfill out of it and maybe applies for
 
03:11:33.030 --> 03:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
a permit and goes through whatever the
 
03:11:35.190 --> 03:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
process is
 
03:11:39.950 --> 03:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
so at what point would would the state
 
03:11:44.830 --> 03:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
then be asking them to use a different
 
03:11:47.550 --> 03:11:47.560 align:start position:0%
piece of land which they would have to
 
03:11:49.830 --> 03:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
purchase what would happen is it would
 
03:11:52.389 --> 03:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
be part of the process they already have
 
03:11:54.870 --> 03:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
to if there's a Wetlands involved they
 
03:11:56.750 --> 03:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
have to go through a particular
 
03:11:59.950 --> 03:11:59.960 align:start position:0%
procedure when they're um going to site
 
03:12:03.190 --> 03:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
land near uh a landfill near wetlands
 
03:12:05.950 --> 03:12:05.960 align:start position:0%
and this would just be similar procedure
 
03:12:08.670 --> 03:12:08.680 align:start position:0%
only now you're looking at Brownfield
 
03:12:13.030 --> 03:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
sites um like I said the dees does list
 
03:12:15.269 --> 03:12:15.279 align:start position:0%
what the Brownfield sites are and
 
03:12:17.710 --> 03:12:17.720 align:start position:0%
therefore they could utilize that
 
03:12:21.510 --> 03:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
information to find out if it would be
 
03:12:24.550 --> 03:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
suitable for their
 
03:12:28.429 --> 03:12:28.439 align:start position:0%
project okay representative ktoa thank
 
03:12:30.309 --> 03:12:30.319 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you so much
 
03:12:32.349 --> 03:12:32.359 align:start position:0%
for being here
 
03:12:35.670 --> 03:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
um I have basically two questions the
 
03:12:38.710 --> 03:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
first one is is what is the typical
 
03:12:41.630 --> 03:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
acreage of a landfill site
 
03:12:44.670 --> 03:12:44.680 align:start position:0%
currently um that's a very good question
 
03:12:47.070 --> 03:12:47.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm I've got some people behind
 
03:12:48.950 --> 03:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
me that can give you more detailed
 
03:12:51.269 --> 03:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
information hey thank
 
03:12:54.349 --> 03:12:54.359 align:start position:0%
you representative Howard thank you
 
03:12:57.349 --> 03:12:57.359 align:start position:0%
madam chair um I have two questions too
 
03:13:00.870 --> 03:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
so um do brownfields typically require
 
03:13:03.070 --> 03:13:03.080 align:start position:0%
mitigation I can't hear you sorry I'm
 
03:13:05.269 --> 03:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
sorry do do uh brownfields typically
 
03:13:07.550 --> 03:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
require mitigation before they're used
 
03:13:12.070 --> 03:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
for other purposes um I'm not again I'm
 
03:13:13.870 --> 03:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
not sure I'll defer to the people
 
03:13:14.990 --> 03:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
because I'm just wondering if if that
 
03:13:16.790 --> 03:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
would add to the expense of a land
 
03:13:18.670 --> 03:13:18.680 align:start position:0%
landfill site if they have to mitigate
 
03:13:21.469 --> 03:13:21.479 align:start position:0%
it first um I I understand that that you
 
03:13:23.710 --> 03:13:23.720 align:start position:0%
would want to use a Brownfield in order
 
03:13:26.110 --> 03:13:26.120 align:start position:0%
to um take advantage of the fact that
 
03:13:28.750 --> 03:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
it's already polluted but I just wonder
 
03:13:30.229 --> 03:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
if there depending on what the pollution
 
03:13:32.190 --> 03:13:32.200 align:start position:0%
is I wonder if it needs to be mitigated
 
03:13:33.990 --> 03:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
the other one is um do they are they
 
03:13:36.429 --> 03:13:36.439 align:start position:0%
typically near Urban centers are there
 
03:13:38.670 --> 03:13:38.680 align:start position:0%
what typically near Urban
 
03:13:41.790 --> 03:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
centers um we have a Brownfield site in
 
03:13:41.800 --> 03:13:43.349 align:start position:0%
centers um we have a Brownfield site in
Littleton

03:13:43.349 --> 03:13:43.359 align:start position:0%
Littleton
 
03:13:45.790 --> 03:13:45.800 align:start position:0%
uh unfortunately it's close to the amk
 
03:13:49.150 --> 03:13:49.160 align:start position:0%
river but um I don't know I can't tell
 
03:13:50.990 --> 03:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
you whether it is or not I can only
 
03:13:54.469 --> 03:13:54.479 align:start position:0%
speak from my personal
 
03:13:57.469 --> 03:13:57.479 align:start position:0%
experience representative ger thank you
 
03:13:59.150 --> 03:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you representative
 
03:14:01.950 --> 03:14:01.960 align:start position:0%
Mass Miller for uh presenting this bill
 
03:14:05.190 --> 03:14:05.200 align:start position:0%
to us um and for taking my question I
 
03:14:06.830 --> 03:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering and this may be a question
 
03:14:08.670 --> 03:14:08.680 align:start position:0%
that is better directed toward some of
 
03:14:11.030 --> 03:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
the folks from Dees but I'm wondering if
 
03:14:13.349 --> 03:14:13.359 align:start position:0%
you know if we were to consider
 
03:14:15.389 --> 03:14:15.399 align:start position:0%
Brownfield sites for where a landfill
 
03:14:18.309 --> 03:14:18.319 align:start position:0%
would go if this would complicate in any
 
03:14:21.429 --> 03:14:21.439 align:start position:0%
way our ability to monitor potential
 
03:14:25.349 --> 03:14:25.359 align:start position:0%
leaks for example from a landfill uh in
 
03:14:27.429 --> 03:14:27.439 align:start position:0%
terms of you know there being underlying
 
03:14:30.269 --> 03:14:30.279 align:start position:0%
contaminants that would come up uh in
 
03:14:32.110 --> 03:14:32.120 align:start position:0%
tests and could complicate the process
 
03:14:35.110 --> 03:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
and and what comes to my mind is for
 
03:14:38.469 --> 03:14:38.479 align:start position:0%
example some right now question about
 
03:14:41.870 --> 03:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
some uh uh chemicals that are leaking
 
03:14:44.229 --> 03:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
into the am usk right out of Bethlehem
 
03:14:46.110 --> 03:14:46.120 align:start position:0%
and and this is as a result of the fact
 
03:14:48.510 --> 03:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
that we put aligned landfill over right
 
03:14:50.429 --> 03:14:50.439 align:start position:0%
the previous unlined landfill that had
 
03:14:52.309 --> 03:14:52.319 align:start position:0%
existed so that's creating some
 
03:14:54.630 --> 03:14:54.640 align:start position:0%
confusion because then when we look at
 
03:14:57.550 --> 03:14:57.560 align:start position:0%
some of the seepage into the river
 
03:14:59.590 --> 03:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
there's this question of well is that
 
03:15:01.990 --> 03:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
the current landfill that is leaking or
 
03:15:05.269 --> 03:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
is that the result of residual chemicals
 
03:15:07.870 --> 03:15:07.880 align:start position:0%
from the previous unline landfill so I'm
 
03:15:09.670 --> 03:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
wondering if you know if we put a
 
03:15:12.190 --> 03:15:12.200 align:start position:0%
landfill on top of a Brownfield site
 
03:15:14.990 --> 03:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
does do it raise
 
03:15:18.750 --> 03:15:18.760 align:start position:0%
potential issues around being able to
 
03:15:21.349 --> 03:15:21.359 align:start position:0%
adequately deter you know monitor
 
03:15:23.510 --> 03:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
potential uh seepage or leaks in the
 
03:15:26.830 --> 03:15:26.840 align:start position:0%
future that's a very good question um I
 
03:15:29.950 --> 03:15:29.960 align:start position:0%
would assume that if a a new landfill
 
03:15:32.510 --> 03:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
was going to be put in on top of an old
 
03:15:35.750 --> 03:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
landfill site because it would be modern
 
03:15:40.110 --> 03:15:40.120 align:start position:0%
more up to date um the liners would be
 
03:15:43.830 --> 03:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
more in aign with what is expected now
 
03:15:46.389 --> 03:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
that that problem would be taken care of
 
03:15:49.030 --> 03:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
as far as the old landfill I would
 
03:15:50.870 --> 03:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
assume there would have to be some sort
 
03:15:55.189 --> 03:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
of monitoring either V Via de uh Dees or
 
03:15:59.229 --> 03:15:59.239 align:start position:0%
the landfill developer thank you very
 
03:16:02.229 --> 03:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
much representative Murray thank you
 
03:16:04.110 --> 03:16:04.120 align:start position:0%
madam chair for taking my question and
 
03:16:05.830 --> 03:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for also taking
 
03:16:08.830 --> 03:16:08.840 align:start position:0%
my question um so I'm curious to know um
 
03:16:11.469 --> 03:16:11.479 align:start position:0%
I know that uh and maybe this again is a
 
03:16:13.189 --> 03:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
question for the Department
 
03:16:16.590 --> 03:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
but um that many of our Brownfield sites
 
03:16:19.229 --> 03:16:19.239 align:start position:0%
have oversight with federal agencies as
 
03:16:20.790 --> 03:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
well so I was just
 
03:16:24.670 --> 03:16:24.680 align:start position:0%
curious how this would like interact
 
03:16:25.830 --> 03:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
with that
 
03:16:28.309 --> 03:16:28.319 align:start position:0%
relationship I I would assume but I'm
 
03:16:31.269 --> 03:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
not sure so like you said Dees can
 
03:16:33.349 --> 03:16:33.359 align:start position:0%
probably answer this better than me I
 
03:16:36.590 --> 03:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
would assume there would be some federal
 
03:16:40.030 --> 03:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
um oversight that would supersede the
 
03:16:42.790 --> 03:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
states but I'm not sure
 
03:16:44.990 --> 03:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
okay representative H Haskins thank you
 
03:16:46.830 --> 03:16:46.840 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you representative
 
03:16:49.710 --> 03:16:49.720 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm assuming too
 
03:16:53.870 --> 03:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
that the mitigation process would
 
03:16:58.110 --> 03:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
involve um history with
 
03:17:01.590 --> 03:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
other um sites that have been
 
03:17:04.189 --> 03:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
redeveloped and there may even be some
 
03:17:06.670 --> 03:17:06.680 align:start position:0%
federal money involved to do that but
 
03:17:09.189 --> 03:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
the mitigation should take care of what
 
03:17:12.990 --> 03:17:13.000 align:start position:0%
the representative's question was um
 
03:17:15.550 --> 03:17:15.560 align:start position:0%
that the applicant would be responsible
 
03:17:18.110 --> 03:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
for I would tend to agree with that
 
03:17:18.120 --> 03:17:19.070 align:start position:0%
for I would tend to agree with that
thank

03:17:19.070 --> 03:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:17:22.229 --> 03:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
you any other questions represent
 
03:17:27.030 --> 03:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
Duty um did you have uh Dees input into
 
03:17:27.040 --> 03:17:27.790 align:start position:0%
Duty um did you have uh Dees input into
the

03:17:27.790 --> 03:17:27.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:17:27.800 --> 03:17:29.510 align:start position:0%
the
bill

03:17:29.510 --> 03:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:17:33.630 --> 03:17:33.640 align:start position:0%
no any uh the the reason I ask I mean
 
03:17:35.590 --> 03:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
first of all regarding Brown sites I
 
03:17:37.469 --> 03:17:37.479 align:start position:0%
mean we have brown we have Brownfield
 
03:17:38.950 --> 03:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
sites all over the place I mean I think
 
03:17:41.670 --> 03:17:41.680 align:start position:0%
Nashville has probably I don't know 24
 
03:17:44.469 --> 03:17:44.479 align:start position:0%
they build houses on them um and I'm not
 
03:17:46.550 --> 03:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
joking about that but I mean the fact of
 
03:17:49.189 --> 03:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
the matter is is that developers do come
 
03:17:53.269 --> 03:17:53.279 align:start position:0%
in and they create a mitigation plan for
 
03:17:56.389 --> 03:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
the area that has been contaminated and
 
03:17:58.150 --> 03:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
then they you know and they build around
 
03:18:00.790 --> 03:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
it um but you know one of the things
 
03:18:03.389 --> 03:18:03.399 align:start position:0%
that I see with this and I think other
 
03:18:06.389 --> 03:18:06.399 align:start position:0%
people have raised it is that there's
 
03:18:09.389 --> 03:18:09.399 align:start position:0%
although it looks like a great solution
 
03:18:11.670 --> 03:18:11.680 align:start position:0%
I think there's a lot of underlying
 
03:18:16.110 --> 03:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
Maybe economic um issues that would have
 
03:18:20.189 --> 03:18:20.199 align:start position:0%
to be uh maybe in rule making uh so I
 
03:18:23.389 --> 03:18:23.399 align:start position:0%
think it's really important for us to be
 
03:18:26.269 --> 03:18:26.279 align:start position:0%
able to get some feedback from Dees on
 
03:18:29.670 --> 03:18:29.680 align:start position:0%
how they perceive this I I agree but I
 
03:18:32.830 --> 03:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
think that this is just another tool in
 
03:18:36.790 --> 03:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
the permit application process that Dees
 
03:18:41.349 --> 03:18:41.359 align:start position:0%
can then factor in to the permit release
 
03:18:43.389 --> 03:18:43.399 align:start position:0%
and I think that the more knowledge you
 
03:18:47.870 --> 03:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
have the better it is for the developer
 
03:18:51.070 --> 03:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
for the department and also for the
 
03:18:53.830 --> 03:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
people who are going to be affected by
 
03:18:56.469 --> 03:18:56.479 align:start position:0%
it representative
 
03:18:59.229 --> 03:18:59.239 align:start position:0%
Howard in the implementation of this
 
03:19:01.990 --> 03:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
bill is there any way to is there any
 
03:19:04.389 --> 03:19:04.399 align:start position:0%
reward or incentive to take to choose
 
03:19:08.229 --> 03:19:08.239 align:start position:0%
Brown site over your original Green site
 
03:19:10.349 --> 03:19:10.359 align:start position:0%
um like I said there are programs
 
03:19:12.469 --> 03:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
available through the federal government
 
03:19:14.429 --> 03:19:14.439 align:start position:0%
and through the state that offer
 
03:19:18.070 --> 03:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
incentives and help support exploring
 
03:19:18.080 --> 03:19:20.269 align:start position:0%
incentives and help support exploring
Brownfield

03:19:20.269 --> 03:19:20.279 align:start position:0%
Brownfield
 
03:19:23.630 --> 03:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
sites any other questions from the
 
03:19:25.990 --> 03:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you so much
 
03:19:28.150 --> 03:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
for coming and introducing the Bill
 
03:19:30.030 --> 03:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
thank you all for your time and for
 
03:19:32.790 --> 03:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
listen our questions appreciate okay I'm

bill
 
03:19:41.040 --> 03:19:43.910 align:start position:0%
bill
welcome

03:19:43.910 --> 03:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
03:19:47.070 --> 03:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and members of the
 
03:19:50.030 --> 03:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
committee uh before I speak about
 
03:19:54.349 --> 03:19:54.359 align:start position:0%
11:32 I just wanted to uh speak to the
 
03:19:56.349 --> 03:19:56.359 align:start position:0%
committee in general and just thank you
 
03:19:58.710 --> 03:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
over the last number of years there's
 
03:20:01.389 --> 03:20:01.399 align:start position:0%
been uh a lot of discussion in relation
 
03:20:05.670 --> 03:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
to Solid Waste in relation to pasas and
 
03:20:07.309 --> 03:20:07.319 align:start position:0%
certainly a lot of discussion around out
 
03:20:10.349 --> 03:20:10.359 align:start position:0%
ofate waste and four or five years ago
 
03:20:12.630 --> 03:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
these issues were certainly were not top
 
03:20:15.150 --> 03:20:15.160 align:start position:0%
of mind for the State of New Hampshire
 
03:20:17.110 --> 03:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
uh but they are now and and they are
 
03:20:18.990 --> 03:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
largely because of the the efforts of
 
03:20:21.349 --> 03:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
this group so regardless of what side of
 
03:20:23.030 --> 03:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
the aisle that you're on regardless of
 
03:20:25.030 --> 03:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
how you voted in these proposed bills
 
03:20:27.349 --> 03:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
over the last number of years I've seen
 
03:20:29.229 --> 03:20:29.239 align:start position:0%
a very functional committee work very
 
03:20:31.030 --> 03:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
hard to listen to what's going on across
 
03:20:32.990 --> 03:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
the state and to try to reach some level
 
03:20:35.750 --> 03:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
of compromise in the best interest of
 
03:20:37.830 --> 03:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire so on behalf
 
03:20:39.469 --> 03:20:39.479 align:start position:0%
of certainly the group that I represent
 
03:20:41.990 --> 03:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
which is ncbc for the record my name is
 
03:20:45.469 --> 03:20:45.479 align:start position:0%
is Tom Tower I reside in Whitefield New
 
03:20:48.110 --> 03:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Mr Tower could you please tell
 
03:20:51.189 --> 03:20:51.199 align:start position:0%
us what NC ABC stands for thank you
 
03:20:53.550 --> 03:20:53.560 align:start position:0%
madam chair it stands for North Country
 
03:20:56.590 --> 03:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
Alliance for balanced change my uh
 
03:20:58.590 --> 03:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
formal testimony has been uploaded
 
03:21:00.870 --> 03:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
online and I am just going to speak at a
 
03:21:02.830 --> 03:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
very high level to many of the things
 
03:21:04.710 --> 03:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
that representative massamilla just
 
03:21:07.150 --> 03:21:07.160 align:start position:0%
spoke about so the first thing that I'll
 
03:21:09.030 --> 03:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
mention is
 
03:21:14.309 --> 03:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
um when you look at call it solid waste
 
03:21:17.389 --> 03:21:17.399 align:start position:0%
sites or or brown fields and we look at
 
03:21:18.710 --> 03:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
as an example
 
03:21:21.110 --> 03:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
now what's happened this morning with
 
03:21:23.309 --> 03:21:23.319 align:start position:0%
the discussion in relation to uh
 
03:21:25.830 --> 03:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
hazardous materials hazardous
 
03:21:31.189 --> 03:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
waste um there never ever should be a
 
03:21:35.550 --> 03:21:35.560 align:start position:0%
consideration for a green field landfill
 
03:21:39.030 --> 03:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
all other efforts need to be explored in
 
03:21:43.429 --> 03:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
order to not uh put these hazardous
 
03:21:46.189 --> 03:21:46.199 align:start position:0%
chemicals into the ground anywhere
 
03:21:48.110 --> 03:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
that's considered a green field right
 
03:21:50.070 --> 03:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
green fields are at a premium green
 
03:21:51.870 --> 03:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
fields are something that we need to
 
03:21:54.309 --> 03:21:54.319 align:start position:0%
protect representative Masa Miller spoke
 
03:21:56.189 --> 03:21:56.199 align:start position:0%
about the the the mission of the
 
03:21:58.870 --> 03:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
department around protecting health and
 
03:22:00.389 --> 03:22:00.399 align:start position:0%
the environment and that's what we
 
03:22:03.550 --> 03:22:03.560 align:start position:0%
should be doing first and foremost so
 
03:22:07.269 --> 03:22:07.279 align:start position:0%
Brownfield uh Brownfield sites are just
 
03:22:10.030 --> 03:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
an option as what was described earlier
 
03:22:12.790 --> 03:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
for the Department to put in place some
 
03:22:16.910 --> 03:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
mechanism so that a a prop a potential
 
03:22:19.950 --> 03:22:19.960 align:start position:0%
landfill uh uh proposal right a proposal
 
03:22:23.349 --> 03:22:23.359 align:start position:0%
for new landfill is actually considering
 
03:22:24.910 --> 03:22:24.920 align:start position:0%
just like they would Wetlands
 
03:22:26.910 --> 03:22:26.920 align:start position:0%
implications that they consider an
 
03:22:28.870 --> 03:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
alternate site that includes a site that
 
03:22:31.790 --> 03:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
is basically already in essence very
 
03:22:34.469 --> 03:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
limited to what it can provide the site
 
03:22:36.990 --> 03:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
can be revitalized if used as a as a
 
03:22:39.870 --> 03:22:39.880 align:start position:0%
landfill it could bring value if used as
 
03:22:43.030 --> 03:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
a landfill so in essence that's really
 
03:22:46.309 --> 03:22:46.319 align:start position:0%
what this is all about is is to ensure
 
03:22:48.630 --> 03:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
one that Greenfield sites are not
 
03:22:51.510 --> 03:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
considered for these you know hazardous
 
03:22:53.510 --> 03:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
facilities now and there's a lot of
 
03:22:55.670 --> 03:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
debate on what you know hazardous
 
03:22:57.309 --> 03:22:57.319 align:start position:0%
actually means and the definition was
 
03:23:00.189 --> 03:23:00.199 align:start position:0%
debated this morning but these sites
 
03:23:02.990 --> 03:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
once they are cited as landfills will in
 
03:23:05.030 --> 03:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
essence be considered a Brownfield and
 
03:23:07.510 --> 03:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
for all intent and purposes be almost a
 
03:23:10.269 --> 03:23:10.279 align:start position:0%
dead site excuse me to do anything
 
03:23:12.830 --> 03:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
else um
 
03:23:15.030 --> 03:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
there are some examples of of where this
 
03:23:18.630 --> 03:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
has been considered uh there is a uh a
 
03:23:20.750 --> 03:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
uh a landfill developer now that's
 
03:23:22.469 --> 03:23:22.479 align:start position:0%
looking to revitalize a site in
 
03:23:25.070 --> 03:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh in Hardwick it's a
 
03:23:28.070 --> 03:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
Brownfield site and what better place to
 
03:23:30.110 --> 03:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
site a landfill than what was a
 
03:23:32.110 --> 03:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
previously cited landfill if there's an
 
03:23:34.030 --> 03:23:34.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity of course all the other
 
03:23:37.030 --> 03:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
things that are considered um those are
 
03:23:39.229 --> 03:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
the places that should be considered at
 
03:23:42.030 --> 03:23:42.040 align:start position:0%
least part of the process right now that
 
03:23:43.750 --> 03:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
that is not part of the process and so
 
03:23:45.990 --> 03:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
what this Bill is saying and I'm sure we
 
03:23:47.510 --> 03:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
can debate it you guys will debate it
 
03:23:50.110 --> 03:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
all day long it may not be perfect but
 
03:23:52.349 --> 03:23:52.359 align:start position:0%
it needs to be considered because right
 
03:23:55.510 --> 03:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
now Green Field sites for landfills is
 
03:23:58.870 --> 03:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
just wrong and I'm happy to take any
 
03:23:58.880 --> 03:24:01.030 align:start position:0%
just wrong and I'm happy to take any
questions

03:24:01.030 --> 03:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:24:05.550 --> 03:24:05.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:10.269 --> 03:24:10.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:12.710 --> 03:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
Penza s just trying to think of the
 
03:24:15.510 --> 03:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
process piece of this
 
03:24:20.429 --> 03:24:20.439 align:start position:0%
so so usually when um from my knowledge
 
03:24:24.510 --> 03:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
when someone is putting in uh a a permit
 
03:24:27.150 --> 03:24:27.160 align:start position:0%
application um at that point they
 
03:24:29.750 --> 03:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
haven't necessarily purchased let's say
 
03:24:33.150 --> 03:24:33.160 align:start position:0%
the Green Field Land right yeah so um
 
03:24:35.150 --> 03:24:35.160 align:start position:0%
they have to you know do a lot of work
 
03:24:36.870 --> 03:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
but then you know have to justify and
 
03:24:37.990 --> 03:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of different things that
 
03:24:41.670 --> 03:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
have to be so how would underneath our
 
03:24:44.750 --> 03:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
current landfill process which is in a
 
03:24:46.910 --> 03:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
sense private
 
03:24:50.510 --> 03:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
ownership would Dees be able to through
 
03:24:52.150 --> 03:24:52.160 align:start position:0%
this bill I want to make sure that it's
 
03:24:57.269 --> 03:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
doing its say hey there are six sites
 
03:25:01.389 --> 03:25:01.399 align:start position:0%
here that are an opportunity for uh you
 
03:25:03.269 --> 03:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
to look at is is that what you're
 
03:25:05.110 --> 03:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
thinking that this could possibly do
 
03:25:07.389 --> 03:25:07.399 align:start position:0%
that we take the massive amounts of
 
03:25:09.670 --> 03:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
brown sites here in New Hampshire and or
 
03:25:12.389 --> 03:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
Brownfield sites and say
 
03:25:15.150 --> 03:25:15.160 align:start position:0%
these are possibly an option would you
 
03:25:18.990 --> 03:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
indirect a a private permitter to to
 
03:25:21.389 --> 03:25:21.399 align:start position:0%
look at them thank you for the question
 
03:25:24.070 --> 03:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
representative um I I think as as part
 
03:25:26.469 --> 03:25:26.479 align:start position:0%
of the process it it wouldn't be
 
03:25:28.870 --> 03:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily direct them but as part of
 
03:25:31.550 --> 03:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
the permit application that that would
 
03:25:33.550 --> 03:25:33.560 align:start position:0%
be one of the boxes that that they would
 
03:25:35.229 --> 03:25:35.239 align:start position:0%
need to check off and that they have
 
03:25:37.910 --> 03:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
previously evaluated a Brownfield site
 
03:25:40.469 --> 03:25:40.479 align:start position:0%
as a potential site for the landfill
 
03:25:43.150 --> 03:25:43.160 align:start position:0%
right now nobody's looking at that why
 
03:25:44.750 --> 03:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we be looking at them if we've
 
03:25:46.309 --> 03:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
got over a hundred across the state of
 
03:25:48.429 --> 03:25:48.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I'm I'm sure they're all
 
03:25:51.030 --> 03:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
there for various reasons they should be
 
03:25:52.910 --> 03:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
examined anyway before we ever put a
 
03:25:54.990 --> 03:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
shovel in the ground to destroy a
 
03:25:55.000 --> 03:25:57.630 align:start position:0%
shovel in the ground to destroy a
Greenfield

03:25:57.630 --> 03:25:57.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:00.110 --> 03:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
site representative
 
03:26:04.030 --> 03:26:04.040 align:start position:0%
Duty uh thank you madam chair um based
 
03:26:06.150 --> 03:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
on your knowledge of
 
03:26:09.189 --> 03:26:09.199 align:start position:0%
brownfields uh is there already I would
 
03:26:10.790 --> 03:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
I would expect but I don't know isn't
 
03:26:14.269 --> 03:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
there already a lot of data uh regarding
 
03:26:17.550 --> 03:26:17.560 align:start position:0%
that site that has to be created when
 
03:26:21.309 --> 03:26:21.319 align:start position:0%
they're um when they want to look at the
 
03:26:23.189 --> 03:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
you know Brownfield and figure out
 
03:26:27.469 --> 03:26:27.479 align:start position:0%
what's there so I would assume that
 
03:26:29.710 --> 03:26:29.720 align:start position:0%
anybody wanting to purchase that land
 
03:26:31.630 --> 03:26:31.640 align:start position:0%
for a landfill would already be ahead of
 
03:26:35.110 --> 03:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
the game is that correct or not do you
 
03:26:37.429 --> 03:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
have any knowledge on that thank you for
 
03:26:39.950 --> 03:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
the question representative um I I don't
 
03:26:41.910 --> 03:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
have specific knowledge knowled but I
 
03:26:43.510 --> 03:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
would think that there would be a
 
03:26:45.870 --> 03:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
significant amount of knowledge in
 
03:26:48.429 --> 03:26:48.439 align:start position:0%
regard to that site there are supposed
 
03:26:50.590 --> 03:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
to be mechanisms in place for monitoring
 
03:26:52.750 --> 03:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
those sites for for years and years to
 
03:26:55.030 --> 03:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
come because of the nature of of the
 
03:26:56.590 --> 03:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
fact that they're brown fields to begin
 
03:26:59.349 --> 03:26:59.359 align:start position:0%
with so the data should be there and I'm
 
03:27:01.469 --> 03:27:01.479 align:start position:0%
thinking if you're a Brownfield site
 
03:27:03.469 --> 03:27:03.479 align:start position:0%
owner and you got somebody knocking at
 
03:27:06.150 --> 03:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
the door saying I'd like to buy this I I
 
03:27:08.750 --> 03:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
would jump on that pretty
 
03:27:12.309 --> 03:27:12.319 align:start position:0%
quickly representative Howard it seems
 
03:27:14.870 --> 03:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
like if we if we were to um just put
 
03:27:16.229 --> 03:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
this bill forward as it is which I I
 
03:27:18.429 --> 03:27:18.439 align:start position:0%
think it's a great idea I like you know
 
03:27:20.510 --> 03:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
it makes perfect sense if we were to put
 
03:27:22.550 --> 03:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
it forward as it is with no carrot or
 
03:27:24.910 --> 03:27:24.920 align:start position:0%
stick it I could see people going
 
03:27:26.269 --> 03:27:26.279 align:start position:0%
through the motions and going back to
 
03:27:27.469 --> 03:27:27.479 align:start position:0%
the Green Field that they had their eye
 
03:27:30.670 --> 03:27:30.680 align:start position:0%
on in the first place so um is there any
 
03:27:33.150 --> 03:27:33.160 align:start position:0%
way to add a little bit more heft to
 
03:27:35.910 --> 03:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
this yeah thank you for the question I I
 
03:27:37.710 --> 03:27:37.720 align:start position:0%
think it's a a great
 
03:27:37.720 --> 03:27:39.550 align:start position:0%
think it's a a great
question

03:27:39.550 --> 03:27:39.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:27:42.630 --> 03:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
um just want to be as as delicate as
 
03:27:45.269 --> 03:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
possible but you know if this becomes
 
03:27:47.750 --> 03:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
part of the permit application process
 
03:27:49.510 --> 03:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
then I would think that there would be
 
03:27:52.189 --> 03:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
mechanisms to ensure that that diligence
 
03:27:54.309 --> 03:27:54.319 align:start position:0%
was done and it wasn't just an exercise
 
03:27:56.349 --> 03:27:56.359 align:start position:0%
and checking off the box to your
 
03:27:58.830 --> 03:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
question how do you call it strengthen
 
03:28:00.950 --> 03:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
those mechanisms I can't answer that off
 
03:28:02.309 --> 03:28:02.319 align:start position:0%
the top of my head but if you give me
 
03:28:03.670 --> 03:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
some time I'll go back and think about
 
03:28:06.950 --> 03:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
it and get back to you representer ger
 
03:28:08.750 --> 03:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Madam chair uh and
 
03:28:11.229 --> 03:28:11.239 align:start position:0%
and actually kind of building off um
 
03:28:12.670 --> 03:28:12.680 align:start position:0%
representative Howard's question you
 
03:28:15.870 --> 03:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
know would would one way of of
 
03:28:18.750 --> 03:28:18.760 align:start position:0%
addressing that issue be to require a a
 
03:28:22.910 --> 03:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
permit applicant to provide to to say
 
03:28:25.110 --> 03:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
this is the brown field we looked at and
 
03:28:26.910 --> 03:28:26.920 align:start position:0%
these are the reasons why it is not
 
03:28:29.309 --> 03:28:29.319 align:start position:0%
sufficient for our purposes right so
 
03:28:32.110 --> 03:28:32.120 align:start position:0%
some level of uh putting a burden on the
 
03:28:33.870 --> 03:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
applicant to demonstrate that they've
 
03:28:35.870 --> 03:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
considered a site and to explain why
 
03:28:37.349 --> 03:28:37.359 align:start position:0%
that site's not
 
03:28:39.870 --> 03:28:39.880 align:start position:0%
adequate thank you for the question and
 
03:28:42.510 --> 03:28:42.520 align:start position:0%
statement representative um I think
 
03:28:44.110 --> 03:28:44.120 align:start position:0%
representative masassa Miller spoke
 
03:28:47.150 --> 03:28:47.160 align:start position:0%
about the process around
 
03:28:50.150 --> 03:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
Wetlands Wetlands has been heightened to
 
03:28:51.990 --> 03:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
the extent that they are some of the
 
03:28:55.110 --> 03:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
most protected areas within the state
 
03:28:56.510 --> 03:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
although it doesn't necessarily mean you
 
03:28:58.990 --> 03:28:59.000 align:start position:0%
can't put a a a a landfill anywhere near
 
03:29:00.429 --> 03:29:00.439 align:start position:0%
them but you need to go through a pretty
 
03:29:04.030 --> 03:29:04.040 align:start position:0%
extensive process to ensure that those
 
03:29:06.469 --> 03:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
have been considered I would think that
 
03:29:08.110 --> 03:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
you you would use a very similar
 
03:29:10.550 --> 03:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
mechanism to do the same thing with
 
03:29:14.150 --> 03:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
Brownfield sites thank you any other
 
03:29:16.229 --> 03:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
questions oh representative H Haskins
 
03:29:18.630 --> 03:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and um thank you
 
03:29:20.670 --> 03:29:20.680 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I like the idea
 
03:29:22.550 --> 03:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
of the carrot and stick and I think
 
03:29:25.750 --> 03:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
we've gotten some information about that
 
03:29:27.710 --> 03:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
just so far in the testimony in other
 
03:29:30.790 --> 03:29:30.800 align:start position:0%
words the carrot is this might be much
 
03:29:34.510 --> 03:29:34.520 align:start position:0%
less expensive and it also might it not
 
03:29:38.830 --> 03:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
be less controversial when you take a
 
03:29:42.030 --> 03:29:42.040 align:start position:0%
dead site or a brown field Feld that a
 
03:29:45.070 --> 03:29:45.080 align:start position:0%
community is not particularly happy with
 
03:29:48.630 --> 03:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
and mitigate it redevelop it
 
03:29:51.870 --> 03:29:51.880 align:start position:0%
economically is that not going to be a
 
03:29:53.229 --> 03:29:53.239 align:start position:0%
plus for the
 
03:29:55.150 --> 03:29:55.160 align:start position:0%
community thank you for that statement
 
03:29:57.590 --> 03:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
and question representative H Haskins
 
03:29:59.189 --> 03:29:59.199 align:start position:0%
absolutely I mean that's one of the
 
03:30:01.150 --> 03:30:01.160 align:start position:0%
benefits is that you've got a site right
 
03:30:03.389 --> 03:30:03.399 align:start position:0%
now that in essence is for all intents
 
03:30:06.429 --> 03:30:06.439 align:start position:0%
and purposes dead to revitalize that
 
03:30:09.110 --> 03:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
that will generate income and uh
 
03:30:10.750 --> 03:30:10.760 align:start position:0%
represent an infusion of cash to a
 
03:30:13.429 --> 03:30:13.439 align:start position:0%
community that might be in dire need of
 
03:30:17.030 --> 03:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
of that Revenue absolutely but certainly
 
03:30:19.070 --> 03:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
not at the expense of a green space yeah
 
03:30:22.990 --> 03:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
followup followup thank you um I'm also
 
03:30:26.670 --> 03:30:26.680 align:start position:0%
thinking that communities have a lot of
 
03:30:29.429 --> 03:30:29.439 align:start position:0%
interest in what happens with these
 
03:30:32.189 --> 03:30:32.199 align:start position:0%
sites and I know something about this
 
03:30:34.110 --> 03:30:34.120 align:start position:0%
coming from the Sea Coast we've had our
 
03:30:37.750 --> 03:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
own issues with this and
 
03:30:42.910 --> 03:30:42.920 align:start position:0%
permitting was very much delayed for
 
03:30:46.510 --> 03:30:46.520 align:start position:0%
years I'm thinking that if this process
 
03:30:50.110 --> 03:30:50.120 align:start position:0%
were to be an economic um Advantage for
 
03:30:53.389 --> 03:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
the community you'd have Community buyin
 
03:30:55.990 --> 03:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
instead of having you know people going
 
03:30:59.750 --> 03:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
to sue you all the time and elongate the
 
03:31:02.110 --> 03:31:02.120 align:start position:0%
process you'd have people saying yes
 
03:31:03.830 --> 03:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you let's do this let's improve
 
03:31:06.269 --> 03:31:06.279 align:start position:0%
our community would it not I absolutely
 
03:31:09.950 --> 03:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
agree yes thank you representative
 
03:31:09.960 --> 03:31:12.590 align:start position:0%
agree yes thank you representative
Penza

03:31:12.590 --> 03:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
Penza
 
03:31:15.189 --> 03:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry sopus I thought you raised
 
03:31:19.910 --> 03:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
your hand oh okay um as someone who's
 
03:31:19.920 --> 03:31:21.150 align:start position:0%
your hand oh okay um as someone who's
been

03:31:21.150 --> 03:31:21.160 align:start position:0%
been
 
03:31:25.150 --> 03:31:25.160 align:start position:0%
intimately um involved in the northern
 
03:31:27.510 --> 03:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
country I would just like to say that I
 
03:31:30.269 --> 03:31:30.279 align:start position:0%
think this is brilliant absolutely
 
03:31:34.710 --> 03:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
brilliant and it um it takes in a lot of
 
03:31:37.510 --> 03:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
the missing pieces and so I'd be
 
03:31:40.229 --> 03:31:40.239 align:start position:0%
delighted to help work with this and um
 
03:31:42.990 --> 03:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
I commend you representative for this
 
03:31:46.070 --> 03:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you very much representative
 
03:31:46.080 --> 03:31:48.150 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you very much representative
representative

03:31:48.150 --> 03:31:48.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:31:51.030 --> 03:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
Penza I know this bill is speaking to a
 
03:31:53.030 --> 03:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
specific area in regards with
 
03:31:55.990 --> 03:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
brownfields and citing new
 
03:31:58.389 --> 03:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
landfills but in a sense couldn't we put
 
03:32:00.349 --> 03:32:00.359 align:start position:0%
this in kind of the realm of all of
 
03:32:02.830 --> 03:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
those like for this would be fantastic
 
03:32:05.910 --> 03:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
for transfer stations this would be um
 
03:32:08.510 --> 03:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
fantastic for recycling centers because
 
03:32:10.550 --> 03:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
they're not necessarily digging into the
 
03:32:10.560 --> 03:32:11.670 align:start position:0%
they're not necessarily digging into the
ground

03:32:11.670 --> 03:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
ground
 
03:32:15.150 --> 03:32:15.160 align:start position:0%
that's not an issue um even for you know
 
03:32:16.990 --> 03:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
like what conquer's doing with
 
03:32:20.030 --> 03:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
incinerating this I I mean I know that
 
03:32:21.830 --> 03:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
they would probably have to change and I
 
03:32:23.349 --> 03:32:23.359 align:start position:0%
know that this is specific but would you
 
03:32:25.389 --> 03:32:25.399 align:start position:0%
think you know could we put it into the
 
03:32:27.389 --> 03:32:27.399 align:start position:0%
whole realm of what we're trying to do
 
03:32:29.870 --> 03:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
here with um with our waste in New
 
03:32:31.750 --> 03:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you representative I
 
03:32:33.429 --> 03:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
think it's an excellent idea in my
 
03:32:35.630 --> 03:32:35.640 align:start position:0%
hometown at Whitefield the transfer
 
03:32:38.870 --> 03:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
station is the Oldtown landfill so that
 
03:32:42.189 --> 03:32:42.199 align:start position:0%
site in essence dead but functions you
 
03:32:44.590 --> 03:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
know very well as a transfer station
 
03:32:46.030 --> 03:32:46.040 align:start position:0%
today but yeah I think that's an
 
03:32:46.040 --> 03:32:47.189 align:start position:0%
today but yeah I think that's an
excellent

03:32:47.189 --> 03:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
03:32:49.510 --> 03:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
idea any other questions from the
 
03:32:52.910 --> 03:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you Mr Tower
 
03:32:54.990 --> 03:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
thank you committee I'd like to call
 
03:32:57.030 --> 03:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
Sarah us ask
 
03:33:00.309 --> 03:33:00.319 align:start position:0%
Kim New Hampshire Dees good afternoon
 
03:33:00.319 --> 03:33:09.750 align:start position:0%
Kim New Hampshire Dees good afternoon
and

03:33:09.750 --> 03:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:09.760 --> 03:33:16.110 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

03:33:16.110 --> 03:33:16.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:18.150 --> 03:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair and members
 
03:33:20.389 --> 03:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
03:33:23.790 --> 03:33:23.800 align:start position:0%
is Sarah uos Kern and I serve as the
 
03:33:25.710 --> 03:33:25.720 align:start position:0%
assistant director of the waste
 
03:33:27.950 --> 03:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
management division at the New Hampshire
 
03:33:30.150 --> 03:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services and
 
03:33:32.630 --> 03:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
with me I have Leah McKenna the
 
03:33:34.469 --> 03:33:34.479 align:start position:0%
administrator of the solid waste
 
03:33:37.189 --> 03:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
management Bureau at
 
03:33:40.830 --> 03:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
Dees Dees absolutely values revitalized
 
03:33:43.189 --> 03:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
izing Brownfield sites and we have a
 
03:33:45.229 --> 03:33:45.239 align:start position:0%
vibrant brownfields program that has
 
03:33:48.150 --> 03:33:48.160 align:start position:0%
been around for almost 30 years and has
 
03:33:51.309 --> 03:33:51.319 align:start position:0%
leveraged funding uh to investigate and
 
03:33:53.349 --> 03:33:53.359 align:start position:0%
mitigate contamination at hundreds of
 
03:33:56.910 --> 03:33:56.920 align:start position:0%
sites in the state but based on our
 
03:33:58.229 --> 03:33:58.239 align:start position:0%
experience with New Hampshire's
 
03:34:00.830 --> 03:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
Brownfield sites and our experience with
 
03:34:05.110 --> 03:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
landfill permitting we oppose House Bill
 
03:34:07.710 --> 03:34:07.720 align:start position:0%
1132 we understand that the bill would
 
03:34:10.030 --> 03:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
require entities that are proposing a
 
03:34:12.590 --> 03:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
new land F on an undeveloped or Green
 
03:34:16.630 --> 03:34:16.640 align:start position:0%
Field site to identify Brownfield sites
 
03:34:19.710 --> 03:34:19.720 align:start position:0%
as alternative locations and demonstrate
 
03:34:22.429 --> 03:34:22.439 align:start position:0%
whether the Greenfield site or the
 
03:34:24.910 --> 03:34:24.920 align:start position:0%
Brownfield site would provide greater
 
03:34:24.920 --> 03:34:25.870 align:start position:0%
Brownfield site would provide greater
public

03:34:25.870 --> 03:34:25.880 align:start position:0%
public
 
03:34:28.710 --> 03:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
benefits we have two main concerns with
 
03:34:30.309 --> 03:34:30.319 align:start position:0%
this proposed
 
03:34:33.590 --> 03:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
requirement first the characteristics of
 
03:34:36.070 --> 03:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's Brownfield sites are not
 
03:34:37.550 --> 03:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
usually consistent with the
 
03:34:40.389 --> 03:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
characteristics needed for a landfill
 
03:34:40.399 --> 03:34:41.790 align:start position:0%
characteristics needed for a landfill
site

03:34:41.790 --> 03:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
site
 
03:34:44.510 --> 03:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
most landfills require at least 100
 
03:34:46.469 --> 03:34:46.479 align:start position:0%
acres and most of New Hampshire's
 
03:34:49.429 --> 03:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
Brownfield sites are not that big also
 
03:34:52.269 --> 03:34:52.279 align:start position:0%
our Brownfield sites are typically
 
03:34:55.910 --> 03:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
former manufacturing facilities Mill
 
03:34:59.309 --> 03:34:59.319 align:start position:0%
facilities commercial facilities usually
 
03:35:01.870 --> 03:35:01.880 align:start position:0%
on small parcels and also in town
 
03:35:04.309 --> 03:35:04.319 align:start position:0%
centers which is not a desirable
 
03:35:07.110 --> 03:35:07.120 align:start position:0%
location for a
 
03:35:09.510 --> 03:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
landfill assuming that an applicant
 
03:35:11.950 --> 03:35:11.960 align:start position:0%
could find a brown field site with an
 
03:35:14.550 --> 03:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate size and location for citing
 
03:35:17.030 --> 03:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
a landfill the bill would require the
 
03:35:19.030 --> 03:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
applicant to uh determine whether the
 
03:35:20.550 --> 03:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
Green Field site or the brown field site
 
03:35:23.630 --> 03:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
had greater public benefit uh but we
 
03:35:25.830 --> 03:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
would find this provision as the bill is
 
03:35:28.110 --> 03:35:28.120 align:start position:0%
written right now um unclear and
 
03:35:29.150 --> 03:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
difficult to
 
03:35:31.469 --> 03:35:31.479 align:start position:0%
administer the bill doesn't provide
 
03:35:34.469 --> 03:35:34.479 align:start position:0%
criteria for assessing relative degrees
 
03:35:37.510 --> 03:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
of public benefit and we're not sure how
 
03:35:39.670 --> 03:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
we would evaluate the applicant's
 
03:35:44.590 --> 03:35:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:47.910 --> 03:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
comparison also the requirement to
 
03:35:50.349 --> 03:35:50.359 align:start position:0%
identify alternative brownfields
 
03:35:52.510 --> 03:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
locations doesn't appear to give
 
03:35:55.309 --> 03:35:55.319 align:start position:0%
consideration to whether the Brownfield
 
03:35:59.030 --> 03:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
sites would be available for
 
03:36:01.429 --> 03:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
acquisition for this reason the bill
 
03:36:03.590 --> 03:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
could result in applicants devoting
 
03:36:06.670 --> 03:36:06.680 align:start position:0%
resources to carrying out evaluations
 
03:36:09.630 --> 03:36:09.640 align:start position:0%
that were really hypothetical exercises
 
03:36:12.510 --> 03:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
and not uh really meaningful evaluation
 
03:36:12.520 --> 03:36:13.750 align:start position:0%
and not uh really meaningful evaluation
of

03:36:13.750 --> 03:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:36:16.309 --> 03:36:16.319 align:start position:0%
alternatives for those reasons we oppose
 
03:36:18.630 --> 03:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
the bill and I would be happy to take
 
03:36:18.640 --> 03:36:20.030 align:start position:0%
the bill and I would be happy to take
your

03:36:20.030 --> 03:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
your
 
03:36:23.070 --> 03:36:23.080 align:start position:0%
questions representa Murray thank you
 
03:36:25.990 --> 03:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
madam chair um and thank you um for the
 
03:36:28.110 --> 03:36:28.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to ask you a question and
 
03:36:31.309 --> 03:36:31.319 align:start position:0%
maybe a followup if I may sure um the
 
03:36:34.070 --> 03:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
first question I do have is uh with the
 
03:36:35.830 --> 03:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility of some of these Brown
 
03:36:37.870 --> 03:36:37.880 align:start position:0%
field sites are there those that are
 
03:36:43.590 --> 03:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:45.750 --> 03:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
perpetuity I want to be sure that I
 
03:36:47.750 --> 03:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
understand your question
 
03:36:51.510 --> 03:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
um is your question whether the current
 
03:36:53.429 --> 03:36:53.439 align:start position:0%
owner of the site would be
 
03:36:53.439 --> 03:36:57.910 align:start position:0%
owner of the site would be
required

03:36:57.910 --> 03:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:01.429 --> 03:37:01.439 align:start position:0%
um well monitoring would be required
 
03:37:03.830 --> 03:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
until there was no contamination
 
03:37:06.229 --> 03:37:06.239 align:start position:0%
remaining at the site so that's should
 
03:37:08.670 --> 03:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
not be in perpetuity but it could be for
 
03:37:10.950 --> 03:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
many many years decades
 
03:37:13.030 --> 03:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
as far as who would be responsible for
 
03:37:16.070 --> 03:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
that monitoring that would depend on
 
03:37:19.910 --> 03:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:22.070 --> 03:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
sales did you have a follow up yeah
 
03:37:23.750 --> 03:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you followup if I may so I guess
 
03:37:26.510 --> 03:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
that was that was my question so if if
 
03:37:28.710 --> 03:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
there is a legal obligation under an
 
03:37:32.630 --> 03:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
original property held by anybody who
 
03:37:34.150 --> 03:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
who currently is on that list of brown
 
03:37:37.070 --> 03:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
sites that you folks all Monitor and it
 
03:37:39.110 --> 03:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
was potentially purchased from somebody
 
03:37:41.070 --> 03:37:41.080 align:start position:0%
else would that absolve
 
03:37:41.080 --> 03:37:42.229 align:start position:0%
else would that absolve
the

03:37:42.229 --> 03:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:37:44.550 --> 03:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
original in the purchase and sale is
 
03:37:46.510 --> 03:37:46.520 align:start position:0%
that what you're seeming to indicate or
 
03:37:49.469 --> 03:37:49.479 align:start position:0%
is that it all depends how how it's
 
03:37:53.630 --> 03:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
crafted thank you representative NAB
 
03:37:54.790 --> 03:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
03:37:56.030 --> 03:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question and for being here
 
03:37:58.710 --> 03:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
today um one of your concerns seems to
 
03:38:00.630 --> 03:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
be about defining the public benefit or
 
03:38:02.870 --> 03:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
comparing the Public Public benefit but
 
03:38:03.990 --> 03:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
in the second paragraph of your
 
03:38:06.389 --> 03:38:06.399 align:start position:0%
testimony you outline the way the public
 
03:38:08.710 --> 03:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
benefit is assessed for a landfill site
 
03:38:10.590 --> 03:38:10.600 align:start position:0%
couldn't you use some of that criteria
 
03:38:12.469 --> 03:38:12.479 align:start position:0%
to develop a comparison between a
 
03:38:14.710 --> 03:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
Brownfield site and a green field
 
03:38:16.870 --> 03:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
site in the written testimony it
 
03:38:18.670 --> 03:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
discusses how public benefits determined
 
03:38:19.510 --> 03:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
for a
 
03:38:19.520 --> 03:38:22.590 align:start position:0%
for a
landfill

03:38:22.590 --> 03:38:22.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:27.630 --> 03:38:27.640 align:start position:0%
um our difficulty would be criteria for
 
03:38:30.389 --> 03:38:30.399 align:start position:0%
assessing for weighing the different
 
03:38:33.429 --> 03:38:33.439 align:start position:0%
factors of P public benefit for one
 
03:38:35.309 --> 03:38:35.319 align:start position:0%
property as opposed to for another
 
03:38:38.950 --> 03:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
property the way that the uh
 
03:38:40.510 --> 03:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
requirements are written right now now
 
03:38:42.070 --> 03:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
for public benefit determination it's
 
03:38:45.870 --> 03:38:45.880 align:start position:0%
focused on one one piece of property so
 
03:38:48.510 --> 03:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
when you get into the the value
 
03:38:50.710 --> 03:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
judgments between one property and
 
03:38:53.590 --> 03:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
another uh there's not currently
 
03:38:57.389 --> 03:38:57.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:00.630 --> 03:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
that followup thank you is that
 
03:39:01.870 --> 03:39:01.880 align:start position:0%
something that could be done in rulle
 
03:39:03.349 --> 03:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
making or within the department or do
 
03:39:04.469 --> 03:39:04.479 align:start position:0%
you think that's something that needs to
 
03:39:06.070 --> 03:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
be outlined in the bill if it was to
 
03:39:06.080 --> 03:39:06.950 align:start position:0%
be outlined in the bill if it was to
move

03:39:06.950 --> 03:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
move
 
03:39:09.630 --> 03:39:09.640 align:start position:0%
forward for rule making we take our
 
03:39:13.910 --> 03:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
guidance from the statutes so uh Clarity
 
03:39:17.389 --> 03:39:17.399 align:start position:0%
in the statute would guide the rul
 
03:39:20.550 --> 03:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
making representative H Haskins thank
 
03:39:22.229 --> 03:39:22.239 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you for taking
 
03:39:25.349 --> 03:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
my question so public benefit it would
 
03:39:27.990 --> 03:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
seem then is always going to be at some
 
03:39:31.110 --> 03:39:31.120 align:start position:0%
level of value judgment there are lots
 
03:39:34.910 --> 03:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
of criteria you can outline them go
 
03:39:39.150 --> 03:39:39.160 align:start position:0%
through them one to 10 but judgments
 
03:39:43.349 --> 03:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:45.830 --> 03:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
right for this bill a judgment would
 
03:39:47.429 --> 03:39:47.439 align:start position:0%
have to be made between the public
 
03:39:49.309 --> 03:39:49.319 align:start position:0%
benefit of one site public benefit of
 
03:39:51.469 --> 03:39:51.479 align:start position:0%
another yeah and public benefit is a
 
03:39:54.510 --> 03:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
part of the permanent process so anytime
 
03:39:56.990 --> 03:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
at some level judge those judgments have
 
03:39:58.990 --> 03:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
to be made do they not I'm not prepared
 
03:40:01.990 --> 03:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
to comment on uh the public benefit
 
03:40:06.710 --> 03:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
process for landfill permitting in
 
03:40:09.309 --> 03:40:09.319 align:start position:0%
specific okay thank you representative
 
03:40:09.319 --> 03:40:11.870 align:start position:0%
specific okay thank you representative
Duty

03:40:11.870 --> 03:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
Duty
 
03:40:16.030 --> 03:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair I'm confused
 
03:40:19.510 --> 03:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
okay uh because uh we have an issue
 
03:40:21.110 --> 03:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
there was a meeting last night I was not
 
03:40:23.550 --> 03:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
able to attend but in New Hampshire uh
 
03:40:27.189 --> 03:40:27.199 align:start position:0%
in Nashua um we have a sighting for an
 
03:40:29.910 --> 03:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
ashalt plant that is going to be right
 
03:40:33.510 --> 03:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
downtown okay and in meetings with the
 
03:40:36.550 --> 03:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
dees uh we were clearly told that at the
 
03:40:39.349 --> 03:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
next public hearing that no one could
 
03:40:41.790 --> 03:40:41.800 align:start position:0%
make any comment comments regarding
 
03:40:45.670 --> 03:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
issues involved with air quality due to
 
03:40:51.030 --> 03:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh diesel trucks um uh you know standing
 
03:40:52.590 --> 03:40:52.600 align:start position:0%
you know waiting to get into the ashal
 
03:40:54.830 --> 03:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
plant that the only thing that the
 
03:40:57.990 --> 03:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
public could comment on were scientific
 
03:41:01.150 --> 03:41:01.160 align:start position:0%
evidence rate relating to the permitting
 
03:41:04.910 --> 03:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
okay so and in reading some of the
 
03:41:07.150 --> 03:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
statements that Dees has made about
 
03:41:10.110 --> 03:41:10.120 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts and what their
 
03:41:13.389 --> 03:41:13.399 align:start position:0%
mission statement is uh it seems to me
 
03:41:13.399 --> 03:41:14.309 align:start position:0%
mission statement is uh it seems to me
that

03:41:14.309 --> 03:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:41:19.070 --> 03:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
Dees um isn't clear in terms of what it
 
03:41:21.550 --> 03:41:21.560 align:start position:0%
deems to be the public benefit and when
 
03:41:24.590 --> 03:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
the public can weigh in on concerns that
 
03:41:28.510 --> 03:41:28.520 align:start position:0%
it has about contamination or or air
 
03:41:32.550 --> 03:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
quality so you know can you help me
 
03:41:34.110 --> 03:41:34.120 align:start position:0%
understand this because you know you say
 
03:41:37.750 --> 03:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
here um that it again assessing relative
 
03:41:40.349 --> 03:41:40.359 align:start position:0%
degrees of public benefit but everything
 
03:41:43.389 --> 03:41:43.399 align:start position:0%
that I've heard from Dees says that they
 
03:41:46.910 --> 03:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
can only evaluate things on on technical
 
03:41:49.309 --> 03:41:49.319 align:start position:0%
qualifications in technical statements
 
03:41:51.710 --> 03:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
made in the permitting and they can't
 
03:41:54.389 --> 03:41:54.399 align:start position:0%
take in you know environmental factors
 
03:41:56.710 --> 03:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
that may be of concern so can you
 
03:41:58.389 --> 03:41:58.399 align:start position:0%
clarify that sure well when you're
 
03:42:00.630 --> 03:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
talking about the proposed asphalt plan
 
03:42:02.670 --> 03:42:02.680 align:start position:0%
in naswa you're talking about an
 
03:42:04.950 --> 03:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
entirely different set of statutes and
 
03:42:06.710 --> 03:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
rules from what we're talking about here
 
03:42:08.830 --> 03:42:08.840 align:start position:0%
because that's the air statutes and air
 
03:42:10.469 --> 03:42:10.479 align:start position:0%
rules and here we're talking about
 
03:42:12.590 --> 03:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
the solid waste rules and solid waste
 
03:42:15.710 --> 03:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
statute and um and that's
 
03:42:19.389 --> 03:42:19.399 align:start position:0%
the uh part of the statutes that this
 
03:42:22.070 --> 03:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
bill would apply to
 
03:42:25.229 --> 03:42:25.239 align:start position:0%
so we're to some degree talking apples
 
03:42:27.269 --> 03:42:27.279 align:start position:0%
and oranges when we're talking about
 
03:42:28.510 --> 03:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
statements that might have been made
 
03:42:31.110 --> 03:42:31.120 align:start position:0%
about an air permitting site as opposed
 
03:42:33.830 --> 03:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
to potentially weighing public benefit
 
03:42:37.149 --> 03:42:37.159 align:start position:0%
between two properties proposed for a
 
03:42:38.950 --> 03:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
landfill to be
 
03:42:41.030 --> 03:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
cited just one
 
03:42:44.710 --> 03:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
followup okay so you're saying that if
 
03:42:49.429 --> 03:42:49.439 align:start position:0%
we amend this bill uh to clarify what we
 
03:42:52.790 --> 03:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
consider to be the public benefit then
 
03:42:55.710 --> 03:42:55.720 align:start position:0%
Dees would welcome
 
03:42:58.710 --> 03:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
that I'm saying that one of the concerns
 
03:43:00.309 --> 03:43:00.319 align:start position:0%
that we have with the bill is that it
 
03:43:03.710 --> 03:43:03.720 align:start position:0%
does not provide criteria for weighing
 
03:43:06.990 --> 03:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
relative public benefit between two
 
03:43:10.830 --> 03:43:10.840 align:start position:0%
properties representative ktoa
 
03:43:12.710 --> 03:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
03:43:17.189 --> 03:43:17.199 align:start position:0%
being here um I had asked the uh Prime
 
03:43:19.030 --> 03:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
sponsor earlier about the acreage and
 
03:43:21.269 --> 03:43:21.279 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned that most landfills or
 
03:43:24.469 --> 03:43:24.479 align:start position:0%
at least 100 acres of the landfills in
 
03:43:24.479 --> 03:43:25.870 align:start position:0%
at least 100 acres of the landfills in
New

03:43:25.870 --> 03:43:25.880 align:start position:0%
New
 
03:43:28.910 --> 03:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire what are they are most of them
 
03:43:31.030 --> 03:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
100 acres or most of them more that
 
03:43:33.510 --> 03:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
would be my first question that's a
 
03:43:35.790 --> 03:43:35.800 align:start position:0%
great question brownfields oh I'm sorry
 
03:43:38.349 --> 03:43:38.359 align:start position:0%
the brownfields well the Brownfield no
 
03:43:41.670 --> 03:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
no land Fields oh uh landfills we can
 
03:43:44.429 --> 03:43:44.439 align:start position:0%
get that information for you but uh I
 
03:43:47.469 --> 03:43:47.479 align:start position:0%
anticipate they would mostly be over 100
 
03:43:50.950 --> 03:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
acres followup uh thank you for that
 
03:43:53.030 --> 03:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
information and that would have been my
 
03:43:54.750 --> 03:43:54.760 align:start position:0%
thought that most landfills are over 100
 
03:43:56.750 --> 03:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
acres and most of the brown Fields
 
03:43:59.590 --> 03:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
except for one are only 100 acres is
 
03:44:01.630 --> 03:44:01.640 align:start position:0%
that am I understanding that correctly
 
03:44:04.510 --> 03:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
there's an inventory that includes
 
03:44:09.950 --> 03:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
313 New Hampshire Brownfield sites and I
 
03:44:13.229 --> 03:44:13.239 align:start position:0%
would say there's a a small handful of
 
03:44:16.269 --> 03:44:16.279 align:start position:0%
sites that exceed a 100
 
03:44:20.429 --> 03:44:20.439 align:start position:0%
acres but for other reasons related to
 
03:44:20.439 --> 03:44:21.229 align:start position:0%
acres but for other reasons related to
their

03:44:21.229 --> 03:44:21.239 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:44:23.309 --> 03:44:23.319 align:start position:0%
characteristics would not be suitable
 
03:44:26.309 --> 03:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
for a landfill one more followup thank
 
03:44:29.950 --> 03:44:29.960 align:start position:0%
you madam chairman thank you again um of
 
03:44:31.670 --> 03:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
some of these Brown Fields would you say
 
03:44:31.680 --> 03:44:33.110 align:start position:0%
some of these Brown Fields would you say
that

03:44:33.110 --> 03:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:44:36.990 --> 03:44:37.000 align:start position:0%
um a good number of them are along
 
03:44:40.670 --> 03:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
waterways many Brownfield sites are
 
03:44:43.630 --> 03:44:43.640 align:start position:0%
right on top of a Waterway uh if you
 
03:44:47.070 --> 03:44:47.080 align:start position:0%
look at photos overhead photos aerial
 
03:44:50.229 --> 03:44:50.239 align:start position:0%
photos of the brownfields project in
 
03:44:53.510 --> 03:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
conquered that was recently completed uh
 
03:44:55.910 --> 03:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
to convert the former Allied Tannery
 
03:44:59.110 --> 03:44:59.120 align:start position:0%
into senior housing you see that that
 
03:45:01.750 --> 03:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
senior housing is here and the water the
 
03:45:03.870 --> 03:45:03.880 align:start position:0%
river is right
 
03:45:06.389 --> 03:45:06.399 align:start position:0%
there okay representative
 
03:45:08.670 --> 03:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
ger thank you madam chair thank you for
 
03:45:10.189 --> 03:45:10.199 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
03:45:13.030 --> 03:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh we heard before the comparison with
 
03:45:15.510 --> 03:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
Wetlands right and and so that if if
 
03:45:18.349 --> 03:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
there is a proposal to build in Wetlands
 
03:45:20.149 --> 03:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
you'd have to be able to you meet a
 
03:45:22.670 --> 03:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
number of criteria right in order to
 
03:45:24.870 --> 03:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that that is a suitable
 
03:45:26.670 --> 03:45:26.680 align:start position:0%
place to put it and that there isn't a
 
03:45:28.429 --> 03:45:28.439 align:start position:0%
better place to put it so that would
 
03:45:30.670 --> 03:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
seem to me to involve comparison that's
 
03:45:33.469 --> 03:45:33.479 align:start position:0%
a comparison between a given site and
 
03:45:35.189 --> 03:45:35.199 align:start position:0%
being able to demonstrate that that site
 
03:45:37.990 --> 03:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
is better or worse than an alternative
 
03:45:40.149 --> 03:45:40.159 align:start position:0%
site so I'm a little bit confused about
 
03:45:42.510 --> 03:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
the idea that we don't have the capacity
 
03:45:44.429 --> 03:45:44.439 align:start position:0%
to make comparisons between a proposed
 
03:45:46.550 --> 03:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
site and an alternative site so could
 
03:45:48.790 --> 03:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
you explain to us how this would be
 
03:45:51.189 --> 03:45:51.199 align:start position:0%
different from how we make these
 
03:45:53.670 --> 03:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
determinations with regard to
 
03:45:57.030 --> 03:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
Wetlands I'm a geologist in the waste
 
03:45:58.990 --> 03:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
management division so I can't speak to
 
03:46:00.990 --> 03:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
how the determinations are made in the
 
03:46:04.070 --> 03:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
wetlands rules uh but what what we can
 
03:46:06.030 --> 03:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
say is that this bill does not provide
 
03:46:08.590 --> 03:46:08.600 align:start position:0%
the criteria for that sort of
 
03:46:08.600 --> 03:46:10.750 align:start position:0%
the criteria for that sort of
comparison

03:46:10.750 --> 03:46:10.760 align:start position:0%
comparison
 
03:46:12.349 --> 03:46:12.359 align:start position:0%
representative H
 
03:46:14.469 --> 03:46:14.479 align:start position:0%
Haskins thank you madam chair and thank
 
03:46:17.429 --> 03:46:17.439 align:start position:0%
you for my question so does it
 
03:46:22.550 --> 03:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
follow um if a brown field near a
 
03:46:25.990 --> 03:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
Waterway is problematic that a green
 
03:46:30.870 --> 03:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
field near a Waterway is problematic as
 
03:46:34.309 --> 03:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
well there are sighting requirements for
 
03:46:36.950 --> 03:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
landfills in New Hampshire and there's a
 
03:46:39.790 --> 03:46:39.800 align:start position:0%
setback required to a Waterway uh these
 
03:46:41.910 --> 03:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
brownfields projects that we talk about
 
03:46:43.550 --> 03:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
Brownfield sites that we talk about
 
03:46:45.389 --> 03:46:45.399 align:start position:0%
which are right on top of the water
 
03:46:47.550 --> 03:46:47.560 align:start position:0%
would not meet the sighting criteria for
 
03:46:52.590 --> 03:46:52.600 align:start position:0%
a landfill follow up if I may um yeah
 
03:46:55.710 --> 03:46:55.720 align:start position:0%
sure you happen to know the acreage of
 
03:46:57.429 --> 03:46:57.439 align:start position:0%
the Bethlehem
 
03:46:59.229 --> 03:46:59.239 align:start position:0%
landfill no but that's in the
 
03:47:00.429 --> 03:47:00.439 align:start position:0%
information that we're going to get to
 
03:47:00.439 --> 03:47:01.429 align:start position:0%
information that we're going to get to
the

03:47:01.429 --> 03:47:01.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:47:04.950 --> 03:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
committee represent big thank you yeah
 
03:47:08.030 --> 03:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that's come up in
 
03:47:11.510 --> 03:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
previous discussions of fills is whether
 
03:47:14.630 --> 03:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
the hydrogeology of a site is
 
03:47:17.830 --> 03:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate for a landfill in terms of
 
03:47:20.110 --> 03:47:20.120 align:start position:0%
being in terms of setback from waterways
 
03:47:24.189 --> 03:47:24.199 align:start position:0%
in terms of the paracity of the ground
 
03:47:27.630 --> 03:47:27.640 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of uh whether there are uh
 
03:47:31.910 --> 03:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
aquafer major aquifers uh under or near
 
03:47:34.950 --> 03:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
the site is that are those
 
03:47:37.349 --> 03:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
hydrogeological considerations something
 
03:47:40.189 --> 03:47:40.199 align:start position:0%
that could um
 
03:47:42.550 --> 03:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh limit the number of brown fields that
 
03:47:49.469 --> 03:47:49.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:51.990 --> 03:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
site well I would say that in the same
 
03:47:54.590 --> 03:47:54.600 align:start position:0%
way those considerations limit any type
 
03:47:56.389 --> 03:47:56.399 align:start position:0%
of property that's appropriate for a
 
03:47:58.630 --> 03:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
landfill uh they would apply to
 
03:48:00.429 --> 03:48:00.439 align:start position:0%
Brownfield sites as
 
03:48:02.469 --> 03:48:02.479 align:start position:0%
well thank
 
03:48:04.510 --> 03:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
you representative Murray you had a
 
03:48:07.550 --> 03:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
question I did thank you um I the
 
03:48:09.590 --> 03:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
question that I had for you is that I'm
 
03:48:11.750 --> 03:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
that brownfields have have as some have
 
03:48:13.149 --> 03:48:13.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned before been turned into
 
03:48:15.590 --> 03:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
transfer stations Parks provided
 
03:48:18.070 --> 03:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
alternate locations for uh residential
 
03:48:21.189 --> 03:48:21.199 align:start position:0%
housing um those types of things um so
 
03:48:23.630 --> 03:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
when those types of projects are being
 
03:48:23.640 --> 03:48:25.389 align:start position:0%
when those types of projects are being
considered

03:48:25.389 --> 03:48:25.399 align:start position:0%
considered
 
03:48:28.990 --> 03:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
um what is the metric then for those
 
03:48:31.510 --> 03:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
types of
 
03:48:34.110 --> 03:48:34.120 align:start position:0%
projects moving forward or not versus
 
03:48:35.830 --> 03:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
something like obviously we were talking
 
03:48:38.710 --> 03:48:38.720 align:start position:0%
about acreage is one one facet um are
 
03:48:38.720 --> 03:48:40.870 align:start position:0%
about acreage is one one facet um are
there

03:48:40.870 --> 03:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:48:42.710 --> 03:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
is there a separate set of Standards or
 
03:48:45.269 --> 03:48:45.279 align:start position:0%
metrics used to consider other things as
 
03:48:47.870 --> 03:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
opposed to landfill sighting that's a
 
03:48:50.229 --> 03:48:50.239 align:start position:0%
good question and I think it would
 
03:48:54.630 --> 03:48:54.640 align:start position:0%
depend on what type of facility or um
 
03:48:57.630 --> 03:48:57.640 align:start position:0%
business someone is looking to site some
 
03:48:59.389 --> 03:48:59.399 align:start position:0%
of the types of places that you
 
03:49:01.830 --> 03:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh like transfer stations do
 
03:49:03.630 --> 03:49:03.640 align:start position:0%
require a different type of a solid
 
03:49:07.630 --> 03:49:07.640 align:start position:0%
waste permit uh and other types like
 
03:49:10.110 --> 03:49:10.120 align:start position:0%
residential facilities would not require
 
03:49:12.309 --> 03:49:12.319 align:start position:0%
a permit to be
 
03:49:17.510 --> 03:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
built from not from waste management at
 
03:49:20.510 --> 03:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
least represent
 
03:49:24.269 --> 03:49:24.279 align:start position:0%
Penza so the the landfill that's in
 
03:49:26.670 --> 03:49:26.680 align:start position:0%
Lebanon is uh
 
03:49:32.149 --> 03:49:32.159 align:start position:0%
15.35 Acres um Lebanon sorry
 
03:49:37.149 --> 03:49:37.159 align:start position:0%
um why wouldn't we look at the
 
03:49:41.469 --> 03:49:41.479 align:start position:0%
313 sites and do that kind of evaluation
 
03:49:43.469 --> 03:49:43.479 align:start position:0%
based upon you know looking at the
 
03:49:46.349 --> 03:49:46.359 align:start position:0%
current rules and then and then see I
 
03:49:50.030 --> 03:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
mean in a sense we only need possibly
 
03:49:53.269 --> 03:49:53.279 align:start position:0%
one one or two landfills in the entire
 
03:49:56.149 --> 03:49:56.159 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire over the next 60
 
03:50:00.750 --> 03:50:00.760 align:start position:0%
to 100 years so to me it it it just
 
03:50:04.830 --> 03:50:04.840 align:start position:0%
seems crazy to not look at
 
03:50:07.070 --> 03:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
it it seems as if you're you're just
 
03:50:09.910 --> 03:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
blanketly saying that
 
03:50:11.990 --> 03:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
this is you know this wouldn't work or
 
03:50:13.790 --> 03:50:13.800 align:start position:0%
this wouldn't work why aren't we why
 
03:50:15.590 --> 03:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
aren't we looking at it why isn't why
 
03:50:16.830 --> 03:50:16.840 align:start position:0%
aren't we looking at all of the
 
03:50:19.630 --> 03:50:19.640 align:start position:0%
opportunities that we have in 313 before
 
03:50:23.870 --> 03:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:26.710 --> 03:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
out I've stated de's position on the
 
03:50:30.790 --> 03:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
bill when an entity is looking to say at
 
03:50:34.189 --> 03:50:34.199 align:start position:0%
a landfill they look at many different
 
03:50:36.630 --> 03:50:36.640 align:start position:0%
options for places to site the landfill
 
03:50:38.950 --> 03:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
and they may be looking at some of these
 
03:50:38.960 --> 03:50:40.309 align:start position:0%
and they may be looking at some of these
sites

03:50:40.309 --> 03:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
sites
 
03:50:42.429 --> 03:50:42.439 align:start position:0%
um but de's position is that we oppose
 
03:50:46.950 --> 03:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
this bill representative Bixby yes so uh
 
03:50:49.510 --> 03:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
one this this is kind of a hypothetical
 
03:50:51.910 --> 03:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
but one of the things that seems to be
 
03:50:54.269 --> 03:50:54.279 align:start position:0%
coming into play here is that Dees
 
03:50:58.309 --> 03:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't actually get to uh make the
 
03:51:01.630 --> 03:51:01.640 align:start position:0%
choice about where uh landfills are
 
03:51:05.149 --> 03:51:05.159 align:start position:0%
going to be cited or because it's in the
 
03:51:08.349 --> 03:51:08.359 align:start position:0%
it's a private entity that is looking to
 
03:51:11.950 --> 03:51:11.960 align:start position:0%
to uh site the landfill and that private
 
03:51:14.229 --> 03:51:14.239 align:start position:0%
entity seems to be in control of that
 
03:51:16.950 --> 03:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
process so the hypothetical part of this
 
03:51:22.110 --> 03:51:22.120 align:start position:0%
is if it were uh the state rather than
 
03:51:25.790 --> 03:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
uh a private entity uh that were looking
 
03:51:28.670 --> 03:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
to S landfills would that open up the
 
03:51:31.830 --> 03:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
possibility of uh looking at more of the
 
03:51:36.750 --> 03:51:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:39.950 --> 03:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
sites I I don't believe
 
03:51:44.269 --> 03:51:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:44.279 --> 03:51:45.790 align:start position:0%
 
the

03:51:45.790 --> 03:51:45.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:51:48.189 --> 03:51:48.199 align:start position:0%
the background of the entity whether
 
03:51:49.710 --> 03:51:49.720 align:start position:0%
it's a government entity or a private
 
03:51:54.070 --> 03:51:54.080 align:start position:0%
entity would uh have an impact on would
 
03:51:54.080 --> 03:51:54.870 align:start position:0%
entity would uh have an impact on would
would

03:51:54.870 --> 03:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:51:58.389 --> 03:51:58.399 align:start position:0%
change the implementation of this bill
 
03:51:59.830 --> 03:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
as it's proposed I don't believe that
 
03:52:02.229 --> 03:52:02.239 align:start position:0%
that would make a difference thank
 
03:52:07.229 --> 03:52:07.239 align:start position:0%
you I have a question so given the 313
 
03:52:10.070 --> 03:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
Brownfield sites that we have
 
03:52:14.550 --> 03:52:14.560 align:start position:0%
have just a wild
 
03:52:17.870 --> 03:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
guess how many of those do you think
 
03:52:20.429 --> 03:52:20.439 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate for any kind of
 
03:52:23.429 --> 03:52:23.439 align:start position:0%
landfill I mean number one we're looking
 
03:52:27.510 --> 03:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
at space size the size of one so that
 
03:52:29.510 --> 03:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
rules out a whole bunch of
 
03:52:32.550 --> 03:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
them then we would be looking at perhaps
 
03:52:35.349 --> 03:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
you know being too close to a school or
 
03:52:38.790 --> 03:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
urban center or waterway that would rule
 
03:52:41.030 --> 03:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
out another bunch of
 
03:52:43.710 --> 03:52:43.720 align:start position:0%
them there are some other considerations
 
03:52:45.830 --> 03:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
obviously you'd have to take into
 
03:52:48.830 --> 03:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
account and you know when you're looking
 
03:52:51.149 --> 03:52:51.159 align:start position:0%
at landfills they basically site
 
03:52:54.590 --> 03:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
specific anyway but just you know any
 
03:52:57.950 --> 03:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
kind do you have any kind of guess as to
 
03:52:59.750 --> 03:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
how many of those
 
03:53:03.429 --> 03:53:03.439 align:start position:0%
313 might be any kind of um candidate
 
03:53:06.189 --> 03:53:06.199 align:start position:0%
for a landfill as stated in the
 
03:53:07.429 --> 03:53:07.439 align:start position:0%
commissioner's letter we don't believe
 
03:53:10.030 --> 03:53:10.040 align:start position:0%
that any of them would be okay thank you
 
03:53:12.429 --> 03:53:12.439 align:start position:0%
for that representative
 
03:53:14.429 --> 03:53:14.439 align:start position:0%
ger thank you madam chair and thank you
 
03:53:16.030 --> 03:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
again for taking my question so I want
 
03:53:18.590 --> 03:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
to return to the the question about the
 
03:53:21.070 --> 03:53:21.080 align:start position:0%
lack of clarity from the legislature
 
03:53:23.510 --> 03:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
regarding criteria right so particularly
 
03:53:25.750 --> 03:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
public benefit uh
 
03:53:28.630 --> 03:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
but and how you would compare one site
 
03:53:31.950 --> 03:53:31.960 align:start position:0%
versus another what that criteria is
 
03:53:33.429 --> 03:53:33.439 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be what I'm thinking about
 
03:53:35.469 --> 03:53:35.479 align:start position:0%
in terms of this bill is isn't that
 
03:53:37.910 --> 03:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
precisely what this bill does it would
 
03:53:39.830 --> 03:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
be if it passed
 
03:53:42.429 --> 03:53:42.439 align:start position:0%
clear instruction by the legislature
 
03:53:45.110 --> 03:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
that brown Fields should always be
 
03:53:48.990 --> 03:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
preferred to Green Fields if they meet
 
03:53:51.309 --> 03:53:51.319 align:start position:0%
our landfill sighting criteria so my
 
03:53:53.590 --> 03:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
question is if that's the concern that
 
03:53:55.030 --> 03:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
there isn't
 
03:53:57.670 --> 03:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
Clarity from the legislature about what
 
03:53:59.510 --> 03:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
that criteria is I'm a little bit
 
03:54:00.950 --> 03:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
puzzled about the opposition here
 
03:54:02.550 --> 03:54:02.560 align:start position:0%
because this bill actually provides
 
03:54:04.149 --> 03:54:04.159 align:start position:0%
precisely that
 
03:54:06.309 --> 03:54:06.319 align:start position:0%
criteria as I said by saying the brown
 
03:54:07.790 --> 03:54:07.800 align:start position:0%
Fields should always be preferred if
 
03:54:10.630 --> 03:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
they meet condition so wouldn't this
 
03:54:13.149 --> 03:54:13.159 align:start position:0%
provide the kind of clarity that Dees is
 
03:54:18.149 --> 03:54:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:21.229 --> 03:54:21.239 align:start position:0%
issue the bill States the department
 
03:54:23.070 --> 03:54:23.080 align:start position:0%
shall require an applicant seeking
 
03:54:25.149 --> 03:54:25.159 align:start position:0%
permits for a Landfield on a Greenfield
 
03:54:27.590 --> 03:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
site to identify alternative Brownfield
 
03:54:28.910 --> 03:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
sites within the state that could
 
03:54:30.429 --> 03:54:30.439 align:start position:0%
reasonably provide similar public
 
03:54:32.710 --> 03:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
benefits and demonstrate for all such
 
03:54:34.389 --> 03:54:34.399 align:start position:0%
Brownfield sites whether the Greenfield
 
03:54:36.790 --> 03:54:36.800 align:start position:0%
site provides greater public benefits
 
03:54:39.469 --> 03:54:39.479 align:start position:0%
and if so by how much
 
03:54:41.870 --> 03:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
it's not clear how we would
 
03:54:45.030 --> 03:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
determine the degree we how we would
 
03:54:47.710 --> 03:54:47.720 align:start position:0%
evaluate someone's description of the
 
03:54:50.910 --> 03:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
degree to which a Greenfield site
 
03:54:52.790 --> 03:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
provides more public benefit than a
 
03:54:56.189 --> 03:54:56.199 align:start position:0%
Brownfield site may I follow up Madam
 
03:54:59.429 --> 03:54:59.439 align:start position:0%
chair thank you so sure I I appreciate
 
03:55:01.710 --> 03:55:01.720 align:start position:0%
that and and so then would it
 
03:55:03.790 --> 03:55:03.800 align:start position:0%
conceivably work to have an amendment
 
03:55:05.910 --> 03:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
that would just effectively State as I
 
03:55:09.349 --> 03:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
said that uh Brownfield site
 
03:55:12.309 --> 03:55:12.319 align:start position:0%
are preferable to Greenfield sites right
 
03:55:13.630 --> 03:55:13.640 align:start position:0%
that's the criteria I hear what you're
 
03:55:16.269 --> 03:55:16.279 align:start position:0%
saying how do we quantify that this site
 
03:55:18.149 --> 03:55:18.159 align:start position:0%
is so much better than this site but if
 
03:55:19.469 --> 03:55:19.479 align:start position:0%
the statement on on the part of the
 
03:55:21.790 --> 03:55:21.800 align:start position:0%
legislature is that a Brownfield site is
 
03:55:24.189 --> 03:55:24.199 align:start position:0%
always better than a green field site if
 
03:55:27.149 --> 03:55:27.159 align:start position:0%
it meets sting criteria uh that doesn't
 
03:55:28.550 --> 03:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
get us into the realm of how do you
 
03:55:30.790 --> 03:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
quantify it it is a value statement so
 
03:55:32.590 --> 03:55:32.600 align:start position:0%
with that type of amendment perhaps
 
03:55:36.070 --> 03:55:36.080 align:start position:0%
provide more clarity for
 
03:55:38.309 --> 03:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
Dees that would provide more clarity but
 
03:55:40.630 --> 03:55:40.640 align:start position:0%
not a all of de's
 
03:55:43.269 --> 03:55:43.279 align:start position:0%
concerns representive
 
03:55:45.710 --> 03:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
kraton thank you madam chair thank you
 
03:55:48.469 --> 03:55:48.479 align:start position:0%
again ladies for taking our
 
03:55:50.630 --> 03:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
questions you haven't listened to all
 
03:55:51.710 --> 03:55:51.720 align:start position:0%
this I just want to give you a
 
03:55:53.750 --> 03:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
hypothetical and tell me if you think it
 
03:55:55.790 --> 03:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
make if this is sort of the way it goes
 
03:55:58.950 --> 03:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
down I want to put a landfill site
 
03:56:01.469 --> 03:56:01.479 align:start position:0%
typically in this state I'm going to
 
03:56:04.630 --> 03:56:04.640 align:start position:0%
need more than 100 acres so I go to Dees
 
03:56:06.670 --> 03:56:06.680 align:start position:0%
and say I want to put in a landfill site
 
03:56:09.870 --> 03:56:09.880 align:start position:0%
you say great there's 30 3 possible
 
03:56:10.950 --> 03:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
places to
 
03:56:13.550 --> 03:56:13.560 align:start position:0%
go go and analyze those based on this
 
03:56:15.790 --> 03:56:15.800 align:start position:0%
bill that's what it tells me to do go
 
03:56:18.269 --> 03:56:18.279 align:start position:0%
and analyze those so you give them the
 
03:56:19.670 --> 03:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
thing and they look at it and they say
 
03:56:23.590 --> 03:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
well of that 313 only a handful are
 
03:56:26.269 --> 03:56:26.279 align:start position:0%
greater than 100 acres and of that
 
03:56:28.469 --> 03:56:28.479 align:start position:0%
handful none of them meet the
 
03:56:32.469 --> 03:56:32.479 align:start position:0%
requirements for setbacks to waterways
 
03:56:33.910 --> 03:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
towns schools whatever those
 
03:56:36.510 --> 03:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
requirements are so thank you very much
 
03:56:39.229 --> 03:56:39.239 align:start position:0%
of the 313 none of them meet the Acres I
 
03:56:41.950 --> 03:56:41.960 align:start position:0%
require to put my landfill in is that
 
03:56:48.149 --> 03:56:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:51.030 --> 03:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
down yes thank
 
03:56:53.590 --> 03:56:53.600 align:start position:0%
you representative Penza and then
 
03:56:53.600 --> 03:56:56.990 align:start position:0%
you representative Penza and then
representative

03:56:56.990 --> 03:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:59.030 --> 03:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
Murray okay so I'm going to go back to
 
03:56:59.040 --> 03:56:59.910 align:start position:0%
Murray okay so I'm going to go back to
the

03:56:59.910 --> 03:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:57:02.910 --> 03:57:02.920 align:start position:0%
313 because earlier in the testimony you
 
03:57:05.590 --> 03:57:05.600 align:start position:0%
had stated that you know you weren't
 
03:57:09.550 --> 03:57:09.560 align:start position:0%
aware of all the crit IIA of what you
 
03:57:12.510 --> 03:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
know these 313 are but then you said
 
03:57:15.309 --> 03:57:15.319 align:start position:0%
that they're that zero of them
 
03:57:18.550 --> 03:57:18.560 align:start position:0%
are um not
 
03:57:20.670 --> 03:57:20.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate I I don't understand how you
 
03:57:22.710 --> 03:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
can have that both ways then shouldn't
 
03:57:24.189 --> 03:57:24.199 align:start position:0%
there be a report I'd love to see a
 
03:57:25.990 --> 03:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
report of every
 
03:57:28.790 --> 03:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
313 of all of them and it doesn't have
 
03:57:32.790 --> 03:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
to be 100 acres can it be
 
03:57:35.429 --> 03:57:35.439 align:start position:0%
15.75 like I just I don't understand why
 
03:57:37.590 --> 03:57:37.600 align:start position:0%
we're not looking at
 
03:57:37.600 --> 03:57:39.229 align:start position:0%
we're not looking at
it

03:57:39.229 --> 03:57:39.239 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:57:41.269 --> 03:57:41.279 align:start position:0%
I don't recall saying that I wasn't
 
03:57:43.070 --> 03:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
aware of criteria associated with the
 
03:57:44.710 --> 03:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
Brownfield sites so I'm not sure how to
 
03:57:47.950 --> 03:57:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:50.750 --> 03:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
question you basically said that you you
 
03:57:54.550 --> 03:57:54.560 align:start position:0%
weren't aware followup sorry you weren't
 
03:57:58.229 --> 03:57:58.239 align:start position:0%
aware of all you know all 313 sites you
 
03:58:00.269 --> 03:58:00.279 align:start position:0%
said for example you know you know that
 
03:58:02.630 --> 03:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
a few of them or a handful of them are
 
03:58:07.030 --> 03:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
over a hundred um you don't know every
 
03:58:09.229 --> 03:58:09.239 align:start position:0%
makeup of every Brownfield site
 
03:58:09.239 --> 03:58:10.950 align:start position:0%
makeup of every Brownfield site
obviously

03:58:10.950 --> 03:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
03:58:14.110 --> 03:58:14.120 align:start position:0%
so and then you stated that zero of them
 
03:58:16.070 --> 03:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
that you feel would be appropriate I'm
 
03:58:17.469 --> 03:58:17.479 align:start position:0%
just I don't understand how you can
 
03:58:19.710 --> 03:58:19.720 align:start position:0%
qualify that statement when I would love
 
03:58:21.510 --> 03:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
to see a report then if you guys have a
 
03:58:24.950 --> 03:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
report on hand of the 313 Brownfield
 
03:58:26.750 --> 03:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
sites I think that would be fantastic to
 
03:58:29.830 --> 03:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
send it to the committee so we know um
 
03:58:32.590 --> 03:58:32.600 align:start position:0%
where these where these all stand I
 
03:58:34.670 --> 03:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
don't have here with me the details on
 
03:58:37.550 --> 03:58:37.560 align:start position:0%
every one of the 313 sites I've spoken
 
03:58:39.229 --> 03:58:39.239 align:start position:0%
with the engineer in charge of our
 
03:58:41.389 --> 03:58:41.399 align:start position:0%
brownfields program who confirmed with
 
03:58:43.910 --> 03:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
me that there's not one of those sites
 
03:58:46.469 --> 03:58:46.479 align:start position:0%
that she's aware of that's appropriate
 
03:58:48.070 --> 03:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
for citing a landfill for various
 
03:58:49.910 --> 03:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
reasons associated with their
 
03:58:52.229 --> 03:58:52.239 align:start position:0%
characteristics Miss Kern do you does
 
03:58:55.950 --> 03:58:55.960 align:start position:0%
dees have a brownfields report that
 
03:58:58.389 --> 03:58:58.399 align:start position:0%
talks about all of these different sites
 
03:59:00.349 --> 03:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
and what their characteristics are I
 
03:59:02.910 --> 03:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
don't believe that there's a report uh
 
03:59:04.750 --> 03:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
that would have summaries of all of the
 
03:59:07.389 --> 03:59:07.399 align:start position:0%
sites okay that information is stored in
 
03:59:09.790 --> 03:59:09.800 align:start position:0%
individual files would be very time
 
03:59:12.189 --> 03:59:12.199 align:start position:0%
consuming to compile thank you
 
03:59:14.750 --> 03:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
03:59:16.710 --> 03:59:16.720 align:start position:0%
chair um if the department could tell me
 
03:59:18.070 --> 03:59:18.080 align:start position:0%
of the
 
03:59:20.670 --> 03:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
313 Roundfield sites that are also on
 
03:59:22.790 --> 03:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
the database that I can look through and
 
03:59:27.830 --> 03:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
sort um how many of them are privately
 
03:59:35.670 --> 03:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:38.910 --> 03:59:38.920 align:start position:0%
here but we could get that for you thank
 
03:59:38.920 --> 03:59:41.189 align:start position:0%
here but we could get that for you thank
you

03:59:41.189 --> 03:59:41.199 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:59:44.030 --> 03:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
okay one other question representative
 
03:59:46.630 --> 03:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
Duty um thank you madam
 
03:59:52.710 --> 03:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
chair so uh I I believe that it's still
 
03:59:55.510 --> 03:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
in in statute unless we've changed it
 
03:59:58.030 --> 03:59:58.040 align:start position:0%
and I can't remember um that there's a
 
04:00:01.110 --> 04:00:01.120 align:start position:0%
200 foot setback from a Waterway did we
 
04:00:04.030 --> 04:00:04.040 align:start position:0%
did that ever pass or is that still
 
04:00:06.630 --> 04:00:06.640 align:start position:0%
law I'm going to ask Leah to speak to
 
04:00:07.990 --> 04:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
this I believe it's in the solid waste
 
04:00:09.710 --> 04:00:09.720 align:start position:0%
rules correct that's an administrative
 
04:00:11.830 --> 04:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
rule it's not in statute okay but it's
 
04:00:14.189 --> 04:00:14.199 align:start position:0%
an administrative rule okay so the the
 
04:00:17.309 --> 04:00:17.319 align:start position:0%
question I have is is I don't understand
 
04:00:20.910 --> 04:00:20.920 align:start position:0%
uh why if we have the 200 foot setback
 
04:00:23.750 --> 04:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
um that we have to rule out all
 
04:00:26.950 --> 04:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
brownfields that are near a Waterway
 
04:00:30.229 --> 04:00:30.239 align:start position:0%
since we have a Brownfield in nashwa
 
04:00:33.030 --> 04:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
right on the the old copper plant okay
 
04:00:35.070 --> 04:00:35.080 align:start position:0%
and it they're mitigating it they've
 
04:00:37.630 --> 04:00:37.640 align:start position:0%
been mitigating it for the last 5 years
 
04:00:40.189 --> 04:00:40.199 align:start position:0%
and they put up they engineered a slurry
 
04:00:44.030 --> 04:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
wall okay to keep the creosol from going
 
04:00:47.870 --> 04:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
into the miramac river so I mean if that
 
04:00:50.990 --> 04:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
in fact Works uh couldn't you do a
 
04:00:57.269 --> 04:00:57.279 align:start position:0%
slurry wall 200 feet in from from a a a
 
04:01:01.229 --> 04:01:01.239 align:start position:0%
water body um to protect it from lee8
 
04:01:04.670 --> 04:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
going into the river and if you're have
 
04:01:09.790 --> 04:01:09.800 align:start position:0%
100 or 110 acres 200 ft from a water
 
04:01:12.309 --> 04:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
body you know you still have a lot of
 
04:01:14.910 --> 04:01:14.920 align:start position:0%
land to be able to use for the landfill
 
04:01:14.920 --> 04:01:17.189 align:start position:0%
land to be able to use for the landfill
just

04:01:17.189 --> 04:01:17.199 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:01:20.149 --> 04:01:20.159 align:start position:0%
asking you bring up a topic that there's
 
04:01:21.790 --> 04:01:21.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of work going into right now at
 
04:01:25.189 --> 04:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
Dees the appropriate protective setbacks
 
04:01:29.229 --> 04:01:29.239 align:start position:0%
for landfills from surface water so we
 
04:01:31.710 --> 04:01:31.720 align:start position:0%
are working on that right now in our
 
04:01:34.349 --> 04:01:34.359 align:start position:0%
update of the solid waste rules the
 
04:01:36.309 --> 04:01:36.319 align:start position:0%
solid waste rules do
 
04:01:39.910 --> 04:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
allow uh permit to get a waiver of the
 
04:01:42.750 --> 04:01:42.760 align:start position:0%
rules if they can come up with an
 
04:01:44.670 --> 04:01:44.680 align:start position:0%
alternative to a requirement in the
 
04:01:48.110 --> 04:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
rules that is as protective as what the
 
04:01:48.120 --> 04:01:49.309 align:start position:0%
rules that is as protective as what the
rules

04:01:49.309 --> 04:01:49.319 align:start position:0%
rules
 
04:01:51.309 --> 04:01:51.319 align:start position:0%
require uh
 
04:01:54.189 --> 04:01:54.199 align:start position:0%
so if there was a
 
04:01:57.630 --> 04:01:57.640 align:start position:0%
site that had a need for something like
 
04:01:59.710 --> 04:01:59.720 align:start position:0%
that that could be considered for a
 
04:02:01.910 --> 04:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
waiver I don't know whether it could be
 
04:02:05.790 --> 04:02:05.800 align:start position:0%
demonstrated to be as protective or
 
04:02:07.950 --> 04:02:07.960 align:start position:0%
not okay any other questions from the
 
04:02:07.960 --> 04:02:09.830 align:start position:0%
not okay any other questions from the
Comm

04:02:09.830 --> 04:02:09.840 align:start position:0%

was being uh considered for uh s Caine
 
04:04:49.349 --> 04:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
in marac now this is a company that has
 
04:04:51.830 --> 04:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
lied over and over and over about what
 
04:04:54.429 --> 04:04:54.439 align:start position:0%
they do and how much um emissions they
 
04:04:57.630 --> 04:04:57.640 align:start position:0%
have put forward um they lied about a
 
04:05:01.630 --> 04:05:01.640 align:start position:0%
bypass that they had to use um and in
 
04:05:06.110 --> 04:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
several meetings with Dees prior to um s
 
04:05:08.670 --> 04:05:08.680 align:start position:0%
Cain saying they were going to close but
 
04:05:13.269 --> 04:05:13.279 align:start position:0%
prior to the the um this uh permit we
 
04:05:16.110 --> 04:05:16.120 align:start position:0%
were told that Dees is a regulatory
 
04:05:19.590 --> 04:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
committee and or a regulatory agency and
 
04:05:21.750 --> 04:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
they do not even though it's in their
 
04:05:24.269 --> 04:05:24.279 align:start position:0%
mission statement they do not need to
 
04:05:27.750 --> 04:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
consider people or the environment they
 
04:05:30.830 --> 04:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
don't need to protect it they um they we
 
04:05:32.070 --> 04:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
were at a meeting and we were
 
04:05:34.870 --> 04:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
specifically told that if a corporation
 
04:05:36.910 --> 04:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
checks off all of the boxes that are
 
04:05:39.269 --> 04:05:39.279 align:start position:0%
necessary for a permit they're given
 
04:05:41.149 --> 04:05:41.159 align:start position:0%
that permit regardless of whether or not
 
04:05:43.550 --> 04:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
there's going to be an impact to the
 
04:05:43.560 --> 04:05:45.070 align:start position:0%
there's going to be an impact to the
community

04:05:45.070 --> 04:05:45.080 align:start position:0%
community
 
04:05:48.189 --> 04:05:48.199 align:start position:0%
uh as you can probably imagine uh with
 
04:05:50.990 --> 04:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
the history that we have in miramac that
 
04:05:54.950 --> 04:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
just won't float and so initially when
 
04:05:56.830 --> 04:05:56.840 align:start position:0%
we when we came up with the idea for
 
04:06:00.229 --> 04:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
this bill we had sort of an idea that
 
04:06:00.239 --> 04:06:01.149 align:start position:0%
this bill we had sort of an idea that
just

04:06:01.149 --> 04:06:01.159 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:06:03.670 --> 04:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
all-encompassing Dees would have to
 
04:06:06.790 --> 04:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
consider public benefit and Community
 
04:06:09.110 --> 04:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
impact well you can't really do that you
 
04:06:11.110 --> 04:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
can't go into any agency and make a
 
04:06:13.910 --> 04:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
massive change like that and um we
 
04:06:15.830 --> 04:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
understood but that was sort of the mud
 
04:06:19.389 --> 04:06:19.399 align:start position:0%
that we put up on the wheel and so in
 
04:06:22.070 --> 04:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
discussion with Dees in discussion with
 
04:06:25.950 --> 04:06:25.960 align:start position:0%
some uh industry experts we decided that
 
04:06:28.469 --> 04:06:28.479 align:start position:0%
instead of making a massive change which
 
04:06:31.149 --> 04:06:31.159 align:start position:0%
I actually argue would be for the better
 
04:06:33.229 --> 04:06:33.239 align:start position:0%
but I understand that logistically it's
 
04:06:35.590 --> 04:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
not the best thing we were just going to
 
04:06:38.670 --> 04:06:38.680 align:start position:0%
take one permit the land fill permit
 
04:06:43.750 --> 04:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
just one and put wording into the the
 
04:06:47.830 --> 04:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
process for this where um they would
 
04:06:51.790 --> 04:06:51.800 align:start position:0%
have they Dees would have to consider uh
 
04:06:54.070 --> 04:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
environmental impact or they consider
 
04:06:56.070 --> 04:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
public benefit and environment and
 
04:06:58.870 --> 04:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
Community impact I'm sorry so on
 
04:07:02.510 --> 04:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment which is uh
 
04:07:08.269 --> 04:07:08.279 align:start position:0%
09h on lines 10 through 12 it identifies
 
04:07:10.110 --> 04:07:10.120 align:start position:0%
exactly what we're talking about and
 
04:07:12.870 --> 04:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
what Dees should consider for a landfill
 
04:07:15.590 --> 04:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
permit which includes human health
 
04:07:18.950 --> 04:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
property values tourism outdoor
 
04:07:20.790 --> 04:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
recreation and
 
04:07:24.429 --> 04:07:24.439 align:start position:0%
Wildlife um to cons or to figure out the
 
04:07:26.309 --> 04:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
impacts of these they should also they
 
04:07:30.269 --> 04:07:30.279 align:start position:0%
should be looking at noise odor traffic
 
04:07:32.750 --> 04:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
groundwater pollution and surface water
 
04:07:36.710 --> 04:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
pollution greenhouse gas and other
 
04:07:41.349 --> 04:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
emissions so this is this amendment uh
 
04:07:45.550 --> 04:07:45.560 align:start position:0%
to this bill would simply consider one
 
04:07:49.830 --> 04:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
permit and then if we pass this and we
 
04:07:52.830 --> 04:07:52.840 align:start position:0%
see in a year that that the agency has
 
04:07:55.389 --> 04:07:55.399 align:start position:0%
not blown up and in fact they have done
 
04:07:58.109 --> 04:07:58.119 align:start position:0%
a good job protecting the communities
 
04:08:00.510 --> 04:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
with these permits then perhaps we could
 
04:08:04.630 --> 04:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
extend it to other permits so that's um
 
04:08:04.640 --> 04:08:05.870 align:start position:0%
extend it to other permits so that's um
that's

04:08:05.870 --> 04:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:08:10.830 --> 04:08:10.840 align:start position:0%
the uh Amendment for for uh public input
 
04:08:12.550 --> 04:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
there's another amendment do you want to
 
04:08:14.990 --> 04:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
do you want to bring this one forward
 
04:08:18.550 --> 04:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
sure and if I may also speak uh about
 
04:08:19.830 --> 04:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
some of the other
 
04:08:24.750 --> 04:08:24.760 align:start position:0%
reasons why the uh 190 uh the amendment
 
04:08:27.710 --> 04:08:27.720 align:start position:0%
that we're proposing 190 is needed to to
 
04:08:30.630 --> 04:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
address some specific issues one has to
 
04:08:34.429 --> 04:08:34.439 align:start position:0%
do with providing support for local
 
04:08:35.990 --> 04:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
communities because as it stands right
 
04:08:38.070 --> 04:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
now there's a public input session and
 
04:08:40.349 --> 04:08:40.359 align:start position:0%
local communities have the opportunity
 
04:08:43.910 --> 04:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
to present their concerns uh but public
 
04:08:45.790 --> 04:08:45.800 align:start position:0%
communities you know our our local
 
04:08:47.469 --> 04:08:47.479 align:start position:0%
communities don't necessarily have the
 
04:08:49.389 --> 04:08:49.399 align:start position:0%
resources they need to hire experts to
 
04:08:51.950 --> 04:08:51.960 align:start position:0%
hire lawyers to hire geologists to do
 
04:08:54.950 --> 04:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
the types of uh investigations that
 
04:08:57.269 --> 04:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
permit applicants can do I mean they're
 
04:08:59.349 --> 04:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
inherently at a disadvantage so this
 
04:09:01.550 --> 04:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
bill would require the applicant who
 
04:09:05.070 --> 04:09:05.080 align:start position:0%
wants to place a facility in a community
 
04:09:08.229 --> 04:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
to uh through a third party
 
04:09:11.229 --> 04:09:11.239 align:start position:0%
do this work uh on behalf of the
 
04:09:12.750 --> 04:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
community that they want to site that
 
04:09:14.349 --> 04:09:14.359 align:start position:0%
they want to have a facility and so it's
 
04:09:16.590 --> 04:09:16.600 align:start position:0%
addressing a specific needs of
 
04:09:18.510 --> 04:09:18.520 align:start position:0%
communities to have the resources they
 
04:09:22.630 --> 04:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
need to be able to um to help evaluate
 
04:09:23.990 --> 04:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
the the the
 
04:09:26.870 --> 04:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
applications we also specifically
 
04:09:29.469 --> 04:09:29.479 align:start position:0%
expanded here it refers to in line seven
 
04:09:32.670 --> 04:09:32.680 align:start position:0%
to the host community and ab budding
 
04:09:34.990 --> 04:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities it's important for us
 
04:09:37.870 --> 04:09:37.880 align:start position:0%
right to recognize we all do that uh it
 
04:09:39.269 --> 04:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't you know these types of
 
04:09:41.790 --> 04:09:41.800 align:start position:0%
facilities aren't they're located in one
 
04:09:44.950 --> 04:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
town but they affect of towns all around
 
04:09:46.429 --> 04:09:46.439 align:start position:0%
that area right you've got trucks coming
 
04:09:49.469 --> 04:09:49.479 align:start position:0%
in and out you have the potential for
 
04:09:52.710 --> 04:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
air pollutants water pollutants uh Etc
 
04:09:55.510 --> 04:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
right so any type of evaluation of the
 
04:09:58.269 --> 04:09:58.279 align:start position:0%
impact has to be Regional and has to
 
04:10:02.389 --> 04:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
affect a variety of um communities that
 
04:10:04.269 --> 04:10:04.279 align:start position:0%
are AB budding the community where the
 
04:10:06.990 --> 04:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
facility is the other part of this bill
 
04:10:10.269 --> 04:10:10.279 align:start position:0%
um which is down in lines 20 to
 
04:10:13.429 --> 04:10:13.439 align:start position:0%
23 uh also makes it clear that when
 
04:10:16.109 --> 04:10:16.119 align:start position:0%
we're talking about public benefit as
 
04:10:19.269 --> 04:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
well as harm uh that it has to be
 
04:10:22.229 --> 04:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
specific to the facility that is being
 
04:10:25.309 --> 04:10:25.319 align:start position:0%
proposed you cannot use a second
 
04:10:28.030 --> 04:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
facility somewhere else in order to
 
04:10:30.510 --> 04:10:30.520 align:start position:0%
argue that you're enhancing the public
 
04:10:32.630 --> 04:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
benefit or diminishing the public harm
 
04:10:35.189 --> 04:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
it has to be specific to the facility
 
04:10:38.389 --> 04:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
that you are applying for um and just
 
04:10:41.990 --> 04:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
one more addition to this this um
 
04:10:44.349 --> 04:10:44.359 align:start position:0%
amendment is uh the F the original
 
04:10:46.790 --> 04:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal note was pretty awful um if you
 
04:10:49.870 --> 04:10:49.880 align:start position:0%
if you read it um it by having the
 
04:10:52.590 --> 04:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
corporations pay for this study it
 
04:10:55.269 --> 04:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
eliminates that fiscal note and I I'm
 
04:10:56.950 --> 04:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
sure you're going to have to have a
 
04:10:59.309 --> 04:10:59.319 align:start position:0%
person to oversee it but this is again
 
04:10:59.319 --> 04:11:01.510 align:start position:0%
person to oversee it but this is again
one

04:11:01.510 --> 04:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:11:03.710 --> 04:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
permit uh thank you and and so in
 
04:11:05.309 --> 04:11:05.319 align:start position:0%
reference to the Second Amendment and by
 
04:11:06.950 --> 04:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
the way we off we decided to offer
 
04:11:09.309 --> 04:11:09.319 align:start position:0%
represent Thomas and I two separate
 
04:11:11.189 --> 04:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
amendments because we we think that they
 
04:11:13.830 --> 04:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
deal with kind of two different things
 
04:11:16.229 --> 04:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
uh and we don't want them necessarily to
 
04:11:17.990 --> 04:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
have to be tied to one another so that
 
04:11:21.109 --> 04:11:21.119 align:start position:0%
we can kind of discuss them take leave
 
04:11:23.630 --> 04:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
whatever amend as as needed but we felt
 
04:11:25.590 --> 04:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
it was better off for the committee's
 
04:11:27.389 --> 04:11:27.399 align:start position:0%
purposes to have these as two separate
 
04:11:29.990 --> 04:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
amendments rather than one Amendment but
 
04:11:32.309 --> 04:11:32.319 align:start position:0%
the Second Amendment
 
04:11:32.319 --> 04:11:35.670 align:start position:0%
the Second Amendment
2024

04:11:35.670 --> 04:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:38.790 --> 04:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
d187 was draft it in response to the
 
04:11:41.910 --> 04:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
December Supreme Court uh decision
 
04:11:44.830 --> 04:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
regarding public benefit um I have a
 
04:11:46.429 --> 04:11:46.439 align:start position:0%
copy of it it's online but I'm also
 
04:11:48.750 --> 04:11:48.760 align:start position:0%
happy to to to provide it for the
 
04:11:51.710 --> 04:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
committee uh this was a dispute
 
04:11:55.149 --> 04:11:55.159 align:start position:0%
involving conservation law Foundation uh
 
04:11:58.149 --> 04:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
and uh uh
 
04:12:01.309 --> 04:12:01.319 align:start position:0%
ncees and uh and Dees as well and there
 
04:12:04.070 --> 04:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
was a debate over how to
 
04:12:06.550 --> 04:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
determine public benefits specifically
 
04:12:09.189 --> 04:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
with regard to capacity and need right
 
04:12:12.070 --> 04:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
and so one side was arguing I believe
 
04:12:13.910 --> 04:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
the conservation law Foundation was
 
04:12:15.149 --> 04:12:15.159 align:start position:0%
arguing that you need to be able to
 
04:12:17.990 --> 04:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
demonstrate need for that facility for
 
04:12:20.189 --> 04:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
effectively every day of the lifetime of
 
04:12:20.199 --> 04:12:21.189 align:start position:0%
effectively every day of the lifetime of
that

04:12:21.189 --> 04:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:12:23.590 --> 04:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
facility the more you know on the other
 
04:12:25.229 --> 04:12:25.239 align:start position:0%
end is the argument that you only need
 
04:12:27.309 --> 04:12:27.319 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate effectively one day of
 
04:12:29.030 --> 04:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
need right if there's any shortfall at
 
04:12:31.710 --> 04:12:31.720 align:start position:0%
all even for one day of the lifetime of
 
04:12:34.750 --> 04:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
that permit that that constitutes need
 
04:12:38.229 --> 04:12:38.239 align:start position:0%
the court determined that Dees has
 
04:12:41.070 --> 04:12:41.080 align:start position:0%
considerable statutory flexibility to
 
04:12:44.469 --> 04:12:44.479 align:start position:0%
determine what need means right uh and
 
04:12:44.479 --> 04:12:45.950 align:start position:0%
determine what need means right uh and
so

04:12:45.950 --> 04:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:12:48.469 --> 04:12:48.479 align:start position:0%
this uh amendment that we're offering
 
04:12:50.229 --> 04:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
here is a
 
04:12:53.189 --> 04:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
solomonic uh solution to the problem uh
 
04:12:55.149 --> 04:12:55.159 align:start position:0%
which is to say that when we look at the
 
04:12:57.070 --> 04:12:57.080 align:start position:0%
lifetime of the permit you need to be
 
04:12:59.950 --> 04:12:59.960 align:start position:0%
able to demonstrate need for at least
 
04:13:02.870 --> 04:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
half of the lifetime of that permit uh
 
04:13:05.389 --> 04:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
and that splits the difference between
 
04:13:07.429 --> 04:13:07.439 align:start position:0%
the two positions that were argued
 
04:13:10.030 --> 04:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
before the court uh so in this case what
 
04:13:11.389 --> 04:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
through this amendment we're asking the
 
04:13:14.070 --> 04:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
legislature to do is to provide specific
 
04:13:17.309 --> 04:13:17.319 align:start position:0%
direction to Dees uh and to say that
 
04:13:19.990 --> 04:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
when considering need uh need has to be
 
04:13:22.070 --> 04:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
demonstrated as you said for at least
 
04:13:24.269 --> 04:13:24.279 align:start position:0%
one half of the lifetime of the permit
 
04:13:26.269 --> 04:13:26.279 align:start position:0%
for the uh specific
 
04:13:29.469 --> 04:13:29.479 align:start position:0%
facility and the amendment also uh
 
04:13:31.510 --> 04:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
stipulates that a new facility would not
 
04:13:34.750 --> 04:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
be able to operate until the year of the
 
04:13:36.830 --> 04:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
shortfall so for example if they're
 
04:13:38.590 --> 04:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
holding if they're if they've applied
 
04:13:41.590 --> 04:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
for a 10-year permit and there's a an
 
04:13:44.790 --> 04:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
anticipated shortfall in in year nine
 
04:13:46.469 --> 04:13:46.479 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be able to start operating
 
04:13:49.269 --> 04:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
until year nine they wouldn't be able to
 
04:13:51.830 --> 04:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
open up a landfill and use it and you
 
04:13:53.870 --> 04:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
know for the first nine years just
 
04:13:55.510 --> 04:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
because there was that anticipated
 
04:13:59.269 --> 04:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
shortfall in year nine so this this
 
04:14:01.149 --> 04:14:01.159 align:start position:0%
amendment also addresses that
 
04:14:03.510 --> 04:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas wouldn't that
 
04:14:06.070 --> 04:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
create a monopoly where you would only
 
04:14:06.080 --> 04:14:08.070 align:start position:0%
create a monopoly where you would only
have

04:14:08.070 --> 04:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:14:09.149 --> 04:14:09.159 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:14:12.269 --> 04:14:12.279 align:start position:0%
one this new one Land one new landfill
 
04:14:13.950 --> 04:14:13.960 align:start position:0%
what if what if there were two new
 
04:14:15.429 --> 04:14:15.439 align:start position:0%
landfills coming
 
04:14:15.439 --> 04:14:17.750 align:start position:0%
landfills coming
online

04:14:17.750 --> 04:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
online
 
04:14:21.550 --> 04:14:21.560 align:start position:0%
um then then you're not you're how do
 
04:14:23.630 --> 04:14:23.640 align:start position:0%
you assess that shortfall there is no
 
04:14:23.640 --> 04:14:25.710 align:start position:0%
you assess that shortfall there is no
shortfall

04:14:25.710 --> 04:14:25.720 align:start position:0%
shortfall
 
04:14:28.229 --> 04:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
really we currently have two large
 
04:14:30.630 --> 04:14:30.640 align:start position:0%
landfills in New Hampshire right right
 
04:14:34.189 --> 04:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
so and theoretically they're both being
 
04:14:36.550 --> 04:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
active because there's a shortfall this
 
04:14:39.269 --> 04:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
would be for for any new landfill not
 
04:14:43.109 --> 04:14:43.119 align:start position:0%
existing landfill right so but then
 
04:14:45.389 --> 04:14:45.399 align:start position:0%
you're saying that there would only be
 
04:14:49.189 --> 04:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
one new landfill at a time that would be
 
04:14:49.199 --> 04:14:50.229 align:start position:0%
one new landfill at a time that would be
coming

04:14:50.229 --> 04:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
coming
 
04:14:53.990 --> 04:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
online and not any others new
 
04:14:56.950 --> 04:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
ones I mean what if what if we wanted
 
04:14:59.309 --> 04:14:59.319 align:start position:0%
you know to place two new landfills
 
04:15:02.510 --> 04:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
somewhere wow I mean just just
 
04:15:04.149 --> 04:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
hypothetically not that you know we
 
04:15:05.870 --> 04:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
would go crazy putting landfills all
 
04:15:08.670 --> 04:15:08.680 align:start position:0%
over but yeah I hope we don't no but I'm
 
04:15:11.550 --> 04:15:11.560 align:start position:0%
just saying it it just seems like this
 
04:15:15.109 --> 04:15:15.119 align:start position:0%
kind of creates a monopoly of of a one
 
04:15:17.950 --> 04:15:17.960 align:start position:0%
new landfill coming online well if if I
 
04:15:20.389 --> 04:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
may speak to that Madam chair uh I I
 
04:15:22.070 --> 04:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
think that if we're talking about given
 
04:15:23.550 --> 04:15:23.560 align:start position:0%
our current
 
04:15:26.309 --> 04:15:26.319 align:start position:0%
capacity if we were looking at two new
 
04:15:30.189 --> 04:15:30.199 align:start position:0%
landfill permits there is no way two new
 
04:15:32.429 --> 04:15:32.439 align:start position:0%
landfills are required to meet our needs
 
04:15:35.269 --> 04:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
right so right there it creates a
 
04:15:39.870 --> 04:15:39.880 align:start position:0%
problem because uh this is simply not uh
 
04:15:41.070 --> 04:15:41.080 align:start position:0%
they would not be permittable I mean
 
04:15:42.950 --> 04:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
there's no reason to to even think about
 
04:15:44.870 --> 04:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
permitting two new landfills because we
 
04:15:46.750 --> 04:15:46.760 align:start position:0%
don't even begin to have the need for
 
04:15:48.630 --> 04:15:48.640 align:start position:0%
two new landfills so I think it would it
 
04:15:49.910 --> 04:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
would have to be in the sense of like
 
04:15:52.189 --> 04:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
who got their permit application in
 
04:15:54.550 --> 04:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
first and that that is
 
04:15:57.469 --> 04:15:57.479 align:start position:0%
uh I I think a perfectly reasonable
 
04:15:59.189 --> 04:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
process you know we there's only so much
 
04:16:02.109 --> 04:16:02.119 align:start position:0%
need you have people apply to provide a
 
04:16:04.389 --> 04:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
service for that need and you would do a
 
04:16:06.590 --> 04:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
first come first serve basis in terms of
 
04:16:09.309 --> 04:16:09.319 align:start position:0%
eval Val ating permit applications and
 
04:16:11.109 --> 04:16:11.119 align:start position:0%
Madam chair it would only be a monopoly
 
04:16:13.550 --> 04:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
if the same company is chosen
 
04:16:13.560 --> 04:16:16.109 align:start position:0%
if the same company is chosen
consistently

04:16:16.109 --> 04:16:16.119 align:start position:0%
consistently
 
04:16:20.269 --> 04:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
correct possibly um Switching gears I
 
04:16:23.710 --> 04:16:23.720 align:start position:0%
also have a question with regard to the
 
04:16:29.189 --> 04:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:34.309 --> 04:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
09h um lines 9 through 14 the assessment
 
04:16:35.990 --> 04:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
shall include harms that a landfill
 
04:16:37.550 --> 04:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
would likely cause
 
04:16:39.229 --> 04:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
by identifying and determining any
 
04:16:41.349 --> 04:16:41.359 align:start position:0%
potentially harmful impacts on human
 
04:16:43.870 --> 04:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
health property values tourism outdoor
 
04:16:45.030 --> 04:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
recreation and
 
04:16:48.030 --> 04:16:48.040 align:start position:0%
wildli such impacts may include noise
 
04:16:51.109 --> 04:16:51.119 align:start position:0%
odor odor uh traffic groundwater
 
04:16:52.510 --> 04:16:52.520 align:start position:0%
pollution surface water pollution
 
04:16:54.070 --> 04:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas and other emissions
 
04:16:56.229 --> 04:16:56.239 align:start position:0%
emanating from the facility and to
 
04:16:57.910 --> 04:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
include the emissions from transport of
 
04:17:00.070 --> 04:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
solid waste related material and
 
04:17:03.469 --> 04:17:03.479 align:start position:0%
byproducts to and from the proposed
 
04:17:06.469 --> 04:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
facility how do you envision all of that
 
04:17:06.479 --> 04:17:09.910 align:start position:0%
facility how do you envision all of that
being

04:17:09.910 --> 04:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:13.950 --> 04:17:13.960 align:start position:0%
Quantified that's a good question
 
04:17:17.229 --> 04:17:17.239 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure of the metrics but there
 
04:17:19.389 --> 04:17:19.399 align:start position:0%
there have to be
 
04:17:22.830 --> 04:17:22.840 align:start position:0%
metrics that that for example I mean I
 
04:17:26.269 --> 04:17:26.279 align:start position:0%
get for noise you can measure decb right
 
04:17:28.429 --> 04:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
um so transportation we were talking
 
04:17:32.109 --> 04:17:32.119 align:start position:0%
about Road usage so if if the roads that
 
04:17:33.950 --> 04:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
are being used with these heavy heavy
 
04:17:36.990 --> 04:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
trucks um have to be repaired more more
 
04:17:39.149 --> 04:17:39.159 align:start position:0%
often than not I mean that's a statistic
 
04:17:43.590 --> 04:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
you could use human health you would
 
04:17:46.070 --> 04:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
um well so this would be for a new
 
04:17:49.590 --> 04:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
landfill I mean the biggest one is any
 
04:17:52.070 --> 04:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
any pasas I mean any environmental
 
04:17:55.070 --> 04:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
toxins the potential for human health if
 
04:17:58.109 --> 04:17:58.119 align:start position:0%
they escape would be something to be
 
04:18:01.349 --> 04:18:01.359 align:start position:0%
considered that would still be
 
04:18:03.550 --> 04:18:03.560 align:start position:0%
um you know something they'd have to
 
04:18:07.710 --> 04:18:07.720 align:start position:0%
guess at they don't have any hard fast
 
04:18:09.189 --> 04:18:09.199 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:18:11.870 --> 04:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
numbers right and if I may thank you
 
04:18:14.550 --> 04:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh there's nothing in the
 
04:18:17.550 --> 04:18:17.560 align:start position:0%
bill that states that the assessment of
 
04:18:19.630 --> 04:18:19.640 align:start position:0%
impact has to be Quantified certainly
 
04:18:21.590 --> 04:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
some of them would require Quant you
 
04:18:22.830 --> 04:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
know quantity if you're talking about
 
04:18:24.870 --> 04:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
home values uh certainly if you're
 
04:18:26.830 --> 04:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
talking about noise as you pointed out
 
04:18:28.870 --> 04:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
these are things that can be Quantified
 
04:18:32.229 --> 04:18:32.239 align:start position:0%
but considering for example tourism
 
04:18:34.710 --> 04:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
right uh the assessment would take a
 
04:18:37.109 --> 04:18:37.119 align:start position:0%
look at what are some of the major
 
04:18:39.710 --> 04:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
tourist draws in the area and say that
 
04:18:42.910 --> 04:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
building a landfill next to a site that
 
04:18:46.710 --> 04:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
is a heavily um you know visited site
 
04:18:48.149 --> 04:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
you don't need to quantify that I mean
 
04:18:49.990 --> 04:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
these are things I would argue to the
 
04:18:52.510 --> 04:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
committee that we would all want if this
 
04:18:54.389 --> 04:18:54.399 align:start position:0%
facility a facility like this was being
 
04:18:56.590 --> 04:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
built in our communities these are
 
04:18:58.189 --> 04:18:58.199 align:start position:0%
precisely the things that we would want
 
04:19:00.670 --> 04:19:00.680 align:start position:0%
to know how is it going to impact local
 
04:19:03.349 --> 04:19:03.359 align:start position:0%
tourism in our our area how is it going
 
04:19:06.269 --> 04:19:06.279 align:start position:0%
to impact uh property values how is it
 
04:19:09.349 --> 04:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
going to to uh impact wildlife and some
 
04:19:11.550 --> 04:19:11.560 align:start position:0%
of these as I said are are quantifiable
 
04:19:13.990 --> 04:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
but some of them are kind of uh
 
04:19:16.309 --> 04:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
qualifiable in the sense that they are
 
04:19:17.790 --> 04:19:17.800 align:start position:0%
statements about the fact that you're
 
04:19:21.309 --> 04:19:21.319 align:start position:0%
building facility in close proximity
 
04:19:24.070 --> 04:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
to uh a natural beauty site like Mount
 
04:19:25.550 --> 04:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
manad knock down in in the in the
 
04:19:27.830 --> 04:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
chesher region right so I I hear what
 
04:19:29.349 --> 04:19:29.359 align:start position:0%
you're saying and and certainly some of
 
04:19:31.670 --> 04:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
these things can be Quantified like
 
04:19:33.429 --> 04:19:33.439 align:start position:0%
property values and there's a way to do
 
04:19:36.309 --> 04:19:36.319 align:start position:0%
that by looking at current landfills and
 
04:19:38.429 --> 04:19:38.439 align:start position:0%
their potential impact on on property
 
04:19:40.229 --> 04:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
value and projecting that onto a new
 
04:19:42.510 --> 04:19:42.520 align:start position:0%
site but as he said some of these are
 
04:19:44.510 --> 04:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
more quality issues that we all care
 
04:19:46.189 --> 04:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
about in our communities even if they're
 
04:19:48.309 --> 04:19:48.319 align:start position:0%
not strictly quantifiable and do you
 
04:19:51.710 --> 04:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
know whether or not Dees takes these
 
04:19:54.429 --> 04:19:54.439 align:start position:0%
particular things and quantifies them
 
04:19:56.670 --> 04:19:56.680 align:start position:0%
when they're currently doing their
 
04:19:59.309 --> 04:19:59.319 align:start position:0%
permitting I mean now Dees is going to
 
04:20:01.870 --> 04:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
be coming up in testifying as well and
 
04:20:04.710 --> 04:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
I'll ask them the same question but I
 
04:20:06.710 --> 04:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
don't know if you do if you knew that I
 
04:20:09.030 --> 04:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
look forward to their answer
 
04:20:12.109 --> 04:20:12.119 align:start position:0%
um the reason for this this bill and the
 
04:20:14.309 --> 04:20:14.319 align:start position:0%
fir one of the reasons is is that
 
04:20:17.630 --> 04:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
they're not obligated by law to consider
 
04:20:21.670 --> 04:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
the impact of permits on public benefit
 
04:20:24.750 --> 04:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
and Community impact I mean they they it
 
04:20:26.710 --> 04:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
is in their mission statement but it's
 
04:20:30.710 --> 04:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
not in law and so so it's you know they
 
04:20:32.590 --> 04:20:32.600 align:start position:0%
they they do one thing for one permit
 
04:20:34.389 --> 04:20:34.399 align:start position:0%
one thing for another permit this you
 
04:20:36.910 --> 04:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
know so there's no consistency about
 
04:20:39.790 --> 04:20:39.800 align:start position:0%
protecting the people you know or and
 
04:20:41.590 --> 04:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
and the environment from from some of
 
04:20:43.469 --> 04:20:43.479 align:start position:0%
these uh the
 
04:20:45.229 --> 04:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
permits I don't know if that answers
 
04:20:46.790 --> 04:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
your question and if I could just follow
 
04:20:48.349 --> 04:20:48.359 align:start position:0%
that up and I realize I want to get to
 
04:20:50.149 --> 04:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
to the questions that we spent we had
 
04:20:52.149 --> 04:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
several meetings with director whims and
 
04:20:54.349 --> 04:20:54.359 align:start position:0%
you know that's not to say that that his
 
04:20:56.229 --> 04:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
this has a stamp of approval but we
 
04:20:59.189 --> 04:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
narrowed this down specifically in
 
04:21:00.670 --> 04:21:00.680 align:start position:0%
response to a number of the questions
 
04:21:03.510 --> 04:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
and concerns that the director had the
 
04:21:05.309 --> 04:21:05.319 align:start position:0%
the bottom line here I think is that we
 
04:21:08.030 --> 04:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
need to be talking about net impact the
 
04:21:09.670 --> 04:21:09.680 align:start position:0%
problem with our public
 
04:21:11.910 --> 04:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
benefit the the way we weigh public
 
04:21:15.149 --> 04:21:15.159 align:start position:0%
benefit is that it doesn't involve a
 
04:21:18.670 --> 04:21:18.680 align:start position:0%
list of here are the advantages and here
 
04:21:20.590 --> 04:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
are the disadvantages and now we're
 
04:21:21.990 --> 04:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
going to compare the two to see which
 
04:21:23.950 --> 04:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
one comes out on top we don't do that
 
04:21:26.229 --> 04:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
the only seems to me rational way to
 
04:21:28.790 --> 04:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
determine whether to go forward is to
 
04:21:31.309 --> 04:21:31.319 align:start position:0%
have a statement of potential harm and a
 
04:21:33.349 --> 04:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
statement of potential benefit and to
 
04:21:35.389 --> 04:21:35.399 align:start position:0%
compare the two otherwise I think we're
 
04:21:36.990 --> 04:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
stuck with what we hear again and again
 
04:21:39.389 --> 04:21:39.399 align:start position:0%
and again is that Dees has a hard time
 
04:21:41.750 --> 04:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
determining what public benefit how it's
 
04:21:44.469 --> 04:21:44.479 align:start position:0%
defined so and let me ask you with this
 
04:21:47.309 --> 04:21:47.319 align:start position:0%
uh Amendment uh
 
04:21:51.590 --> 04:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
09h or and both maybe 0187
 
04:21:55.030 --> 04:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
H did I hear correctly that director
 
04:21:57.870 --> 04:21:57.880 align:start position:0%
whimet um had some input into this oh
 
04:21:59.870 --> 04:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay we had several meetings
 
04:22:01.389 --> 04:22:01.399 align:start position:0%
with him thank
 
04:22:04.790 --> 04:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
you representative NAB thank you madam
 
04:22:07.030 --> 04:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
04:22:08.670 --> 04:22:08.680 align:start position:0%
um representative gerana you sort of
 
04:22:11.229 --> 04:22:11.239 align:start position:0%
just got at a question I have um
 
04:22:13.109 --> 04:22:13.119 align:start position:0%
regarding the comparison of the benefits
 
04:22:15.429 --> 04:22:15.439 align:start position:0%
to the negatives but I look at your list
 
04:22:18.990 --> 04:22:19.000 align:start position:0%
and it's hard for me to think you know
 
04:22:20.830 --> 04:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
landfills are necessarily evils we need
 
04:22:23.109 --> 04:22:23.119 align:start position:0%
them but what is a case in which they
 
04:22:24.950 --> 04:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
would ever increase property values
 
04:22:27.750 --> 04:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
increase tourism increase Recreation
 
04:22:30.109 --> 04:22:30.119 align:start position:0%
it's always going to be I would think
 
04:22:31.389 --> 04:22:31.399 align:start position:0%
this list is always sort of going to
 
04:22:33.550 --> 04:22:33.560 align:start position:0%
come out negatively the impact of having
 
04:22:36.510 --> 04:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
a landfill in your area so do you look
 
04:22:38.429 --> 04:22:38.439 align:start position:0%
at it as a comparison to the benefit of
 
04:22:40.469 --> 04:22:40.479 align:start position:0%
having the landfill do you look at it as
 
04:22:42.149 --> 04:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
this spot that's right next to a lake or
 
04:22:43.750 --> 04:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
right next to a town is worse than if
 
04:22:46.389 --> 04:22:46.399 align:start position:0%
the spot was a little more remote I mean
 
04:22:47.950 --> 04:22:47.960 align:start position:0%
how do you think about this list because
 
04:22:50.070 --> 04:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
I look at it and say your report's never
 
04:22:51.910 --> 04:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
going to say hey this is great it's
 
04:22:53.189 --> 04:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
going to be great for all these things
 
04:22:55.189 --> 04:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
right to have a landfill that's it's
 
04:22:56.990 --> 04:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
hard to imagine that would ever be the
 
04:22:59.149 --> 04:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
outcome thank you very much
 
04:23:01.229 --> 04:23:01.239 align:start position:0%
representative for the question I I
 
04:23:02.990 --> 04:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
think that you're right it's not going
 
04:23:04.309 --> 04:23:04.319 align:start position:0%
to come out negative but it should come
 
04:23:05.990 --> 04:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
out neutral you know I mean we all want
 
04:23:07.590 --> 04:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
to know know if if citing one of these
 
04:23:08.950 --> 04:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
things in our community is going to
 
04:23:11.510 --> 04:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
negatively impact our property values so
 
04:23:14.469 --> 04:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
the purpose is not to uh have this come
 
04:23:17.790 --> 04:23:17.800 align:start position:0%
out as a as a say positive impact on the
 
04:23:19.910 --> 04:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
community but as I said I think we
 
04:23:23.389 --> 04:23:23.399 align:start position:0%
should all be given um a sense of if
 
04:23:26.670 --> 04:23:26.680 align:start position:0%
there might be a negative impact and
 
04:23:28.830 --> 04:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
another thing is and I'm we're playing
 
04:23:31.429 --> 04:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
tag here and I hope it's not confusing
 
04:23:34.870 --> 04:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
but um this assessment would allow the
 
04:23:38.149 --> 04:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
community to have their eyes open so if
 
04:23:40.030 --> 04:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
it says you know there's potential for
 
04:23:42.349 --> 04:23:42.359 align:start position:0%
leachate leak into the lake you know
 
04:23:44.510 --> 04:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
people could maybe start filtering water
 
04:23:46.309 --> 04:23:46.319 align:start position:0%
now before it becomes an issue or
 
04:23:48.630 --> 04:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
something like that so it's it's eyes
 
04:23:50.910 --> 04:23:50.920 align:start position:0%
open for the community I'm not
 
04:23:52.910 --> 04:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily saying that you know it's
 
04:23:54.790 --> 04:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
going to stop any landfills that's not
 
04:23:57.830 --> 04:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
the point of this the point is if we're
 
04:23:59.670 --> 04:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
going to have a landfill let's make sure
 
04:24:01.710 --> 04:24:01.720 align:start position:0%
it's safe let's make sure people know
 
04:24:04.670 --> 04:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
about any potential hazards and and
 
04:24:07.070 --> 04:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
let's make sure the benefit out the the
 
04:24:09.830 --> 04:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
negative part of it representative H
 
04:24:12.070 --> 04:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
Haskins thank you madam chair and thank
 
04:24:14.229 --> 04:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um
 
04:24:16.429 --> 04:24:16.439 align:start position:0%
representative gerana I'd like to take
 
04:24:19.389 --> 04:24:19.399 align:start position:0%
the metaphor of Solomon because I
 
04:24:22.790 --> 04:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
studied the Hebrew Bible and in that
 
04:24:27.070 --> 04:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
example the objective was the baby had
 
04:24:29.910 --> 04:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
to survive when two women said it was
 
04:24:32.189 --> 04:24:32.199 align:start position:0%
their baby Solomon had to make a
 
04:24:35.630 --> 04:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
decision if we have risk benefit
 
04:24:38.109 --> 04:24:38.119 align:start position:0%
analysis that the feds have been doing
 
04:24:40.830 --> 04:24:40.840 align:start position:0%
for years can't we use some of those
 
04:24:44.590 --> 04:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
examples to tell us how to do public
 
04:24:47.710 --> 04:24:47.720 align:start position:0%
benefit how to weigh public
 
04:24:50.070 --> 04:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
benefit thank you for the question and
 
04:24:52.229 --> 04:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
and and appreciate your expertise your
 
04:24:54.670 --> 04:24:54.680 align:start position:0%
theological expertise yes I I agree this
 
04:24:56.429 --> 04:24:56.439 align:start position:0%
is not Reinventing the wheel this is not
 
04:24:58.990 --> 04:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
something that people don't already do
 
04:25:01.309 --> 04:25:01.319 align:start position:0%
right so uh there are processes for this
 
04:25:02.950 --> 04:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
at the federal level as you point out
 
04:25:04.510 --> 04:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
and they are certainly adaptable and
 
04:25:07.469 --> 04:25:07.479 align:start position:0%
applicable uh in New Hampshire thank you
 
04:25:09.910 --> 04:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:25:13.469 --> 04:25:13.479 align:start position:0%
Penza just to kind of follow up on that
 
04:25:15.349 --> 04:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
because it seemed as if there was a
 
04:25:17.309 --> 04:25:17.319 align:start position:0%
question that these aren't you know this
 
04:25:19.630 --> 04:25:19.640 align:start position:0%
would just be you know a guess these are
 
04:25:20.990 --> 04:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
these are people that have dedicated
 
04:25:24.670 --> 04:25:24.680 align:start position:0%
their whole lives to risk analysis
 
04:25:27.990 --> 04:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
public benefit all of that and I mean
 
04:25:30.149 --> 04:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
all I know is that this happens all the
 
04:25:32.429 --> 04:25:32.439 align:start position:0%
time for even in private businesses you
 
04:25:34.750 --> 04:25:34.760 align:start position:0%
know you have to weigh the good versus
 
04:25:36.910 --> 04:25:36.920 align:start position:0%
the bad to say if it's if it makes sense
 
04:25:39.229 --> 04:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
for to go forward this isn't just about
 
04:25:41.149 --> 04:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
landfills this is about everything
 
04:25:43.870 --> 04:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
correct that falls in the agency
 
04:25:48.070 --> 04:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
eventually we hope it's about everything
 
04:25:50.349 --> 04:25:50.359 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:25:54.309 --> 04:25:54.319 align:start position:0%
Duty uh thank you madam chair um I'll go
 
04:25:56.389 --> 04:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
back to the comment I made about the
 
04:25:58.750 --> 04:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
ashalt plant
 
04:26:02.030 --> 04:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
um the the people of Nashville who came
 
04:26:06.149 --> 04:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
to that meeting uh hit the floor when
 
04:26:09.309 --> 04:26:09.319 align:start position:0%
they found out that their concerns about
 
04:26:12.870 --> 04:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
air quality uh regarding their children
 
04:26:15.510 --> 04:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
they they lived in those areas uh
 
04:26:18.710 --> 04:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
children walked to school in that area
 
04:26:21.550 --> 04:26:21.560 align:start position:0%
and um the ashalt plant was going to be
 
04:26:24.030 --> 04:26:24.040 align:start position:0%
open I think from 6:00 in the morning
 
04:26:26.830 --> 04:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
until 5:00 at night and I think they
 
04:26:29.149 --> 04:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to operate at least six days a
 
04:26:33.070 --> 04:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
week maybe 7 days a week and residents
 
04:26:36.830 --> 04:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
in the community were told that they any
 
04:26:40.109 --> 04:26:40.119 align:start position:0%
concerns they had about a diminishment
 
04:26:43.229 --> 04:26:43.239 align:start position:0%
of their quality life could not and
 
04:26:44.870 --> 04:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
would not be
 
04:26:51.269 --> 04:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
considered okay and um I just find that
 
04:26:55.309 --> 04:26:55.319 align:start position:0%
um that that's unconscionable that's
 
04:26:58.229 --> 04:26:58.239 align:start position:0%
unconscionable especially when
 
04:27:00.590 --> 04:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
representative Duty do you have a
 
04:27:02.990 --> 04:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
question yeah the well it's not a
 
04:27:05.269 --> 04:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
question I'm sorry the statement is I
 
04:27:07.830 --> 04:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
think that some something like this may
 
04:27:10.510 --> 04:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
make Industries or people that want to
 
04:27:13.670 --> 04:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
locate this think about how they can
 
04:27:16.149 --> 04:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
build these representative duty if you
 
04:27:18.670 --> 04:27:18.680 align:start position:0%
don't have a question please refrain
 
04:27:20.429 --> 04:27:20.439 align:start position:0%
okay thank you madam chair yeah
 
04:27:23.469 --> 04:27:23.479 align:start position:0%
representative sofikitis
 
04:27:26.590 --> 04:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
um I just um for the record I just want
 
04:27:28.349 --> 04:27:28.359 align:start position:0%
to know because I had heard that St
 
04:27:31.590 --> 04:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
gobain was closing are they
 
04:27:35.109 --> 04:27:35.119 align:start position:0%
closing they um have plans to close this
 
04:27:35.119 --> 04:27:36.950 align:start position:0%
closing they um have plans to close this
summer

04:27:36.950 --> 04:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
summer
 
04:27:39.149 --> 04:27:39.159 align:start position:0%
we're in the process of trying to figure
 
04:27:42.109 --> 04:27:42.119 align:start position:0%
out what that means as far as cleaning
 
04:27:44.550 --> 04:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
up the building getting rid of what's
 
04:27:46.189 --> 04:27:46.199 align:start position:0%
inside the building and cleaning up the
 
04:27:48.910 --> 04:27:48.920 align:start position:0%
land around it although you can't clean
 
04:27:50.870 --> 04:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for
 
04:27:50.880 --> 04:27:52.389 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for
representative

04:27:52.389 --> 04:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:27:54.870 --> 04:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
kraton thank you ma'am and thank you for
 
04:27:58.189 --> 04:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
this bill it
 
04:28:00.830 --> 04:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
clearly the community impact should be
 
04:28:03.229 --> 04:28:03.239 align:start position:0%
considered what I'm looking at though is
 
04:28:05.389 --> 04:28:05.399 align:start position:0%
the is the amendment and I don't
 
04:28:08.149 --> 04:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
understand how it works what what I
 
04:28:09.670 --> 04:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
think you're saying is that if I'm going
 
04:28:11.510 --> 04:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
to put several billions of dollars into
 
04:28:15.510 --> 04:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
building a landfill that I have to bet
 
04:28:19.670 --> 04:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
that my timing is correct in terms of
 
04:28:21.109 --> 04:28:21.119 align:start position:0%
the other
 
04:28:24.550 --> 04:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
plant closing and my plant opening
 
04:28:26.229 --> 04:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
otherwise I build this multi-million
 
04:28:29.389 --> 04:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
dollar plant and I can't open it because
 
04:28:31.309 --> 04:28:31.319 align:start position:0%
our law now says that you can only have
 
04:28:33.550 --> 04:28:33.560 align:start position:0%
one based on a
 
04:28:35.429 --> 04:28:35.439 align:start position:0%
capacity I think that's what you said
 
04:28:37.910 --> 04:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
you said said you can't open this plant
 
04:28:39.389 --> 04:28:39.399 align:start position:0%
until the other plant
 
04:28:42.389 --> 04:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
expires based on the need no no no no no
 
04:28:45.109 --> 04:28:45.119 align:start position:0%
no that's I don't I I may have misspoken
 
04:28:48.030 --> 04:28:48.040 align:start position:0%
um you cannot so if if the need is
 
04:28:50.389 --> 04:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
projected so we we currently have two
 
04:28:52.590 --> 04:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
plants uh two landfills two large
 
04:28:55.229 --> 04:28:55.239 align:start position:0%
landfills in New Hampshire um if to put
 
04:28:58.070 --> 04:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
in a third one um you would have to go
 
04:29:00.349 --> 04:29:00.359 align:start position:0%
through the the permitting process which
 
04:29:02.070 --> 04:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
this doesn't change the permitting
 
04:29:04.229 --> 04:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
process it it changes one one tiny
 
04:29:05.429 --> 04:29:05.439 align:start position:0%
aspect but you still have to go through
 
04:29:09.670 --> 04:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
that process um and the only way you
 
04:29:11.870 --> 04:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
that you should be getting the permit is
 
04:29:15.030 --> 04:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
if a need and a shortfall is
 
04:29:17.550 --> 04:29:17.560 align:start position:0%
identified like you know in in five
 
04:29:19.429 --> 04:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
years we're going to need you know more
 
04:29:22.990 --> 04:29:23.000 align:start position:0%
landfill capacity so so the the permit
 
04:29:25.469 --> 04:29:25.479 align:start position:0%
would be given to you on the on the
 
04:29:28.349 --> 04:29:28.359 align:start position:0%
understanding that in five years that's
 
04:29:30.309 --> 04:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
what that's when we'll be needing you so
 
04:29:32.990 --> 04:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
you can build it and everything but this
 
04:29:36.550 --> 04:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
this second Amendment would say until
 
04:29:39.790 --> 04:29:39.800 align:start position:0%
that need is here you can't start using
 
04:29:42.510 --> 04:29:42.520 align:start position:0%
it you can't start using it but it's if
 
04:29:45.229 --> 04:29:45.239 align:start position:0%
like you said it's a fiveyear lead time
 
04:29:49.109 --> 04:29:49.119 align:start position:0%
so you I'm it just just seems
 
04:29:51.389 --> 04:29:51.399 align:start position:0%
exorbitantly complicated to me okay
 
04:29:53.830 --> 04:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm sorry man I I'll just
 
04:29:56.670 --> 04:29:56.680 align:start position:0%
speak to that so first of all this this
 
04:29:58.389 --> 04:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
I would like hopefully Pro s away from
 
04:30:00.349 --> 04:30:00.359 align:start position:0%
the notion that it can only be one
 
04:30:02.030 --> 04:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the bill that that
 
04:30:04.630 --> 04:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
that that mandates that what it says is
 
04:30:07.750 --> 04:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
that and this is already part of of
 
04:30:10.950 --> 04:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
rules that that the question about
 
04:30:13.990 --> 04:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
public benefit is inseparably linked to
 
04:30:17.389 --> 04:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
need capacity and need and what we're
 
04:30:21.229 --> 04:30:21.239 align:start position:0%
saying is that a either an expansion or
 
04:30:24.429 --> 04:30:24.439 align:start position:0%
a new landfill should not be opened and
 
04:30:26.990 --> 04:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
begin operating until the point where
 
04:30:30.070 --> 04:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
there is need this is not uh certainly
 
04:30:32.550 --> 04:30:32.560 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's a business and necessary
 
04:30:34.389 --> 04:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
evil as as representative NAB pointed
 
04:30:36.429 --> 04:30:36.439 align:start position:0%
out but uh we shouldn't be in a
 
04:30:38.510 --> 04:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
situation and and I know none of us are
 
04:30:40.710 --> 04:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
are here and thinking that because
 
04:30:42.990 --> 04:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
companies can make a profit opening
 
04:30:45.109 --> 04:30:45.119 align:start position:0%
landfills they should just be open be
 
04:30:46.830 --> 04:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
able to open landfills because they can
 
04:30:49.630 --> 04:30:49.640 align:start position:0%
make money doing it what we're saying is
 
04:30:51.670 --> 04:30:51.680 align:start position:0%
that you shouldn't be able to begin
 
04:30:54.910 --> 04:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
operating an expansion or a new landfill
 
04:30:56.630 --> 04:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
until the point where there is a
 
04:31:00.670 --> 04:31:00.680 align:start position:0%
demonstrated need for that landfill so
 
04:31:01.990 --> 04:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
we're not opening landfills that are
 
04:31:02.990 --> 04:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
simply not
 
04:31:05.750 --> 04:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
needed representative Duty thank thank
 
04:31:08.750 --> 04:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
you madam chair are you aware that I
 
04:31:12.670 --> 04:31:12.680 align:start position:0%
believe that um these um that this
 
04:31:15.750 --> 04:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
already exists in the health care field
 
04:31:18.590 --> 04:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
and in hospitals uh I I believe that
 
04:31:21.229 --> 04:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that they have to
 
04:31:23.189 --> 04:31:23.199 align:start position:0%
go before regulatory board and
 
04:31:24.870 --> 04:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
demonstrate need before you can build a
 
04:31:27.389 --> 04:31:27.399 align:start position:0%
new hospital did you check to see if
 
04:31:29.349 --> 04:31:29.359 align:start position:0%
that's a mo is that the kind of model
 
04:31:31.389 --> 04:31:31.399 align:start position:0%
that you're using for
 
04:31:31.399 --> 04:31:33.670 align:start position:0%
that you're using for
this

04:31:33.670 --> 04:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:31:37.429 --> 04:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
um the details of this I I spent many
 
04:31:39.590 --> 04:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
hours this summer talking to uh
 
04:31:42.830 --> 04:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
legislators from New York State um and
 
04:31:45.950 --> 04:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
they have um and again it was um past Le
 
04:31:48.309 --> 04:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
they've got HK Falls which is comparable
 
04:31:50.630 --> 04:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
to our marac um which is comparable to
 
04:31:50.640 --> 04:31:52.149 align:start position:0%
to our marac um which is comparable to
Bennington

04:31:52.149 --> 04:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
Bennington
 
04:31:55.990 --> 04:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
Vermont um and one of the differences
 
04:31:58.149 --> 04:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
they have a Department of Environmental
 
04:32:00.910 --> 04:32:00.920 align:start position:0%
Protection and that's I think that's
 
04:32:04.510 --> 04:32:04.520 align:start position:0%
what this is trying to do um because
 
04:32:05.950 --> 04:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
right now we have a department of
 
04:32:07.750 --> 04:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services which is a
 
04:32:10.830 --> 04:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
regulatory committee uh again agency not
 
04:32:14.349 --> 04:32:14.359 align:start position:0%
committee um and so this tries to bring
 
04:32:16.790 --> 04:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
it in line with more of a
 
04:32:19.670 --> 04:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
protection for the citizens of New
 
04:32:21.429 --> 04:32:21.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh
 
04:32:23.870 --> 04:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
agency and and if I may respond
 
04:32:25.309 --> 04:32:25.319 align:start position:0%
representative duty to your question and
 
04:32:27.389 --> 04:32:27.399 align:start position:0%
also try to provide some more clarity I
 
04:32:28.389 --> 04:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
should have thought about this when I
 
04:32:30.389 --> 04:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
was responding to representative kraton
 
04:32:32.429 --> 04:32:32.439 align:start position:0%
I would refer my colleagues to and I can
 
04:32:34.870 --> 04:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
again submit it uh to the clerk to the
 
04:32:37.630 --> 04:32:37.640 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court court case Pages 9 through
 
04:32:40.189 --> 04:32:40.199 align:start position:0%
11 what we are addressing is
 
04:32:43.429 --> 04:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
specifically in response to the ruling
 
04:32:45.510 --> 04:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
by the Supreme Court right so when when
 
04:32:49.109 --> 04:32:49.119 align:start position:0%
I talk about the need to demonstrate
 
04:32:52.309 --> 04:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
need as it were this is specifically
 
04:32:54.990 --> 04:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
addressing the issues that were raised
 
04:32:57.469 --> 04:32:57.479 align:start position:0%
in this ruling and the ruling was that
 
04:33:00.469 --> 04:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
Dees has considerable regulatory
 
04:33:03.149 --> 04:33:03.159 align:start position:0%
flexibility in determining what need
 
04:33:05.910 --> 04:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
means what we are saying is that we as a
 
04:33:08.390 --> 04:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
legislature have the responsibility of
 
04:33:10.789 --> 04:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
actually determining what need means and
 
04:33:12.429 --> 04:33:12.439 align:start position:0%
we we've heard from Dees a number of
 
04:33:14.869 --> 04:33:14.879 align:start position:0%
times uh that it's difficult for them to
 
04:33:16.990 --> 04:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
do things without clarification so I'll
 
04:33:18.990 --> 04:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
submit this and I would ask my committee
 
04:33:21.070 --> 04:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
colleagues to read the case especially
 
04:33:24.349 --> 04:33:24.359 align:start position:0%
Pages 9 through 11 because what this
 
04:33:28.910 --> 04:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
amendment does specifically responds to
 
04:33:32.510 --> 04:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
the case uh the ruling by the Supreme
 
04:33:36.189 --> 04:33:36.199 align:start position:0%
Court representative Penza
 
04:33:38.070 --> 04:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
okay so I was a little confused because
 
04:33:41.709 --> 04:33:41.719 align:start position:0%
the initial bill does not speak about
 
04:33:46.709 --> 04:33:46.719 align:start position:0%
landfills and so the the two amendments
 
04:33:49.470 --> 04:33:49.480 align:start position:0%
replace 100% okay so that's where I
 
04:33:54.629 --> 04:33:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:57.750 --> 04:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
um so would you want both of these to be
 
04:33:59.789 --> 04:33:59.799 align:start position:0%
applied is really where it would be one
 
04:34:03.189 --> 04:34:03.199 align:start position:0%
or the other like I'm getting I ideally
 
04:34:05.789 --> 04:34:05.799 align:start position:0%
we would like both um
 
04:34:09.189 --> 04:34:09.199 align:start position:0%
however um the uh 90
 
04:34:13.910 --> 04:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
190 um is more specific about the public
 
04:34:17.189 --> 04:34:17.199 align:start position:0%
benefit and 87
 
04:34:21.429 --> 04:34:21.439 align:start position:0%
1887 um addresses that uh Supreme Court
 
04:34:24.949 --> 04:34:24.959 align:start position:0%
ruling which is included in the
 
04:34:27.349 --> 04:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
definition of public benefit so ideally
 
04:34:29.750 --> 04:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
both of them should be should be passed
 
04:34:31.551 --> 04:34:31.561 align:start position:0%
we just made them separate because we
 
04:34:34.269 --> 04:34:34.279 align:start position:0%
didn't want one to bog down the
 
04:34:34.279 --> 04:34:35.869 align:start position:0%
didn't want one to bog down the
other

04:34:35.869 --> 04:34:35.879 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:34:35.879 --> 04:34:37.029 align:start position:0%
other
representative

04:34:37.029 --> 04:34:37.039 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:34:39.230 --> 04:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you madam chair and thank
 
04:34:41.150 --> 04:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question to the the
 
04:34:44.949 --> 04:34:44.959 align:start position:0%
two uh just two of maybe many of the
 
04:34:48.949 --> 04:34:48.959 align:start position:0%
sponsors sorry um my question is uh are
 
04:34:50.750 --> 04:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
there other instances in where host
 
04:34:52.629 --> 04:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
communities are notified in public
 
04:34:55.910 --> 04:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
comment uh is taken when there are other
 
04:34:59.269 --> 04:34:59.279 align:start position:0%
um entities or buildings like maybe
 
04:35:01.629 --> 04:35:01.639 align:start position:0%
jails or nuclear power plants or
 
04:35:03.709 --> 04:35:03.719 align:start position:0%
anything of the like that are like built
 
04:35:05.349 --> 04:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
or established in a community is there
 
04:35:08.551 --> 04:35:08.561 align:start position:0%
any other precedent that um is available
 
04:35:10.910 --> 04:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
for us to look at aside from rul making
 
04:35:12.150 --> 04:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
and all of those other things where we
 
04:35:14.709 --> 04:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
know public is invited to comment but
 
04:35:16.750 --> 04:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
with specificity to the creation of a
 
04:35:20.551 --> 04:35:20.561 align:start position:0%
new entity like a new
 
04:35:24.709 --> 04:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
landfill I I believe um the process that
 
04:35:27.310 --> 04:35:27.320 align:start position:0%
Dees uses U almost always includes
 
04:35:31.429 --> 04:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
public input um Community input um
 
04:35:33.709 --> 04:35:33.719 align:start position:0%
however we were
 
04:35:36.349 --> 04:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
um I we were were we were told by an
 
04:35:39.910 --> 04:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
employee of Dees that that they don't
 
04:35:41.470 --> 04:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
especially for written testimony they
 
04:35:45.150 --> 04:35:45.160 align:start position:0%
don't look at things like like s Cain
 
04:35:47.349 --> 04:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
has lied s Cain has has been mistr
 
04:35:50.629 --> 04:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
truthful s Cain has done this um they
 
04:35:53.470 --> 04:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
like comments that say there's a typo on
 
04:35:55.830 --> 04:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
line seven or something like that you
 
04:35:58.109 --> 04:35:58.119 align:start position:0%
know so again they've reinforced they
 
04:36:01.029 --> 04:36:01.039 align:start position:0%
are a regulatory agency and even though
 
04:36:04.390 --> 04:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
they they invite public input um it's
 
04:36:05.949 --> 04:36:05.959 align:start position:0%
questionable about whether or not they
 
04:36:09.869 --> 04:36:09.879 align:start position:0%
actually consider uh the actual input to
 
04:36:12.109 --> 04:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
the community the direct
 
04:36:14.310 --> 04:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
input yes and I would say I I don't know
 
04:36:16.070 --> 04:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
the answer and I'll I'll make some
 
04:36:18.109 --> 04:36:18.119 align:start position:0%
inquiries prisons sound like a an
 
04:36:20.070 --> 04:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
example of that you know what what we're
 
04:36:22.109 --> 04:36:22.119 align:start position:0%
saying is that the current process
 
04:36:22.119 --> 04:36:23.310 align:start position:0%
saying is that the current process
already

04:36:23.310 --> 04:36:23.320 align:start position:0%
already
 
04:36:26.670 --> 04:36:26.680 align:start position:0%
requires permit applicants to make a
 
04:36:29.510 --> 04:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
case about this is the public benefit
 
04:36:31.230 --> 04:36:31.240 align:start position:0%
what we are saying is that they should
 
04:36:34.789 --> 04:36:34.799 align:start position:0%
have to also say here are the and the
 
04:36:36.750 --> 04:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
word here is potential it's always
 
04:36:39.349 --> 04:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
potential public benefit they should
 
04:36:42.510 --> 04:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
also have to speak to potential public
 
04:36:43.869 --> 04:36:43.879 align:start position:0%
harms that doesn't mean they have to
 
04:36:45.189 --> 04:36:45.199 align:start position:0%
have a crystal ball the word is
 
04:36:47.189 --> 04:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
potential uh and so when you're trying
 
04:36:49.109 --> 04:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
to to put one of these facilities in the
 
04:36:52.109 --> 04:36:52.119 align:start position:0%
community you should have to present
 
04:36:55.510 --> 04:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
potential benefits and potential harms
 
04:36:58.189 --> 04:36:58.199 align:start position:0%
to help Dees make their
 
04:37:01.189 --> 04:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
decisions any other
 
04:37:03.990 --> 04:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
questions just represent
 
04:37:06.789 --> 04:37:06.799 align:start position:0%
Penza just had a question because I was
 
04:37:09.830 --> 04:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
at said meeting that you were at
 
04:37:14.789 --> 04:37:14.799 align:start position:0%
and um I brought up the specific um
 
04:37:18.189 --> 04:37:18.199 align:start position:0%
permit that was in a sense going to be
 
04:37:20.789 --> 04:37:20.799 align:start position:0%
rubber stamped from s go
 
04:37:25.269 --> 04:37:25.279 align:start position:0%
Bay and that answer was accurate of we
 
04:37:28.709 --> 04:37:28.719 align:start position:0%
don't look at correct I mean I just want
 
04:37:30.670 --> 04:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that is specific that
 
04:37:31.990 --> 04:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about because I heard
 
04:37:33.990 --> 04:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
the same exact thing that is what I
 
04:37:34.000 --> 04:37:35.910 align:start position:0%
the same exact thing that is what I
heard

04:37:35.910 --> 04:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
heard
 
04:37:38.830 --> 04:37:38.840 align:start position:0%
any other questions thank you for your
 
04:37:41.670 --> 04:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
introducing the bill and I would Now
 
04:37:54.230 --> 04:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:03.910 --> 04:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:03.920 --> 04:38:05.429 align:start position:0%
 
here

04:38:05.429 --> 04:38:05.439 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:38:08.510 --> 04:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Madame chairman good afternoon
 
04:38:11.750 --> 04:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
for the record my name's Gary Abbott I'm
 
04:38:13.590 --> 04:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
the Executive Vice President of the
 
04:38:16.230 --> 04:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
associated general contractors of New
 
04:38:19.230 --> 04:38:19.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm here today uh I came
 
04:38:22.949 --> 04:38:22.959 align:start position:0%
initially opposed to Hill 1170 because
 
04:38:25.869 --> 04:38:25.879 align:start position:0%
of its far-reaching it basically said
 
04:38:27.910 --> 04:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
any permit that goes through Dees would
 
04:38:30.551 --> 04:38:30.561 align:start position:0%
need this extensive study and I was
 
04:38:33.670 --> 04:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
looking at we get all kinds of permits
 
04:38:37.029 --> 04:38:37.039 align:start position:0%
air wet lands all kinds of permits
 
04:38:38.470 --> 04:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
through the department of environmental
 
04:38:40.709 --> 04:38:40.719 align:start position:0%
service this would delay so many
 
04:38:44.990 --> 04:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
projects that would uh be affected since
 
04:38:47.910 --> 04:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
the amendments were proposed I thought
 
04:38:50.189 --> 04:38:50.199 align:start position:0%
yay I'm good I don't really have to
 
04:38:53.470 --> 04:38:53.480 align:start position:0%
worry about it landfills is not
 
04:38:55.349 --> 04:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily uh something that I would
 
04:38:57.310 --> 04:38:57.320 align:start position:0%
have to worry about but I want to bring
 
04:38:59.109 --> 04:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
to your attention because this moner
 
04:39:01.551 --> 04:39:01.561 align:start position:0%
said maybe everything should be covered
 
04:39:04.429 --> 04:39:04.439 align:start position:0%
and so I just want to bring up even if
 
04:39:06.750 --> 04:39:06.760 align:start position:0%
we were to do this assessment and I'm
 
04:39:08.869 --> 04:39:08.879 align:start position:0%
looking at the original bill I have not
 
04:39:11.230 --> 04:39:11.240 align:start position:0%
seen the amendment so I can't talk on
 
04:39:13.789 --> 04:39:13.799 align:start position:0%
landfills but I look at such broad
 
04:39:17.349 --> 04:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
language as human value safety uh
 
04:39:19.830 --> 04:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
concerns you know about proper planning
 
04:39:21.949 --> 04:39:21.959 align:start position:0%
and it's so vague that I don't even know
 
04:39:24.590 --> 04:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
what a report would look like and I can
 
04:39:28.150 --> 04:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
tell you this um Dees whenever we go for
 
04:39:30.750 --> 04:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
a permit you cannot pollute the
 
04:39:33.269 --> 04:39:33.279 align:start position:0%
environment or you cannot you have to
 
04:39:35.070 --> 04:39:35.080 align:start position:0%
meet their conditions they're very very
 
04:39:37.270 --> 04:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
strict they are for protecting the
 
04:39:39.190 --> 04:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
environment and not only do we have to
 
04:39:41.190 --> 04:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
go through Dees sometimes fishing game
 
04:39:43.868 --> 04:39:43.878 align:start position:0%
for alteration of terrain permits it's
 
04:39:47.030 --> 04:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
not an easy process from an applicant's
 
04:39:49.868 --> 04:39:49.878 align:start position:0%
aspect to get approval especially if
 
04:39:52.750 --> 04:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
you're not uh making sure you protect
 
04:39:54.990 --> 04:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
the environment so I want to put that
 
04:39:57.150 --> 04:39:57.160 align:start position:0%
the whole question of need this has come
 
04:39:59.910 --> 04:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
up before but who decides what is need
 
04:40:01.510 --> 04:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
if I want to build a new building on
 
04:40:03.628 --> 04:40:03.638 align:start position:0%
conquered down Main Street who decides
 
04:40:06.310 --> 04:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
that it's needed and what public benefit
 
04:40:08.030 --> 04:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
so those are the reasons I came against
 
04:40:10.070 --> 04:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
the initial bill but I think it's
 
04:40:12.910 --> 04:40:12.920 align:start position:0%
helpful in your discussion on landfill
 
04:40:14.470 --> 04:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
because there there's definitely
 
04:40:17.190 --> 04:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
landfills have a different priority it
 
04:40:20.430 --> 04:40:20.440 align:start position:0%
is for the benefit of the state you know
 
04:40:22.750 --> 04:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
landfills are going to help all the
 
04:40:24.830 --> 04:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
communities it's not something many
 
04:40:27.310 --> 04:40:27.320 align:start position:0%
people go after as far as permits but
 
04:40:28.990 --> 04:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
those that do have got to meet all the
 
04:40:30.708 --> 04:40:30.718 align:start position:0%
conditions and go through a very lengthy
 
04:40:33.190 --> 04:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
process so I don't even know how an
 
04:40:35.430 --> 04:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
assessment impact would work work and I
 
04:40:37.788 --> 04:40:37.798 align:start position:0%
think you've had some uh committee
 
04:40:39.750 --> 04:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
members ask that question
 
04:40:41.910 --> 04:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
because you could just be getting a
 
04:40:46.110 --> 04:40:46.120 align:start position:0%
report which costs money that still part
 
04:40:48.230 --> 04:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
of this makes me think you need to look
 
04:40:52.270 --> 04:40:52.280 align:start position:0%
at the de's rules for uh landfills and
 
04:40:54.550 --> 04:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
how they assess because I do think they
 
04:40:56.910 --> 04:40:56.920 align:start position:0%
look at Road impacts and a whole bunch
 
04:40:58.948 --> 04:40:58.958 align:start position:0%
of other things already when somebody
 
04:41:00.788 --> 04:41:00.798 align:start position:0%
goes through the process I'm going on
 
04:41:03.708 --> 04:41:03.718 align:start position:0%
and on the bulk of me 95% is good that
 
04:41:06.868 --> 04:41:06.878 align:start position:0%
if you're removing the original Bill 5%
 
04:41:09.070 --> 04:41:09.080 align:start position:0%
is just a warning that this needs a lot
 
04:41:11.550 --> 04:41:11.560 align:start position:0%
of clarification in order to understand
 
04:41:14.990 --> 04:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
what the impact would really do does it
 
04:41:18.110 --> 04:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
give who decides whether need is a big
 
04:41:21.110 --> 04:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
need is a is one that's very subjective
 
04:41:22.868 --> 04:41:22.878 align:start position:0%
what I think is a need might be
 
04:41:24.990 --> 04:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
different than somebody else has a need
 
04:41:27.510 --> 04:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
so I I really caution you to look at
 
04:41:30.470 --> 04:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
that term it's probably a lawyer great
 
04:41:34.310 --> 04:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
word that they'd love in court and so uh
 
04:41:35.788 --> 04:41:35.798 align:start position:0%
who would would make that
 
04:41:37.670 --> 04:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
determination with that I would end my
 
04:41:40.270 --> 04:41:40.280 align:start position:0%
testimony and since the amendment most
 
04:41:42.070 --> 04:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
of my opposition would go away with the
 
04:41:44.070 --> 04:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
killing of the original
 
04:41:46.990 --> 04:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you any questions from the
 
04:41:49.628 --> 04:41:49.638 align:start position:0%
committee thank you seeing none thank
 
04:42:03.550 --> 04:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:03.560 --> 04:42:06.550 align:start position:0%
 
deers

04:42:06.550 --> 04:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
deers
 
04:42:09.150 --> 04:42:09.160 align:start position:0%
so I was very um for the record my name
 
04:42:11.868 --> 04:42:11.878 align:start position:0%
is Ted deers I'm the uh assistant uh
 
04:42:13.788 --> 04:42:13.798 align:start position:0%
director of The Water Division at Dees
 
04:42:15.550 --> 04:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
and it was very fortuitous that I happen
 
04:42:17.510 --> 04:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
to be sitting next
 
04:42:20.470 --> 04:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
to Sarah uas Kern assistant director of
 
04:42:23.470 --> 04:42:23.480 align:start position:0%
the waste management division at Dees so
 
04:42:25.990 --> 04:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the opportunity
 
04:42:28.990 --> 04:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
uh obviously similar to what Mr Abbott
 
04:42:31.550 --> 04:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
just suggested uh there's 15 people
 
04:42:34.390 --> 04:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
who've seen this uh these amendments um
 
04:42:37.310 --> 04:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
and neither of us are one of them so uh
 
04:42:40.310 --> 04:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
we are ill prepared to comment upon them
 
04:42:42.270 --> 04:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
you had our comments from the original
 
04:42:44.430 --> 04:42:44.440 align:start position:0%
bill it sounds like uh you're moving off
 
04:42:47.470 --> 04:42:47.480 align:start position:0%
of that in some manner um but it sounds
 
04:42:49.110 --> 04:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
like it's turning over to sort of
 
04:42:50.868 --> 04:42:50.878 align:start position:0%
landfills so I will turn it over to my
 
04:42:53.150 --> 04:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
colleague from the waste division thank
 
04:42:55.550 --> 04:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
you uh we were unaware of these
 
04:42:57.670 --> 04:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
amendments to this bill but I look
 
04:43:00.030 --> 04:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
forward to obtaining copies to take to
 
04:43:01.750 --> 04:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
director whimet so that he can become
 
04:43:04.190 --> 04:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
familiar with them and then we would be
 
04:43:06.670 --> 04:43:06.680 align:start position:0%
happy to provide comments on it okay are
 
04:43:08.550 --> 04:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
there any extra copies at the end of the
 
04:43:08.560 --> 04:43:20.310 align:start position:0%
there any extra copies at the end of the
table

04:43:20.310 --> 04:43:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:29.868 --> 04:43:29.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:33.070 --> 04:43:33.080 align:start position:0%
you okay just receive copies thank you
 
04:43:35.230 --> 04:43:35.240 align:start position:0%
sure yeah yeah and I I don't expect you
 
04:43:38.990 --> 04:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
to comment on them um because you
 
04:43:42.670 --> 04:43:42.680 align:start position:0%
haven't seen it till two seconds ago um
 
04:43:45.390 --> 04:43:45.400 align:start position:0%
but with regard to any of the other
 
04:43:47.470 --> 04:43:47.480 align:start position:0%
testimony that you've heard or questions
 
04:43:50.310 --> 04:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
that you've heard asked um do you have
 
04:43:54.270 --> 04:43:54.280 align:start position:0%
any any comment on that I don't have any
 
04:43:56.590 --> 04:43:56.600 align:start position:0%
comment today I believe there's a work
 
04:43:59.470 --> 04:43:59.480 align:start position:0%
session on this bill tomorrow and we are
 
04:44:01.830 --> 04:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
not going to be ready to comment on this
 
04:44:03.070 --> 04:44:03.080 align:start position:0%
or participate in a work session
 
04:44:04.948 --> 04:44:04.958 align:start position:0%
tomorrow but we would be happy to
 
04:44:06.230 --> 04:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
we can have a little more time with the
 
04:44:09.350 --> 04:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
language certainly thank you any
 
04:44:12.390 --> 04:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
questions representative Marie um yes
 
04:44:14.628 --> 04:44:14.638 align:start position:0%
thank you I I guess I'm going to ask you
 
04:44:17.030 --> 04:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
the same question that I asked the prime
 
04:44:18.788 --> 04:44:18.798 align:start position:0%
sponsor and the co-sponsor and maybe
 
04:44:21.470 --> 04:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
it's just for you um just regarding
 
04:44:23.350 --> 04:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
other instances and where uh host
 
04:44:26.628 --> 04:44:26.638 align:start position:0%
committees are notified public um in
 
04:44:29.750 --> 04:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
your testimony you do mention that it um
 
04:44:32.510 --> 04:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
the bill the underlying bill um prior to
 
04:44:34.350 --> 04:44:34.360 align:start position:0%
its Amendment would require the
 
04:44:36.390 --> 04:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
Department to engage with each community
 
04:44:38.310 --> 04:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
in the state to identify benefits and
 
04:44:40.470 --> 04:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
potential impacts further goes on to
 
04:44:42.310 --> 04:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
state that it would create a new
 
04:44:44.190 --> 04:44:44.200 align:start position:0%
requirement for public input both in
 
04:44:44.200 --> 04:44:45.830 align:start position:0%
requirement for public input both in
community

04:44:45.830 --> 04:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
community
 
04:44:48.150 --> 04:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
um the community in which the permit or
 
04:44:49.350 --> 04:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
project is located as well as
 
04:44:51.750 --> 04:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
neighboring communities So to that end I
 
04:44:53.628 --> 04:44:53.638 align:start position:0%
guess I am looking for some clarity as
 
04:44:55.670 --> 04:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
to whether or not that process already
 
04:44:59.070 --> 04:44:59.080 align:start position:0%
exists somewhere um aside from like a
 
04:45:00.948 --> 04:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
rul making hearing or some other type of
 
04:45:02.430 --> 04:45:02.440 align:start position:0%
circumstance so if you could speak to
 
04:45:04.470 --> 04:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
that sure I'm going to see if Ted has
 
04:45:07.910 --> 04:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
some comments on that sure
 
04:45:10.230 --> 04:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
so again this is back to the original
 
04:45:12.430 --> 04:45:12.440 align:start position:0%
bill which would have covered um from
 
04:45:13.990 --> 04:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
our perspective life the universe and
 
04:45:18.750 --> 04:45:18.760 align:start position:0%
everything so that um in that case we
 
04:45:20.470 --> 04:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
have lots and lots and lots of different
 
04:45:22.670 --> 04:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
permits we have something like I can't
 
04:45:26.788 --> 04:45:26.798 align:start position:0%
remember what the number is 88 um 133
 
04:45:30.230 --> 04:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
chapters uh of law within the department
 
04:45:32.510 --> 04:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
and uh you know hundreds of different
 
04:45:34.708 --> 04:45:34.718 align:start position:0%
kinds of permits that cover lots and
 
04:45:36.990 --> 04:45:37.000 align:start position:0%
lots of things that have time frames
 
04:45:41.310 --> 04:45:41.320 align:start position:0%
that extend from years to weeks so
 
04:45:45.030 --> 04:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
there's a whole spectrum of opportunity
 
04:45:47.550 --> 04:45:47.560 align:start position:0%
for both public comment and integration
 
04:45:49.910 --> 04:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
within Community interests as well as
 
04:45:51.990 --> 04:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
interactions with other state laws and
 
04:45:54.628 --> 04:45:54.638 align:start position:0%
St State jurisdictions as well as
 
04:45:57.230 --> 04:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
federal laws and federal jurisdictions
 
04:45:58.990 --> 04:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
this is pretty complex when you start
 
04:46:00.868 --> 04:46:00.878 align:start position:0%
getting into that magnitude now if
 
04:46:03.670 --> 04:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
you're shrooming it down to one thing
 
04:46:06.470 --> 04:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
then you have an opportunity to be able
 
04:46:08.110 --> 04:46:08.120 align:start position:0%
to Think Through what does that mean
 
04:46:10.590 --> 04:46:10.600 align:start position:0%
relative to the existing statutes
 
04:46:10.600 --> 04:46:11.708 align:start position:0%
relative to the existing statutes
Federal

04:46:11.708 --> 04:46:11.718 align:start position:0%
Federal
 
04:46:14.070 --> 04:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
overlays all what the communities
 
04:46:16.230 --> 04:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
already do how that interacts with local
 
04:46:17.990 --> 04:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
zoning how that interacts with other
 
04:46:19.910 --> 04:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
kinds of aspects those are all things
 
04:46:22.510 --> 04:46:22.520 align:start position:0%
that you can consider program by program
 
04:46:25.670 --> 04:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
but RIT large it's a pretty big universe
 
04:46:27.430 --> 04:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
um of things that you're talking about
 
04:46:30.070 --> 04:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
and a broad spectrum of how those kinds
 
04:46:32.430 --> 04:46:32.440 align:start position:0%
of interactions happen does that get at
 
04:46:36.750 --> 04:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:38.750 --> 04:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
follow follow up yeah thank you if I may
 
04:46:41.110 --> 04:46:41.120 align:start position:0%
so if what I'm hearing is um that the
 
04:46:43.150 --> 04:46:43.160 align:start position:0%
scope were narrowed perhaps that it
 
04:46:47.070 --> 04:46:47.080 align:start position:0%
would be of more use to allow a
 
04:46:50.270 --> 04:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
framework in which it is clearly defined
 
04:46:53.548 --> 04:46:53.558 align:start position:0%
for public comment um to neighboring or
 
04:46:55.830 --> 04:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
host communities is that what you're
 
04:46:58.750 --> 04:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
saying versus a broad I guess I would
 
04:47:00.948 --> 04:47:00.958 align:start position:0%
just say that it would totally depend on
 
04:47:03.230 --> 04:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
which statute and which permit you're
 
04:47:05.070 --> 04:47:05.080 align:start position:0%
talking about and how you would like to
 
04:47:08.948 --> 04:47:08.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:10.948 --> 04:47:10.958 align:start position:0%
conversation any other questions from
 
04:47:14.270 --> 04:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
the committee seeing none thank you very
 
04:47:17.830 --> 04:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
much for stepping up and speaking with
 
04:47:22.030 --> 04:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
us are there any other pink uh folks in
 
04:47:24.270 --> 04:47:24.280 align:start position:0%
the audience who'd like to um make
 
04:47:29.230 --> 04:47:29.240 align:start position:0%
comment on this bill seeing none I'd
 
04:47:31.030 --> 04:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
like the blue
 
04:47:35.708 --> 04:47:35.718 align:start position:0%

environment agriculture yes thank you
 
04:49:00.350 --> 04:49:00.360 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you members of the
 
04:49:02.948 --> 04:49:02.958 align:start position:0%
committee I uh appreciate the time that
 
04:49:05.708 --> 04:49:05.718 align:start position:0%
you gave me I do want to say my new
 
04:49:07.910 --> 04:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
colleague representative sha Durkin
 
04:49:09.510 --> 04:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
wishes he was here but he couldn't make
 
04:49:12.708 --> 04:49:12.718 align:start position:0%
it so he sends his best regards um
 
04:49:16.110 --> 04:49:16.120 align:start position:0%
before you today is HB
 
04:49:18.390 --> 04:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
1620 and it's a pretty straightforward
 
04:49:21.350 --> 04:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
bill I hope that's probably uh worst
 
04:49:23.868 --> 04:49:23.878 align:start position:0%
thing I could probably say but um
 
04:49:26.628 --> 04:49:26.638 align:start position:0%
ultimately the the the the packet I just
 
04:49:28.948 --> 04:49:28.958 align:start position:0%
handed you um I'm going to actually be
 
04:49:31.110 --> 04:49:31.120 align:start position:0%
using this today and tomorrow I'll be
 
04:49:34.310 --> 04:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
back again tomorrow for another bill and
 
04:49:40.510 --> 04:49:40.520 align:start position:0%
um this is the first few pages of the
 
04:49:42.628 --> 04:49:42.638 align:start position:0%
committee report the final committee
 
04:49:44.190 --> 04:49:44.200 align:start position:0%
report for the committee to study
 
04:49:46.190 --> 04:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
unlimited service area permits for
 
04:49:48.868 --> 04:49:48.878 align:start position:0%
landfills and out of state waste coming
 
04:49:50.590 --> 04:49:50.600 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire so I've got this bill
 
04:49:51.628 --> 04:49:51.638 align:start position:0%
today I've got another bill coming
 
04:49:53.990 --> 04:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
tomorrow so I will be referring to this
 
04:49:58.590 --> 04:49:58.600 align:start position:0%
uh um on both days for as you probably
 
04:50:01.350 --> 04:50:01.360 align:start position:0%
recall that was a bill that uh uh or a
 
04:50:04.708 --> 04:50:04.718 align:start position:0%
study committee that met um over the
 
04:50:07.150 --> 04:50:07.160 align:start position:0%
summer I know Madam chair came to at
 
04:50:09.948 --> 04:50:09.958 align:start position:0%
least one of our meetings and we ended
 
04:50:12.670 --> 04:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
up with a number of findings and uh
 
04:50:13.948 --> 04:50:13.958 align:start position:0%
that's on
 
04:50:18.030 --> 04:50:18.040 align:start position:0%
page on the third page in the
 
04:50:20.510 --> 04:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
recommendations and this bill today
 
04:50:22.270 --> 04:50:22.280 align:start position:0%
actually speaks to one of those
 
04:50:24.548 --> 04:50:24.558 align:start position:0%
recommendations and that is the
 
04:50:26.990 --> 04:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
consideration of a moratorium against
 
04:50:31.070 --> 04:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
the construction of new landfills and uh
 
04:50:33.830 --> 04:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
we felt in the committee that uh the con
 
04:50:36.070 --> 04:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
concept should at least be discussed and
 
04:50:39.390 --> 04:50:39.400 align:start position:0%
presented to to you folks to um to
 
04:50:43.310 --> 04:50:43.320 align:start position:0%
consider and I want to actually talk
 
04:50:45.708 --> 04:50:45.718 align:start position:0%
about the word moratorium sometimes
 
04:50:47.548 --> 04:50:47.558 align:start position:0%
people get worried about that concerned
 
04:50:49.510 --> 04:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
about it uh I don't think there's any
 
04:50:52.150 --> 04:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
intention here amongst myself and
 
04:50:56.030 --> 04:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
amongst others um to eliminate landfills
 
04:50:57.990 --> 04:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
entirely I think that uh uh
 
04:50:59.990 --> 04:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative the previous hearing said
 
04:51:02.030 --> 04:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's a necessary evil that
 
04:51:04.990 --> 04:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
we have to deal with um the fortunate
 
04:51:06.788 --> 04:51:06.798 align:start position:0%
thing that we have in New Hampshire is
 
04:51:08.910 --> 04:51:08.920 align:start position:0%
we have plenty of capacity of landfills
 
04:51:12.470 --> 04:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
in fact looking at uh the B annual Solid
 
04:51:16.510 --> 04:51:16.520 align:start position:0%
Waste report from Dees we have capacity
 
04:51:23.990 --> 04:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
until 20 33 34 is um even in 20 2030 we
 
04:51:26.948 --> 04:51:26.958 align:start position:0%
have an excess of 363,000 tons so we
 
04:51:28.430 --> 04:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
don't have a gun to our head we have we
 
04:51:31.110 --> 04:51:31.120 align:start position:0%
have the luxury of time to talk about
 
04:51:33.230 --> 04:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
this and and and consider this and
 
04:51:33.990 --> 04:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things things the
 
04:51:35.470 --> 04:51:35.480 align:start position:0%
findings of the committee said there are
 
04:51:38.910 --> 04:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of moving Parts with this um and
 
04:51:42.350 --> 04:51:42.360 align:start position:0%
so how do we deal with solid waste and
 
04:51:45.470 --> 04:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
landfills and capacity and one of the
 
04:51:47.788 --> 04:51:47.798 align:start position:0%
things that we considered was in the in
 
04:51:51.110 --> 04:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
the committee is recycling Advanced
 
04:51:55.270 --> 04:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
recycling incineration um uh having
 
04:51:58.110 --> 04:51:58.120 align:start position:0%
having more utilization of recycled
 
04:52:00.110 --> 04:52:00.120 align:start position:0%
products and really what this bill does
 
04:52:01.990 --> 04:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
is it buys us
 
04:52:06.110 --> 04:52:06.120 align:start position:0%
Time by stopping the issuance of uh
 
04:52:08.310 --> 04:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
landfill permits to consider those
 
04:52:10.510 --> 04:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
things to consider those other options
 
04:52:13.548 --> 04:52:13.558 align:start position:0%
as we move forward um I mean there were
 
04:52:15.310 --> 04:52:15.320 align:start position:0%
topics that we discussed I know the
 
04:52:17.110 --> 04:52:17.120 align:start position:0%
chair was there that really you know I
 
04:52:19.868 --> 04:52:19.878 align:start position:0%
think that you know bipartisan B bamal
 
04:52:21.990 --> 04:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh committee really said you know we
 
04:52:23.430 --> 04:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
really should be spend spending some
 
04:52:25.830 --> 04:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
time on this and U there may be some
 
04:52:28.310 --> 04:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
legitimate real answers to this problem
 
04:52:30.830 --> 04:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
that's been uh that's been going on for
 
04:52:34.910 --> 04:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
quite some time so um
 
04:52:37.830 --> 04:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
the point being is this this pauses the
 
04:52:41.190 --> 04:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
issuance of of new uh landfill permits
 
04:52:44.190 --> 04:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't stop the department from
 
04:52:46.830 --> 04:52:46.840 align:start position:0%
accepting and investigating applications
 
04:52:48.070 --> 04:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
so that's the other thing too if you
 
04:52:50.708 --> 04:52:50.718 align:start position:0%
look at line five of the bill the
 
04:52:52.750 --> 04:52:52.760 align:start position:0%
department shall continue to accept and
 
04:52:55.150 --> 04:52:55.160 align:start position:0%
investigate applications so it gives the
 
04:52:58.670 --> 04:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity for things to come in um the
 
04:53:01.948 --> 04:53:01.958 align:start position:0%
the uh the department to to investigate
 
04:53:05.708 --> 04:53:05.718 align:start position:0%
these and um and and really ruminate on
 
04:53:08.948 --> 04:53:08.958 align:start position:0%
on on them and study them um and then
 
04:53:12.390 --> 04:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
they and it holds off the issuance to
 
04:53:15.670 --> 04:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
2031 and the other opt as you as you
 
04:53:18.230 --> 04:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
this committee knows we are having new
 
04:53:20.830 --> 04:53:20.840 align:start position:0%
rules in development uh that should be
 
04:53:24.150 --> 04:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
out in July maybe I think I've heard um
 
04:53:25.708 --> 04:53:25.718 align:start position:0%
I've seen a draft of those I'm sure I
 
04:53:27.510 --> 04:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
know you have been briefed on that as
 
04:53:30.628 --> 04:53:30.638 align:start position:0%
well so this also not only does it give
 
04:53:32.990 --> 04:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
pause while those new rules are be being
 
04:53:35.708 --> 04:53:35.718 align:start position:0%
considered but if the same staff that
 
04:53:38.270 --> 04:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
are developing the rules are also
 
04:53:41.230 --> 04:53:41.240 align:start position:0%
reviewing the permits it gives uh gives
 
04:53:45.948 --> 04:53:45.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:50.548 --> 04:53:50.558 align:start position:0%
um the other topic that we discussed is
 
04:53:53.390 --> 04:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
um which I'll be talking about tomorrow
 
04:53:56.030 --> 04:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
I'm going to save that for tomorrow and
 
04:53:58.430 --> 04:53:58.440 align:start position:0%
again really is you know a pause on the
 
04:54:00.708 --> 04:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
issuance of of permits we find that this
 
04:54:02.590 --> 04:54:02.600 align:start position:0%
is probably the most El personally I
 
04:54:04.350 --> 04:54:04.360 align:start position:0%
think this is the most El solution to
 
04:54:07.750 --> 04:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
this issue with so many moving parts and
 
04:54:09.390 --> 04:54:09.400 align:start position:0%
um and it just gives us time because we
 
04:54:10.868 --> 04:54:10.878 align:start position:0%
do have the capacity we have plenty of
 
04:54:12.230 --> 04:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
capacity here in the state of New
 
04:54:14.270 --> 04:54:14.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire one of the things that I
 
04:54:16.510 --> 04:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to talk about really quickly and
 
04:54:18.830 --> 04:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
I was going to have a an economist here
 
04:54:21.628 --> 04:54:21.638 align:start position:0%
but he's hung up in oh he's he's here I
 
04:54:25.350 --> 04:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
will wait on that then um is the fiscal
 
04:54:27.510 --> 04:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
note so he he he arrived right on right
 
04:54:30.628 --> 04:54:30.638 align:start position:0%
on right on Q um and with that I'm going
 
04:54:33.270 --> 04:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
to hand it over to the committee and uh
 
04:54:35.270 --> 04:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
I'm available for
 
04:54:39.270 --> 04:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
questions represent viby okay so I think
 
04:54:40.948 --> 04:54:40.958 align:start position:0%
that you're aware that there is
 
04:54:43.470 --> 04:54:43.480 align:start position:0%
currently another permit that has been
 
04:54:48.030 --> 04:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
submitted for uh the landfill uh attempt
 
04:54:51.470 --> 04:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
in Dalton and I was wondering uh how
 
04:54:54.430 --> 04:54:54.440 align:start position:0%
this bill would affect that and whether
 
04:54:58.150 --> 04:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
the fact that the uh bill is going to be
 
04:55:02.868 --> 04:55:02.878 align:start position:0%
processed after the uh that permit has
 
04:55:04.390 --> 04:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
was submitted
 
04:55:06.510 --> 04:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
uh has an impact on how this bill would
 
04:55:09.030 --> 04:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
work yeah so that's a good question it's
 
04:55:10.868 --> 04:55:10.878 align:start position:0%
a relevant question and this bill was
 
04:55:12.230 --> 04:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
actually submitted prior to that
 
04:55:17.990 --> 04:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
application being being uh sent in so um
 
04:55:20.350 --> 04:55:20.360 align:start position:0%
I don't know if this was you know we
 
04:55:22.628 --> 04:55:22.638 align:start position:0%
knew that this was coming this
 
04:55:24.628 --> 04:55:24.638 align:start position:0%
application up north I don't know if
 
04:55:27.510 --> 04:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
this was the bill that expedited that
 
04:55:29.628 --> 04:55:29.638 align:start position:0%
submission or not I've been told that it
 
04:55:33.830 --> 04:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
probably was but um uh that is is that
 
04:55:35.150 --> 04:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
is a good question and something that
 
04:55:40.230 --> 04:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:42.788 --> 04:55:42.798 align:start position:0%
forward representative H Haskins thank
 
04:55:44.030 --> 04:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you
 
04:55:46.310 --> 04:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
04:55:52.070 --> 04:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
I'm interested in um lines five and six
 
04:55:54.788 --> 04:55:54.798 align:start position:0%
the department shall continue to accept
 
04:55:58.230 --> 04:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
and investigate applications what what
 
04:56:00.470 --> 04:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
did you have in mind with that so the
 
04:56:05.070 --> 04:56:05.080 align:start position:0%
the point is is they will again
 
04:56:06.910 --> 04:56:06.920 align:start position:0%
building off the last question we had
 
04:56:10.190 --> 04:56:10.200 align:start position:0%
anticipated a a an application being
 
04:56:12.430 --> 04:56:12.440 align:start position:0%
filed uh I did not anticipate it being
 
04:56:15.470 --> 04:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
filed when it was so but the the intent
 
04:56:17.830 --> 04:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
was is that people can you know
 
04:56:19.948 --> 04:56:19.958 align:start position:0%
applicants can submit an application
 
04:56:21.590 --> 04:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
they can send in an application for a
 
04:56:24.510 --> 04:56:24.520 align:start position:0%
landfill um the dees can work on the
 
04:56:26.708 --> 04:56:26.718 align:start position:0%
application but it won't issue the final
 
04:56:28.030 --> 04:56:28.040 align:start position:0%
permit until
 
04:56:32.948 --> 04:56:32.958 align:start position:0%
2031 followup M CH followup thank you um
 
04:56:35.150 --> 04:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
one of one of my concerns all along has
 
04:56:37.430 --> 04:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
been that the rul making process is
 
04:56:41.390 --> 04:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
going on at the same time that the
 
04:56:44.910 --> 04:56:44.920 align:start position:0%
permit is being reviewed and it seems to
 
04:56:47.990 --> 04:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
me that Dees has indicated to us that
 
04:56:50.230 --> 04:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
they are somewhat under staffed and
 
04:56:53.948 --> 04:56:53.958 align:start position:0%
underfunded and I wonder whether it
 
04:56:56.948 --> 04:56:56.958 align:start position:0%
makes sense to you that an application
 
04:56:59.948 --> 04:56:59.958 align:start position:0%
be reviewed when the rul making is going
 
04:57:03.868 --> 04:57:03.878 align:start position:0%
on and and and again being that there's
 
04:57:06.788 --> 04:57:06.798 align:start position:0%
no pressure with this I mean it's 2031
 
04:57:09.070 --> 04:57:09.080 align:start position:0%
is where where we have the uh the time
 
04:57:11.590 --> 04:57:11.600 align:start position:0%
frame so there's no immediate need to to
 
04:57:14.910 --> 04:57:14.920 align:start position:0%
process I mean they can uh process or uh
 
04:57:16.868 --> 04:57:16.878 align:start position:0%
investigate an application but they
 
04:57:19.110 --> 04:57:19.120 align:start position:0%
don't have to this kind of this will put
 
04:57:20.510 --> 04:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
the pause on that so if they want to
 
04:57:24.190 --> 04:57:24.200 align:start position:0%
allocate staff to develop rules and put
 
04:57:26.390 --> 04:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
this aside while they do that they they
 
04:57:27.990 --> 04:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
can one of the other things that I think
 
04:57:29.948 --> 04:57:29.958 align:start position:0%
you you bring up a good point is that
 
04:57:31.150 --> 04:57:31.160 align:start position:0%
you know we have rules that are
 
04:57:33.868 --> 04:57:33.878 align:start position:0%
developing and we have we have
 
04:57:36.470 --> 04:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
we have conditions that are evolving
 
04:57:38.868 --> 04:57:38.878 align:start position:0%
right now in the state I mean we have a
 
04:57:43.150 --> 04:57:43.160 align:start position:0%
a a landfill right now that's leaking p
 
04:57:45.750 --> 04:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
and it's headed towards a river and you
 
04:57:48.430 --> 04:57:48.440 align:start position:0%
know I mean I know that there is Dees
 
04:57:50.830 --> 04:57:50.840 align:start position:0%
contends that it's not actively leaking
 
04:57:53.628 --> 04:57:53.638 align:start position:0%
it was from prior to the landfill when
 
04:57:56.948 --> 04:57:56.958 align:start position:0%
it was when it was uh unlined but we
 
04:57:59.430 --> 04:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
have other groups that you know would
 
04:58:01.230 --> 04:58:01.240 align:start position:0%
would disagree with that so I mean those
 
04:58:02.628 --> 04:58:02.638 align:start position:0%
are major issues I mean that's that's
 
04:58:04.628 --> 04:58:04.638 align:start position:0%
something that should be settled it
 
04:58:07.910 --> 04:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
should be figured out before we move
 
04:58:10.070 --> 04:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
forward with any new landfills I mean
 
04:58:11.470 --> 04:58:11.480 align:start position:0%
having gone through this now for a
 
04:58:14.030 --> 04:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
second year myself personally here but
 
04:58:16.788 --> 04:58:16.798 align:start position:0%
watching this issue since I was in eth
 
04:58:19.270 --> 04:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
grade I I grow grew up in the north
 
04:58:21.510 --> 04:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
country and when it was sandco we've all
 
04:58:23.590 --> 04:58:23.600 align:start position:0%
been watching this whole thing develop
 
04:58:25.708 --> 04:58:25.718 align:start position:0%
um you know we've always wondered what's
 
04:58:27.990 --> 04:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
going to happen when that's when it hits
 
04:58:30.590 --> 04:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
the water and just a year ago we were
 
04:58:33.190 --> 04:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
here and Dees was saying uh well these
 
04:58:35.948 --> 04:58:35.958 align:start position:0%
are double lined and triple lined and uh
 
04:58:37.190 --> 04:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
um you know we're not going to worry
 
04:58:41.150 --> 04:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
about it it's safe but my colleague once
 
04:58:43.430 --> 04:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
said you know if the Titanic was wrapped
 
04:58:45.310 --> 04:58:45.320 align:start position:0%
in bubble wrap would you still go on it
 
04:58:47.430 --> 04:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
I mean that's so the question the point
 
04:58:49.548 --> 04:58:49.558 align:start position:0%
being is there are some real questions
 
04:58:51.750 --> 04:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
that have to be answered and you know
 
04:58:53.430 --> 04:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
anyone I know there are folks that are
 
04:58:55.708 --> 04:58:55.718 align:start position:0%
followed the past stuff going down in
 
04:58:59.150 --> 04:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
marac U we have the Air Force Base U we
 
04:59:01.070 --> 04:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
just in my Committee in ways and means
 
04:59:03.110 --> 04:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
we talked about a leak that you know it
 
04:59:06.310 --> 04:59:06.320 align:start position:0%
was cleaned up years ago but the the on
 
04:59:08.910 --> 04:59:08.920 align:start position:0%
the land but now it's leaking into Squam
 
04:59:13.830 --> 04:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
Lake um so the point being is that uh I
 
04:59:15.270 --> 04:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
mean the yeah the rules are being
 
04:59:18.990 --> 04:59:19.000 align:start position:0%
developed but and and and Dees can work
 
04:59:22.270 --> 04:59:22.280 align:start position:0%
on the permits while this pause is
 
04:59:24.750 --> 04:59:24.760 align:start position:0%
taking place but the reality is I think
 
04:59:26.910 --> 04:59:26.920 align:start position:0%
we got to get the rules right we have to
 
04:59:29.470 --> 04:59:29.480 align:start position:0%
get the permitting right before we
 
04:59:32.110 --> 04:59:32.120 align:start position:0%
before we do anything because I mean I I
 
04:59:34.670 --> 04:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
I say this personally I I literally I my
 
04:59:36.670 --> 04:59:36.680 align:start position:0%
my earth science teacher in seven eth
 
04:59:38.830 --> 04:59:38.840 align:start position:0%
and nth grade was talking to us about
 
04:59:41.350 --> 04:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
the sanco landfill which is now in Beth
 
04:59:43.990 --> 04:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
NC he said once those go in you will
 
04:59:46.190 --> 04:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
never get them out and it's true once
 
04:59:49.750 --> 04:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
the stuff is in the ground good or bad
 
04:59:51.750 --> 04:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
we're stuck with it forever so we've got
 
04:59:54.150 --> 04:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
to get this right and uh this adds us
 
04:59:55.708 --> 04:59:55.718 align:start position:0%
time it pumps the brakes it gives us a
 
04:59:58.030 --> 04:59:58.040 align:start position:0%
little space gives us a little margin so
 
05:00:01.190 --> 05:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
we can do the best thing indeed thank
 
05:00:04.030 --> 05:00:04.040 align:start position:0%
you represent ger thank you madam chair
 
05:00:05.628 --> 05:00:05.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for representative for taking
 
05:00:07.230 --> 05:00:07.240 align:start position:0%
my question I'm going to ask you to
 
05:00:10.830 --> 05:00:10.840 align:start position:0%
address one of the critiques of the bill
 
05:00:12.910 --> 05:00:12.920 align:start position:0%
uh that commissioner Scott included in
 
05:00:14.470 --> 05:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
the letter that he sent to the committee
 
05:00:16.708 --> 05:00:16.718 align:start position:0%
and you were copied on that on that
 
05:00:20.110 --> 05:00:20.120 align:start position:0%
letter uh but to revisit for a moment
 
05:00:21.910 --> 05:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
the time we spent together in that study
 
05:00:23.708 --> 05:00:23.718 align:start position:0%
committee one of the things we talked
 
05:00:27.150 --> 05:00:27.160 align:start position:0%
about right was uh what it means to be
 
05:00:29.390 --> 05:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
vested when when we talk to Dees and to
 
05:00:31.510 --> 05:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office thinking
 
05:00:32.910 --> 05:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
about what we could do and what we could
 
05:00:34.590 --> 05:00:34.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do what it means for a company
 
05:00:37.390 --> 05:00:37.400 align:start position:0%
to be vested right um and the reason why
 
05:00:40.510 --> 05:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
I bring that up is because in the letter
 
05:00:43.230 --> 05:00:43.240 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner Scott uh on the one hand
 
05:00:44.910 --> 05:00:44.920 align:start position:0%
expressed his concern that this doesn't
 
05:00:48.030 --> 05:00:48.040 align:start position:0%
address potential capacity needs and the
 
05:00:50.590 --> 05:00:50.600 align:start position:0%
next paragraph he acknowledges but then
 
05:00:52.910 --> 05:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
criticizes the bill for actually
 
05:00:56.110 --> 05:00:56.120 align:start position:0%
addressing potential capacity needs by
 
05:01:00.390 --> 05:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
saying that would be unfair to Grant
 
05:01:03.430 --> 05:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
extensions of current landfill
 
05:01:05.910 --> 05:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
right rather than provide a new uh
 
05:01:07.628 --> 05:01:07.638 align:start position:0%
provide a permit for a new landfill
 
05:01:10.470 --> 05:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
potentially so could could you speak to
 
05:01:13.948 --> 05:01:13.958 align:start position:0%
that that criticism and specifically to
 
05:01:17.548 --> 05:01:17.558 align:start position:0%
how current landfills are already vested
 
05:01:20.110 --> 05:01:20.120 align:start position:0%
right so the that the granting of an
 
05:01:22.390 --> 05:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
expansion is not the same as the
 
05:01:24.670 --> 05:01:24.680 align:start position:0%
granting of a new landfill because
 
05:01:27.070 --> 05:01:27.080 align:start position:0%
existing landfills are already vested
 
05:01:29.868 --> 05:01:29.878 align:start position:0%
and potential landfills are not yes
 
05:01:32.150 --> 05:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um for the
 
05:01:34.110 --> 05:01:34.120 align:start position:0%
record I I have not read my email I've
 
05:01:35.628 --> 05:01:35.638 align:start position:0%
been in committee all morning so I have
 
05:01:37.270 --> 05:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
not read that I know that you said you
 
05:01:39.310 --> 05:01:39.320 align:start position:0%
you you you said I've got it so I'm sure
 
05:01:43.310 --> 05:01:43.320 align:start position:0%
it's sitting there uh um uh in my in my
 
05:01:45.230 --> 05:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
email box but I can talk about you know
 
05:01:47.510 --> 05:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
the difference between when when we
 
05:01:49.990 --> 05:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
created the bill uh we felt it was
 
05:01:51.230 --> 05:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
important that landfills that are
 
05:01:52.868 --> 05:01:52.878 align:start position:0%
already operating should be allowed to
 
05:01:55.590 --> 05:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
expand under under their current
 
05:01:58.670 --> 05:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
guidelines um this goes out to going
 
05:02:01.910 --> 05:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
into new landfills and I think the talk
 
05:02:03.990 --> 05:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
earlier today about Green Space versus
 
05:02:06.750 --> 05:02:06.760 align:start position:0%
brown space really comes into play here
 
05:02:08.390 --> 05:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh a landfill that's already been
 
05:02:09.910 --> 05:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
permitted it's already been accepting
 
05:02:12.990 --> 05:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
garbage it's there the garbage is there
 
05:02:15.788 --> 05:02:15.798 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's it's you know the the
 
05:02:17.910 --> 05:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
horse is out of the the barn there if
 
05:02:21.868 --> 05:02:21.878 align:start position:0%
you will um you know any you
 
05:02:24.788 --> 05:02:24.798 align:start position:0%
know we're assuming that monitoring is
 
05:02:28.070 --> 05:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
being done the wells are being monitored
 
05:02:30.708 --> 05:02:30.718 align:start position:0%
uh the structure is in place to to do
 
05:02:34.070 --> 05:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
that to the best of our ability as of
 
05:02:38.510 --> 05:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
today going into a new facility I mean
 
05:02:40.590 --> 05:02:40.600 align:start position:0%
the one that comes to mind is Dalton you
 
05:02:42.590 --> 05:02:42.600 align:start position:0%
know it's a it's a green space there's
 
05:02:44.990 --> 05:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
never been trash there um it's it's
 
05:02:46.990 --> 05:02:47.000 align:start position:0%
sitting next to a lake but as soon as
 
05:02:49.230 --> 05:02:49.240 align:start position:0%
you start putting stuff in there like I
 
05:02:51.190 --> 05:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
said it's there it's going to be there
 
05:02:53.948 --> 05:02:53.958 align:start position:0%
forever so I think the the the the point
 
05:02:56.708 --> 05:02:56.718 align:start position:0%
being is that you know we protect our
 
05:02:59.110 --> 05:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
pristine areas for now until we get it
 
05:03:01.548 --> 05:03:01.558 align:start position:0%
right but we allow those that are
 
05:03:03.670 --> 05:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
continuing to do business with breast
 
05:03:05.470 --> 05:03:05.480 align:start position:0%
practices I've been to these facilities
 
05:03:07.190 --> 05:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
and it's I you know if you haven't been
 
05:03:08.590 --> 05:03:08.600 align:start position:0%
to a landfill in New Hampshire I would
 
05:03:10.230 --> 05:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
encourage you to do so because you know
 
05:03:11.628 --> 05:03:11.638 align:start position:0%
the stuff that goes on there is really
 
05:03:14.190 --> 05:03:14.200 align:start position:0%
quite remarkable um you know but they're
 
05:03:16.788 --> 05:03:16.798 align:start position:0%
doing things to the best best practices
 
05:03:18.750 --> 05:03:18.760 align:start position:0%
who's to say best practices five years
 
05:03:21.150 --> 05:03:21.160 align:start position:0%
are going to be from now are going to be
 
05:03:21.160 --> 05:03:21.990 align:start position:0%
are going to be from now are going to be
best

05:03:21.990 --> 05:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
best
 
05:03:25.910 --> 05:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
practices today when I was in eth grade
 
05:03:27.990 --> 05:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
best practices were to throw it in a big
 
05:03:31.030 --> 05:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
pit and you know today we would line
 
05:03:33.430 --> 05:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
that pit we'd say because you know that
 
05:03:34.670 --> 05:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
pit may or may not be leaking it's
 
05:03:36.350 --> 05:03:36.360 align:start position:0%
leaking sometime it started leaking
 
05:03:38.390 --> 05:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
sometime whether or not it was back then
 
05:03:40.628 --> 05:03:40.638 align:start position:0%
or now I don't know but um you know
 
05:03:41.910 --> 05:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
there's differences of opinion that so I
 
05:03:43.350 --> 05:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
hope that addressed your
 
05:03:45.670 --> 05:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
question may
 
05:03:49.430 --> 05:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
followup yeah sure thank you reedly but
 
05:03:51.910 --> 05:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
thank you uh and could you also just
 
05:03:53.948 --> 05:03:53.958 align:start position:0%
very briefly uh sens of time and I know
 
05:03:55.390 --> 05:03:55.400 align:start position:0%
you also have to leave to get to your
 
05:03:57.350 --> 05:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
daughter's play today so don't want to
 
05:03:59.110 --> 05:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
take too much more time but um could you
 
05:04:00.910 --> 05:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
also speak to one of the other things
 
05:04:02.350 --> 05:04:02.360 align:start position:0%
that we discussed in the committee which
 
05:04:03.948 --> 05:04:03.958 align:start position:0%
is you're talking about what we might be
 
05:04:05.548 --> 05:04:05.558 align:start position:0%
doing five years from now we've had a
 
05:04:06.910 --> 05:04:06.920 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion in this committee
 
05:04:09.708 --> 05:04:09.718 align:start position:0%
about Advanced recycling for example so
 
05:04:13.150 --> 05:04:13.160 align:start position:0%
if isn't it the case that the capacity
 
05:04:16.030 --> 05:04:16.040 align:start position:0%
issues we will be addressing them by
 
05:04:19.310 --> 05:04:19.320 align:start position:0%
pursuing plans that we have regarding
 
05:04:22.030 --> 05:04:22.040 align:start position:0%
food waste diversion and advanced
 
05:04:24.390 --> 05:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
recycling that will also ease some of
 
05:04:27.390 --> 05:04:27.400 align:start position:0%
the capacity uh issues
 
05:04:30.788 --> 05:04:30.798 align:start position:0%
correct yeah that that that will and and
 
05:04:33.510 --> 05:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
I'm one of the things that was mentioned
 
05:04:34.948 --> 05:04:34.958 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal and I'm not going to speak
 
05:04:36.990 --> 05:04:37.000 align:start position:0%
to the fiscal note per se we've got
 
05:04:39.868 --> 05:04:39.878 align:start position:0%
someone here that uh is uh is much
 
05:04:42.548 --> 05:04:42.558 align:start position:0%
better at that than I am but one of the
 
05:04:44.310 --> 05:04:44.320 align:start position:0%
things they talked about is that it's
 
05:04:47.310 --> 05:04:47.320 align:start position:0%
going to increase Transportation costs
 
05:04:51.310 --> 05:04:51.320 align:start position:0%
well I I push back to transport costs to
 
05:04:52.948 --> 05:04:52.958 align:start position:0%
landfills and I'm going to push back on
 
05:04:54.190 --> 05:04:54.200 align:start position:0%
that a little bit because of exactly
 
05:04:57.110 --> 05:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
what you said but hitting pause on this
 
05:04:58.990 --> 05:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
and following the recommendations of the
 
05:05:00.670 --> 05:05:00.680 align:start position:0%
study committee which is pursuing
 
05:05:02.788 --> 05:05:02.798 align:start position:0%
Advanced Recycling and improving
 
05:05:05.270 --> 05:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
recycling methods and uh and things like
 
05:05:09.070 --> 05:05:09.080 align:start position:0%
that um you conceivably reduce the
 
05:05:10.708 --> 05:05:10.718 align:start position:0%
amount that you're hauling to landfills
 
05:05:12.470 --> 05:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
I mean that one one could think that
 
05:05:14.270 --> 05:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
that that would uh that would do that
 
05:05:16.030 --> 05:05:16.040 align:start position:0%
the other topic was incineration
 
05:05:18.150 --> 05:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
incineration Will eliminate a third of
 
05:05:20.470 --> 05:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
what's goes into the landfills um and
 
05:05:21.990 --> 05:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
again these are you know I know there
 
05:05:23.830 --> 05:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
those are hot but button issues as well
 
05:05:26.708 --> 05:05:26.718 align:start position:0%
but they're issues that need time to be
 
05:05:29.670 --> 05:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
vetted and uh and and that's exactly
 
05:05:32.750 --> 05:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
what this build does it gives time to to
 
05:05:35.628 --> 05:05:35.638 align:start position:0%
further explore Advanced Recycling and
 
05:05:37.628 --> 05:05:37.638 align:start position:0%
in and implement it consider
 
05:05:38.990 --> 05:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
implementing it in New Hampshire I think
 
05:05:41.548 --> 05:05:41.558 align:start position:0%
one of the things we found out in uh our
 
05:05:42.750 --> 05:05:42.760 align:start position:0%
committee over the summer is New
 
05:05:45.788 --> 05:05:45.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the only the only state in
 
05:05:47.628 --> 05:05:47.638 align:start position:0%
the Northeast that doesn't it's lagging
 
05:05:49.788 --> 05:05:49.798 align:start position:0%
it's the last state in the Northeast uh
 
05:05:52.350 --> 05:05:52.360 align:start position:0%
W with efforts on recycling we know that
 
05:05:55.750 --> 05:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
um um compost 30% of the stuff that we
 
05:05:57.670 --> 05:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
throw away is compostable that's filling
 
05:06:00.750 --> 05:06:00.760 align:start position:0%
up uh a space in our in our landfills so
 
05:06:03.868 --> 05:06:03.878 align:start position:0%
yeah this pumps the brakes says you know
 
05:06:06.190 --> 05:06:06.200 align:start position:0%
let's let's look at what we can do aside
 
05:06:07.910 --> 05:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
from this let's get our rules right
 
05:06:09.830 --> 05:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
let's uh we don't have a we don't have a
 
05:06:11.430 --> 05:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
gun to our head we don't have we don't
 
05:06:14.470 --> 05:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
have a capacity issue right now uh and
 
05:06:16.750 --> 05:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
this just buys us time to to make the
 
05:06:20.030 --> 05:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
Right Moves make do the right things
 
05:06:21.230 --> 05:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair
 
05:06:24.310 --> 05:06:24.320 align:start position:0%
representative rosart um so did your
 
05:06:29.030 --> 05:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
study committee come up with 2031 as a
 
05:06:32.190 --> 05:06:32.200 align:start position:0%
as a date or how did that date come up
 
05:06:34.310 --> 05:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
yeah so the um that's a good question
 
05:06:37.548 --> 05:06:37.558 align:start position:0%
and so the study committee stopped at a
 
05:06:39.548 --> 05:06:39.558 align:start position:0%
moratorium or a pause should be
 
05:06:41.708 --> 05:06:41.718 align:start position:0%
considered uh could be considered we
 
05:06:43.990 --> 05:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
didn't get into the details too much the
 
05:06:47.830 --> 05:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
the 2031 came up based on the uh banial
 
05:06:52.190 --> 05:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste report um which estimated uh
 
05:06:55.030 --> 05:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
capacity needing further capacity in
 
05:06:57.110 --> 05:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
2034 I didn't print that out because
 
05:06:59.708 --> 05:06:59.718 align:start position:0%
it's 100 and plus pages but that's the
 
05:07:02.470 --> 05:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
banial solid waste report um that's on
 
05:07:05.190 --> 05:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
the dees website it's on page seven that
 
05:07:08.270 --> 05:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
says the uh um capacity may fall short
 
05:07:11.788 --> 05:07:11.798 align:start position:0%
projected in 2034 so considering 2031
 
05:07:14.708 --> 05:07:14.718 align:start position:0%
three years buys us some time um to get
 
05:07:17.190 --> 05:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
a permit to get get to get a facility in
 
05:07:20.230 --> 05:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
place and does it take three years to
 
05:07:22.910 --> 05:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
get a facility put in place that I don't
 
05:07:22.920 --> 05:07:24.708 align:start position:0%
get a facility put in place that I don't
know

05:07:24.708 --> 05:07:24.718 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:07:26.990 --> 05:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you any other
 
05:07:30.868 --> 05:07:30.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:33.150 --> 05:07:33.160 align:start position:0%
Penza I just want wanted to ask if you
 
05:07:38.030 --> 05:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable in um uh basically an
 
05:07:40.270 --> 05:07:40.280 align:start position:0%
application that's sitting out there
 
05:07:43.230 --> 05:07:43.240 align:start position:0%
during the same time that rules are in a
 
05:07:45.390 --> 05:07:45.400 align:start position:0%
sense being processed does that make you
 
05:07:47.190 --> 05:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable because in a sense you
 
05:07:49.150 --> 05:07:49.160 align:start position:0%
know rules are being developed at the
 
05:07:50.750 --> 05:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
same time there's an application in
 
05:07:50.760 --> 05:07:52.070 align:start position:0%
same time there's an application in
there

05:07:52.070 --> 05:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:07:55.110 --> 05:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
and is that part of the reason why in
 
05:07:56.948 --> 05:07:56.958 align:start position:0%
putting a moratorium in here because
 
05:07:59.070 --> 05:07:59.080 align:start position:0%
there is not a definite need at this
 
05:08:01.110 --> 05:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
point and there isn't for another 10
 
05:08:05.310 --> 05:08:05.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:10.150 --> 05:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
been down here a year and uh I can tell
 
05:08:14.150 --> 05:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
you the folks up north as everywhere
 
05:08:16.510 --> 05:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
we're looking for an answer on some
 
05:08:19.628 --> 05:08:19.638 align:start position:0%
stuff we have needs we have crazy things
 
05:08:22.110 --> 05:08:22.120 align:start position:0%
like 250 feet you can put a landfill 250
 
05:08:26.110 --> 05:08:26.120 align:start position:0%
fet from a body of water and you
 
05:08:28.628 --> 05:08:28.638 align:start position:0%
know those things are common sense we
 
05:08:31.470 --> 05:08:31.480 align:start position:0%
would think but we can't get a consensus
 
05:08:34.430 --> 05:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
on on what what what the right way to go
 
05:08:37.350 --> 05:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
is I mean this house has bipartisan uh
 
05:08:39.830 --> 05:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
passed bipartisan bills to to to make
 
05:08:41.990 --> 05:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
Common Sense changes and it gets to the
 
05:08:44.350 --> 05:08:44.360 align:start position:0%
other side of the wall and it dies um
 
05:08:46.628 --> 05:08:46.638 align:start position:0%
we've had cases where you know both h
 
05:08:48.390 --> 05:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
both bodies have passed something gets
 
05:08:51.990 --> 05:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
to the corner at office and dies
 
05:08:54.670 --> 05:08:54.680 align:start position:0%
meanwhile you've got forever chemicals
 
05:08:55.990 --> 05:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
rolling into our
 
05:08:58.830 --> 05:08:58.840 align:start position:0%
Rivers um right Upstream from my town
 
05:09:01.150 --> 05:09:01.160 align:start position:0%
who's invested hundreds of thousands of
 
05:09:04.310 --> 05:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
dollars to revitalize as a downtown and
 
05:09:07.830 --> 05:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh and and and we're thinking this is
 
05:09:09.548 --> 05:09:09.558 align:start position:0%
crazy why isn't anybody doing anything
 
05:09:13.788 --> 05:09:13.798 align:start position:0%
on that so does it am I concerned about
 
05:09:16.948 --> 05:09:16.958 align:start position:0%
that you know a couple things yeah I'm
 
05:09:19.990 --> 05:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
concerned that we we haven't done the
 
05:09:22.750 --> 05:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
right we haven't we've getting Common
 
05:09:25.788 --> 05:09:25.798 align:start position:0%
Sense stuff through down here hasn't
 
05:09:27.910 --> 05:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
happened we've got we've got places all
 
05:09:30.230 --> 05:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
over the state being Newington and and
 
05:09:32.868 --> 05:09:32.878 align:start position:0%
and marac and and all we just placed
 
05:09:35.110 --> 05:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
replaced two wells in the state of New
 
05:09:37.390 --> 05:09:37.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for schools because of
 
05:09:39.150 --> 05:09:39.160 align:start position:0%
contamination and we're still not
 
05:09:41.708 --> 05:09:41.718 align:start position:0%
getting anything done down here that
 
05:09:45.190 --> 05:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
concerns me um it would concern me as a
 
05:09:47.030 --> 05:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
applicant to have an application in
 
05:09:49.150 --> 05:09:49.160 align:start position:0%
there knowing the rules might change I
 
05:09:51.708 --> 05:09:51.718 align:start position:0%
mean I I I can't imagine putting up an
 
05:09:54.910 --> 05:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
investment like that uh knowing that the
 
05:09:57.070 --> 05:09:57.080 align:start position:0%
uh the dees might change the rules
 
05:09:58.948 --> 05:09:58.958 align:start position:0%
Midstream so yeah there's a lot of
 
05:10:01.230 --> 05:10:01.240 align:start position:0%
concerns I have a lot of concerns there
 
05:10:04.030 --> 05:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
and uh I think that this is a it's a
 
05:10:06.430 --> 05:10:06.440 align:start position:0%
common sense thing um I mean it's a
 
05:10:09.628 --> 05:10:09.638 align:start position:0%
pause it's a you know we do this in my
 
05:10:11.510 --> 05:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means Committee we do this with
 
05:10:13.590 --> 05:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
historical race horsing we' we've put a
 
05:10:16.390 --> 05:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
pause on things because HR gambling it's
 
05:10:18.708 --> 05:10:18.718 align:start position:0%
it's a contentious issue but regardless
 
05:10:22.230 --> 05:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
of what HR does it doesn't poison
 
05:10:26.788 --> 05:10:26.798 align:start position:0%
Wells and if we can put a moratorium on
 
05:10:31.030 --> 05:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
a electronic machine that you know
 
05:10:33.110 --> 05:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
people gamble on why can't we put a
 
05:10:34.310 --> 05:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
moratorium on something that could
 
05:10:37.190 --> 05:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
poison our drinking water representative
 
05:10:39.310 --> 05:10:39.320 align:start position:0%
NAB thank you madam chair thank you for
 
05:10:42.190 --> 05:10:42.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I wonder did your
 
05:10:45.190 --> 05:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
committee hear from private uh landfill
 
05:10:47.310 --> 05:10:47.320 align:start position:0%
companies and did they have any push
 
05:10:49.548 --> 05:10:49.558 align:start position:0%
back on this legislation or Yeah we
 
05:10:52.150 --> 05:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
actually did we heard uh and and the the
 
05:10:54.310 --> 05:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
the reports online and again I gave you
 
05:10:56.470 --> 05:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
the first few pages of that uh we heard
 
05:10:58.670 --> 05:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
from representatives from carbury uh
 
05:11:02.030 --> 05:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
landfill and I think maybe Wast man
 
05:11:04.670 --> 05:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
management um some of the folks may be
 
05:11:06.868 --> 05:11:06.878 align:start position:0%
here in the room um and we did we did
 
05:11:10.110 --> 05:11:10.120 align:start position:0%
hear from them and you
 
05:11:14.708 --> 05:11:14.718 align:start position:0%
know they were very re I mean I I didn't
 
05:11:16.628 --> 05:11:16.638 align:start position:0%
they want to do the right thing too I
 
05:11:19.868 --> 05:11:19.878 align:start position:0%
I'm not here to demonize anybody I mean
 
05:11:21.708 --> 05:11:21.718 align:start position:0%
uh we all understand every single one of
 
05:11:23.708 --> 05:11:23.718 align:start position:0%
us throws stuff away I mean like you
 
05:11:25.390 --> 05:11:25.400 align:start position:0%
said earlier I mean it's it's the stuff
 
05:11:27.750 --> 05:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
that we deal with um you got they're
 
05:11:29.910 --> 05:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
doing the best they can they're they're
 
05:11:31.430 --> 05:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
they're they're they're trying to do it
 
05:11:33.510 --> 05:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
to the high highest standards that's
 
05:11:36.868 --> 05:11:36.878 align:start position:0%
around um and uh and I think their their
 
05:11:40.110 --> 05:11:40.120 align:start position:0%
feedback was receptive and it was we we
 
05:11:42.990 --> 05:11:43.000 align:start position:0%
they were respectful um I've had nothing
 
05:11:44.670 --> 05:11:44.680 align:start position:0%
my interactions with them in this
 
05:11:46.788 --> 05:11:46.798 align:start position:0%
capacity have been nothing but um
 
05:11:49.548 --> 05:11:49.558 align:start position:0%
top-notch and uh I think they're an
 
05:11:51.430 --> 05:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
industry that really want to do the
 
05:11:54.150 --> 05:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
right thing too and we just have to work
 
05:11:55.948 --> 05:11:55.958 align:start position:0%
together to find out the pathway that
 
05:11:58.070 --> 05:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
best suits both sides representative
 
05:12:00.548 --> 05:12:00.558 align:start position:0%
rord thank you for that thank you
 
05:12:02.670 --> 05:12:02.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate that any other questions
 
05:12:06.310 --> 05:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I'd like to call
 
05:12:20.030 --> 05:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:22.350 --> 05:12:22.360 align:start position:0%
speak thank you yeah my name is Jared
 
05:12:24.110 --> 05:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
Sullivan representative for grafting 2
 
05:12:26.030 --> 05:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
which is Bethlehem and Frank conia the
 
05:12:28.590 --> 05:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
one of the bills or sorry one of the
 
05:12:30.470 --> 05:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
landfills that is so contentious is in
 
05:12:32.470 --> 05:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
my town of Bethlehem
 
05:12:33.868 --> 05:12:33.878 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to be as quick as I can
 
05:12:34.990 --> 05:12:35.000 align:start position:0%
because I have to get back up to my
 
05:12:36.830 --> 05:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
committee where two of my bills are in
 
05:12:38.110 --> 05:12:38.120 align:start position:0%
the middle of a working session and we
 
05:12:40.350 --> 05:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
haven't just got to them yet so um
 
05:12:42.150 --> 05:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
anyways I'm just here to talk about the
 
05:12:44.030 --> 05:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal node it was somebody asked me
 
05:12:45.830 --> 05:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
well David asked me to look at it he
 
05:12:47.190 --> 05:12:47.200 align:start position:0%
thought it didn't quite make sense and
 
05:12:48.788 --> 05:12:48.798 align:start position:0%
so I thought I would look into it and
 
05:12:51.190 --> 05:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
there are a few things in here that I I
 
05:12:53.230 --> 05:12:53.240 align:start position:0%
I feel like we should flag
 
05:12:57.350 --> 05:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
so um for starters they're talking about
 
05:13:00.150 --> 05:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
there being no impact on fiscal years 24
 
05:13:03.070 --> 05:13:03.080 align:start position:0%
and 25 they're saying that they do not
 
05:13:04.868 --> 05:13:04.878 align:start position:0%
anticipate an impact on the state or
 
05:13:08.310 --> 05:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
local expenditures
 
05:13:11.310 --> 05:13:11.320 align:start position:0%
so I guess everything starts in 2026
 
05:13:12.750 --> 05:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
because that's when it's anticipated
 
05:13:15.230 --> 05:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
that the Bethlehem uh landfill will
 
05:13:17.830 --> 05:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
close down um it doesn't matter whether
 
05:13:19.510 --> 05:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
this bill passes or not the Bethlehem
 
05:13:21.590 --> 05:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
landfill will close down even if
 
05:13:23.470 --> 05:13:23.480 align:start position:0%
something changed and we were able to
 
05:13:25.910 --> 05:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
extend the Bethlehem or do the expansion
 
05:13:28.510 --> 05:13:28.520 align:start position:0%
at the Bethlehem landfill uh I've spoken
 
05:13:30.788 --> 05:13:30.798 align:start position:0%
with Cella and they have I've been there
 
05:13:32.510 --> 05:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
several times on on the site and got a
 
05:13:33.948 --> 05:13:33.958 align:start position:0%
tour of the landfill because this is a
 
05:13:35.670 --> 05:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
super hot bu an issue in my town as you
 
05:13:38.350 --> 05:13:38.360 align:start position:0%
can imagine they've told me that even if
 
05:13:40.788 --> 05:13:40.798 align:start position:0%
the Dalton thing does get approved or
 
05:13:42.868 --> 05:13:42.878 align:start position:0%
somehow Bethlehem revers course and we
 
05:13:44.708 --> 05:13:44.718 align:start position:0%
did expand the Bethlehem there would be
 
05:13:47.470 --> 05:13:47.480 align:start position:0%
a gap in between there starting in 2026
 
05:13:49.070 --> 05:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
because it takes that much time to build
 
05:13:53.390 --> 05:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
out so this bill really has no impact of
 
05:13:55.548 --> 05:13:55.558 align:start position:0%
starting in 2026 that's going to happen
 
05:13:57.190 --> 05:13:57.200 align:start position:0%
regardless so the fact that that entered
 
05:13:59.110 --> 05:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
this methodology in the fiscal note is a
 
05:14:02.830 --> 05:14:02.840 align:start position:0%
little concerning um because those costs
 
05:14:04.628 --> 05:14:04.638 align:start position:0%
are going to increase regardless if if
 
05:14:06.150 --> 05:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
that's what they inue believe will
 
05:14:08.510 --> 05:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
happen so there their logic is you know
 
05:14:10.708 --> 05:14:10.718 align:start position:0%
in their economic analysis of of the
 
05:14:12.110 --> 05:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
impact of this bill is that you're going
 
05:14:14.708 --> 05:14:14.718 align:start position:0%
to see a decrease in the supply of
 
05:14:17.390 --> 05:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
landfill space or a capacity to deal
 
05:14:19.310 --> 05:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
with waste right and and that that that
 
05:14:20.830 --> 05:14:20.840 align:start position:0%
is true you're going to see that and
 
05:14:22.190 --> 05:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
that generally does when you see
 
05:14:24.030 --> 05:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
decreases in Supply things costs do go
 
05:14:25.750 --> 05:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
up but it that's kind of looking at it
 
05:14:28.230 --> 05:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
in a vacuum and I think that in in this
 
05:14:30.110 --> 05:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
world there are other things that happen
 
05:14:32.030 --> 05:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
so when prices of a one thing happens
 
05:14:34.390 --> 05:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
generally the substitutes react and so
 
05:14:36.750 --> 05:14:36.760 align:start position:0%
you know if if the cost of Coca-Cola
 
05:14:38.830 --> 05:14:38.840 align:start position:0%
went up dramatically would all switch
 
05:14:40.910 --> 05:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
and start consuming Pepsi instead right
 
05:14:42.788 --> 05:14:42.798 align:start position:0%
and Pepsi could start producing more
 
05:14:43.948 --> 05:14:43.958 align:start position:0%
because they would have a market
 
05:14:45.708 --> 05:14:45.718 align:start position:0%
opportunity well it's reasonable to
 
05:14:47.628 --> 05:14:47.638 align:start position:0%
assume that certainly in the medium term
 
05:14:49.310 --> 05:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
Maybe not immediately but the medium-
 
05:14:52.150 --> 05:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
term if we decide not to increase our
 
05:14:54.030 --> 05:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
landfill capacity in the state that
 
05:14:56.110 --> 05:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
other things would step into fill that
 
05:14:57.788 --> 05:14:57.798 align:start position:0%
void because it would be a market
 
05:15:00.590 --> 05:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity again this bill doesn't I I
 
05:15:01.948 --> 05:15:01.958 align:start position:0%
think this is a really key point this
 
05:15:03.670 --> 05:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
bill does not impact whether or not the
 
05:15:05.628 --> 05:15:05.638 align:start position:0%
Bethlehem landfill is going to close
 
05:15:07.110 --> 05:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
it's going to close regardless of
 
05:15:08.910 --> 05:15:08.920 align:start position:0%
whether we extend extend the life in
 
05:15:11.430 --> 05:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
Bethlehem in the future or have Dalton
 
05:15:13.670 --> 05:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
the this capacity problem happens with
 
05:15:16.190 --> 05:15:16.200 align:start position:0%
or without this bill and this bill this
 
05:15:18.190 --> 05:15:18.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal note suggests that the problems
 
05:15:20.190 --> 05:15:20.200 align:start position:0%
from a financial standpoint start to
 
05:15:22.830 --> 05:15:22.840 align:start position:0%
occur on 2026 it's just not true it
 
05:15:24.150 --> 05:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense and I hope that you
 
05:15:28.030 --> 05:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
guys can you know use that clear flawed
 
05:15:29.750 --> 05:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
methodology to discredit this part of
 
05:15:32.510 --> 05:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
the fiscal analysis um with that I'll
 
05:15:33.830 --> 05:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
open up questions and if not I'll run
 
05:15:36.548 --> 05:15:36.558 align:start position:0%
back to my committee any questions
 
05:15:36.558 --> 05:15:39.190 align:start position:0%
back to my committee any questions
representative

05:15:39.190 --> 05:15:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:42.070 --> 05:15:42.080 align:start position:0%
kulan thank you Mr Speaker and thank you
 
05:15:44.510 --> 05:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question representative um
 
05:15:46.590 --> 05:15:46.600 align:start position:0%
yeah with I heard what you said about
 
05:15:49.708 --> 05:15:49.718 align:start position:0%
the um increases and um you made some
 
05:15:52.628 --> 05:15:52.638 align:start position:0%
good points on the economic thing but
 
05:15:55.750 --> 05:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
living in Grafton County like a lot of
 
05:15:59.390 --> 05:15:59.400 align:start position:0%
our constituents myself included we have
 
05:16:02.110 --> 05:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
private waste so one thing that worries
 
05:16:04.070 --> 05:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
me about bills like this is that we
 
05:16:06.628 --> 05:16:06.638 align:start position:0%
can't really see too far into the future
 
05:16:09.788 --> 05:16:09.798 align:start position:0%
right because you know the world in 2019
 
05:16:12.470 --> 05:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
is a lot different you know than it is
 
05:16:15.350 --> 05:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
today and we didn't see these un you
 
05:16:18.390 --> 05:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
know unforeseen things or we do live in
 
05:16:20.868 --> 05:16:20.878 align:start position:0%
an uncertain world so is there any kind
 
05:16:25.190 --> 05:16:25.200 align:start position:0%
of concern that you have about um you
 
05:16:28.470 --> 05:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
know Waste Management prices rising
 
05:16:31.628 --> 05:16:31.638 align:start position:0%
between now and 2031 and you know
 
05:16:33.708 --> 05:16:33.718 align:start position:0%
because that does impact our
 
05:16:37.270 --> 05:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
constituents and our own uh Waste
 
05:16:40.590 --> 05:16:40.600 align:start position:0%
Services costs my costs have gone up in
 
05:16:42.990 --> 05:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
this past year alone so I'm just
 
05:16:46.270 --> 05:16:46.280 align:start position:0%
wondering if there's any concerns uh
 
05:16:48.070 --> 05:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
regarding prices so if your prices have
 
05:16:49.230 --> 05:16:49.240 align:start position:0%
gone up in the past year it's not
 
05:16:51.390 --> 05:16:51.400 align:start position:0%
because of this bill obviously so I
 
05:16:54.070 --> 05:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
think the market forces that drive cost
 
05:16:57.390 --> 05:16:57.400 align:start position:0%
increases are anything from National
 
05:16:59.430 --> 05:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
inflation problems that we've we've all
 
05:17:03.110 --> 05:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
seen increases in gas pric or oil prices
 
05:17:04.830 --> 05:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
that drive you know these vehicles that
 
05:17:07.948 --> 05:17:07.958 align:start position:0%
pick up our waste um labor shortages so
 
05:17:09.590 --> 05:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
you have to pay people who work and
 
05:17:11.470 --> 05:17:11.480 align:start position:0%
drive these trucks and these waste
 
05:17:13.390 --> 05:17:13.400 align:start position:0%
removal uh service companies have to pay
 
05:17:14.548 --> 05:17:14.558 align:start position:0%
their staff more like all of those
 
05:17:15.548 --> 05:17:15.558 align:start position:0%
things are going to drive the cost
 
05:17:17.750 --> 05:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to pass that on to you if
 
05:17:19.628 --> 05:17:19.638 align:start position:0%
you're going to look at this bill
 
05:17:22.310 --> 05:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
specifically the relevant question is
 
05:17:24.190 --> 05:17:24.200 align:start position:0%
does this bill prevent capacity from
 
05:17:28.628 --> 05:17:28.638 align:start position:0%
coming on and the reality is it might
 
05:17:30.230 --> 05:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
but it's not clear that that's entirely
 
05:17:32.310 --> 05:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
true right and so we know that the
 
05:17:34.868 --> 05:17:34.878 align:start position:0%
Bethlehem thing is not scheduled to be
 
05:17:37.470 --> 05:17:37.480 align:start position:0%
expanded because the town won't won't
 
05:17:38.670 --> 05:17:38.680 align:start position:0%
allow it they've already like voted it
 
05:17:40.948 --> 05:17:40.958 align:start position:0%
down at the Town level the Dalton Thing
 
05:17:42.788 --> 05:17:42.798 align:start position:0%
Remains kind of in the air last I
 
05:17:45.150 --> 05:17:45.160 align:start position:0%
checked um that might come it might not
 
05:17:46.708 --> 05:17:46.718 align:start position:0%
but it's certainly not going to come in
 
05:17:50.990 --> 05:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
2026 and if it does if it does pass uh I
 
05:17:52.750 --> 05:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
don't I can't speak to how long it would
 
05:17:56.150 --> 05:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
take to develop it but uh if 20 it's
 
05:17:58.548 --> 05:17:58.558 align:start position:0%
definitely not going to be by 2026 27 so
 
05:18:01.590 --> 05:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
it' be some point between then and 2031
 
05:18:03.390 --> 05:18:03.400 align:start position:0%
which is what the moratorium is
 
05:18:05.590 --> 05:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
suggesting whether or not that happens I
 
05:18:07.030 --> 05:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
don't know so I guess you could make an
 
05:18:09.030 --> 05:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
argument that if the assumption that the
 
05:18:11.548 --> 05:18:11.558 align:start position:0%
Dalton thing will be developed then
 
05:18:13.548 --> 05:18:13.558 align:start position:0%
potentially there could be an increase
 
05:18:15.830 --> 05:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
potentially compared to the status quo
 
05:18:17.628 --> 05:18:17.638 align:start position:0%
um I don't know that you could I don't
 
05:18:18.948 --> 05:18:18.958 align:start position:0%
know if that's a super reasonable
 
05:18:20.470 --> 05:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
assumption you have to you have to make
 
05:18:21.990 --> 05:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
some real assumptions to get to that
 
05:18:23.590 --> 05:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
outcome that prices will increase
 
05:18:25.470 --> 05:18:25.480 align:start position:0%
because of this bill prices might very
 
05:18:26.590 --> 05:18:26.600 align:start position:0%
well increased because of the
 
05:18:28.430 --> 05:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
inflationary environment or whole host
 
05:18:29.948 --> 05:18:29.958 align:start position:0%
of other reasons but because of this
 
05:18:32.110 --> 05:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
bill that feel feels like a stretch to
 
05:18:36.070 --> 05:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:39.070 --> 05:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
information represent Murray thank you
 
05:18:41.230 --> 05:18:41.240 align:start position:0%
madam chair um and thank you for taking
 
05:18:44.310 --> 05:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
my question um with regard to the waste
 
05:18:46.150 --> 05:18:46.160 align:start position:0%
disposal hierarchy we know that
 
05:18:47.990 --> 05:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
landfilling is our least preferred
 
05:18:50.310 --> 05:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
method of dealing with the things that
 
05:18:52.788 --> 05:18:52.798 align:start position:0%
we consume buy purchase all of the other
 
05:18:58.030 --> 05:18:58.040 align:start position:0%
things and um I also noted in um the
 
05:19:00.628 --> 05:19:00.638 align:start position:0%
report that was issued uh that was
 
05:19:03.110 --> 05:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
associated with the prime sponsors uh
 
05:19:06.830 --> 05:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
testimony that we're only 20 26%
 
05:19:08.310 --> 05:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
recycling rate for the State of New
 
05:19:11.510 --> 05:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I think that we have
 
05:19:15.708 --> 05:19:15.718 align:start position:0%
our uh triangle upside down right now um
 
05:19:18.788 --> 05:19:18.798 align:start position:0%
so our desire would be to be recycling
 
05:19:21.708 --> 05:19:21.718 align:start position:0%
more and landfilling less would you not
 
05:19:25.070 --> 05:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
agree I mean sure ideally I mean I'm I'm
 
05:19:26.948 --> 05:19:26.958 align:start position:0%
not an expert of the best way to deal
 
05:19:28.470 --> 05:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
with our waste problems but there's
 
05:19:30.708 --> 05:19:30.718 align:start position:0%
plenty of material to be recycled than
 
05:19:31.788 --> 05:19:31.798 align:start position:0%
it should be
 
05:19:34.628 --> 05:19:34.638 align:start position:0%
recycled um my understanding is
 
05:19:35.948 --> 05:19:35.958 align:start position:0%
recycling rates across the entire
 
05:19:37.990 --> 05:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
country are quite low uh but I don't
 
05:19:39.150 --> 05:19:39.160 align:start position:0%
want to pretend like I'm an expert on
 
05:19:41.910 --> 05:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
this I'm not an expert on why we recycle
 
05:19:43.510 --> 05:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
what we recycle and why we don't recycle
 
05:19:45.190 --> 05:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
what we don't recycle compared to other
 
05:19:47.070 --> 05:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
nations or other parts of the country
 
05:19:47.080 --> 05:19:48.590 align:start position:0%
nations or other parts of the country
even

05:19:48.590 --> 05:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
even
 
05:19:51.788 --> 05:19:51.798 align:start position:0%
um on that point I would say that there
 
05:19:54.830 --> 05:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
are a lot of things that could be
 
05:19:57.470 --> 05:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
recycled that perhaps aren't
 
05:20:00.590 --> 05:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
recycled and I know in my town of
 
05:20:02.670 --> 05:20:02.680 align:start position:0%
Bethlehem we're like one of the only
 
05:20:04.110 --> 05:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
towns in the North country that actually
 
05:20:07.430 --> 05:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
has curbside pickup and in it we have
 
05:20:10.070 --> 05:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
all the recycling thrown into one bin
 
05:20:12.990 --> 05:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
and from my understanding much of it
 
05:20:15.190 --> 05:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
just gets landfilled anyways and doesn't
 
05:20:16.750 --> 05:20:16.760 align:start position:0%
get separated I think basically the
 
05:20:19.788 --> 05:20:19.798 align:start position:0%
metal gets separated out uh again don't
 
05:20:21.230 --> 05:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
don't hold me to that I'm not an expert
 
05:20:23.708 --> 05:20:23.718 align:start position:0%
on it this is just what I've been told
 
05:20:25.628 --> 05:20:25.638 align:start position:0%
um but I think recycling yeah recycling
 
05:20:27.270 --> 05:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
is important I think if we can create a
 
05:20:28.590 --> 05:20:28.600 align:start position:0%
market for that stuff or if there is a
 
05:20:30.670 --> 05:20:30.680 align:start position:0%
market for that stuff I think from an
 
05:20:32.230 --> 05:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
economic standpoint I'm an economist
 
05:20:33.270 --> 05:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
that's why I was asked to come speak
 
05:20:34.548 --> 05:20:34.558 align:start position:0%
here from an economic standpoint you got
 
05:20:36.670 --> 05:20:36.680 align:start position:0%
to ask why are we not recycling things
 
05:20:38.070 --> 05:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
and I don't know the answer to that but
 
05:20:39.590 --> 05:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
if there's a market for the stuff why is
 
05:20:41.670 --> 05:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
it not being recycled does it take a
 
05:20:43.230 --> 05:20:43.240 align:start position:0%
government nudge to force Us in that
 
05:20:44.910 --> 05:20:44.920 align:start position:0%
direction or is there some sort of
 
05:20:47.390 --> 05:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
market failure that is causing us to is
 
05:20:49.030 --> 05:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
it is it a lack of infrastructure for
 
05:20:50.670 --> 05:20:50.680 align:start position:0%
recycling stuff that makes recycling
 
05:20:52.310 --> 05:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
more expensive than landfilling
 
05:20:54.750 --> 05:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
currently and I think that's actually a
 
05:20:56.590 --> 05:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
pretty interesting question that it
 
05:20:58.190 --> 05:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
would be good for somebody to kind of
 
05:20:59.548 --> 05:20:59.558 align:start position:0%
look at or explain I don't know the
 
05:21:01.990 --> 05:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
answer to it but um certainly is
 
05:21:04.390 --> 05:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
preferable to recycle holding alls
 
05:21:07.230 --> 05:21:07.240 align:start position:0%
constant thank you and one followup if I
 
05:21:09.750 --> 05:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
so to that end I guess if if we increase
 
05:21:11.270 --> 05:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
all of our other things like I believe
 
05:21:13.230 --> 05:21:13.240 align:start position:0%
maybe was mentioned in the other
 
05:21:15.150 --> 05:21:15.160 align:start position:0%
testimonies and we do other waste
 
05:21:18.270 --> 05:21:18.280 align:start position:0%
diversion composting recycling um is it
 
05:21:22.628 --> 05:21:22.638 align:start position:0%
your assumption that the the impact and
 
05:21:22.638 --> 05:21:24.230 align:start position:0%
your assumption that the the impact and
burden

05:21:24.230 --> 05:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
burden
 
05:21:28.110 --> 05:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
of uh capacity might slow down with
 
05:21:30.830 --> 05:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
these other efforts sure yeah I mean
 
05:21:32.190 --> 05:21:32.200 align:start position:0%
that that's a very logical assumption
 
05:21:35.430 --> 05:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
and also uh I mean one of the big
 
05:21:38.070 --> 05:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
concerns with landfills and I know I'm
 
05:21:39.788 --> 05:21:39.798 align:start position:0%
not educating anybody on this topic but
 
05:21:40.830 --> 05:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
just to say it because it needs to be
 
05:21:41.948 --> 05:21:41.958 align:start position:0%
said one of the big concerns about
 
05:21:43.868 --> 05:21:43.878 align:start position:0%
landfills in this specific location of
 
05:21:46.270 --> 05:21:46.280 align:start position:0%
Bethlehem or the Dalton facility is
 
05:21:48.670 --> 05:21:48.680 align:start position:0%
that the potential for leaking into
 
05:21:50.390 --> 05:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
water that's very close with the poest
 
05:21:52.750 --> 05:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
soil is is pretty high and that's the
 
05:21:54.230 --> 05:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
concern we're not saying we need no
 
05:21:56.470 --> 05:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
landfills obviously we need landfills
 
05:21:57.750 --> 05:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
this gives us time to kind of figure
 
05:22:00.030 --> 05:22:00.040 align:start position:0%
that out and in that process maybe there
 
05:22:01.548 --> 05:22:01.558 align:start position:0%
are other Solutions which right now will
 
05:22:03.990 --> 05:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
be considered because there's sort of
 
05:22:05.708 --> 05:22:05.718 align:start position:0%
the default the status quo and there's
 
05:22:07.470 --> 05:22:07.480 align:start position:0%
always status quo bias in every decision
 
05:22:09.150 --> 05:22:09.160 align:start position:0%
making and we know where the landfill is
 
05:22:10.750 --> 05:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
and in my town it's right there so why
 
05:22:13.788 --> 05:22:13.798 align:start position:0%
would we have robust recycling
 
05:22:15.510 --> 05:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
facilities in my town or maybe the
 
05:22:17.430 --> 05:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
surrounding towns when you have a
 
05:22:19.390 --> 05:22:19.400 align:start position:0%
landfill right there but yeah if you can
 
05:22:21.910 --> 05:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
get more recycled then that that does
 
05:22:25.150 --> 05:22:25.160 align:start position:0%
seem um like it might reduce capacity
 
05:22:27.750 --> 05:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
needs in the future for actual landfills
 
05:22:29.910 --> 05:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
representative ger thank you madam chair
 
05:22:31.670 --> 05:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh and
 
05:22:34.948 --> 05:22:34.958 align:start position:0%
with regard to capacity uh the provision
 
05:22:37.190 --> 05:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
in the bill that would allow for the
 
05:22:39.628 --> 05:22:39.638 align:start position:0%
expansion of existing facilities
 
05:22:42.670 --> 05:22:42.680 align:start position:0%
providing more capacity would also
 
05:22:44.390 --> 05:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
counter inflationary pressures right in
 
05:22:46.430 --> 05:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
terms of of the market not inflationary
 
05:22:48.788 --> 05:22:48.798 align:start position:0%
per se but we have the Capac we have the
 
05:22:50.670 --> 05:22:50.680 align:start position:0%
ability through this bill to add
 
05:22:53.430 --> 05:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
capacity which should help prevent the
 
05:22:56.548 --> 05:22:56.558 align:start position:0%
increase in costs correct yeah I mean
 
05:22:59.430 --> 05:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
the the bur the Berlin one um I mean
 
05:23:01.230 --> 05:23:01.240 align:start position:0%
that's presumably where the stuff and my
 
05:23:04.670 --> 05:23:04.680 align:start position:0%
town will go when this when this
 
05:23:06.390 --> 05:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
landfill that we currently have
 
05:23:08.510 --> 05:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
closes there's no reason why they can't
 
05:23:10.750 --> 05:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
expand I that this doesn't prohibit that
 
05:23:13.150 --> 05:23:13.160 align:start position:0%
and that that is a bu a landfill that
 
05:23:15.350 --> 05:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
from my understanding is a good landfill
 
05:23:16.750 --> 05:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of it's not sitting on poor
 
05:23:18.390 --> 05:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
soil it's sitting on a clay based soil
 
05:23:21.470 --> 05:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
so if if we're going to have uh
 
05:23:23.270 --> 05:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
expansions of other ones the capacity
 
05:23:26.310 --> 05:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
problems may or may not materialize like
 
05:23:27.868 --> 05:23:27.878 align:start position:0%
I think in the very very short term
 
05:23:29.510 --> 05:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
there's going to be capacity problems
 
05:23:30.670 --> 05:23:30.680 align:start position:0%
regardless of this bill because of what
 
05:23:31.948 --> 05:23:31.958 align:start position:0%
I laid out when I first started my
 
05:23:34.230 --> 05:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
testimony but I I think that you know if
 
05:23:35.510 --> 05:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
that does drive up prices guess what's
 
05:23:37.030 --> 05:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
going to happen the Market's going to
 
05:23:39.190 --> 05:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
work and and the landfill in in Berlin
 
05:23:41.590 --> 05:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
for example will likely
 
05:23:46.150 --> 05:23:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:50.390 --> 05:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
Penza are you familiar with um with
 
05:23:53.590 --> 05:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
Dalton switching um over to a new
 
05:23:56.708 --> 05:23:56.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:58.708 --> 05:23:58.718 align:start position:0%
Bethlehem uh you mean they don't use the
 
05:24:00.868 --> 05:24:00.878 align:start position:0%
Bethlehem landfill correct somebody has
 
05:24:03.070 --> 05:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
told me that yeah I I I don't know where
 
05:24:04.948 --> 05:24:04.958 align:start position:0%
it goes right now so they actually
 
05:24:07.030 --> 05:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
switched to carbury is there a question
 
05:24:11.830 --> 05:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
about this bill it it is okay um they
 
05:24:13.990 --> 05:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
switched to carbur which was less money
 
05:24:16.030 --> 05:24:16.040 align:start position:0%
which in talking about the money piece
 
05:24:18.868 --> 05:24:18.878 align:start position:0%
here but in doing so realizing that
 
05:24:21.430 --> 05:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
there is still plenty of capacity with
 
05:24:24.110 --> 05:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire piece so because you
 
05:24:25.548 --> 05:24:25.558 align:start position:0%
have to be able to take New Hampshire
 
05:24:28.150 --> 05:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
trash first in a sense so if a landfill
 
05:24:31.990 --> 05:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
is taking 50% or more then that also uh
 
05:24:35.590 --> 05:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
negates this with um you know we've got
 
05:24:37.510 --> 05:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
Recycling and food waste and all that
 
05:24:40.150 --> 05:24:40.160 align:start position:0%
can you see that to be keeping us to a
 
05:24:43.390 --> 05:24:43.400 align:start position:0%
point in in um
 
05:24:45.708 --> 05:24:45.718 align:start position:0%
2031 I mean yeah I think so I I don't
 
05:24:46.948 --> 05:24:46.958 align:start position:0%
think that this is going to drive up
 
05:24:49.030 --> 05:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
costs and I think the costs are going to
 
05:24:50.708 --> 05:24:50.718 align:start position:0%
go up based on what's already in the
 
05:24:51.910 --> 05:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
pipeline because it takes a while to
 
05:24:54.310 --> 05:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
build these facilities so this bill is
 
05:24:55.910 --> 05:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
not what's going to drive any sort of
 
05:24:57.868 --> 05:24:57.878 align:start position:0%
cost increas is is the argument against
 
05:24:59.350 --> 05:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
this fiscal note which I don't think was
 
05:25:04.590 --> 05:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
done very well um I think an an just not
 
05:25:05.708 --> 05:25:05.718 align:start position:0%
I don't generally live in a world of
 
05:25:07.470 --> 05:25:07.480 align:start position:0%
anecdotes but I'll give you an anecdote
 
05:25:09.430 --> 05:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
to your point which is I was doing work
 
05:25:13.230 --> 05:25:13.240 align:start position:0%
on my my house this summer and getting a
 
05:25:15.110 --> 05:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
dumpster from cassella which would go to
 
05:25:17.788 --> 05:25:17.798 align:start position:0%
the landfill in my town was considerably
 
05:25:19.430 --> 05:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
more expensive than getting one from a
 
05:25:20.750 --> 05:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
Berlin provider where it went to
 
05:25:23.990 --> 05:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
Carberry and so I it might just make
 
05:25:26.230 --> 05:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
sense to expand that area because
 
05:25:28.110 --> 05:25:28.120 align:start position:0%
they're already jacking up prices in
 
05:25:29.548 --> 05:25:29.558 align:start position:0%
cassella it's already sort of over
 
05:25:31.030 --> 05:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
subscribed to it seems like just based
 
05:25:33.110 --> 05:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
on the market forces that we're
 
05:25:35.470 --> 05:25:35.480 align:start position:0%
seeing any other
 
05:25:39.590 --> 05:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
05:25:49.470 --> 05:25:49.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:59.590 --> 05:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:59.600 --> 05:26:10.830 align:start position:0%
 
Morrison

05:26:10.830 --> 05:26:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:13.350 --> 05:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
good afternoon good
 
05:26:15.510 --> 05:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh for the record my name is
 
05:26:18.868 --> 05:26:18.878 align:start position:0%
Wayne Morrison and U I am the President
 
05:26:20.628 --> 05:26:20.638 align:start position:0%
of North Country Alliance for balance
 
05:26:23.390 --> 05:26:23.400 align:start position:0%
change which is a big title for a small
 
05:26:25.590 --> 05:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
group of volunteers who don't get paid
 
05:26:27.070 --> 05:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
for any of the work that they do but
 
05:26:29.948 --> 05:26:29.958 align:start position:0%
I've spent the last four or five years
 
05:26:31.230 --> 05:26:31.240 align:start position:0%
uh working very very hard with a
 
05:26:33.548 --> 05:26:33.558 align:start position:0%
coalition of people to try and make
 
05:26:36.510 --> 05:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
changes and and reform some of the
 
05:26:38.670 --> 05:26:38.680 align:start position:0%
regulations particularly around landfill
 
05:26:41.590 --> 05:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
sighting um but also in protecting clean
 
05:26:44.750 --> 05:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
water uh all across the state so I know
 
05:26:46.708 --> 05:26:46.718 align:start position:0%
you've had a long day and I'm sure it's
 
05:26:49.190 --> 05:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
a long week the testimony I gave you I'm
 
05:26:50.548 --> 05:26:50.558 align:start position:0%
going to take a leap of faith and I'm
 
05:26:52.070 --> 05:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
going to kind of set that aside I'm not
 
05:26:55.350 --> 05:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
going to try and read it I hope you will
 
05:26:57.868 --> 05:26:57.878 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's it's was put together with
 
05:27:01.270 --> 05:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of uh care and tried to express
 
05:27:03.708 --> 05:27:03.718 align:start position:0%
myself in terms of why I support this
 
05:27:06.750 --> 05:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
bill but I think for the for the time
 
05:27:08.708 --> 05:27:08.718 align:start position:0%
that I have with you I'd really like to
 
05:27:12.430 --> 05:27:12.440 align:start position:0%
focus my attention on U why do we need
 
05:27:12.440 --> 05:27:13.310 align:start position:0%
focus my attention on U why do we need
to

05:27:13.310 --> 05:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:27:16.708 --> 05:27:16.718 align:start position:0%
pause and why
 
05:27:16.718 --> 05:27:18.910 align:start position:0%
pause and why
2031

05:27:18.910 --> 05:27:18.920 align:start position:0%
2031
 
05:27:22.310 --> 05:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
um there are multiple Solid Waste
 
05:27:24.230 --> 05:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
warning lights flashing in the state of
 
05:27:24.240 --> 05:27:24.948 align:start position:0%
warning lights flashing in the state of
New

05:27:24.948 --> 05:27:24.958 align:start position:0%
New
 
05:27:26.990 --> 05:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire some of them are flashing
 
05:27:30.670 --> 05:27:30.680 align:start position:0%
yellow and some of them are flashing red
 
05:27:33.548 --> 05:27:33.558 align:start position:0%
and it's important that this group the
 
05:27:36.270 --> 05:27:36.280 align:start position:0%
legislature pay attention to those and
 
05:27:38.548 --> 05:27:38.558 align:start position:0%
finally to act on
 
05:27:42.150 --> 05:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
them business as usual in the
 
05:27:45.070 --> 05:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
landfilling business is not going to be
 
05:27:47.310 --> 05:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
particularly good for New
 
05:27:50.150 --> 05:27:50.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have a booming outdoor
 
05:27:50.160 --> 05:27:52.110 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have a booming outdoor
recreation

05:27:52.110 --> 05:27:52.120 align:start position:0%
recreation
 
05:27:54.750 --> 05:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
economy and we need to protect the
 
05:27:58.070 --> 05:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
health and the environment and the and
 
05:27:59.990 --> 05:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
we need to protect uh the best interest
 
05:28:02.110 --> 05:28:02.120 align:start position:0%
of our Citi cens and our
 
05:28:04.350 --> 05:28:04.360 align:start position:0%
businesses the pause gives the
 
05:28:07.190 --> 05:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
legislature a chance first to evaluate a
 
05:28:09.948 --> 05:28:09.958 align:start position:0%
bunch of moving parts that we don't
 
05:28:12.350 --> 05:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
particularly have answers to today but
 
05:28:14.110 --> 05:28:14.120 align:start position:0%
we need to get answers and then we need
 
05:28:14.120 --> 05:28:16.270 align:start position:0%
we need to get answers and then we need
to

05:28:16.270 --> 05:28:16.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:28:18.910 --> 05:28:18.920 align:start position:0%
act I want to start I have five points
 
05:28:21.110 --> 05:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
that I would like to raise with the
 
05:28:23.628 --> 05:28:23.638 align:start position:0%
group the first one being you've heard a
 
05:28:25.670 --> 05:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
lot about
 
05:28:28.830 --> 05:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
capacity and I am here to tell you after
 
05:28:31.070 --> 05:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
diving into this and spending
 
05:28:33.830 --> 05:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
hundreds of hours trying to understand
 
05:28:37.390 --> 05:28:37.400 align:start position:0%
how Dees and how our system works in
 
05:28:37.400 --> 05:28:39.030 align:start position:0%
how Dees and how our system works in
calculating

05:28:39.030 --> 05:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
calculating
 
05:28:42.868 --> 05:28:42.878 align:start position:0%
capacity we absolutely do not have a
 
05:28:46.788 --> 05:28:46.798 align:start position:0%
capacity situation today and the
 
05:28:50.070 --> 05:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
2034 date that is quoted in the banial
 
05:28:53.230 --> 05:28:53.240 align:start position:0%
report I hope all of you know that that
 
05:28:56.310 --> 05:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
date is a function of a model that Dees
 
05:28:59.230 --> 05:28:59.240 align:start position:0%
uses I'm not against models but they're
 
05:29:01.470 --> 05:29:01.480 align:start position:0%
only as good as the Fe back and the data
 
05:29:03.548 --> 05:29:03.558 align:start position:0%
that you feed into
 
05:29:06.510 --> 05:29:06.520 align:start position:0%
them and if you explore that model and
 
05:29:09.030 --> 05:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
if Mike whim was here director whims was
 
05:29:12.708 --> 05:29:12.718 align:start position:0%
here he would tell you that 2034 is not
 
05:29:15.788 --> 05:29:15.798 align:start position:0%
a date that's really meaningful because
 
05:29:18.310 --> 05:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
it that that capacity shortfall starts
 
05:29:20.788 --> 05:29:20.798 align:start position:0%
because we assume the largest landfill
 
05:29:22.868 --> 05:29:22.878 align:start position:0%
in the state operated by waste
 
05:29:25.590 --> 05:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
management is going to shut
 
05:29:28.510 --> 05:29:28.520 align:start position:0%
down that's not going to happen they are
 
05:29:30.270 --> 05:29:30.280 align:start position:0%
going to expand and they're going to
 
05:29:32.910 --> 05:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
continue to run the largest landfill in
 
05:29:32.920 --> 05:29:33.750 align:start position:0%
continue to run the largest landfill in
the

05:29:33.750 --> 05:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:29:39.350 --> 05:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
state 2034 is likely to be 2044 or 2054
 
05:29:41.230 --> 05:29:41.240 align:start position:0%
depending on the capacity that they add
 
05:29:43.350 --> 05:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
at that
 
05:29:47.830 --> 05:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
time so in in considering the actions we
 
05:29:51.390 --> 05:29:51.400 align:start position:0%
need to take it is clear that the
 
05:29:53.948 --> 05:29:53.958 align:start position:0%
legislature and the state has plenty of
 
05:29:56.070 --> 05:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
time to try and Wade through some
 
05:29:58.070 --> 05:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
difficult problems and to the extent
 
05:30:00.390 --> 05:30:00.400 align:start position:0%
that we can we won't get it perfect but
 
05:30:01.910 --> 05:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
we certainly will get it better than we
 
05:30:05.190 --> 05:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
have in the past and now is the time to
 
05:30:06.670 --> 05:30:06.680 align:start position:0%
do that it could we couldn't have a
 
05:30:09.548 --> 05:30:09.558 align:start position:0%
better time so the pause is
 
05:30:12.270 --> 05:30:12.280 align:start position:0%
important and the timing this is the
 
05:30:14.310 --> 05:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
perfect time to
 
05:30:17.830 --> 05:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
stop secondly my second
 
05:30:21.110 --> 05:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
point the state went essentially 19
 
05:30:26.470 --> 05:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:29.708 --> 05:30:29.718 align:start position:0%
plan that action or lack of action was
 
05:30:29.718 --> 05:30:30.788 align:start position:0%
plan that action or lack of action was
extremely

05:30:30.788 --> 05:30:30.798 align:start position:0%
extremely
 
05:30:34.708 --> 05:30:34.718 align:start position:0%
detrimental to our Solid Waste position
 
05:30:38.150 --> 05:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
relative to Massachusetts relative to
 
05:30:41.430 --> 05:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
Vermont relative to Maine while we were
 
05:30:44.430 --> 05:30:44.440 align:start position:0%
essentially ignoring the solid waste
 
05:30:47.030 --> 05:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
problem other states were taking all
 
05:30:48.548 --> 05:30:48.558 align:start position:0%
kinds of
 
05:30:52.270 --> 05:30:52.280 align:start position:0%
actions that has made us very attractive
 
05:30:54.190 --> 05:30:54.200 align:start position:0%
to the private operators in the solid
 
05:30:58.470 --> 05:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
waste business it is not a surprise it
 
05:31:02.030 --> 05:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
is it is not a difficult problem to see
 
05:31:05.390 --> 05:31:05.400 align:start position:0%
why trash is coming to New Hampshire our
 
05:31:08.628 --> 05:31:08.638 align:start position:0%
laws are behind the times and they are
 
05:31:12.310 --> 05:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
more LAX than our neighboring
 
05:31:16.788 --> 05:31:16.798 align:start position:0%
states after 19 years Karen eel and the
 
05:31:19.868 --> 05:31:19.878 align:start position:0%
solid waste working group put a year
 
05:31:19.878 --> 05:31:20.910 align:start position:0%
solid waste working group put a year
working

05:31:20.910 --> 05:31:20.920 align:start position:0%
working
 
05:31:24.470 --> 05:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
diligently with Dees to develop an
 
05:31:24.480 --> 05:31:25.948 align:start position:0%
diligently with Dees to develop an
updated

05:31:25.948 --> 05:31:25.958 align:start position:0%
updated
 
05:31:28.990 --> 05:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
plan and guess what that plan says the
 
05:31:32.310 --> 05:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
overarching goal of that plan is to
 
05:31:34.430 --> 05:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
reduce the amount of solid
 
05:31:38.830 --> 05:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
waste going in needing disposal by
 
05:31:42.708 --> 05:31:42.718 align:start position:0%
25% what does that mean well that's
 
05:31:45.190 --> 05:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
calculated based on how much Municipal
 
05:31:47.270 --> 05:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
solid waste and how much construction
 
05:31:50.310 --> 05:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
and demolition material that we
 
05:31:53.190 --> 05:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
produce 25% as it turns out when you do
 
05:31:58.030 --> 05:31:58.040 align:start position:0%
the math is 370,000 tons a year by the
 
05:31:58.040 --> 05:31:59.070 align:start position:0%
the math is 370,000 tons a year by the
year

05:31:59.070 --> 05:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:31:59.080 --> 05:32:00.628 align:start position:0%
year
2030

05:32:00.628 --> 05:32:00.638 align:start position:0%
2030
 
05:32:02.548 --> 05:32:02.558 align:start position:0%
and just to put that in perspective if
 
05:32:05.150 --> 05:32:05.160 align:start position:0%
we were to hit that goal those numbers
 
05:32:07.548 --> 05:32:07.558 align:start position:0%
are bigger than the two or the three of
 
05:32:09.150 --> 05:32:09.160 align:start position:0%
the largest landfills that currently
 
05:32:11.510 --> 05:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
operate in the state so if we were
 
05:32:13.270 --> 05:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
successful we would eliminate the need
 
05:32:15.390 --> 05:32:15.400 align:start position:0%
for one
 
05:32:19.190 --> 05:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
landfill so I asked this group why on
 
05:32:22.510 --> 05:32:22.520 align:start position:0%
Earth as we sit here in 2024 would we
 
05:32:25.190 --> 05:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
even be considering adding additional
 
05:32:27.670 --> 05:32:27.680 align:start position:0%
capacity before we even have a chance to
 
05:32:31.110 --> 05:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
see how are we going to do against that
 
05:32:33.708 --> 05:32:33.718 align:start position:0%
goal isn't that where the state of New
 
05:32:35.510 --> 05:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should be putting its energy
 
05:32:37.150 --> 05:32:37.160 align:start position:0%
isn't that where the investment should
 
05:32:37.160 --> 05:32:38.110 align:start position:0%
isn't that where the investment should
be

05:32:38.110 --> 05:32:38.120 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:32:41.030 --> 05:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
going the solid waste working group and
 
05:32:42.948 --> 05:32:42.958 align:start position:0%
the and the state's Solid Waste
 
05:32:45.030 --> 05:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
Management plan says we should be in the
 
05:32:47.470 --> 05:32:47.480 align:start position:0%
diversion business not the landfilling
 
05:32:49.430 --> 05:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
business we should be worried about
 
05:32:53.430 --> 05:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
composting and recycling reuse we should
 
05:32:55.670 --> 05:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
not be looking to knock down trees and
 
05:32:57.868 --> 05:32:57.878 align:start position:0%
kill wetlands and make more space for
 
05:32:57.878 --> 05:32:58.948 align:start position:0%
kill wetlands and make more space for
more

05:32:58.948 --> 05:32:58.958 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:32:58.958 --> 05:33:00.948 align:start position:0%
more
landfills

05:33:00.948 --> 05:33:00.958 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
05:33:04.070 --> 05:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
our neighboring states are closing
 
05:33:06.628 --> 05:33:06.638 align:start position:0%
landfills and they are shipping their
 
05:33:08.430 --> 05:33:08.440 align:start position:0%
trash to New
 
05:33:11.070 --> 05:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we should all be very upset
 
05:33:13.548 --> 05:33:13.558 align:start position:0%
about that our neighbors to the South
 
05:33:16.350 --> 05:33:16.360 align:start position:0%
are fixing their problem by
 
05:33:19.628 --> 05:33:19.638 align:start position:0%
making making it our problem and by the
 
05:33:22.390 --> 05:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
way it's not only the trash they sent
 
05:33:27.190 --> 05:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
us but that trash is turning into
 
05:33:31.628 --> 05:33:31.638 align:start position:0%
lee8 and you should think of lee8 as PE
 
05:33:31.638 --> 05:33:33.270 align:start position:0%
lee8 and you should think of lee8 as PE
landfills

05:33:33.270 --> 05:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
05:33:36.270 --> 05:33:36.280 align:start position:0%
are essentially P
 
05:33:38.910 --> 05:33:38.920 align:start position:0%
factories they produce millions and
 
05:33:41.510 --> 05:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
millions of gallons of
 
05:33:43.350 --> 05:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
lee8 every
 
05:33:45.590 --> 05:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
year and that has to
 
05:33:51.470 --> 05:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
be collected stored pumped transported
 
05:33:54.310 --> 05:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
and treated somewhere in the
 
05:33:56.670 --> 05:33:56.680 align:start position:0%
state and that puts New Hampshire
 
05:33:58.830 --> 05:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
citizens and New Hampshire businesses at
 
05:34:03.070 --> 05:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
risk every single day and although the
 
05:34:05.510 --> 05:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
industry wants to tell you about doubled
 
05:34:07.868 --> 05:34:07.878 align:start position:0%
line systems and monitoring
 
05:34:11.230 --> 05:34:11.240 align:start position:0%
Wells let me tell you they all
 
05:34:14.670 --> 05:34:14.680 align:start position:0%
leak and we don't the last thing that we
 
05:34:17.670 --> 05:34:17.680 align:start position:0%
need is another landfill when we don't
 
05:34:19.510 --> 05:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
need the capacity and we're going to
 
05:34:23.030 --> 05:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:25.430 --> 05:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
problem the third thing is the change in
 
05:34:28.868 --> 05:34:28.878 align:start position:0%
the updating of the dees
 
05:34:28.878 --> 05:34:30.830 align:start position:0%
the updating of the dees
rules

05:34:30.830 --> 05:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
rules
 
05:34:32.948 --> 05:34:32.958 align:start position:0%
nobody that I talk to anywhere in the
 
05:34:34.548 --> 05:34:34.558 align:start position:0%
state can tell me when was the last time
 
05:34:37.390 --> 05:34:37.400 align:start position:0%
we had a new landfill most of them are
 
05:34:40.310 --> 05:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
organically grown from dumps that that
 
05:34:42.548 --> 05:34:42.558 align:start position:0%
somebody Acquired and grew we haven't
 
05:34:47.510 --> 05:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
had a Greenfield landfill in in anyone's
 
05:34:49.868 --> 05:34:49.878 align:start position:0%
memory we should at least make sure
 
05:34:51.948 --> 05:34:51.958 align:start position:0%
before we ever have another new landfill
 
05:34:54.830 --> 05:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
we are using the latest rules the
 
05:34:58.750 --> 05:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
tightest possible regulations to protect
 
05:35:00.590 --> 05:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
our resources and our
 
05:35:00.600 --> 05:35:03.150 align:start position:0%
our resources and our
people

05:35:03.150 --> 05:35:03.160 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:35:06.110 --> 05:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
fourth new tougher regulatory standards
 
05:35:08.628 --> 05:35:08.638 align:start position:0%
are under review for forever chemicals
 
05:35:11.548 --> 05:35:11.558 align:start position:0%
pasas which are abundantly present in
 
05:35:14.470 --> 05:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
every bit of the luche that gets
 
05:35:17.230 --> 05:35:17.240 align:start position:0%
produced top toxic chemicals are one of
 
05:35:19.390 --> 05:35:19.400 align:start position:0%
the reasons landfilling is at the very
 
05:35:23.470 --> 05:35:23.480 align:start position:0%
bottom of the state's Solid Waste
 
05:35:26.670 --> 05:35:26.680 align:start position:0%
hierarchy we we make beautiful
 
05:35:28.948 --> 05:35:28.958 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint slides that say here's the
 
05:35:31.948 --> 05:35:31.958 align:start position:0%
hierarchy and at the very bottom tip the
 
05:35:34.390 --> 05:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
last thing the the the the the move of
 
05:35:37.150 --> 05:35:37.160 align:start position:0%
Last Resort is to create a
 
05:35:39.750 --> 05:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
landfill and then our behavior is the
 
05:35:42.868 --> 05:35:42.878 align:start position:0%
exact inverse the first thing we do is
 
05:35:44.750 --> 05:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
we've got a capacity problem let's
 
05:35:47.190 --> 05:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
either expand or let's add a new
 
05:35:51.230 --> 05:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
one what are we doing now is the time to
 
05:35:51.240 --> 05:35:52.350 align:start position:0%
one what are we doing now is the time to
change

05:35:52.350 --> 05:35:52.360 align:start position:0%
change
 
05:35:54.590 --> 05:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
direction the last item I want to talk
 
05:35:55.548 --> 05:35:55.558 align:start position:0%
to you
 
05:35:58.470 --> 05:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
about is that the overarching problem
 
05:36:00.270 --> 05:36:00.280 align:start position:0%
taxing New Hampshire Sol ID waste
 
05:36:02.548 --> 05:36:02.558 align:start position:0%
management system is the unlimited
 
05:36:05.150 --> 05:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
importation of outof State waste by
 
05:36:05.160 --> 05:36:06.150 align:start position:0%
importation of outof State waste by
private

05:36:06.150 --> 05:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
private
 
05:36:08.708 --> 05:36:08.718 align:start position:0%
operators everything else pales in
 
05:36:14.230 --> 05:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
comparison to that whether it's 40%
 
05:36:16.670 --> 05:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
50% if we keep on the track that we're
 
05:36:19.150 --> 05:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
going it's going to be 60% there's no
 
05:36:21.990 --> 05:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
stopping it and to my understanding Dees
 
05:36:23.708 --> 05:36:23.718 align:start position:0%
has no control over that they can't
 
05:36:26.868 --> 05:36:26.878 align:start position:0%
limit it we are letting private
 
05:36:30.070 --> 05:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
operators dictate our solid waste
 
05:36:33.868 --> 05:36:33.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:38.750 --> 05:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
obscene I do not blame Dees it has taken
 
05:36:42.310 --> 05:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
an executive branch a legislative branch
 
05:36:43.750 --> 05:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
and the Department of Environmental
 
05:36:46.350 --> 05:36:46.360 align:start position:0%
Services to get us where we are
 
05:36:49.430 --> 05:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
today but guess what we can fix all of
 
05:36:53.470 --> 05:36:53.480 align:start position:0%
that Dees cannot do that alone they
 
05:36:56.830 --> 05:36:56.840 align:start position:0%
cannot fix the aate waste problem but
 
05:36:56.840 --> 05:36:58.190 align:start position:0%
cannot fix the aate waste problem but
you

05:36:58.190 --> 05:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:37:01.190 --> 05:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
can there are bills coming your way
 
05:37:04.310 --> 05:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
there are actions we can take this pause
 
05:37:07.510 --> 05:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
is so important because if we don't
 
05:37:09.708 --> 05:37:09.718 align:start position:0%
pause the risk is that we're going to
 
05:37:13.270 --> 05:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
let another private operator open a new
 
05:37:16.788 --> 05:37:16.798 align:start position:0%
landfill and guess what we are going to
 
05:37:19.788 --> 05:37:19.798 align:start position:0%
institutionalize out ofate waste for
 
05:37:23.390 --> 05:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
decades and decades to
 
05:37:26.110 --> 05:37:26.120 align:start position:0%
come and while you guys go off and look
 
05:37:27.590 --> 05:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
at other things and a million other
 
05:37:28.910 --> 05:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
bills and you've got all kinds of
 
05:37:28.920 --> 05:37:31.190 align:start position:0%
bills and you've got all kinds of
priorities

05:37:31.190 --> 05:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
priorities
 
05:37:32.750 --> 05:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
people in the North country are going to
 
05:37:35.230 --> 05:37:35.240 align:start position:0%
have to live with that
 
05:37:37.430 --> 05:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
decision and it won't be
 
05:37:40.310 --> 05:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
me it'll be the next generation and the
 
05:37:42.628 --> 05:37:42.638 align:start position:0%
generation after that that will not get
 
05:37:42.638 --> 05:37:43.430 align:start position:0%
generation after that that will not get
to

05:37:43.430 --> 05:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:37:46.070 --> 05:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
experience the
 
05:37:49.628 --> 05:37:49.638 align:start position:0%
Beauty and the environment and all those
 
05:37:51.350 --> 05:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
things that make New Hampshire New
 
05:37:53.670 --> 05:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it's why our out of our
 
05:37:55.628 --> 05:37:55.638 align:start position:0%
outdoor recreation industry is
 
05:37:58.510 --> 05:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely booming it's why people want
 
05:38:01.150 --> 05:38:01.160 align:start position:0%
to come here
 
05:38:04.310 --> 05:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
now is exactly the time to pause to
 
05:38:07.910 --> 05:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
focus to seek both Technical and policy
 
05:38:10.868 --> 05:38:10.878 align:start position:0%
solutions to ensure that if and when we
 
05:38:13.948 --> 05:38:13.958 align:start position:0%
actually do need another landfill by God
 
05:38:15.670 --> 05:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
we get it
 
05:38:18.270 --> 05:38:18.280 align:start position:0%
right we're not ready to do that now
 
05:38:20.310 --> 05:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
Dees is not in a
 
05:38:22.948 --> 05:38:22.958 align:start position:0%
position to make the kind of
 
05:38:25.310 --> 05:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
decisions that reflect a 100-year
 
05:38:26.548 --> 05:38:26.558 align:start position:0%
commitment that that one of these
 
05:38:28.510 --> 05:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
landfills ends up
 
05:38:28.520 --> 05:38:30.390 align:start position:0%
landfills ends up
being

05:38:30.390 --> 05:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
being
 
05:38:32.350 --> 05:38:32.360 align:start position:0%
I know this sounds like a radical
 
05:38:34.430 --> 05:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
proposal to
 
05:38:36.948 --> 05:38:36.958 align:start position:0%
pause but sometimes that's what you need
 
05:38:39.590 --> 05:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
to get perspective and
 
05:38:41.910 --> 05:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
focus and the people of New Hampshire
 
05:38:41.920 --> 05:38:44.030 align:start position:0%
focus and the people of New Hampshire
deserve

05:38:44.030 --> 05:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
deserve
 
05:38:46.190 --> 05:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
that again I will
 
05:38:49.590 --> 05:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
say I'm not anti-b business I spent my
 
05:38:51.788 --> 05:38:51.798 align:start position:0%
entire life with a working in Fortune
 
05:38:55.350 --> 05:38:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:57.750 --> 05:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
business but the businesses I want to
 
05:39:00.150 --> 05:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
support are the restaurants and the
 
05:39:03.590 --> 05:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
shops and the breweries and all those
 
05:39:07.110 --> 05:39:07.120 align:start position:0%
businesses that are doing well in our
 
05:39:10.150 --> 05:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
state and one landfill puts all of that
 
05:39:10.160 --> 05:39:11.190 align:start position:0%
state and one landfill puts all of that
at

05:39:11.190 --> 05:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
at
 
05:39:14.990 --> 05:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
risk particularly one that we don't need
 
05:39:18.750 --> 05:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
and one that will serve the needs of
 
05:39:21.070 --> 05:39:21.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts as much or more than it
 
05:39:23.430 --> 05:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
will the people of New
 
05:39:28.070 --> 05:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire please please vote ought to
 
05:39:30.990 --> 05:39:31.000 align:start position:0%
pass and support this
 
05:39:35.070 --> 05:39:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:38.310 --> 05:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
questions any questions from the

by environmental health issues to build
 
05:40:24.868 --> 05:40:24.878 align:start position:0%
local power and take aim at polluters we
 
05:40:26.590 --> 05:40:26.600 align:start position:0%
partner with people from communities who
 
05:40:28.590 --> 05:40:28.600 align:start position:0%
are most impacted by environmental

problems whether we're talking about

leaking landfills or P Fass in your
 
05:40:35.670 --> 05:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
water and we train folks from all walks

make change in their neighborhoods and
 
05:40:42.910 --> 05:40:42.920 align:start position:0%
Beyond We join leaders together to build
 
05:40:44.868 --> 05:40:44.878 align:start position:0%
powerful Statewide Regional and National
 
05:40:47.310 --> 05:40:47.320 align:start position:0%

Community leaders from from across the

state to testify in support of hb1 1620
 
05:41:06.830 --> 05:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
to put a moratorium or a pause on new
 
05:41:09.030 --> 05:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
landfill permits until
 
05:41:12.948 --> 05:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
2031 we really owe it all uh to Granite
 
05:41:15.070 --> 05:41:15.080 align:start position:0%
we all owe it to Granite State residents
 
05:41:17.110 --> 05:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
to think carefully about our waste
 
05:41:19.310 --> 05:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
management and our landfill s sighting
 
05:41:22.590 --> 05:41:22.600 align:start position:0%
practices before we rush head first into
 
05:41:24.910 --> 05:41:24.920 align:start position:0%
a commitment that is going to affect
 
05:41:27.270 --> 05:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
generations to come and as folks in my
 
05:41:29.468 --> 05:41:29.478 align:start position:0%
generation say we are not ready to
 
05:41:31.670 --> 05:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
define the relationship with landfill
 
05:41:34.110 --> 05:41:34.120 align:start position:0%
sighting yet in New
 
05:41:36.830 --> 05:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we know that all landfills
 
05:41:38.990 --> 05:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
leak discharging lee8 into the
 
05:41:41.030 --> 05:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
surrounding soils where this garbage
 
05:41:43.510 --> 05:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
juice can travel with really concerning
 
05:41:45.948 --> 05:41:45.958 align:start position:0%
speed and when you sight landfills on
 
05:41:48.628 --> 05:41:48.638 align:start position:0%
porous or otherwise unsuitable terrain
 
05:41:50.548 --> 05:41:50.558 align:start position:0%
this toxic leech a can contaminate
 
05:41:52.708 --> 05:41:52.718 align:start position:0%
Community water sources before our
 
05:41:54.788 --> 05:41:54.798 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Agencies as hard as they
 
05:41:57.910 --> 05:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
might try have a chance to respond and I
 
05:41:59.910 --> 05:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
know from my line of work that after
 
05:42:02.230 --> 05:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
seeping through these piles of waste
 
05:42:04.990 --> 05:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
leate can be carrying lead and arsenic
 
05:42:07.468 --> 05:42:07.478 align:start position:0%
heavy metals and toxic forever chemicals
 
05:42:10.310 --> 05:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
like pasas all of which are huge Public
 
05:42:12.750 --> 05:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
public health concerns we know that
 
05:42:15.708 --> 05:42:15.718 align:start position:0%
pasas alone are associated with Cancers
 
05:42:18.350 --> 05:42:18.360 align:start position:0%
with reproductive disorders and serious
 
05:42:20.830 --> 05:42:20.840 align:start position:0%
developmental problems so it's clear
 
05:42:23.190 --> 05:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
that whenever we have the opportunity we
 
05:42:25.548 --> 05:42:25.558 align:start position:0%
need to be preventing their
 
05:42:28.708 --> 05:42:28.718 align:start position:0%
spread as you've heard in Prior comments
 
05:42:32.270 --> 05:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
landfill sighting is a high stakes game
 
05:42:34.990 --> 05:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
and there are corporate polluters out
 
05:42:37.110 --> 05:42:37.120 align:start position:0%
there who are pushing for permit
 
05:42:40.670 --> 05:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
approvals that would have us all gamble
 
05:42:43.548 --> 05:42:43.558 align:start position:0%
with people's lives so I'm asking you
 
05:42:46.070 --> 05:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
all instead of making hasty decisions
 
05:42:49.150 --> 05:42:49.160 align:start position:0%
that sacrifice the health of our most
 
05:42:52.350 --> 05:42:52.360 align:start position:0%
vulnerable towns we need to take this
 
05:42:55.548 --> 05:42:55.558 align:start position:0%
pause we need to be actively reducing
 
05:42:58.070 --> 05:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
our Solid Waste production in accordance
 
05:42:59.910 --> 05:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
with this zero waste TI
 
05:43:01.910 --> 05:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
and we need to prevent further
 
05:43:03.590 --> 05:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
devastating pollution we don't want
 
05:43:05.390 --> 05:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
another Claremont we don't want another
 
05:43:08.070 --> 05:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
miramac we don't want another Bethlehem
 
05:43:11.150 --> 05:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
we really really need to take this pause
 
05:43:13.350 --> 05:43:13.360 align:start position:0%
so I'll just end by saying we know that
 
05:43:16.430 --> 05:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
now is not the time to play games with
 
05:43:18.788 --> 05:43:18.798 align:start position:0%
our future and so I'm urging you all to
 
05:43:21.868 --> 05:43:21.878 align:start position:0%
vote a to pass on 1620 to ensure a
 
05:43:24.230 --> 05:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
thriving future for all the generations
 
05:43:26.548 --> 05:43:26.558 align:start position:0%
to come thank you so much for your time
 
05:43:28.030 --> 05:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take
 
05:43:28.040 --> 05:43:30.110 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take
questions

05:43:30.110 --> 05:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:43:34.590 --> 05:43:34.600 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
05:43:52.750 --> 05:43:52.760 align:start position:0%

vice president of public policy for the

business and industry Association we
 
05:44:04.788 --> 05:44:04.798 align:start position:0%
serve as New Hampshire Statewide Chamber
 
05:44:06.390 --> 05:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
of Commerce and represent hundreds of
 
05:44:08.230 --> 05:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
businesses in the state of New
 
05:44:10.750 --> 05:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm here today to express
 
05:44:13.270 --> 05:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
bia's opposition to House Bill
 
05:44:16.150 --> 05:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
1620 as established by bia's public
 
05:44:18.030 --> 05:44:18.040 align:start position:0%
policy priorities we support
 
05:44:19.868 --> 05:44:19.878 align:start position:0%
science-based environmental policies
 
05:44:21.670 --> 05:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
that balance Economic Development with
 
05:44:23.910 --> 05:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
the long-term sustainability of the
 
05:44:25.830 --> 05:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
state's natural
 
05:44:28.390 --> 05:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
resources baia has concerns regarding
 
05:44:30.750 --> 05:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
house bills 1620 because we believe this
 
05:44:32.948 --> 05:44:32.958 align:start position:0%
proposal fails to strike the delicate
 
05:44:34.628 --> 05:44:34.638 align:start position:0%
balance between allowing for economic
 
05:44:37.390 --> 05:44:37.400 align:start position:0%
development and Environmental Protection
 
05:44:40.868 --> 05:44:40.878 align:start position:0%
firstly We Believe House Bill 1620 is
 
05:44:43.070 --> 05:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
unnecessary the solid waste rules are
 
05:44:44.590 --> 05:44:44.600 align:start position:0%
currently already in the process of
 
05:44:45.910 --> 05:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
being updated by the New Hampshire
 
05:44:47.948 --> 05:44:47.958 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services and
 
05:44:50.910 --> 05:44:50.920 align:start position:0%
are slated to be done this year further
 
05:44:53.270 --> 05:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
we're concerned that the year 2031 has
 
05:44:55.948 --> 05:44:55.958 align:start position:0%
been arbitrarily determined and is an
 
05:44:57.990 --> 05:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
unreasonably long timeline for a
 
05:45:01.670 --> 05:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
moratorium un Land Fill permits second
 
05:45:04.510 --> 05:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
the landfill permitting sighting process
 
05:45:06.350 --> 05:45:06.360 align:start position:0%
and development process takes years to
 
05:45:08.190 --> 05:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
complete for my discussions with
 
05:45:10.190 --> 05:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
technical experts they've estimated this
 
05:45:12.430 --> 05:45:12.440 align:start position:0%
process takes about 6 to 10 years if all
 
05:45:14.628 --> 05:45:14.638 align:start position:0%
goes smoothly which we know from recent
 
05:45:16.590 --> 05:45:16.600 align:start position:0%
experience has been a
 
05:45:18.830 --> 05:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
challenge um I'd also like to address
 
05:45:21.750 --> 05:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
line five um in the bill uh there was
 
05:45:23.628 --> 05:45:23.638 align:start position:0%
discussion about this earlier about Dees
 
05:45:26.910 --> 05:45:26.920 align:start position:0%
will accept and investigate permits uh
 
05:45:29.708 --> 05:45:29.718 align:start position:0%
applications during the moratorium time
 
05:45:31.430 --> 05:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
this line does not alleviate our
 
05:45:34.190 --> 05:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
concerns because it basically allows for
 
05:45:35.990 --> 05:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
applications to be held while the goal
 
05:45:37.990 --> 05:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
post is moved whether it's through rules
 
05:45:40.910 --> 05:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
or legislation if passed we believe this
 
05:45:42.390 --> 05:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
bill could ultimately result in a
 
05:45:44.910 --> 05:45:44.920 align:start position:0%
shortage of instate disposal capacity
 
05:45:46.390 --> 05:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
resulting in New Hampshire generated
 
05:45:48.030 --> 05:45:48.040 align:start position:0%
solid Wass having to be shipped out of
 
05:45:50.868 --> 05:45:50.878 align:start position:0%
state for disposal and these existing
 
05:45:53.868 --> 05:45:53.878 align:start position:0%
landfills cannot expand
 
05:45:55.708 --> 05:45:55.718 align:start position:0%
exponentially not only is this
 
05:45:57.548 --> 05:45:57.558 align:start position:0%
problematic for the solid waste industry
 
05:45:58.910 --> 05:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
but we believe these changes will have
 
05:46:00.990 --> 05:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
negative consequences and exponentially
 
05:46:02.468 --> 05:46:02.478 align:start position:0%
increase the cost of her business in
 
05:46:04.628 --> 05:46:04.638 align:start position:0%
every industry throughout New Hampshire
 
05:46:06.548 --> 05:46:06.558 align:start position:0%
additionally shipping waste out of state
 
05:46:08.390 --> 05:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
has unended consequences such as
 
05:46:09.948 --> 05:46:09.958 align:start position:0%
dramatically increasing the carbon
 
05:46:11.990 --> 05:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
footprint associated with instate
 
05:46:14.830 --> 05:46:14.840 align:start position:0%
generated waste disposal this is one of
 
05:46:16.310 --> 05:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
the many reasons that are completely
 
05:46:18.868 --> 05:46:18.878 align:start position:0%
contrary to the both federal and state
 
05:46:20.510 --> 05:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
carbon reduction goals and should be a
 
05:46:23.350 --> 05:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
primary reason not to pass this bill in
 
05:46:25.468 --> 05:46:25.478 align:start position:0%
conclusion bi respectfully requests the
 
05:46:27.190 --> 05:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
committee to vote inexpedient to
 
05:46:29.430 --> 05:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
legislate on House Bill 162
 
05:46:30.948 --> 05:46:30.958 align:start position:0%
because if passed the bill would be
 
05:46:32.430 --> 05:46:32.440 align:start position:0%
damaging to New Hampshire's business
 
05:46:34.910 --> 05:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
climate future Economic Development and
 
05:46:37.030 --> 05:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
could also result in in unintended
 
05:46:38.788 --> 05:46:38.798 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts as affordable
 
05:46:41.190 --> 05:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
instate disposal capacity becomes more
 
05:46:43.510 --> 05:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
scarce thank you for your consideration
 
05:46:45.948 --> 05:46:45.958 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to try to answer any
 
05:46:49.670 --> 05:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Miss cotch um I'm
 
05:46:51.468 --> 05:46:51.478 align:start position:0%
interested to know if
 
05:46:56.350 --> 05:46:56.360 align:start position:0%
Bia would find um a
 
05:47:00.270 --> 05:47:00.280 align:start position:0%
lesser pause acceptable I mean if it
 
05:47:00.280 --> 05:47:01.948 align:start position:0%
lesser pause acceptable I mean if it
wasn't

05:47:01.948 --> 05:47:01.958 align:start position:0%
wasn't
 
05:47:07.070 --> 05:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
2031 would you would Bia be amable to
 
05:47:09.110 --> 05:47:09.120 align:start position:0%
something like you know
 
05:47:12.310 --> 05:47:12.320 align:start position:0%
2028 something like that in so far as I
 
05:47:14.510 --> 05:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
mean we've heard testimonies saying that
 
05:47:16.070 --> 05:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
you know we've got a lot of things going
 
05:47:19.230 --> 05:47:19.240 align:start position:0%
on we've got rules being developed we've
 
05:47:22.350 --> 05:47:22.360 align:start position:0%
got uh issues with certain landfills
 
05:47:25.230 --> 05:47:25.240 align:start position:0%
maybe we just really need to step back
 
05:47:28.990 --> 05:47:29.000 align:start position:0%
and assess what's going on what we might
 
05:47:33.910 --> 05:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
need in terms of policy and so forth
 
05:47:36.990 --> 05:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
um what what's your thought on that
 
05:47:39.110 --> 05:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question Madam chair I
 
05:47:40.750 --> 05:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
believe that of course a shorter
 
05:47:43.468 --> 05:47:43.478 align:start position:0%
moratorium would be a modest Improvement
 
05:47:46.270 --> 05:47:46.280 align:start position:0%
but with rule changes you know being
 
05:47:48.030 --> 05:47:48.040 align:start position:0%
updated this year already I'm not sure
 
05:47:49.990 --> 05:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
if it's
 
05:47:56.310 --> 05:47:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:59.350 --> 05:47:59.360 align:start position:0%
Penza I have two questions um first
 
05:48:03.948 --> 05:48:03.958 align:start position:0%
question um has the Bia um read the the
 
05:48:06.628 --> 05:48:06.638 align:start position:0%
report the final report for the study of
 
05:48:08.310 --> 05:48:08.320 align:start position:0%
unlimited service area permits for land
 
05:48:10.708 --> 05:48:10.718 align:start position:0%
Sills out of waste thank you for the
 
05:48:13.350 --> 05:48:13.360 align:start position:0%
question I've reviewed it
 
05:48:16.350 --> 05:48:16.360 align:start position:0%
briefly so then my second um question
 
05:48:19.390 --> 05:48:19.400 align:start position:0%
would be how can you say that the bill
 
05:48:21.788 --> 05:48:21.798 align:start position:0%
could cause a capacity issue when the
 
05:48:23.150 --> 05:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
state says
 
05:48:25.750 --> 05:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise I think we're under the belief
 
05:48:27.910 --> 05:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
that you know if it takes 6 to 10 years
 
05:48:30.230 --> 05:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
to permit and and we're concerned about
 
05:48:33.910 --> 05:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
capacity starting in 2034 then you know
 
05:48:38.548 --> 05:48:38.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:42.510 --> 05:48:42.520 align:start position:0%
there okay thank you um representative
 
05:48:45.270 --> 05:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you madam chair um I have
 
05:48:47.628 --> 05:48:47.638 align:start position:0%
two questions too first of all um you
 
05:48:50.310 --> 05:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
know the the Bia is probably concerned
 
05:48:52.270 --> 05:48:52.280 align:start position:0%
with job generation and do you do you
 
05:48:55.150 --> 05:48:55.160 align:start position:0%
anticipate that that more that building
 
05:48:58.750 --> 05:48:58.760 align:start position:0%
the these anticipated um uh landfill
 
05:49:00.868 --> 05:49:00.878 align:start position:0%
would create jobs or what what is the
 
05:49:03.910 --> 05:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
business opportunity in building more
 
05:49:06.150 --> 05:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
landfills thank you for the question
 
05:49:07.590 --> 05:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
well I represent the greater business
 
05:49:09.310 --> 05:49:09.320 align:start position:0%
community so I can't specifically
 
05:49:11.830 --> 05:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
discuss um you know what the solid waste
 
05:49:14.270 --> 05:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
industry is looking for here but of
 
05:49:15.990 --> 05:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
course it would generate more
 
05:49:19.350 --> 05:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
jobs and my second question is uh
 
05:49:21.310 --> 05:49:21.320 align:start position:0%
regarding science you say you use
 
05:49:23.628 --> 05:49:23.638 align:start position:0%
science-based um information to make
 
05:49:25.628 --> 05:49:25.638 align:start position:0%
your decisions
 
05:49:29.390 --> 05:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
um uh Could you um sort of explain where
 
05:49:31.510 --> 05:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
you know what scientific body you're
 
05:49:34.270 --> 05:49:34.280 align:start position:0%
using to to determine these things thank
 
05:49:36.270 --> 05:49:36.280 align:start position:0%
you for the question um I believe I said
 
05:49:41.548 --> 05:49:41.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:44.590 --> 05:49:44.600 align:start position:0%
policy um in communicating with uh
 
05:49:46.350 --> 05:49:46.360 align:start position:0%
technical experts within our membership
 
05:49:46.360 --> 05:49:48.110 align:start position:0%
technical experts within our membership
environmental

05:49:48.110 --> 05:49:48.120 align:start position:0%
environmental
 
05:49:51.270 --> 05:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
experts representative German thank you
 
05:49:53.110 --> 05:49:53.120 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:49:56.590 --> 05:49:56.600 align:start position:0%
question uh I'm a college professor true
 
05:49:59.190 --> 05:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
to form I'm going to be pedantic about
 
05:50:02.190 --> 05:50:02.200 align:start position:0%
uh about the letter here uh you indicate
 
05:50:04.030 --> 05:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
uh we believe these these changes will
 
05:50:06.190 --> 05:50:06.200 align:start position:0%
have negative consequences and
 
05:50:08.270 --> 05:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
exponentially increased costs for
 
05:50:11.708 --> 05:50:11.718 align:start position:0%
businesses in every industry uh um so
 
05:50:13.350 --> 05:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
leaving aside for a moment the actual
 
05:50:15.310 --> 05:50:15.320 align:start position:0%
technical definition of
 
05:50:18.628 --> 05:50:18.638 align:start position:0%
exponential I'm assuming this is a more
 
05:50:22.150 --> 05:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
um a less precise term meaning just
 
05:50:24.430 --> 05:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
rapid as opposed to literally
 
05:50:27.190 --> 05:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
exponential but can you tell us this
 
05:50:28.750 --> 05:50:28.760 align:start position:0%
goes a little bit to repres resentative
 
05:50:30.788 --> 05:50:30.798 align:start position:0%
Howard's question how you've determined
 
05:50:33.510 --> 05:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
that have you run models what specific
 
05:50:35.430 --> 05:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
data do you have that you could provide
 
05:50:37.430 --> 05:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
the committee that would demonstrate
 
05:50:40.670 --> 05:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
that there would be a rapid large
 
05:50:43.750 --> 05:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
increase in costs to Industry throughout
 
05:50:46.948 --> 05:50:46.958 align:start position:0%
the state thank you for the question um
 
05:50:48.510 --> 05:50:48.520 align:start position:0%
this information is anecdotal from our
 
05:50:51.030 --> 05:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
members we know that if they have to pay
 
05:50:53.070 --> 05:50:53.080 align:start position:0%
to send their waste out of state for
 
05:50:54.910 --> 05:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
disposal that's going to cost more the
 
05:50:56.150 --> 05:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
further they have to send it if they're
 
05:50:58.708 --> 05:50:58.718 align:start position:0%
shipping their waste to Ohio for
 
05:51:00.628 --> 05:51:00.638 align:start position:0%
disposal that's going to cost more than
 
05:51:03.548 --> 05:51:03.558 align:start position:0%
keeping it in state thank
 
05:51:06.750 --> 05:51:06.760 align:start position:0%
you representative Bixby yeah just to
 
05:51:09.310 --> 05:51:09.320 align:start position:0%
follow up on the the question of jobs um
 
05:51:13.670 --> 05:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if in the uh process of
 
05:51:16.270 --> 05:51:16.280 align:start position:0%
looking at the the the employment
 
05:51:19.390 --> 05:51:19.400 align:start position:0%
prospects for the North Country uh as
 
05:51:22.030 --> 05:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
the result of a you know either having
 
05:51:24.590 --> 05:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
another landfill up there or not uh
 
05:51:27.628 --> 05:51:27.638 align:start position:0%
would the landfills provided by the by
 
05:51:30.548 --> 05:51:30.558 align:start position:0%
would the jobs provided by the landfill
 
05:51:33.590 --> 05:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh offset the potential loss of jobs in
 
05:51:35.150 --> 05:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
the tourism
 
05:51:37.468 --> 05:51:37.478 align:start position:0%
industry thank you for the question I I
 
05:51:39.070 --> 05:51:39.080 align:start position:0%
think it's a a good question to look
 
05:51:41.788 --> 05:51:41.798 align:start position:0%
into but I I don't have the answer
 
05:51:44.390 --> 05:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
representative Murray um thank you um
 
05:51:45.948 --> 05:51:45.958 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question so
 
05:51:48.230 --> 05:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
my other question to you around jobs
 
05:51:50.030 --> 05:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
would be is is there not the potential
 
05:51:52.590 --> 05:51:52.600 align:start position:0%
for other if if this bill were to go
 
05:51:54.230 --> 05:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
forward is there a potential for other
 
05:51:57.708 --> 05:51:57.718 align:start position:0%
jobs in in ancel ancillary Industries uh
 
05:51:58.830 --> 05:51:58.840 align:start position:0%
to maybe
 
05:52:00.510 --> 05:52:00.520 align:start position:0%
uh be developed or come alive as a
 
05:52:04.190 --> 05:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
result of a pause and a refocus on some
 
05:52:06.468 --> 05:52:06.478 align:start position:0%
other areas that might be around
 
05:52:08.948 --> 05:52:08.958 align:start position:0%
recycling efforts or some other types of
 
05:52:11.030 --> 05:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
um related things that would more
 
05:52:13.910 --> 05:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
comport to our waste disposal hierarchy
 
05:52:15.190 --> 05:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and I would
 
05:52:18.468 --> 05:52:18.478 align:start position:0%
say certainly um our sub our opposition
 
05:52:20.670 --> 05:52:20.680 align:start position:0%
here is not just about jobs though it's
 
05:52:23.030 --> 05:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
about Economic Development and and the
 
05:52:25.350 --> 05:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
ability for businesses to thrive in New
 
05:52:27.230 --> 05:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so it's not limited to just
 
05:52:27.240 --> 05:52:30.390 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so it's not limited to just
that

05:52:30.390 --> 05:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:33.708 --> 05:52:33.718 align:start position:0%
um interested to know excuse
 
05:52:36.750 --> 05:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
me how did you get to the number that it
 
05:52:40.310 --> 05:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
takes six to 10 years to permit a new
 
05:52:42.990 --> 05:52:43.000 align:start position:0%
landfill um in discussions with our
 
05:52:44.548 --> 05:52:44.558 align:start position:0%
technical experts and our membership
 
05:52:45.990 --> 05:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
environmental experts we're talking
 
05:52:47.750 --> 05:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
about you know from the beginning of the
 
05:52:49.310 --> 05:52:49.320 align:start position:0%
application process to the actual
 
05:52:51.868 --> 05:52:51.878 align:start position:0%
development of a landfill is that
 
05:52:55.390 --> 05:52:55.400 align:start position:0%
something that um a number that you
 
05:52:58.350 --> 05:52:58.360 align:start position:0%
have also verified with Department of
 
05:52:58.360 --> 05:52:59.510 align:start position:0%
have also verified with Department of
Environmental

05:52:59.510 --> 05:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
Environmental
 
05:53:01.750 --> 05:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
Services I have not spoken them with
 
05:53:03.350 --> 05:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
them directly about verifying that
 
05:53:04.868 --> 05:53:04.878 align:start position:0%
number but I'm sure they could attest to
 
05:53:06.468 --> 05:53:06.478 align:start position:0%
that in their
 
05:53:08.590 --> 05:53:08.600 align:start position:0%
testimony okay I don't see any other
 
05:53:11.468 --> 05:53:11.478 align:start position:0%
pink cards so I don't
 
05:53:14.830 --> 05:53:14.840 align:start position:0%
know um
 
05:53:18.390 --> 05:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
okay representative Murray um yes thank
 
05:53:20.110 --> 05:53:20.120 align:start position:0%
you I I did have one other question or
 
05:53:22.868 --> 05:53:22.878 align:start position:0%
comment could you speak to I there are
 
05:53:25.270 --> 05:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
currently situations in where um some of
 
05:53:27.708 --> 05:53:27.718 align:start position:0%
our waste is already disposed of out of
 
05:53:30.270 --> 05:53:30.280 align:start position:0%
state for various Natures if it it's a
 
05:53:32.150 --> 05:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
toxic substance or some other entity
 
05:53:33.390 --> 05:53:33.400 align:start position:0%
where we don't deal with that in the
 
05:53:36.350 --> 05:53:36.360 align:start position:0%
state which portion are are you
 
05:53:38.310 --> 05:53:38.320 align:start position:0%
referring to where there would be an
 
05:53:41.270 --> 05:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
increase in out of state
 
05:53:43.628 --> 05:53:43.638 align:start position:0%
disposal thank you for the question I I
 
05:53:45.230 --> 05:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
think the scenaria I'm referring to in
 
05:53:47.548 --> 05:53:47.558 align:start position:0%
that situation would be if if we no
 
05:53:49.110 --> 05:53:49.120 align:start position:0%
longer had enough capacity in New
 
05:53:51.030 --> 05:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and had to dispose of our
 
05:53:53.350 --> 05:53:53.360 align:start position:0%
waste then out of
 
05:53:57.070 --> 05:53:57.080 align:start position:0%
state thank you any other
 
05:54:00.190 --> 05:54:00.200 align:start position:0%
questions representative Bixby yes do
 
05:54:02.670 --> 05:54:02.680 align:start position:0%
you know if your experts took into
 
05:54:06.430 --> 05:54:06.440 align:start position:0%
account in their assessment of timing uh
 
05:54:10.270 --> 05:54:10.280 align:start position:0%
the fact that Dees does not permit
 
05:54:13.948 --> 05:54:13.958 align:start position:0%
Beyond a certain date uh simply because
 
05:54:16.468 --> 05:54:16.478 align:start position:0%
it is their policy to have uh end dates
 
05:54:18.868 --> 05:54:18.878 align:start position:0%
on permits but the permit does that end
 
05:54:21.430 --> 05:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
date does not imply that there is not
 
05:54:23.468 --> 05:54:23.478 align:start position:0%
future capacity it's just the end date
 
05:54:26.150 --> 05:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
of a particular permit and that permits
 
05:54:30.628 --> 05:54:30.638 align:start position:0%
can be and are renewed on a regular
 
05:54:37.030 --> 05:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:39.270 --> 05:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
years I'm not sure I understand the
 
05:54:41.868 --> 05:54:41.878 align:start position:0%
question okay so uh
 
05:54:45.590 --> 05:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
Dees has a cycle of Permitting and the
 
05:54:49.390 --> 05:54:49.400 align:start position:0%
fact and they uh what the when they say
 
05:54:52.070 --> 05:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
our current permitted capacity is
 
05:54:56.510 --> 05:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
through such and such a date say uh
 
05:54:59.708 --> 05:54:59.718 align:start position:0%
2034 the fact that the permitted
 
05:55:03.830 --> 05:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
capacity is through 202 2034 doesn't
 
05:55:05.750 --> 05:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
mean that
 
05:55:08.628 --> 05:55:08.638 align:start position:0%
suddenly uh the landfills that are
 
05:55:11.430 --> 05:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
permitted no longer have capacity it's
 
05:55:13.030 --> 05:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
merely that they will need to renew
 
05:55:16.310 --> 05:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
their permits and that the capacity the
 
05:55:19.070 --> 05:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
actual capacity may be substantially
 
05:55:21.350 --> 05:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
higher in the future than what's
 
05:55:24.390 --> 05:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
reflected by the permitted capacity is
 
05:55:25.910 --> 05:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
that do your experts take that into
 
05:55:27.110 --> 05:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
account when they're looking at the
 
05:55:28.510 --> 05:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
potential of sending
 
05:55:30.990 --> 05:55:31.000 align:start position:0%
waste out of state well I think that's a
 
05:55:32.270 --> 05:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
accurate statement but we're just
 
05:55:35.190 --> 05:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
judging by what's approved right now
 
05:55:35.200 --> 05:55:36.270 align:start position:0%
judging by what's approved right now
thank

05:55:36.270 --> 05:55:36.280 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:55:38.910 --> 05:55:38.920 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:55:41.310 --> 05:55:41.320 align:start position:0%
Penza I have two questions first
 
05:55:43.948 --> 05:55:43.958 align:start position:0%
question is uh castella waste um
 
05:55:47.868 --> 05:55:47.878 align:start position:0%
management u a member of the Bia yes
 
05:55:51.830 --> 05:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
okay second question did the Bia go for
 
05:55:55.468 --> 05:55:55.478 align:start position:0%
example to um a current area for example
 
05:55:59.230 --> 05:55:59.240 align:start position:0%
Rochester or Bethlehem and then get all
 
05:56:02.030 --> 05:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
of those businesses on board with this
 
05:56:03.910 --> 05:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
and if so I'd love to have a list of
 
05:56:06.990 --> 05:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
that cuz I went up there in um talk to a
 
05:56:08.708 --> 05:56:08.718 align:start position:0%
lot of businesses and they are very much
 
05:56:11.628 --> 05:56:11.638 align:start position:0%
against a new landfill in their area
 
05:56:13.030 --> 05:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question we have a
 
05:56:14.830 --> 05:56:14.840 align:start position:0%
policy development process that goes for
 
05:56:16.948 --> 05:56:16.958 align:start position:0%
our policy advisory subcommittee made up
 
05:56:18.830 --> 05:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
of executive board members that's how we
 
05:56:20.390 --> 05:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
come to decisions on
 
05:56:23.548 --> 05:56:23.558 align:start position:0%
bills so you can't give specific
 
05:56:26.868 --> 05:56:26.878 align:start position:0%
businesses that support or don't support
 
05:56:28.830 --> 05:56:28.840 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
05:56:30.590 --> 05:56:30.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question it's it's
 
05:56:34.350 --> 05:56:34.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:36.510 --> 05:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee okay any other questions
 
05:56:37.788 --> 05:56:37.798 align:start position:0%
from the
 
05:56:40.310 --> 05:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
05:56:42.030 --> 05:56:42.040 align:start position:0%
much for coming and speaking with us
 
05:56:43.548 --> 05:56:43.558 align:start position:0%
this afternoon thank you for the
 
05:56:45.510 --> 05:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity I have no other pink cards
 
05:56:46.670 --> 05:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
but I
 
05:56:51.788 --> 05:56:51.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:54.190 --> 05:56:54.200 align:start position:0%
kerm and I'd like you to fill out a pink
 
05:56:56.948 --> 05:56:56.958 align:start position:0%
card if you get a chance please yes I
 
05:56:58.430 --> 05:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
actually sent one up to you and I don't
 
05:57:00.150 --> 05:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
know where it got to but I'm happy to
 
05:57:03.468 --> 05:57:03.478 align:start position:0%
fill out another one I gave it to me the
 
05:57:05.548 --> 05:57:05.558 align:start position:0%
no I get it was for the other bill but I
 
05:57:08.468 --> 05:57:08.478 align:start position:0%
didn't see one for this
 
05:57:11.510 --> 05:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
one did it get
 
05:57:14.350 --> 05:57:14.360 align:start position:0%
lost no problem I can fill out another
 
05:57:14.360 --> 05:57:21.190 align:start position:0%
lost no problem I can fill out another
one

05:57:21.190 --> 05:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:24.150 --> 05:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
all you're on okay thank you for the
 
05:57:26.990 --> 05:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
record my name is Sarah U huskar and I'm
 
05:57:28.510 --> 05:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
the assistant director of the waste
 
05:57:30.230 --> 05:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
management division at New Hampshire
 
05:57:32.510 --> 05:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
Dees and this is leam McKenna
 
05:57:33.868 --> 05:57:33.878 align:start position:0%
administrator of the solid waste
 
05:57:36.230 --> 05:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
management Bureau thank you for the
 
05:57:39.830 --> 05:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify on House Bill
 
05:57:43.310 --> 05:57:43.320 align:start position:0%
1620 Dees opposes this bill because it
 
05:57:45.830 --> 05:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
suspends solid waste per permitting
 
05:57:47.708 --> 05:57:47.718 align:start position:0%
activities that are important to
 
05:57:49.670 --> 05:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
maintaining the stability of the solid
 
05:57:51.830 --> 05:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
waste Market in the state and we
 
05:57:54.430 --> 05:57:54.440 align:start position:0%
concerned that it could have adverse
 
05:57:56.788 --> 05:57:56.798 align:start position:0%
Economic Consequences on New Hampshire
 
05:57:59.910 --> 05:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
communities and New Hampshire businesses
 
05:58:02.468 --> 05:58:02.478 align:start position:0%
and that concern about The Economic
 
05:58:04.868 --> 05:58:04.878 align:start position:0%
Consequences is related to the
 
05:58:08.628 --> 05:58:08.638 align:start position:0%
projections of capacity uh and capacity
 
05:58:12.230 --> 05:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
need which are
 
05:58:15.590 --> 05:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
um in some ways difficult to assess uh
 
05:58:19.948 --> 05:58:19.958 align:start position:0%
it appears that the 2031 date was
 
05:58:22.430 --> 05:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
selected based on a chart that's in the
 
05:58:25.070 --> 05:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
solid waste banal
 
05:58:30.070 --> 05:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
report and the uh um projections in that
 
05:58:35.110 --> 05:58:35.120 align:start position:0%
report indicate that need will not
 
05:58:37.468 --> 05:58:37.478 align:start position:0%
exceed capacity until sometime after
 
05:58:39.468 --> 05:58:39.478 align:start position:0%
2031 I think it's
 
05:58:42.430 --> 05:58:42.440 align:start position:0%
2035 but it's important to understand
 
05:58:45.230 --> 05:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
that these projections do not take into
 
05:58:48.990 --> 05:58:49.000 align:start position:0%
account um important factors such as the
 
05:58:52.150 --> 05:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
location of the capacity in the state
 
05:58:54.628 --> 05:58:54.638 align:start position:0%
and also it doesn't take into account
 
05:58:56.990 --> 05:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
the fact that landfills are able to
 
05:58:59.110 --> 05:58:59.120 align:start position:0%
accept out of state
 
05:59:03.230 --> 05:59:03.240 align:start position:0%
waste when you take those factors into
 
05:59:05.670 --> 05:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
consideration there is a potential for a
 
05:59:10.390 --> 05:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
capacity need much sooner um year 2627
 
05:59:12.548 --> 05:59:12.558 align:start position:0%
is what our fiscal note
 
05:59:15.310 --> 05:59:15.320 align:start position:0%
says while the bill does allow for
 
05:59:17.430 --> 05:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
permitting of expansions at existing
 
05:59:19.670 --> 05:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
landfills to continue during this period
 
05:59:23.150 --> 05:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
of time existing landfills may not be
 
05:59:26.350 --> 05:59:26.360 align:start position:0%
positioned or inclined to apply for
 
05:59:30.390 --> 05:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
expansion so so it uh may not
 
05:59:34.948 --> 05:59:34.958 align:start position:0%
be reliable to solely rely on potential
 
05:59:37.070 --> 05:59:37.080 align:start position:0%
landfill expansions to solve any
 
05:59:39.468 --> 05:59:39.478 align:start position:0%
capacity need issues that would arise
 
05:59:42.590 --> 05:59:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:45.190 --> 05:59:45.200 align:start position:0%
time that summarizes our concerns about
 
05:59:48.030 --> 05:59:48.040 align:start position:0%
the bill and I'm happy to take
 
05:59:51.070 --> 05:59:51.080 align:start position:0%
questions representative NAB thank you
 
05:59:52.350 --> 05:59:52.360 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you for taking my
 
05:59:53.948 --> 05:59:53.958 align:start position:0%
question I'm curious because it came up
 
05:59:55.868 --> 05:59:55.878 align:start position:0%
the other day um and because the
 
05:59:57.190 --> 05:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
previous speaker was just talking about
 
05:59:59.430 --> 05:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
their process what the process is by
 
06:00:01.230 --> 06:00:01.240 align:start position:0%
which Dees decides whether to take a
 
06:00:03.468 --> 06:00:03.478 align:start position:0%
position for or against a bill or to
 
06:00:05.670 --> 06:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
just offer commentary and remain
 
06:00:08.070 --> 06:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
neutral uh the process involves
 
06:00:10.110 --> 06:00:10.120 align:start position:0%
discussion discussing the details of the
 
06:00:13.430 --> 06:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:16.750 --> 06:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
leadership representative Duty yes thank
 
06:00:17.708 --> 06:00:17.718 align:start position:0%
you madam
 
06:00:21.750 --> 06:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
chairperson um so naswa has capacity out
 
06:00:26.350 --> 06:00:26.360 align:start position:0%
for 40 years okay in its landfill um so
 
06:00:29.628 --> 06:00:29.638 align:start position:0%
if nashwa could do that why can't other
 
06:00:32.750 --> 06:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
landfills um manage their landfills to
 
06:00:35.230 --> 06:00:35.240 align:start position:0%
have that kind of
 
06:00:38.468 --> 06:00:38.478 align:start position:0%
capacity it depends on the specifics of
 
06:00:41.948 --> 06:00:41.958 align:start position:0%
the landfill how much space they have uh
 
06:00:45.310 --> 06:00:45.320 align:start position:0%
what the geometry of the landfill is um
 
06:00:48.670 --> 06:00:48.680 align:start position:0%
some landfills have phases of approvals
 
06:00:50.628 --> 06:00:50.638 align:start position:0%
how much space is left in their phase so
 
06:00:52.510 --> 06:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
so it's specific to the
 
06:00:55.788 --> 06:00:55.798 align:start position:0%
landfill representative Howard thank you
 
06:00:57.868 --> 06:00:57.878 align:start position:0%
madam chair um most of the reasons that
 
06:00:59.510 --> 06:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
you gave for opposing this bill were
 
06:01:02.590 --> 06:01:02.600 align:start position:0%
Financial or economic um and isn't your
 
06:01:05.830 --> 06:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
purview to protect and and take care of
 
06:01:08.868 --> 06:01:08.878 align:start position:0%
the environment um so I'm just wondering
 
06:01:11.868 --> 06:01:11.878 align:start position:0%
why you know why bring why cap bringing
 
06:01:14.070 --> 06:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
in garbage from outside and and keeping
 
06:01:17.070 --> 06:01:17.080 align:start position:0%
that in in income level going is more
 
06:01:18.110 --> 06:01:18.120 align:start position:0%
important than protecting the
 
06:01:20.030 --> 06:01:20.040 align:start position:0%
environment uh there are a couple issues
 
06:01:22.670 --> 06:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
to unpack there uh the first is that yes
 
06:01:24.430 --> 06:01:24.440 align:start position:0%
our mission is to protect human health
 
06:01:26.390 --> 06:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
and the environment and the solid waste
 
06:01:29.230 --> 06:01:29.240 align:start position:0%
management act actually charges us with
 
06:01:32.430 --> 06:01:32.440 align:start position:0%
both making sure that New Hampshire has
 
06:01:36.030 --> 06:01:36.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate outlet for its solid waste
 
06:01:39.990 --> 06:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
and um meeting the goals for the
 
06:01:42.030 --> 06:01:42.040 align:start position:0%
different types of ways of dealing with
 
06:01:43.990 --> 06:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
the solid waste and protecting the
 
06:01:47.230 --> 06:01:47.240 align:start position:0%
environment but uh the economic concerns
 
06:01:50.190 --> 06:01:50.200 align:start position:0%
are related to that responsibility that
 
06:01:53.150 --> 06:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
we have to make sure that the solid
 
06:01:55.270 --> 06:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
waste that does need to get landfilled
 
06:01:57.628 --> 06:01:57.638 align:start position:0%
can be landfilled in a way that is a
 
06:02:00.390 --> 06:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
affordable in response to your question
 
06:02:00.400 --> 06:02:02.190 align:start position:0%
affordable in response to your question
about

06:02:02.190 --> 06:02:02.200 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:02:05.030 --> 06:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
um waste from out of state coming into
 
06:02:07.868 --> 06:02:07.878 align:start position:0%
State Dees does not have authority over
 
06:02:09.468 --> 06:02:09.478 align:start position:0%
that so we we don't have a way to
 
06:02:13.030 --> 06:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
control that representative Bixby yeah
 
06:02:15.070 --> 06:02:15.080 align:start position:0%
so um the question came up with a
 
06:02:17.190 --> 06:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
previous speaker about how long it takes
 
06:02:21.230 --> 06:02:21.240 align:start position:0%
to uh permit uh and and uh deploy a new
 
06:02:23.510 --> 06:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
landfill uh what is the what is the time
 
06:02:27.190 --> 06:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
frame for uh uh from the initiation of
 
06:02:30.948 --> 06:02:30.958 align:start position:0%
the the process to uh it becoming open
 
06:02:32.510 --> 06:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
yes I did hear that in the previous
 
06:02:36.350 --> 06:02:36.360 align:start position:0%
testimony and it makes sense to me that
 
06:02:39.670 --> 06:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
the the experts that Bia consulted would
 
06:02:41.510 --> 06:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
indicate that it was 6 to 10 years
 
06:02:44.150 --> 06:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
because from the point of um doing the
 
06:02:46.390 --> 06:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
planning and citing before an
 
06:02:47.868 --> 06:02:47.878 align:start position:0%
application is ever
 
06:02:51.830 --> 06:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
submitted uh it it makes sense that it
 
06:02:53.468 --> 06:02:53.478 align:start position:0%
would take that long to the point of
 
06:02:53.478 --> 06:02:54.510 align:start position:0%
would take that long to the point of
getting

06:02:54.510 --> 06:02:54.520 align:start position:0%
getting
 
06:02:58.150 --> 06:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
permitted thank you and and so you're
 
06:03:04.468 --> 06:03:04.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:07.910 --> 06:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
2027 I mean we we saw one report that
 
06:03:07.920 --> 06:03:08.868 align:start position:0%
2027 I mean we we saw one report that
says

06:03:08.868 --> 06:03:08.878 align:start position:0%
says
 
06:03:12.910 --> 06:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
2031 and you were saying that um that
 
06:03:14.990 --> 06:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
that report doesn't take certain
 
06:03:16.628 --> 06:03:16.638 align:start position:0%
capacity issues into
 
06:03:19.708 --> 06:03:19.718 align:start position:0%
consideration and that you were mostly
 
06:03:22.310 --> 06:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
looking at more around
 
06:03:24.708 --> 06:03:24.718 align:start position:0%
2027 in our in our fiscal note we
 
06:03:26.708 --> 06:03:26.718 align:start position:0%
indicated that we could see some
 
06:03:29.830 --> 06:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
decrease in capacity by that time by 20
 
06:03:31.830 --> 06:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
so that's decreasing do you know what
 
06:03:34.868 --> 06:03:34.878 align:start position:0%
percentage of decrease in capacity I
 
06:03:36.230 --> 06:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
don't have that
 
06:03:39.990 --> 06:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
information okay representative Murray
 
06:03:41.350 --> 06:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
thank you while we're talking about
 
06:03:44.070 --> 06:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
decreases here I I was referring back to
 
06:03:47.190 --> 06:03:47.200 align:start position:0%
the 2021-22 banial solid waste report
 
06:03:49.750 --> 06:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
that your department uh issued and I was
 
06:03:52.150 --> 06:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
looking at the roughly one and a half
 
06:03:55.110 --> 06:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
million tons of waste that was noted as
 
06:03:58.590 --> 06:03:58.600 align:start position:0%
being disposed of between mssw and CN D
 
06:04:02.590 --> 06:04:02.600 align:start position:0%
um in the year 2018 and we are at a 7%
 
06:04:08.750 --> 06:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
reduction uh as compared to um 2018 in
 
06:04:08.760 --> 06:04:10.390 align:start position:0%
reduction uh as compared to um 2018 in
2022

06:04:10.390 --> 06:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
2022
 
06:04:15.270 --> 06:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
1.3 maybe 1.4 million tons um were uh
 
06:04:18.110 --> 06:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
disposed of in the year 2022 so we are
 
06:04:20.030 --> 06:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
trending in the right direction of
 
06:04:23.190 --> 06:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
disposing of less uh albe it slowly but
 
06:04:25.070 --> 06:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
it seems like there are incremental
 
06:04:27.990 --> 06:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
decreases in year-over-year changes from
 
06:04:31.270 --> 06:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
2020 all the way to 2022 with some
 
06:04:34.070 --> 06:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
fluctuation so I didn't know if you
 
06:04:36.070 --> 06:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
expect those Trends to continue or not
 
06:04:39.190 --> 06:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
and if you could speak to
 
06:04:42.270 --> 06:04:42.280 align:start position:0%
that we do hope and expect those Trends
 
06:04:48.468 --> 06:04:48.478 align:start position:0%
to continue and uh with implementation
 
06:04:51.910 --> 06:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
of increased recycling increased
 
06:04:54.230 --> 06:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
composting all of the things that our
 
06:04:57.590 --> 06:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste plan which is a 10-year plan
 
06:05:00.990 --> 06:05:01.000 align:start position:0%
uh proposes to have implemented we would
 
06:05:06.910 --> 06:05:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:09.468 --> 06:05:09.478 align:start position:0%
further representative
 
06:05:13.190 --> 06:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
Penza I have a couple questions if okay
 
06:05:19.390 --> 06:05:19.400 align:start position:0%
so um the report says 2034 though not 20
 
06:05:22.070 --> 06:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
31 and I just wanted to correct that so
 
06:05:24.070 --> 06:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
which report the one that you were just
 
06:05:27.590 --> 06:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
saying that okay yeah um
 
06:05:29.868 --> 06:05:29.878 align:start position:0%
so in any case I wanted to understand
 
06:05:34.270 --> 06:05:34.280 align:start position:0%
about capacity and it's true that with
 
06:05:36.670 --> 06:05:36.680 align:start position:0%
all of the permit applications 100% New
 
06:05:39.190 --> 06:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire comes first
 
06:05:41.628 --> 06:05:41.638 align:start position:0%
correct we come first we have to be able
 
06:05:44.868 --> 06:05:44.878 align:start position:0%
to take care of our waste before anyone
 
06:05:44.878 --> 06:05:45.948 align:start position:0%
to take care of our waste before anyone
else

06:05:45.948 --> 06:05:45.958 align:start position:0%
else
 
06:05:49.708 --> 06:05:49.718 align:start position:0%
correct I don't really understand your
 
06:05:53.430 --> 06:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
question in the permit application that
 
06:05:55.350 --> 06:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
someone's putting in for for a landfill
 
06:05:58.788 --> 06:05:58.798 align:start position:0%
so the current landfills preference 100%
 
06:06:01.990 --> 06:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:05.830 --> 06:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
trash preference in the permit
 
06:06:09.350 --> 06:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
application I'm sorry I'm not
 
06:06:12.150 --> 06:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
following I'm not trying to be
 
06:06:17.110 --> 06:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
obtuse are you trying to say that when a
 
06:06:19.868 --> 06:06:19.878 align:start position:0%
landfill operator
 
06:06:25.868 --> 06:06:25.878 align:start position:0%
accepts um solid waste that they have
 
06:06:29.030 --> 06:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
100% preference refence to that coming
 
06:06:33.830 --> 06:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire and then what comes
 
06:06:35.910 --> 06:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
from out of state correct in the
 
06:06:39.120 --> 06:06:39.130 align:start position:0%
planning of the B do our do our waste
 
06:06:39.130 --> 06:06:40.270 align:start position:0%
planning of the B do our do our waste
[Music]

06:06:40.270 --> 06:06:40.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:06:43.468 --> 06:06:43.478 align:start position:0%
operators uh have any kind of preference
 
06:06:46.190 --> 06:06:46.200 align:start position:0%
to where the waste is coming from when
 
06:06:49.190 --> 06:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
it comes to their facility I mean will
 
06:06:51.230 --> 06:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
they they
 
06:06:55.150 --> 06:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
won't they they take New Hampshire trash
 
06:06:56.628 --> 06:06:56.638 align:start position:0%
before they would take out of state
 
06:06:56.638 --> 06:06:59.350 align:start position:0%
before they would take out of state
trash

06:06:59.350 --> 06:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:03.030 --> 06:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
no yes Dees does not uh is not able to
 
06:07:07.468 --> 06:07:07.478 align:start position:0%
set a limit or a percentage of no in
 
06:07:09.030 --> 06:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
state as opposed to out of state trash
 
06:07:11.430 --> 06:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
that the landfills will
 
06:07:17.030 --> 06:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
accept can I'm not hang on no no hang on
 
06:07:20.310 --> 06:07:20.320 align:start position:0%
then then go ahead representative Penza
 
06:07:21.830 --> 06:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not saying it's like a
 
06:07:23.628 --> 06:07:23.638 align:start position:0%
preference or anything like that it's
 
06:07:26.070 --> 06:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
it's truly an obligation it's in the
 
06:07:28.990 --> 06:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
permit it says says that you shall
 
06:07:31.750 --> 06:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
guarantee capacity for New Hampshire
 
06:07:33.590 --> 06:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
it's a New Hampshire Reed to take New
 
06:07:36.190 --> 06:07:36.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire waste yes okay
 
06:07:36.200 --> 06:07:38.350 align:start position:0%
Hampshire waste yes okay
yes

06:07:38.350 --> 06:07:38.360 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:07:41.510 --> 06:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
06:07:45.230 --> 06:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you madam chair um the
 
06:07:47.868 --> 06:07:47.878 align:start position:0%
current rules uh expire in July is that
 
06:07:49.830 --> 06:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
right the current um about landfills
 
06:07:51.070 --> 06:07:51.080 align:start position:0%
they're working on new rules that will
 
06:07:53.948 --> 06:07:53.958 align:start position:0%
take place in so the current permit um
 
06:07:55.788 --> 06:07:55.798 align:start position:0%
application that's will that will the
 
06:07:58.708 --> 06:07:58.718 align:start position:0%
