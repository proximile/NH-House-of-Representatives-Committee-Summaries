00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:41.639 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone I'm going to call
 
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
to order a committee of conference for
 
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 align:start position:0%
458 now this is a bill
 
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
that was a significant change from the
 
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
original House Bill
 
00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
458 that was a bill that was designed to
 
00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
do something something completely
 
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
different but a Senate Bill had
 
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
superseded it so the house amended House
 
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 align:start position:0%
Bill 458 to reestablish a commission to
 
00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 align:start position:0%
to study the assessing of power
 
00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
generation this is a commission that was
 
00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
established at least a year ago maybe
 
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
two years ago it had done some work but
 
00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
it didn't finish the work that they were
 
00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:28.039 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish so they asked us to
 
00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:29.319 align:start position:0%
and then the committee the commission
 
00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
EXP spired so they asked us to
 
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
reestablish the commission so that they
 
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.240 align:start position:0%
could finish their
 
00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:37.759 align:start position:0%
work so that's what the substance of the
 
00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:39.589 align:start position:0%
work so that's what the substance of the
bill

00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
did and when we sent the bill to the
 
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
Senate after it passed the house the
 
00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
Senate decided to make
 
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
a a change an
 
00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:55.000 align:start position:0%
amendment to solve one problem and
 
00:06:56.189 --> 00:06:56.199 align:start position:0%
here's the
 
00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
problem right
 
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.360 align:start position:0%
now power General generators power plant
 
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
assessment so that when they're trying
 
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
to figure out what their tax assessment
 
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
is going to be they have to talk to the
 
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
Dr and then they have to talk to one or
 
00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
more private assessor is usually hired
 
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
by a
 
00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
municipality and this creates a lot of
 
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
confusion and it also leads to to a lot
 
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
of lawsuits which ends up costing
 
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
everybody more
 
00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
money so the Senate changed the language
 
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:41.720 align:start position:0%
in the bill to try to eliminate this
 
00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
multiple points of
 
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:46.840 align:start position:0%
assessment and create just a single
 
00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
point of assessment for a power
 
00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:52.639 align:start position:0%
generation plant to deal with
 
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
and the board of assessment came to me
 
00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
and said they preferred the house
 
00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:02.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
language but looking at the house
 
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
language and comparing it to the Senate
 
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
language it seems to me that the
 
00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:11.560 align:start position:0%
original House language is
 
00:08:14.749 --> 00:08:14.759 align:start position:0%
quite vague and
 
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
confusing so we think we would be
 
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
willing to go along with the Senate
 
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment with a slight
 
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:27.560 align:start position:0%
change the current Senate Amendment for
 
00:08:31.749 --> 00:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
Section D reads recommend a solution for
 
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
Power Generation generation assets to
 
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:35.560 align:start position:0%
face a single point of assessment
 
00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
commensurate with market-based
 
00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:39.509 align:start position:0%
commensurate with market-based
commercial

00:08:39.509 --> 00:08:39.519 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
property we feel if we changed the three
 
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
words at the beginning of that sentence
 
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:52.389 --> 00:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
recommendations that that would allow
 
00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:57.320 align:start position:0%
the commission to analyze all different
 
00:08:59.470 --> 00:08:59.480 align:start position:0%
strategies for coming methodologies for
 
00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
coming up with an
 
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:03.560 align:start position:0%
assessment and then come up with a
 
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation or possibly more
 
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations to put together a single
 
00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:11.720 align:start position:0%
point of
 
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
assessment so that's the proposal I
 
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
think we would like to ask the Senate to
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
consider and I would open the floor to
 
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
other members of the committee to
 
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
discuss this further representative
 
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr chairman um were you
 
00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:32.240 align:start position:0%
also considering in that amended
 
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:34.720 align:start position:0%
language that you just mentioned adding
 
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
the single
 
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
point language to that because I you
 
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
didn't mention that you mentioned
 
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
changing the sentence at the beginning
 
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
to say create recommendations so what
 
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
I'm recommending is that we go to the
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
Senate if you look at the uh side by
 
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:51.640 align:start position:0%
side and change the first three words
 
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:53.800 align:start position:0%
yes okay gotcha just change the first
 
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
three words because that preserves the
 
00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
language about a single point of
 
00:09:59.829 --> 00:09:59.839 align:start position:0%
assessment perfect thank you okay
 
00:09:59.839 --> 00:10:01.470 align:start position:0%
assessment perfect thank you okay
further

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:01.480 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.310 align:start position:0%
further
discussion

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:03.320 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:06.959 align:start position:0%
good that's good good okay the Senate
 
00:10:09.389 --> 00:10:09.399 align:start position:0%
agrees with um
 
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
this recommendation that we change those
 
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
three words to the two words create
 
00:10:18.509 --> 00:10:18.519 align:start position:0%
recommendations and the house
 
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
members I believe we agree to that as
 
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:25.240 align:start position:0%
well okay good I think we're done it's
 
00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.030 align:start position:0%
well okay good I think we're done it's
only

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
only
 
00:10:30.069 --> 00:10:30.079 align:start position:0%

to order the committee of conference on
 
00:32:55.549 --> 00:32:55.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:58.430 --> 00:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
1623 for the house we have
 
00:33:02.629 --> 00:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
Representatives Harrington Bernardi and
 
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
Thomas and myself of course and for the
 
00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
Senate we have Senate enr chairman
 
00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
Senator Kevin
 
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
avard Senator David Waters and joining
 
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
us shortly will be Senator Howard Pearl
 
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:18.789 align:start position:0%
us shortly will be Senator Howard Pearl
I

00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
believe he is at another uh Committee of
 
00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:23.960 align:start position:0%
conference working on lithium batteries
 
00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:24.830 align:start position:0%
conference working on lithium batteries
Mr

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:27.519 align:start position:0%
chairman was scheduled at the same time
 
00:33:27.519 --> 00:33:28.789 align:start position:0%
chairman was scheduled at the same time
yeah

00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:31.960 align:start position:0%
so we're here to discuss the changes
 
00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:35.960 align:start position:0%
made by the Senate to House Bill
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
1623 the Senate removed quite a bit of
 
00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:43.480 align:start position:0%
the language that was in the original
 
00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
Bill essentially all of the language
 
00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.310 align:start position:0%
Bill essentially all of the language
down

00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:53.080 align:start position:0%
to section
 
00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
two a language that involved War
 
00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.310 align:start position:0%
two a language that involved War
findings

00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
findings
 
00:34:02.029 --> 00:34:02.039 align:start position:0%
and the language that involved changes
 
00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:05.320 align:start position:0%
to RSA 378 colon
 
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
37 which is the New Hampshire State
 
00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:11.710 align:start position:0%
37 which is the New Hampshire State
energy

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:11.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:14.829 --> 00:34:14.839 align:start position:0%
policy the Senate left intacted the
 
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
section of the bill that
 
00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:20.200 align:start position:0%
discussed loss of instate electrical
 
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
generation and provided a remedy about
 
00:34:25.349 --> 00:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
what to do with
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
that so I'm here this morning on on
 
00:34:30.629 --> 00:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
behalf of the house because the house
 
00:34:36.589 --> 00:34:36.599 align:start position:0%
position was the entire Bill to advocate
 
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
for adding some new language to the
 
00:34:43.869 --> 00:34:43.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:48.069 --> 00:34:48.079 align:start position:0%
bill I recognized that the original
 
00:34:52.069 --> 00:34:52.079 align:start position:0%
Bill's complete replacement of RSA 378
 
00:34:55.589 --> 00:34:55.599 align:start position:0%
colon 37 was probably too much to
 
00:34:59.310 --> 00:34:59.320 align:start position:0%
ask so this amended version that I'm
 
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
morning retains all of the original
 
00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
language from 378 col
 
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
37 doesn't change a single letter of the
 
00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:13.150 align:start position:0%
37 doesn't change a single letter of the
existing

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:13.160 align:start position:0%
existing
 
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
language of that portion of the statute
 
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
all it does is add some additional
 
00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
language to that portion of the
 
00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:25.270 align:start position:0%
language to that portion of the
statute

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
to place an emphas emphasis
 
00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
on some important
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
Concepts the
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
major Concepts that it tries to enshrine
 
00:35:39.069 --> 00:35:39.079 align:start position:0%
in statute are
 
00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
reliability and low consumer prices and
 
00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:45.430 align:start position:0%
reliability and low consumer prices and
price

00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:49.349 --> 00:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
stability when I talk to my
 
00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
constituents they complain a little bit
 
00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
about the price of electricity but the
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
thing they complain the most about is
 
00:35:57.359 --> 00:35:58.470 align:start position:0%
thing they complain the most about is
it's

00:35:58.470 --> 00:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:00.760 align:start position:0%
reliability why does it take so long for
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
the power company to get my power back
 
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
on when it goes off when a storm passes
 
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
through why do I have power outages
 
00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:12.040 align:start position:0%
every week etc etc that's the single
 
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
biggest complaint that I hear when I
 
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
talk to my constituents about
 
00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:18.910 align:start position:0%
talk to my constituents about
electricity

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
00:36:22.349 --> 00:36:22.359 align:start position:0%
so I think it's important for us to
 
00:36:24.829 --> 00:36:24.839 align:start position:0%
emphasize in state energy policy that
 
00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
reliability is a key
 
00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
component of everything we do and that's
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
why the four of us on the house side
 
00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
have worked together to put together
 
00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:43.640 align:start position:0%
proposal and I would like to hear from
 
00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
other members of the committee of
 
00:36:48.069 --> 00:36:48.079 align:start position:0%
conference to get your reaction to this
 
00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:50.680 align:start position:0%
proposal representative
 
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah just to reemphasize what
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
the chairman just said I think that uh
 
00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:57.560 align:start position:0%
you know it sounds kind of silly but
 
00:36:59.109 --> 00:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
during a power routage I've had people
 
00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:01.599 align:start position:0%
say I'll rent your generator I don't
 
00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:04.280 align:start position:0%
care what it cost because reliability is
 
00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
such an important thing um my daughter
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
who has her own business uh lives out
 
00:37:12.109 --> 00:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
used to live in California and she would
 
00:37:14.109 --> 00:37:14.119 align:start position:0%
lose the power in the summertime on a
 
00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
semi-regular basis which caused her to
 
00:37:18.309 --> 00:37:18.319 align:start position:0%
move out of California she just couldn't
 
00:37:20.829 --> 00:37:20.839 align:start position:0%
tolerate having that loss and as we go
 
00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
forward we liability is going to be a
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
much much bigger issue and we need to
 
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
look at the big picture on this we've
 
00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:29.480 align:start position:0%
seen a lot of proposals for New
 
00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:31.880 align:start position:0%
Generation but very few of them come
 
00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
online um in the last uh year I think
 
00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
we've seen five offshore wind projects
 
00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
cancelled from New Jersey through New
 
00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:41.960 align:start position:0%
England uh it's one in New Jersey just
 
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
paid $120 million fine rather than build
 
00:37:47.309 --> 00:37:47.319 align:start position:0%
to their contract that they signed one
 
00:37:50.069 --> 00:37:50.079 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts paid a $65 million fine
 
00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
so reliability is going to be the key
 
00:37:56.069 --> 00:37:56.079 align:start position:0%
issue people about my French but
 
00:37:58.510 --> 00:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
that's what they do about cost but when
 
00:38:00.309 --> 00:38:00.319 align:start position:0%
it comes down to it if they don't have
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
electricity they're willing to pay
 
00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:04.280 align:start position:0%
double the price to get it back so we
 
00:38:06.069 --> 00:38:06.079 align:start position:0%
got to start with reliability that's the
 
00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
most important
 
00:38:11.309 --> 00:38:11.319 align:start position:0%
thing representative Thomas thank you Mr
 
00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:14.079 align:start position:0%
chair uh again I will Echo with the last
 
00:38:17.349 --> 00:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
two speakers sentiments and add that for
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
my constituents in
 
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
lary yes reliability is paramont and I
 
00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
would say extremely important to our uh
 
00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:29.720 align:start position:0%
our our businesses but lary has a very
 
00:38:33.069 --> 00:38:33.079 align:start position:0%
high percentage of elderly and families
 
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
on fixed incomes and price and price
 
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
stability are Paramount to them as well
 
00:38:42.349 --> 00:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
so I think it's very important that we
 
00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
set up a policy where yes reliability is
 
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
first always has to be you have to have
 
00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:50.200 align:start position:0%
reliable power no matter what you do but
 
00:38:53.829 --> 00:38:53.839 align:start position:0%
also pricing and price stability is very
 
00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:56.200 align:start position:0%
important particularly for our elderly
 
00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:58.200 align:start position:0%
and people on fixed income
 
00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:00.200 align:start position:0%
uh they just with with inflation going
 
00:39:03.069 --> 00:39:03.079 align:start position:0%
on right now they just can't afford more
 
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
price likes and I think we need to be
 
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
very sensitive to that and I think the
 
00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
state needs to follow a policy that
 
00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:11.960 align:start position:0%
follows the best interests of these
 
00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
constituents representative
 
00:39:17.309 --> 00:39:17.319 align:start position:0%
Bernardi thank you Mr chair I'll I'll
 
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
third the motion uh the key language you
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
have in here uh in this particular
 
00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
amendment is affordability reliability
 
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
and price stability those are key
 
00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:35.240 align:start position:0%
elements to ensure uh that we address in
 
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
energy policy and they hit all the
 
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
points of our constituents they want the
 
00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:45.160 align:start position:0%
prices known and they want that
 
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
electricity reliable and they want it
 
00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable in
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
cost Senator
 
00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
Waters uh thank you Mr chairman um
 
00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
we have passed uh House Bill 1431 on uh
 
00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:05.839 align:start position:0%
transmission planning and we have
 
00:40:08.309 --> 00:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
created a uh grid modernization working
 
00:40:11.589 --> 00:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
group a couple years ago and uh I think
 
00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:13.480 align:start position:0%
that we have good systems in place to
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
deal with reliability of uh transmission
 
00:40:20.069 --> 00:40:20.079 align:start position:0%
and distribution um and I think that the
 
00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:23.480 align:start position:0%
Senate would like to uh stay with the
 
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
Senate position on the bill and hope
 
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
that the house would exceed to that
 
00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:34.309 --> 00:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
chairman I concur with any further
 
00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
Waters okay so is it the Senate's
 
00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:44.440 align:start position:0%
position that they will not consider
 
00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
this amendment language that is the
 
00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:49.150 align:start position:0%
this amendment language that is the
Senate's

00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:49.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
position we have there's no room for
 
00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
discussion no room for we do like what
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
you modifications to this language we do
 
00:40:59.630 --> 00:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
like what is the remainder of the of of
 
00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:01.720 align:start position:0%
the bill though and we uh we feel that
 
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
uh that sovereignty piece is is very
 
00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
very important and uh we definitely
 
00:41:07.309 --> 00:41:07.319 align:start position:0%
would Embrace that
 
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly but at this time I think
 
00:41:14.589 --> 00:41:14.599 align:start position:0%
any uh any changes or uh we're we're
 
00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
pretty much
 
00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh of one mind not to uh to amend it
 
00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
could you help us understand what about
 
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
this language you don't like either of
 
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
you uh
 
00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:31.240 align:start position:0%
well I think it uh there there is a a
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
bit of vaguery here with this uh limited
 
00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
to the intervenes economic advantages
 
00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
it's not very
 
00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:41.480 align:start position:0%
specific and
 
00:41:44.589 --> 00:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
uh I just I I just feel it's too vague
 
00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
at this point and I think what we have
 
00:41:48.349 --> 00:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
right now I haven't heard anything about
 
00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
reliability uh for my consumers and for
 
00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:53.480 align:start position:0%
my constituents at this price definitely
 
00:41:56.589 --> 00:41:56.599 align:start position:0%
prices are are are concerned but uh
 
00:41:59.550 --> 00:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
allowing more more uh renewable energies
 
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh projects that we're working on right
 
00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
now I think is is is trying to address
 
00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:06.760 align:start position:0%
that but um at this point I think just
 
00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's kind of vague so I mean that's
 
00:42:14.349 --> 00:42:14.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
this Senator Waters yeah thanks Mr
 
00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
chairman so I agree with the the chair
 
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
um and I also would just say in a big
 
00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
picture we have gotten just an enormous
 
00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:26.440 align:start position:0%
amount done on energy policy over the
 
00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
last couple of years years and I I think
 
00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:31.400 align:start position:0%
that um we're ending up in a very good
 
00:42:33.829 --> 00:42:33.839 align:start position:0%
place with what the Senate did to Senate
 
00:42:37.069 --> 00:42:37.079 align:start position:0%
bill to House Bill 16 uh 23 and as I
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
said I think that there certainly will
 
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
be things to continue discussing in
 
00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:43.960 align:start position:0%
subsequent sessions but uh it is our
 
00:42:46.549 --> 00:42:46.559 align:start position:0%
hope that the um because there is as the
 
00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:49.400 align:start position:0%
chairman said some some substance that's
 
00:42:52.589 --> 00:42:52.599 align:start position:0%
important to uh the version of House
 
00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:55.960 align:start position:0%
Bill 1623 that the Senate passed and we
 
00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
would hope that the house um for this
 
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
year could live with letting that be
 
00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
what we do and conversations would
 
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
continue so Senator avard you mentioned
 
00:43:10.829 --> 00:43:10.839 align:start position:0%
um some what you consider to be vague
 
00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:13.480 align:start position:0%
language about economically Advantage
 
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
One technology over
 
00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:19.400 align:start position:0%
another would it change your opinion of
 
00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
this suggested language if the phrase
 
00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:25.400 align:start position:0%
that starts on line three with the words
 
00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
to limit and ends on line five with
 
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
specific policy goal if that phrase was
 
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
struck would the rest of the language be
 
00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
acceptable to either of
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
you I I think uh at this point we we're
 
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:47.800 align:start position:0%
anything so you won't even consider that
 
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
no sir but thank you for asking all
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
right representative Thomas thank you Mr
 
00:43:57.870 --> 00:43:57.880 align:start position:0%
chair so uh to be clear um Sen
 
00:44:01.549 --> 00:44:01.559 align:start position:0%
I could you help me understand a little
 
00:44:01.559 --> 00:44:02.670 align:start position:0%
I could you help me understand a little
bit

00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:02.680 align:start position:0%
bit
 
00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
more why you have
 
00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
a um reservation on
 
00:44:14.309 --> 00:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
wanting uh people's energy to be
 
00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
reliable and lower cost and to be stable
 
00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
I I I I don't can you help me understand
 
00:44:24.109 --> 00:44:24.119 align:start position:0%
why that phrase seems to be offensive uh
 
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
to to the senate i
 
00:44:30.349 --> 00:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
I'd be glad to just say senator Waters I
 
00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
think we'd be very happy to continue
 
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
discussions next session um and I I I
 
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:37.480 align:start position:0%
don't think that our objection to this
 
00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
at this point in time should be assumed
 
00:44:44.069 --> 00:44:44.079 align:start position:0%
to have any principle or of what the
 
00:44:47.069 --> 00:44:47.079 align:start position:0%
representative has just suggested so um
 
00:44:50.549 --> 00:44:50.559 align:start position:0%
I as I said I hope that uh the house can
 
00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:53.240 align:start position:0%
understand the Senate position um of
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
sticking with its verion and um that
 
00:44:58.470 --> 00:44:58.480 align:start position:0%
that's where we're at at and uh so
 
00:45:00.309 --> 00:45:00.319 align:start position:0%
that's the decision I think is up to the
 
00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:03.400 align:start position:0%
house is what you want to do Senator
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
aard yeah I I I have no objections to uh
 
00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
lowering uh energy costs and and
 
00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:12.440 align:start position:0%
producing reliability I think the the
 
00:45:14.349 --> 00:45:14.359 align:start position:0%
key part of this bill that I'm I'm very
 
00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
keen on on passing is the you know the
 
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
protection of law fair and I think uh
 
00:45:21.309 --> 00:45:21.319 align:start position:0%
and I applaud you for that that part of
 
00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:24.280 align:start position:0%
this bill and I think that at this point
 
00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:26.200 align:start position:0%
uh that is one key element of this bill
 
00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
that'll help uh lower the cost and and
 
00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
keep reliability there because people
 
00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
will not be engaged in Endless lawsuits
 
00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
and I think that is a good part of this
 
00:45:38.109 --> 00:45:38.119 align:start position:0%
bill and I I support it
 
00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly uh so I think that's kind
 
00:45:43.589 --> 00:45:43.599 align:start position:0%
of where I'm at right now so it's not
 
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
like we're definitely for lower prices
 
00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
we're definitely for reliability so to
 
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
not not agree with that part of the bill
 
00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
does not mean that we are against it it
 
00:45:54.309 --> 00:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
just means that this is the part of the
 
00:45:59.910 --> 00:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:01.829 --> 00:46:01.839 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly okay anybody else have
 
00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
anything to add representative
 
00:46:08.549 --> 00:46:08.559 align:start position:0%
Bernardi thank you Mr chair I guess I do
 
00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:12.200 align:start position:0%
not understand that statement it's I
 
00:46:14.589 --> 00:46:14.599 align:start position:0%
understand the law fair section of the
 
00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
bill makes perfect sense but I don't
 
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
understand why making a public policy
 
00:46:23.549 --> 00:46:23.559 align:start position:0%
statement that we want energy
 
00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:25.960 align:start position:0%
reliability price affordability and
 
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
price stability
 
00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:30.440 align:start position:0%
is not good for New Hampshire it just
 
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
comments okay seeing none I'm going to
 
00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:45.400 align:start position:0%
call for a five minute break and I'm
 
00:46:46.829 --> 00:46:46.839 align:start position:0%
going to ask the house members to meet
 
00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:48.520 align:start position:0%
me in this office right over here for a
 
00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:55.829 align:start position:0%
me in this office right over here for a
quick

00:46:55.829 --> 00:46:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:55.839 --> 00:47:25.829 align:start position:0%
 
discussion

00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%

00:52:55.589 --> 00:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
like to resume this Committee of
 
00:52:58.950 --> 00:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
conference on how Bill
 
00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
1623 house conre have made a decision
 
00:53:06.030 --> 00:53:06.040 align:start position:0%
about what we would like to do and I
 
00:53:08.670 --> 00:53:08.680 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Thomas thank
 
00:53:12.910 --> 00:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair Mr chair um although I I do
 
00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:14.720 align:start position:0%
think it's extremely important that the
 
00:53:17.109 --> 00:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
state make a statement on the policy of
 
00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:19.960 align:start position:0%
energy reliability looking for the low
 
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
cost and to protect price stability it
 
00:53:25.390 --> 00:53:25.400 align:start position:0%
does trouble me that we can't seem to
 
00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
get that language in to this bill
 
00:53:29.950 --> 00:53:29.960 align:start position:0%
however the second part of this bill is
 
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
also very important and it does protect
 
00:53:35.309 --> 00:53:35.319 align:start position:0%
or helps to protect our generators and
 
00:53:37.630 --> 00:53:37.640 align:start position:0%
sends a strong message to others outside
 
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
of us of the state here that um that we
 
00:53:42.829 --> 00:53:42.839 align:start position:0%
want to protect our power generators the
 
00:53:46.510 --> 00:53:46.520 align:start position:0%
ones that we have so I believe it's
 
00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
worth keeping this bill uh with the
 
00:53:53.109 --> 00:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
Senate's position and that I expect uh
 
00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
that that there will be new uh
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
legislation and discussions coming
 
00:54:01.069 --> 00:54:01.079 align:start position:0%
forward next year to uh make this bill
 
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
even better make this statute even
 
00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:07.240 align:start position:0%
better so uh with that uh I uh somewhat
 
00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
um uh reluctantly but I believe that
 
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
this a step in the right direction and I
 
00:54:13.349 --> 00:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
will be supporting the Senate
 
00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:15.640 align:start position:0%
Amendment representative
 
00:54:17.549 --> 00:54:17.559 align:start position:0%
Arrington yeah without repeating
 
00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:19.240 align:start position:0%
everything that uh representative Thomas
 
00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
just said I complete agreement with them
 
00:54:23.950 --> 00:54:23.960 align:start position:0%
I think uh sometimes you got to look at
 
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
it and say well a step in the right
 
00:54:27.349 --> 00:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
direction is better than no Step at all
 
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
though I think uh the original bill was
 
00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:31.480 align:start position:0%
better I'm willing to go along with this
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
with the idea that if I am reelected uh
 
00:54:36.309 --> 00:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
this discussion we'll be back again next
 
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
year representative
 
00:54:41.549 --> 00:54:41.559 align:start position:0%
Bernardi thank you Mr chair yes I I
 
00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
would concur uh half a loaf here is uh
 
00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:48.799 align:start position:0%
better than uh no loaf at all it's the
 
00:54:51.069 --> 00:54:51.079 align:start position:0%
uh the lawfare provisions are very
 
00:54:53.710 --> 00:54:53.720 align:start position:0%
important particularly with respect to
 
00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:56.559 align:start position:0%
our discussions in uh the greater uh New
 
00:55:00.349 --> 00:55:00.359 align:start position:0%
England area uh but it's also important
 
00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
for us in the future to strive for a
 
00:55:07.829 --> 00:55:07.839 align:start position:0%
policy that enshrines reliability
 
00:55:12.109 --> 00:55:12.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:14.789 --> 00:55:14.799 align:start position:0%
affordability thank
 
00:55:18.910 --> 00:55:18.920 align:start position:0%

00:55:20.990 --> 00:55:21.000 align:start position:0%

discuss House Bill 1600 an act relative
 
01:33:40.709 --> 01:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
to participation in net energy meeting
 
01:33:40.719 --> 01:33:41.870 align:start position:0%
to participation in net energy meeting
metering

01:33:41.870 --> 01:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
metering
 
01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
sorry the bill that we sent that the
 
01:33:48.510 --> 01:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:53.990 --> 01:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
Senate was a two-section bill that
 
01:33:57.070 --> 01:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
basically made Municipal
 
01:34:00.669 --> 01:34:00.679 align:start position:0%
hosts who want to participate in
 
01:34:03.709 --> 01:34:03.719 align:start position:0%
community aggregation to be a member of
 
01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
the community
 
01:34:08.750 --> 01:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
aggregation the Senate after listening
 
01:34:10.109 --> 01:34:10.119 align:start position:0%
to some
 
01:34:12.910 --> 01:34:12.920 align:start position:0%
concerns from the Department of energy
 
01:34:16.870 --> 01:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
and some others decided to change the
 
01:34:19.229 --> 01:34:19.239 align:start position:0%
bill to remove that section of the bill
 
01:34:24.550 --> 01:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
and to change it into a study committee
 
01:34:26.590 --> 01:34:26.600 align:start position:0%
a committee that shall examine
 
01:34:30.189 --> 01:34:30.199 align:start position:0%
legislative options regarding regulation
 
01:34:32.709 --> 01:34:32.719 align:start position:0%
of aggregation of electric customers by
 
01:34:35.790 --> 01:34:35.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities and counties including
 
01:34:38.550 --> 01:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
treatment of Municipal hosts pursuant to
 
01:34:42.590 --> 01:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
RSA 362a col
 
01:34:45.750 --> 01:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
92 so the position of the
 
01:34:49.470 --> 01:34:49.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:54.910 --> 01:34:54.920 align:start position:0%
to make the change that allowed
 
01:34:57.950 --> 01:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
these Municipal hosts to be part of a
 
01:34:57.960 --> 01:35:00.149 align:start position:0%
these Municipal hosts to be part of a
community

01:35:00.149 --> 01:35:00.159 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:35:02.229 --> 01:35:02.239 align:start position:0%
aggregation at the time that the house
 
01:35:04.270 --> 01:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
made that decision which I believe
 
01:35:06.149 --> 01:35:06.159 align:start position:0%
passed on the consent calendar
 
01:35:08.189 --> 01:35:08.199 align:start position:0%
unanimously out of committee and then on
 
01:35:10.709 --> 01:35:10.719 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar in the house at the
 
01:35:13.390 --> 01:35:13.400 align:start position:0%
time of that
 
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
passage the facts on the ground seem to
 
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
indicate that this was a
 
01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:20.910 align:start position:0%
indicate that this was a
non-controversial

01:35:20.910 --> 01:35:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:23.910 --> 01:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
item subsequently by the time the bill
 
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
got to the Senate numerous objections
 
01:35:29.229 --> 01:35:29.239 align:start position:0%
had been raised and
 
01:35:31.870 --> 01:35:31.880 align:start position:0%
concerns concerning some possible
 
01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:35.669 align:start position:0%
concerns concerning some possible
unintended

01:35:35.669 --> 01:35:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:38.510 --> 01:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
consequences and I paid close attention
 
01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
as did many of the members of this
 
01:35:43.590 --> 01:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
committee our committee science
 
01:35:45.990 --> 01:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
technology and energy to the debate in
 
01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:46.669 align:start position:0%
technology and energy to the debate in
the

01:35:46.669 --> 01:35:46.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:35:51.550 --> 01:35:51.560 align:start position:0%
Senate and many of those concerns seemed
 
01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:54.550 align:start position:0%
Senate and many of those concerns seemed
legitimate

01:35:54.550 --> 01:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
legitimate
 
01:35:58.189 --> 01:35:58.199 align:start position:0%
so we're here this morning to discuss
 
01:36:00.189 --> 01:36:00.199 align:start position:0%
what should be the path
 
01:36:03.870 --> 01:36:03.880 align:start position:0%
forward and I would like to recognize my
 
01:36:07.390 --> 01:36:07.400 align:start position:0%
house colleagues to discuss what they
 
01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
think we should do for this bill so I'll
 
01:36:14.350 --> 01:36:14.360 align:start position:0%
turn first to representative Corman who
 
01:36:17.669 --> 01:36:17.679 align:start position:0%
is the Prime sponsor of this
 
01:36:20.350 --> 01:36:20.360 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you very much Mr
 
01:36:22.830 --> 01:36:22.840 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I introduced this bill at
 
01:36:25.149 --> 01:36:25.159 align:start position:0%
the request of the Community power
 
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
Coalition and as uh chairman Bose said
 
01:36:32.229 --> 01:36:32.239 align:start position:0%
it passed St in the house unanimously
 
01:36:36.070 --> 01:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
passed on consent and then went to the
 
01:36:38.550 --> 01:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
Senate where uh energy and natural
 
01:36:41.910 --> 01:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
resources heard the bill when Department
 
01:36:45.430 --> 01:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
of energy testified on the bill at St
 
01:36:48.709 --> 01:36:48.719 align:start position:0%
and at enr they testified that they were
 
01:36:52.149 --> 01:36:52.159 align:start position:0%
neutral and then shortly uh Before the
 
01:36:55.390 --> 01:36:55.400 align:start position:0%
bill was exec in Ian hour uh we received
 
01:36:58.870 --> 01:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
a letter from Tom France and Chris Elms
 
01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
with their concerns about the
 
01:37:04.270 --> 01:37:04.280 align:start position:0%
bill and um these concerns actually
 
01:37:07.910 --> 01:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
chairman Vose listed in his floor speech
 
01:37:10.270 --> 01:37:10.280 align:start position:0%
last week in the house when we discussed
 
01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:12.189 align:start position:0%
last week in the house when we discussed
this

01:37:12.189 --> 01:37:12.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:37:15.109 --> 01:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
bill the community power Coalition in
 
01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
fact the chair uh Clifton Belo who's
 
01:37:18.950 --> 01:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
sitting in the
 
01:37:24.430 --> 01:37:24.440 align:start position:0%
back did send Tom frons a response to to
 
01:37:27.629 --> 01:37:27.639 align:start position:0%
the points that he raised and Mr Belo
 
01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
responded in detail to each one of the
 
01:37:34.430 --> 01:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
concerns raised by the department of
 
01:37:37.790 --> 01:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
energy so I understand that that this
 
01:37:39.510 --> 01:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
part of the bill the first part of the
 
01:37:42.149 --> 01:37:42.159 align:start position:0%
bill is is in Jeopardy but my own
 
01:37:44.870 --> 01:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
feeling is that these concerns actually
 
01:37:48.510 --> 01:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
have already been answered and we we
 
01:37:50.350 --> 01:37:50.360 align:start position:0%
should go forward with the house version
 
01:37:51.149 --> 01:37:51.159 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:37:54.070 --> 01:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
bill couple of things I want to say
 
01:37:56.709 --> 01:37:56.719 align:start position:0%
one is that when the bill was introduced
 
01:38:01.990 --> 01:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
to Senate enr Mr Belo also included or
 
01:38:05.709 --> 01:38:05.719 align:start position:0%
uh uh suggested an amendment um with a
 
01:38:08.229 --> 01:38:08.239 align:start position:0%
minor language change that addressed a
 
01:38:11.790 --> 01:38:11.800 align:start position:0%
concern that Doe had expressed at that
 
01:38:14.030 --> 01:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
point um and that that particular
 
01:38:15.950 --> 01:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment did not make it through and
 
01:38:18.030 --> 01:38:18.040 align:start position:0%
the second thing I want to say is that
 
01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
the Senate Amendment which creates a
 
01:38:23.950 --> 01:38:23.960 align:start position:0%
study committee uh I would not favor
 
01:38:27.229 --> 01:38:27.239 align:start position:0%
that at all and the reason is that I
 
01:38:30.589 --> 01:38:30.599 align:start position:0%
don't think we need one and by the time
 
01:38:34.629 --> 01:38:34.639 align:start position:0%
it actually would be formed and um
 
01:38:38.149 --> 01:38:38.159 align:start position:0%
operating it would be very late in the
 
01:38:41.189 --> 01:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
cycle with a report due on November 1st
 
01:38:42.629 --> 01:38:42.639 align:start position:0%
I could see this committee not even
 
01:38:44.629 --> 01:38:44.639 align:start position:0%
getting formed until September and that
 
01:38:46.950 --> 01:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
just doesn't give much time and there
 
01:38:48.189 --> 01:38:48.199 align:start position:0%
actually is one other thing I want to
 
01:38:50.430 --> 01:38:50.440 align:start position:0%
say which is section two of the house
 
01:38:53.030 --> 01:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
bill no matter what we do we should at
 
01:38:55.750 --> 01:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
least get get section two approved
 
01:38:56.990 --> 01:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
because that's just a simple
 
01:38:59.870 --> 01:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
housekeeping change that I don't think
 
01:39:02.070 --> 01:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
there's any objection to so those are
 
01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
the points I want to make thank you for
 
01:39:05.830 --> 01:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
recognizing me Mr chairman
 
01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:07.350 align:start position:0%
recognizing me Mr chairman
representative

01:39:07.350 --> 01:39:07.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:39:10.109 --> 01:39:10.119 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr
 
01:39:12.350 --> 01:39:12.360 align:start position:0%
chairman um what I would like to say is
 
01:39:14.750 --> 01:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
I would like to take us back to those
 
01:39:18.589 --> 01:39:18.599 align:start position:0%
happy days when the house was in
 
01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh was in agreement that this was a good
 
01:39:24.750 --> 01:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
bill to pass uh and basically talk about
 
01:39:27.310 --> 01:39:27.320 align:start position:0%
the reason for section one of the
 
01:39:32.430 --> 01:39:32.440 align:start position:0%
bill um we enabled uh competition in the
 
01:39:34.910 --> 01:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
market with HB
 
01:39:38.550 --> 01:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
3155 and when I saw this bill and I was
 
01:39:40.310 --> 01:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
a co-sponsor on it when I saw the
 
01:39:43.669 --> 01:39:43.679 align:start position:0%
language in this bill basically it it
 
01:39:45.990 --> 01:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
also is housekeeping it's trying to make
 
01:39:48.870 --> 01:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
sure that the community power Coalition
 
01:39:51.310 --> 01:39:51.320 align:start position:0%
is able to become to partner with
 
01:39:53.350 --> 01:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
Municipal hosts and that those
 
01:39:55.149 --> 01:39:55.159 align:start position:0%
definitions are clarified in the
 
01:39:57.510 --> 01:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
language of the RSA and I think all of
 
01:39:59.750 --> 01:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
us on on house science technology and
 
01:40:02.910 --> 01:40:02.920 align:start position:0%
energy agreed that that was language
 
01:40:04.990 --> 01:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
that should be there to enable those
 
01:40:07.750 --> 01:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
Partnerships which I don't know about
 
01:40:10.390 --> 01:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
the rest of you but when we past
 
01:40:12.950 --> 01:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
315 that is what I imagined Community
 
01:40:16.430 --> 01:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
power would be going out and doing um
 
01:40:18.470 --> 01:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
helping to leverage those local
 
01:40:20.189 --> 01:40:20.199 align:start position:0%
community projects in order to bring
 
01:40:23.270 --> 01:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
people's costs down um by accessing
 
01:40:25.350 --> 01:40:25.360 align:start position:0%
accessing power near where they're using
 
01:40:29.310 --> 01:40:29.320 align:start position:0%
it so I looked at this as a followon
 
01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
step that made a lot of
 
01:40:33.189 --> 01:40:33.199 align:start position:0%
sense and when I heard that there was a
 
01:40:35.109 --> 01:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
letter saying don't do anything with
 
01:40:38.109 --> 01:40:38.119 align:start position:0%
this bill um I went to sort of see what
 
01:40:40.990 --> 01:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
the concerns from doe were and I know we
 
01:40:43.709 --> 01:40:43.719 align:start position:0%
have we have someone from DOA here today
 
01:40:45.189 --> 01:40:45.199 align:start position:0%
that will maybe answer questions if we
 
01:40:50.990 --> 01:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
have any um and I read the letter and
 
01:40:53.589 --> 01:40:53.599 align:start position:0%
what I saw was I don't want to call it a
 
01:40:56.310 --> 01:40:56.320 align:start position:0%
smoke screen but I what I saw was a
 
01:40:59.910 --> 01:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
letter that was um alleging that there
 
01:41:02.070 --> 01:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
were a lot of things that were
 
01:41:06.109 --> 01:41:06.119 align:start position:0%
unknown um many of those unknowns that
 
01:41:09.270 --> 01:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
they alluded to were covered by the
 
01:41:11.109 --> 01:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
Inception of the community power
 
01:41:14.030 --> 01:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
Coalition with 315 and are already in
 
01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
Statute in many places the one thing
 
01:41:19.470 --> 01:41:19.480 align:start position:0%
that I saw that was pointed to that is
 
01:41:21.709 --> 01:41:21.719 align:start position:0%
an open question is sort of what's
 
01:41:23.669 --> 01:41:23.679 align:start position:0%
happening on some existing people UC
 
01:41:26.070 --> 01:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
dockets but when those dockets are
 
01:41:28.229 --> 01:41:28.239 align:start position:0%
resolved they will be taking into
 
01:41:30.189 --> 01:41:30.199 align:start position:0%
consideration the fact that Community
 
01:41:35.109 --> 01:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
power uh is operating in you know in the
 
01:41:37.510 --> 01:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
environment that we have today for um
 
01:41:39.550 --> 01:41:39.560 align:start position:0%
Power suppliers
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
so I I think that the original um
 
01:41:46.430 --> 01:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
purpose of the bill has not changed and
 
01:41:48.189 --> 01:41:48.199 align:start position:0%
that the delay is
 
01:41:49.890 --> 01:41:49.900 align:start position:0%
unnecessary without
 
01:41:49.900 --> 01:41:51.430 align:start position:0%
unnecessary without
[Music]

01:41:51.430 --> 01:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:41:53.990 --> 01:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
some objection that that
 
01:41:58.629 --> 01:41:58.639 align:start position:0%
actually um can be Quantified um because
 
01:42:00.430 --> 01:42:00.440 align:start position:0%
it it it does feel like it's sort of
 
01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:01.270 align:start position:0%
it it it does feel like it's sort of
being

01:42:01.270 --> 01:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:42:03.629 --> 01:42:03.639 align:start position:0%
derailed the the other argument that I
 
01:42:05.629 --> 01:42:05.639 align:start position:0%
think was thrown out was a concern for
 
01:42:08.030 --> 01:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
cost shifting and in speaking with the
 
01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
folks at Community power um what is in
 
01:42:15.070 --> 01:42:15.080 align:start position:0%
this bill says that any Financial
 
01:42:17.990 --> 01:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
transactions that happen between the
 
01:42:20.830 --> 01:42:20.840 align:start position:0%
municipal host and Community power are
 
01:42:22.750 --> 01:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
between those parties it has nothing to
 
01:42:26.589 --> 01:42:26.599 align:start position:0%
do with the default um provider so so
 
01:42:28.870 --> 01:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
rate payers uh of the utilities would
 
01:42:31.870 --> 01:42:31.880 align:start position:0%
not be affected in any way by any of
 
01:42:36.149 --> 01:42:36.159 align:start position:0%
these uh private contracts so I'm trying
 
01:42:38.470 --> 01:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
to figure out what it is we're trying to
 
01:42:43.109 --> 01:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
stop by um changing our position on the
 
01:42:45.310 --> 01:42:45.320 align:start position:0%
original Bill uh that sailed through the
 
01:42:47.350 --> 01:42:47.360 align:start position:0%
house because it was a good a good bit
 
01:42:52.109 --> 01:42:52.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:54.350 --> 01:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
legislation I know you said you didn't
 
01:42:57.709 --> 01:42:57.719 align:start position:0%
want to uh accuse this bill of being a
 
01:43:00.910 --> 01:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
smokescreen but you did which is
 
01:43:04.350 --> 01:43:04.360 align:start position:0%
probably not appropriate so let's try to
 
01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
keep that in mind as we make comments uh
 
01:43:10.870 --> 01:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
going forward it's not appropriate to
 
01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
malign the motivation or the intentions
 
01:43:17.910 --> 01:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
of a state department representative
 
01:43:21.830 --> 01:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair um well first
 
01:43:24.390 --> 01:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
of all I agree that the the section two
 
01:43:27.669 --> 01:43:27.679 align:start position:0%
technical housekeeping is um you know a
 
01:43:30.189 --> 01:43:30.199 align:start position:0%
uh something that normally happens in a
 
01:43:31.550 --> 01:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
build when we find that just for
 
01:43:32.830 --> 01:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
technical reasons we have to make a
 
01:43:34.470 --> 01:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
housekeeping change I don't have any
 
01:43:38.790 --> 01:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
problem with that um but as in sometimes
 
01:43:41.589 --> 01:43:41.599 align:start position:0%
you know in the fury of having public
 
01:43:44.109 --> 01:43:44.119 align:start position:0%
hearings in the house uh you know bills
 
01:43:45.709 --> 01:43:45.719 align:start position:0%
get passed and then because we think
 
01:43:47.669 --> 01:43:47.679 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's a good bill but then
 
01:43:49.870 --> 01:43:49.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes as time goes by and you hear
 
01:43:51.270 --> 01:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
other arguments coming from the other
 
01:43:53.669 --> 01:43:53.679 align:start position:0%
side of the curtain um you know you
 
01:43:55.510 --> 01:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
start to wonder gee maybe there was
 
01:43:57.870 --> 01:43:57.880 align:start position:0%
something we didn't quite understand and
 
01:44:00.669 --> 01:44:00.679 align:start position:0%
so I'm beginning to think that you know
 
01:44:03.390 --> 01:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
in this particular case uh the wisdom of
 
01:44:05.830 --> 01:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
the uh of our friends on on the other
 
01:44:07.750 --> 01:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
side to maybe step back and have a study
 
01:44:10.430 --> 01:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
committee just might be in order for
 
01:44:13.310 --> 01:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
something complicated as what's uh going
 
01:44:16.149 --> 01:44:16.159 align:start position:0%
on here so I would be more inclined to
 
01:44:19.629 --> 01:44:19.639 align:start position:0%
agree with um the chair that perhaps
 
01:44:20.990 --> 01:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
this might be the better course of
 
01:44:22.830 --> 01:44:22.840 align:start position:0%
action in this particular case because
 
01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:23.990 align:start position:0%
action in this particular case because
sometimes

01:44:23.990 --> 01:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
01:44:25.310 --> 01:44:25.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes we think something is really
 
01:44:28.149 --> 01:44:28.159 align:start position:0%
good and and then maybe after a while we
 
01:44:29.510 --> 01:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
discover well we hadn't thought about
 
01:44:31.830 --> 01:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
something and perhaps we need to step
 
01:44:34.950 --> 01:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
back so I'd be more inclined to uh to
 
01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:40.709 --> 01:44:40.719 align:start position:0%
side as uh a press release from the
 
01:44:43.229 --> 01:44:43.239 align:start position:0%
governor's office a week or so ago
 
01:44:43.239 --> 01:44:44.950 align:start position:0%
governor's office a week or so ago
pointed

01:44:44.950 --> 01:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
pointed
 
01:44:47.629 --> 01:44:47.639 align:start position:0%
out New Hampshire has done a very good
 
01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
job of
 
01:44:52.669 --> 01:44:52.679 align:start position:0%
managing what some people refer to as a
 
01:44:56.990 --> 01:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
trans transition in the energy
 
01:44:59.510 --> 01:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
economy and we've done that by paying
 
01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:00.510 align:start position:0%
economy and we've done that by paying
close

01:45:00.510 --> 01:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
close
 
01:45:03.109 --> 01:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
attention to what things
 
01:45:05.910 --> 01:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
cost and what the unintended
 
01:45:09.990 --> 01:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
consequences of policies might
 
01:45:12.950 --> 01:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
be the result of all that is that energy
 
01:45:15.470 --> 01:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
costs have been rising in New Hampshire
 
01:45:18.870 --> 01:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
much more slowly than they have been
 
01:45:22.229 --> 01:45:22.239 align:start position:0%
rising in the five other New England
 
01:45:22.239 --> 01:45:25.149 align:start position:0%
rising in the five other New England
states

01:45:25.149 --> 01:45:25.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:28.910 --> 01:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
and the difference is the direct result
 
01:45:30.510 --> 01:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
of the policy
 
01:45:35.189 --> 01:45:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:38.990 --> 01:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
made so I know the governor's office and
 
01:45:41.790 --> 01:45:41.800 align:start position:0%
the department of energy want to take a
 
01:45:45.310 --> 01:45:45.320 align:start position:0%
very careful and balanced
 
01:45:47.790 --> 01:45:47.800 align:start position:0%
approach to how we
 
01:45:50.390 --> 01:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
Implement policies to
 
01:45:55.589 --> 01:45:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:58.229 --> 01:45:58.239 align:start position:0%
with an eye toward
 
01:46:00.270 --> 01:46:00.280 align:start position:0%
protecting the people who have to pay
 
01:46:06.870 --> 01:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:09.149 --> 01:46:09.159 align:start position:0%
essentially so initially that's why I
 
01:46:11.109 --> 01:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
thought maybe a study committee might be
 
01:46:13.990 --> 01:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate to try to far it
 
01:46:19.149 --> 01:46:19.159 align:start position:0%
out whether this proposed legislative
 
01:46:21.910 --> 01:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
change would cost people
 
01:46:25.830 --> 01:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
money probably not utility rate payers
 
01:46:28.990 --> 01:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
but maybe Community power Coalition rate
 
01:46:31.709 --> 01:46:31.719 align:start position:0%
paays and to be
 
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
forthcoming I am chair of the eping
 
01:46:36.709 --> 01:46:36.719 align:start position:0%
energy aggregation committee and the
 
01:46:39.589 --> 01:46:39.599 align:start position:0%
town of eping will become is a community
 
01:46:42.790 --> 01:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
power Coalition member and will launch
 
01:46:46.270 --> 01:46:46.280 align:start position:0%
our own Community power uh program on
 
01:46:49.589 --> 01:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
October 1 of this year so that's my full
 
01:46:52.430 --> 01:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
disclosure with with regard to community
 
01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:53.990 align:start position:0%
disclosure with with regard to community
power

01:46:53.990 --> 01:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
power
 
01:46:57.750 --> 01:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
so I was initially uh persuaded that a
 
01:47:00.310 --> 01:47:00.320 align:start position:0%
study committee might be a
 
01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:02.390 align:start position:0%
study committee might be a
worthwhile

01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
worthwhile
 
01:47:06.070 --> 01:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
project but then I received email from
 
01:47:07.510 --> 01:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
the director of regulatory and
 
01:47:10.070 --> 01:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
legislative affairs at the community
 
01:47:11.950 --> 01:47:11.960 align:start position:0%
power Co
 
01:47:15.189 --> 01:47:15.199 align:start position:0%
Coalition who said that and this is a
 
01:47:17.830 --> 01:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
quote from the email we request that
 
01:47:20.510 --> 01:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
there not be a study committee included
 
01:47:24.270 --> 01:47:24.280 align:start position:0%
in such an agreement on quote and as
 
01:47:27.149 --> 01:47:27.159 align:start position:0%
representative Corman uh has already
 
01:47:29.229 --> 01:47:29.239 align:start position:0%
indicated the chance of this study
 
01:47:31.030 --> 01:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
committee producing a significant
 
01:47:34.430 --> 01:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
outcome seem to be
 
01:47:37.910 --> 01:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
slim given the fact that this is the
 
01:47:39.390 --> 01:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
second year of a
 
01:47:42.070 --> 01:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
banum in the fall people are going to be
 
01:47:46.270 --> 01:47:46.280 align:start position:0%
distracted by their own campaigns for
 
01:47:47.990 --> 01:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
reelection if they
 
01:47:51.149 --> 01:47:51.159 align:start position:0%
are amounting such a
 
01:47:55.189 --> 01:47:55.199 align:start position:0%
campaign so I now feel that a study
 
01:47:58.030 --> 01:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
committee might not be the best way to
 
01:48:01.589 --> 01:48:01.599 align:start position:0%
go for this particular bill I do think
 
01:48:04.109 --> 01:48:04.119 align:start position:0%
it's important to save the technical
 
01:48:06.350 --> 01:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
correction that's in section two of the
 
01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
bill but beyond that I think um there's
 
01:48:14.589 --> 01:48:14.599 align:start position:0%
not much else we can do this
 
01:48:17.629 --> 01:48:17.639 align:start position:0%
bym and we have to hope that we
 
01:48:21.629 --> 01:48:21.639 align:start position:0%
can work harder next year to come up
 
01:48:25.430 --> 01:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
with a uh strategy to fulfill the
 
01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
requirements of
 
01:48:30.589 --> 01:48:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:33.189 --> 01:48:33.199 align:start position:0%
proposal so the senate representative
 
01:48:35.310 --> 01:48:35.320 align:start position:0%
watus you have something to add to our
 
01:48:37.830 --> 01:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
conversation thanks Mr chairman and uh I
 
01:48:39.270 --> 01:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
I just want to start off by saying how
 
01:48:42.750 --> 01:48:42.760 align:start position:0%
much um it's appreciated all the house
 
01:48:47.070 --> 01:48:47.080 align:start position:0%
has done on community power and um the
 
01:48:50.750 --> 01:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
vvus of ideas sitting in the back there
 
01:48:52.350 --> 01:48:52.360 align:start position:0%
around this that we will have lots of
 
01:48:55.149 --> 01:48:55.159 align:start position:0%
chances discussed in the future so I I I
 
01:48:58.790 --> 01:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
do think that the chairman um suggest
 
01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
that it's good to good to get section
 
01:49:02.830 --> 01:49:02.840 align:start position:0%
two to on a technical fix and if that's
 
01:49:05.310 --> 01:49:05.320 align:start position:0%
what we do to save the bill maybe that's
 
01:49:06.950 --> 01:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
a good way to go is that fair enough Mr
 
01:49:09.109 --> 01:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
chairman yeah so I I think that that's
 
01:49:14.629 --> 01:49:14.639 align:start position:0%
what we could agree on is um uh to uh
 
01:49:17.030 --> 01:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
amended version of just section
 
01:49:20.950 --> 01:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
two okay representative McGee thank you
 
01:49:23.589 --> 01:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman since we have folks here in
 
01:49:25.510 --> 01:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
the audience who've come to the hearing
 
01:49:29.350 --> 01:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
um I I I'd like to take us just briefly
 
01:49:31.390 --> 01:49:31.400 align:start position:0%
to what what we're actually discussing
 
01:49:34.030 --> 01:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
for those who are watching at home the
 
01:49:36.189 --> 01:49:36.199 align:start position:0%
language that we're discussing not
 
01:49:38.030 --> 01:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
implementing that sailed through the
 
01:49:40.629 --> 01:49:40.639 align:start position:0%
house is when a municipal host as
 
01:49:44.510 --> 01:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
defined in RSA 362 consents to use its
 
01:49:47.830 --> 01:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
generation to offset the group load of a
 
01:49:50.550 --> 01:49:50.560 align:start position:0%
municipal or County aggregation and not
 
01:49:52.750 --> 01:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
one or more individual retail customer
 
01:49:55.910 --> 01:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
accounts then it shall be a customer of
 
01:49:58.589 --> 01:49:58.599 align:start position:0%
a municipal or County aggregation and
 
01:50:01.589 --> 01:50:01.599 align:start position:0%
not on utility default service with
 
01:50:03.709 --> 01:50:03.719 align:start position:0%
compensation for their output made
 
01:50:06.070 --> 01:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
pursuant to RSA
 
01:50:10.510 --> 01:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
362 so what we're saying is we can't
 
01:50:13.629 --> 01:50:13.639 align:start position:0%
agree that a group that we empowered in
 
01:50:15.270 --> 01:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
order to provide competition in the
 
01:50:18.229 --> 01:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
energy Market that pretty much all of
 
01:50:22.030 --> 01:50:22.040 align:start position:0%
our towns are currently engaging with um
 
01:50:24.189 --> 01:50:24.199 align:start position:0%
that we can't allow them to enter into
 
01:50:26.750 --> 01:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
this type of relationship because we're
 
01:50:30.189 --> 01:50:30.199 align:start position:0%
not sure how it will turn out when that
 
01:50:33.870 --> 01:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
is exactly what we asked them to do when
 
01:50:37.510 --> 01:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
we decided to put them into business in
 
01:50:39.350 --> 01:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
the state I I feel like it's a one step
 
01:50:41.830 --> 01:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
forward two steps back what we're doing
 
01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
to them because they've got Municipal
 
01:50:45.669 --> 01:50:45.679 align:start position:0%
hosts lined up that they're looking to
 
01:50:47.750 --> 01:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
work with and that has everything to do
 
01:50:49.310 --> 01:50:49.320 align:start position:0%
with whether or not they can bring down
 
01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
costs right they're not they're not
 
01:50:54.350 --> 01:50:54.360 align:start position:0%
magicians they're asking us to
 
01:50:57.589 --> 01:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
enable Partnerships that should have
 
01:51:00.950 --> 01:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
been defined when we passed 315 but we
 
01:51:02.870 --> 01:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
didn't think of them you know we didn't
 
01:51:05.470 --> 01:51:05.480 align:start position:0%
think to include that language so that's
 
01:51:07.390 --> 01:51:07.400 align:start position:0%
why I said I thought section one was
 
01:51:12.030 --> 01:51:12.040 align:start position:0%
also a housekeeping item and I'm still
 
01:51:14.430 --> 01:51:14.440 align:start position:0%
haven't heard maybe we should hear from
 
01:51:18.069 --> 01:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
doe what objections
 
01:51:20.390 --> 01:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
or cost
 
01:51:22.910 --> 01:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
concerns uh could get in the way of us
 
01:51:24.629 --> 01:51:24.639 align:start position:0%
being able to pass this now rather than
 
01:51:26.550 --> 01:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
delaying I I know there's been a lot of
 
01:51:27.870 --> 01:51:27.880 align:start position:0%
conversation about the easiest thing to
 
01:51:29.669 --> 01:51:29.679 align:start position:0%
do is just pass section two and be done
 
01:51:33.589 --> 01:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
with it but I came here today hoping
 
01:51:34.910 --> 01:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
that we would have a more fome
 
01:51:39.470 --> 01:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
conversation about the goal of this bill
 
01:51:43.229 --> 01:51:43.239 align:start position:0%
um because again it's a one step forward
 
01:51:45.870 --> 01:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
two steps back for a business a
 
01:51:48.270 --> 01:51:48.280 align:start position:0%
nonprofit that's trying to create
 
01:51:50.030 --> 01:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
competition in our energy Market to
 
01:51:51.750 --> 01:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
lower costs that's what we ask them to
 
01:51:54.189 --> 01:51:54.199 align:start position:0%
do that's what we celebrated when we
 
01:51:56.550 --> 01:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
passed 315 and now they're coming back
 
01:51:58.990 --> 01:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
to us saying this type of a relationship
 
01:52:01.870 --> 01:52:01.880 align:start position:0%
is something that we should be enabl to
 
01:52:03.790 --> 01:52:03.800 align:start position:0%
do and it should should be in statute so
 
01:52:06.390 --> 01:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
that it's clear how that works and we're
 
01:52:08.430 --> 01:52:08.440 align:start position:0%
saying this clear language this simple
 
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
language about this relationship we
 
01:52:14.990 --> 01:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
can't figure it out and I I just
 
01:52:17.350 --> 01:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
fundamentally disagree with that I think
 
01:52:20.350 --> 01:52:20.360 align:start position:0%
I think it's it is as simple as it looks
 
01:52:23.350 --> 01:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
so I'm just throwing it out there
 
01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
okay further comment representative
 
01:52:28.030 --> 01:52:28.040 align:start position:0%
Corbin thank you uh to what
 
01:52:29.669 --> 01:52:29.679 align:start position:0%
representative McGee just said I would
 
01:52:31.669 --> 01:52:31.679 align:start position:0%
add one other thing which is one of the
 
01:52:34.709 --> 01:52:34.719 align:start position:0%
objections that Doe raised was what
 
01:52:37.189 --> 01:52:37.199 align:start position:0%
happens when there are multiple
 
01:52:40.629 --> 01:52:40.639 align:start position:0%
utilities involved and the amendment
 
01:52:44.430 --> 01:52:44.440 align:start position:0%
that Mr Belo suggested to the senate enr
 
01:52:47.189 --> 01:52:47.199 align:start position:0%
committee actually took care of that and
 
01:52:48.830 --> 01:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
and said that all the customers
 
01:52:51.550 --> 01:52:51.560 align:start position:0%
comprising the load being offset are you
 
01:52:53.870 --> 01:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
located in the same utility service
 
01:52:57.069 --> 01:52:57.079 align:start position:0%
territory so that particular objection
 
01:53:00.109 --> 01:53:00.119 align:start position:0%
could have been answered had the Senate
 
01:53:02.950 --> 01:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
considered that particular
 
01:53:06.069 --> 01:53:06.079 align:start position:0%
Amendment okay thank you any further
 
01:53:08.270 --> 01:53:08.280 align:start position:0%

we are going to resume the committee of
 
02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:46.430 align:start position:0%
we are going to resume the committee of
conference

02:00:46.430 --> 02:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
conference
 
02:00:49.310 --> 02:00:49.320 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
02:00:53.589 --> 02:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
1600 and I am going to move
 
02:00:56.229 --> 02:00:56.239 align:start position:0%
that this Committee of conference adopt
 
02:01:00.109 --> 02:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
an amendment to the entire bill that
 
02:01:04.990 --> 02:01:05.000 align:start position:0%
preserves the content of section two of
 
02:01:07.629 --> 02:01:07.639 align:start position:0%
the original House
 
02:01:10.270 --> 02:01:10.280 align:start position:0%
Bill and section three the effective
 
02:01:12.990 --> 02:01:13.000 align:start position:0%
date of the original House bill that
 
02:01:14.790 --> 02:01:14.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment would of course renumber these
 
02:01:17.669 --> 02:01:17.679 align:start position:0%
two sections to one and
 
02:01:22.790 --> 02:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
two do I have a second to that motion
 
02:01:28.950 --> 02:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
seconded by Senator Waters any if I may
 
02:01:32.510 --> 02:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
Senator Purl I believe procedurally you
 
02:01:34.270 --> 02:01:34.280 align:start position:0%
have to vote on it and then we have to
 
02:01:36.109 --> 02:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
vote on it separately so I think you
 
02:01:37.390 --> 02:01:37.400 align:start position:0%
your second would have to come from the
 
02:01:39.910 --> 02:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
house side okay sorry about that so do I
 
02:01:41.669 --> 02:01:41.679 align:start position:0%

02:01:43.709 --> 02:01:43.719 align:start position:0%
member of the House Representative
 
02:01:47.430 --> 02:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
