00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 align:start position:0%
we might be a little light on the
 
00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 align:start position:0%
attendance today but we'll motor on
 
00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
so we do have enough people there one
 
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 align:start position:0%
okay great
 
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
um okay so we will now open the public
 
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 445 and the chair
 
00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 align:start position:0%
will recognize representative ulery to
 
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill although I will need
 
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for the record my
 
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
name is Jordan ulery Hillsborough 13 in
 
00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:41.759 align:start position:0%
the town of Hudson
 
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 align:start position:0%
um this past summer I sat on a uh
 
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
commission to discuss some of the issues
 
00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 align:start position:0%
surrounding uh oplc I think I finally
 
00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
got those acronym down
 
00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:53.749 align:start position:0%
got those acronym down
um

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 align:start position:0%
in that we came up with a uh
 
00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:01.259 align:start position:0%
series of issues I won't say problems
 
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 align:start position:0%
because they they're surmountable uh
 
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 align:start position:0%
issues uh faced by oplc one of which was
 
00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
the mandatory requirement in current law
 
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
that any excess funds is are lapsed into
 
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
the general fund at the end of the uh
 
00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.590 align:start position:0%
the general fund at the end of the uh
biennium

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:18.600 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
which means that there's Gap years that
 
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
exist because they've got access funds
 
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.220 align:start position:0%
so the excess funds have to be lapsed
 
00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
back into the general fund
 
00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:29.629 align:start position:0%
back into the general fund
so

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
one of the ways to continue their
 
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
process in order to make sure that they
 
00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
have money for investigators when people
 
00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:40.199 align:start position:0%
make allegations against licensed
 
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
individuals uh so that they can continue
 
00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
to operate their various operations
 
00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:49.189 align:start position:0%
to operate their various operations
including

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
including
 
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
issuing new licenses and organizing the
 
00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.930 align:start position:0%
issuing new licenses and organizing the
board

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:53.940 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
extra funds are required
 
00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.340 align:start position:0%
they estimate that it costs them around
 
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:02.580 align:start position:0%
three to five million dollars uh every
 
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:05.660 align:start position:0%
year to fill in these funds therefore
 
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
we've decided the the commission decided
 
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
we split up different tasks you will
 
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:13.860 align:start position:0%
notice throughout the calendar uh
 
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.300 align:start position:0%
several different bills that are going
 
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
to be coming up including one which is a
 
00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
massive reorganization recodification
 
00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:21.050 align:start position:0%
massive reorganization recodification
bill

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:21.060 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
uh that is being handled by Edna which
 
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.010 align:start position:0%
uh that is being handled by Edna which
is

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:25.020 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:28.500 align:start position:0%
one as as is a result of the work that
 
00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:30.539 align:start position:0%
we did over the summer which you know
 
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
two or three times a week we got
 
00:07:35.409 --> 00:07:35.419 align:start position:0%
together with uh oplc staff and
 
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
shareholders and got their input some of
 
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:40.740 align:start position:0%
the stuff that you see in the uh
 
00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
Governor's budget uh
 
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
I would be willing to say came out of
 
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
the discussions that we held although I
 
00:07:49.249 --> 00:07:49.259 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:50.460 align:start position:0%
for sure
 
00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:52.919 align:start position:0%
but those were certainly some of the
 
00:07:55.089 --> 00:07:55.099 align:start position:0%
things that we discussed
 
00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
I would remind people that the L and
 
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:01.860 align:start position:0%
oplc stands for licensure licensure by
 
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
definition means the ability to do
 
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:06.900 align:start position:0%
something that is otherwise illegal to
 
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.809 align:start position:0%
something that is otherwise illegal to
do

00:08:08.809 --> 00:08:08.819 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:10.860 align:start position:0%
we've all received
 
00:08:12.309 --> 00:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
um emails
 
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
a literal interpret interpretation of
 
00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:20.580 align:start position:0%
granting the license
 
00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039 align:start position:0%
to a person to plant the rose bush means
 
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
that you couldn't take care of your own
 
00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.490 align:start position:0%
that you couldn't take care of your own
roses

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
roses
 
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:28.860 align:start position:0%
or tulips or whatever but that's aside
 
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:31.860 align:start position:0%
from what this bill is it's just
 
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:34.200 align:start position:0%
a generalized discussion of it there's a
 
00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:36.419 align:start position:0%
difference between certification which
 
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:38.820 align:start position:0%
is a qualification to do something and
 
00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:41.039 align:start position:0%
licensure which is permission to do that
 
00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:44.039 align:start position:0%
which is otherwise illegal to do
 
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:47.220 align:start position:0%
so uh just so the language is is
 
00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:48.959 align:start position:0%
straight you'll notice this
 
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
commissioning was bipartisan this bill
 
00:08:53.769 --> 00:08:53.779 align:start position:0%
is bipartisan uh happy to sponsor it
 
00:08:58.009 --> 00:08:58.019 align:start position:0%
basically it sets up a non-lapsing fund
 
00:08:58.019 --> 00:08:59.030 align:start position:0%
basically it sets up a non-lapsing fund
um

00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
in general which passed the DNA
 
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
committee they've the Edna committee
 
00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:07.519 align:start position:0%
requested that we put a cap on that
 
00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:12.180 align:start position:0%
which is in Amendment uh uh zero three
 
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
three two H which you should have
 
00:09:19.009 --> 00:09:19.019 align:start position:0%
received today single page handout
 
00:09:19.019 --> 00:09:20.030 align:start position:0%
received today single page handout
um

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
which is there I had the opportunity to
 
00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:24.540 align:start position:0%
spend some time with Senator Lang
 
00:09:28.389 --> 00:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
formerly of this committee and his bill
 
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
apparently he uh forgot to signed on to
 
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
any DNA are in his ways and means uh
 
00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:40.620 align:start position:0%
committee uh sets up the same thing they
 
00:09:42.769 --> 00:09:42.779 align:start position:0%
added an amendment on to their bill
 
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:47.580 align:start position:0%
which requires reporting by oplc I just
 
00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:50.360 align:start position:0%
spoke and it seems as all that would be
 
00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
an acceptable the two can be easily
 
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
merged together at some time whether the
 
00:09:59.690 --> 00:09:59.700 align:start position:0%
commedia conference or uh we adapt his
 
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
language or he adapts our language or
 
00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:03.660 align:start position:0%
something like that but it would seem to
 
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
me that it would be both meeting the
 
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
needs of the Edna committee which wanted
 
00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
a cap on the amount of funds that would
 
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
be retained by oplc and a
 
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
a reporting of the expenditures of the
 
00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:21.180 align:start position:0%
funds both to me sound like an excellent
 
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:23.700 align:start position:0%
idea uh particularly since there has
 
00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:27.240 align:start position:0%
been some question regarding uh uh how
 
00:10:29.449 --> 00:10:29.459 align:start position:0%
this operates uh one of the other bills
 
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
we talked about was uh just recently was
 
00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:33.300 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:34.980 align:start position:0%
um public race
 
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
um public notice of meetings which uh
 
00:10:41.329 --> 00:10:41.339 align:start position:0%
communication was an issue within oplc
 
00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:45.060 align:start position:0%
which uh the the commissioner uh readily
 
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh agreed that it was an issue and some
 
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:50.820 align:start position:0%
of the uh boards were acting more
 
00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:52.740 align:start position:0%
independently than they were working
 
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
within the overall structure but
 
00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:58.140 align:start position:0%
basically what this bill does is one
 
00:11:00.769 --> 00:11:00.779 align:start position:0%
small part of a larger part that's going
 
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:03.180 align:start position:0%
to mesh together and come up the idea is
 
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:04.980 align:start position:0%
to have it separate from the budget in
 
00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:07.100 align:start position:0%
statutory law regarding how it operates
 
00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:10.740 align:start position:0%
and give each one of the sections a good
 
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
looking over as we go through and then
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
mesh them all together mash them up and
 
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
come up with something
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
so with that Madam chair I would be
 
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
happy to answer limited questions but I
 
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
would prefer to defer the operation of
 
00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
oplc and how this fund would operate to
 
00:11:32.329 --> 00:11:32.339 align:start position:0%
the uh the staff
 
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
questions for the sponsor
 
00:11:37.069 --> 00:11:37.079 align:start position:0%
oh representative alberger
 
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:38.700 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I actually have
 
00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
two questions and they're not related so
 
00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
if you want to separate them that's fine
 
00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:46.380 align:start position:0%
um I'm confused about two things and
 
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
I'll just do one at a time
 
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.690 align:start position:0%
I'll just do one at a time
um

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:50.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
there is a lapse at the end of the
 
00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:54.170 align:start position:0%
there is a lapse at the end of the
biennium

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:54.180 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:11:58.850 --> 00:11:58.860 align:start position:0%
correct currently yes and
 
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
I'm confused as to
 
00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.190 align:start position:0%
I'm confused as to
why

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
given that we set up a budget now for
 
00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:10.260 align:start position:0%
the next two years why that same process
 
00:12:14.569 --> 00:12:14.579 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be happening for the oplc so
 
00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:16.980 align:start position:0%
there shouldn't be a lapse in funding
 
00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:20.220 align:start position:0%
just as with any other department
 
00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:22.140 align:start position:0%
other departments do have carryover
 
00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:23.389 align:start position:0%
other departments do have carryover
funding

00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
uh oplc doesn't everything that they
 
00:12:28.009 --> 00:12:28.019 align:start position:0%
have lapses at the end of two years
 
00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
which then leaves them with a gap year
 
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
I'll let oplc discuss that in more
 
00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:36.180 align:start position:0%
detail as to how it operates if you
 
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
don't mind representative
 
00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.710 align:start position:0%
don't mind representative
follow-up

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:12:42.769 --> 00:12:42.779 align:start position:0%
um actually separate I'm also trying to
 
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
figure out what kind of capital
 
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
expenditures are involved
 
00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.550 align:start position:0%
expenditures are involved
bunches

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
bunches
 
00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:52.200 align:start position:0%
I would like to hear more about them and
 
00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:53.700 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that the commissioner will be
 
00:12:56.269 --> 00:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
happy to explain thank you thank you
 
00:12:56.279 --> 00:12:57.590 align:start position:0%
happy to explain thank you thank you
representative

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
yes we just passed a revenue estimate
 
00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:03.060 align:start position:0%
and did any of that Revenue estimate
 
00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:05.519 align:start position:0%
include uh
 
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
monies into the general fund from oplc
 
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
uh and I'm sure it's minuscule but is
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
there any at all you know they uh during
 
00:13:17.569 --> 00:13:17.579 align:start position:0%
this this summer we learned that it goes
 
00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:20.220 align:start position:0%
for a two three million dollars it's you
 
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
know omniscal monies come back it
 
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
depends on how many licenses are issued
 
00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:27.060 align:start position:0%
it's a very flu it's a very Flex term
 
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
how much money is around when it's
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
around at the end of the biennium
 
00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
um it's kind of like uh we used to have
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
a uh uh a tax in in the state that was
 
00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
based on a product on site
 
00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:42.110 align:start position:0%
based on a product on site
and

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:44.569 --> 00:13:44.579 align:start position:0%
the stuff got moved the day that they
 
00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
took inventory and then it got moved
 
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
back the day after they took inventory
 
00:13:51.889 --> 00:13:51.899 align:start position:0%
uh and that's kind of uh what happens
 
00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:00.660 align:start position:0%
other questions representative all me
 
00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.030 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
um

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.889 align:start position:0%
 
this

00:14:06.889 --> 00:14:06.899 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
how much
 
00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:11.629 align:start position:0%
how much
um

00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
is the total
 
00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:14.870 align:start position:0%
is the total
um

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
total amount of of
 
00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:21.170 align:start position:0%
total amount of of
fees

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:21.180 align:start position:0%
fees
 
00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
what's What's the total intake of the of
 
00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:26.459 align:start position:0%
the is is this supposed to be a
 
00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:29.700 align:start position:0%
department it's an office right
 
00:14:32.269 --> 00:14:32.279 align:start position:0%
the exact number are what the
 
00:14:34.009 --> 00:14:34.019 align:start position:0%
commissioner discussed that with you
 
00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
what I will say is that uh these very
 
00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:39.300 align:start position:0%
according to
 
00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:40.129 align:start position:0%
according to
um

00:14:40.129 --> 00:14:40.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:42.060 align:start position:0%
how many people are applying for license
 
00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:45.300 align:start position:0%
how much money is expended in order to
 
00:14:49.009 --> 00:14:49.019 align:start position:0%
for example we learned that uh one of
 
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
the smaller licensed agencies is
 
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.189 align:start position:0%
the smaller licensed agencies is
Midwifery

00:14:52.189 --> 00:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
Midwifery
 
00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:54.500 align:start position:0%
we used to get a report from Midwifery
 
00:14:58.189 --> 00:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
remember it was real small but the
 
00:14:59.750 --> 00:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
largest number of complaints comes from
 
00:15:01.009 --> 00:15:01.019 align:start position:0%
that department
 
00:15:01.019 --> 00:15:02.569 align:start position:0%
that department
why

00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:02.579 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:04.500 align:start position:0%
oh I could say something but I won't
 
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
I'll get in trouble but uh
 
00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.170 align:start position:0%
I'll get in trouble but uh
it's

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:09.180 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
that's that's what happens uh they need
 
00:15:14.509 --> 00:15:14.519 align:start position:0%
extra funds from there so it gets taken
 
00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:17.420 align:start position:0%
from others so as to the equity
 
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:20.940 align:start position:0%
equitability of the application of
 
00:15:23.449 --> 00:15:23.459 align:start position:0%
license fees to other individuals into
 
00:15:29.329 --> 00:15:29.339 align:start position:0%
visuals within the uh Universe of oplc
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
um this is a a method of smoothing that
 
00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:36.300 align:start position:0%
out and being able to maintain uh what
 
00:15:38.569 --> 00:15:38.579 align:start position:0%
the lower numbers which
 
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
would include Landscape Architects for
 
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
example uh regarding complaints and
 
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
investigations and having to deal with
 
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
this that whatever that comes up with a
 
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
professional board
 
00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.009 align:start position:0%
professional board
um

00:15:52.009 --> 00:15:52.019 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:53.940 align:start position:0%
their costs are going to be lower
 
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
therefore their license is going to be
 
00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
lower but they're actually paying more
 
00:15:59.449 --> 00:15:59.459 align:start position:0%
now because they need to shift some of
 
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:01.980 align:start position:0%
the money from them and everyone else in
 
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
order to pay for activities regarding
 
00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
this particular uh profession or that
 
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
particular profession wherever they have
 
00:16:11.689 --> 00:16:11.699 align:start position:0%
it happens to be the target at the
 
00:16:14.329 --> 00:16:14.339 align:start position:0%
current time so this is a buffer if you
 
00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:18.300 align:start position:0%
will to allow uh being able to handle
 
00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:20.660 align:start position:0%
those uh
 
00:16:23.569 --> 00:16:23.579 align:start position:0%
transitory complaints
 
00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:25.860 align:start position:0%
did I say that right did you have a
 
00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:30.889 align:start position:0%
did I say that right did you have a
follow-up

00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:30.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:37.069 --> 00:16:37.079 align:start position:0%
uh that the boards have more duties more
 
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
benefits uh than just on listening to to
 
00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
the complaints and dealing with them yes
 
00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:47.820 align:start position:0%
we went into uh there's a lot of
 
00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
information that the people in the
 
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:53.940 align:start position:0%
professions want to yes yes and the the
 
00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:55.620 align:start position:0%
boards that were present in part in
 
00:16:58.490 --> 00:16:58.500 align:start position:0%
partokan the discussion were largely in
 
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
favor of uh the the uh construct and and
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
supported the idea of keeping their
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
license fees uh for their entities
 
00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:10.620 align:start position:0%
rather than shifting uh the cost to
 
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
cover some of the others as the uh as
 
00:17:18.169 --> 00:17:18.179 align:start position:0%
the needs uh to investigate this that or
 
00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
something else took place
 
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:21.949 align:start position:0%
something else took place
um

00:17:21.949 --> 00:17:21.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:26.689 --> 00:17:26.699 align:start position:0%
the uh or initial uh
 
00:17:30.169 --> 00:17:30.179 align:start position:0%
uh fiscal note regarding uh Florida here
 
00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:32.100 align:start position:0%
down in finance just the other day on on
 
00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:35.100 align:start position:0%
the 91 a issues the fiscal note got
 
00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:37.260 align:start position:0%
wrong you notice that there's a
 
00:17:39.289 --> 00:17:39.299 align:start position:0%
minuscule fiscal note attached to this
 
00:17:39.299 --> 00:17:40.310 align:start position:0%
minuscule fiscal note attached to this
which

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.930 align:start position:0%
which
uh

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:41.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
it's you know doesn't say much of
 
00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:46.010 align:start position:0%
it's you know doesn't say much of
anything

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:46.020 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
um but because there's not much of
 
00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
anything to say uh this is a retained
 
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
fund and Reporting on it would make
 
00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
sense and having a fixed amount than
 
00:17:59.810 --> 00:17:59.820 align:start position:0%
anything in excess of that so that the
 
00:18:03.529 --> 00:18:03.539 align:start position:0%
agency does not uh over indulge if you
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
will uh is uh
 
00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
so representative Platt yes um
 
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
represent representative Oliver you said
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
that the Senate has passed a similar
 
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
version bill because I I think you said
 
00:18:27.289 --> 00:18:27.299 align:start position:0%
that it came out of ways and means over
 
00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:29.340 align:start position:0%
there anyway the other body
 
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
that's correct that came out of waste
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
means Tim Lang's committee
 
00:18:36.529 --> 00:18:36.539 align:start position:0%
um Senator Lang's committee yeah
 
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
and uh it'll go to the Senate on
 
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:40.549 align:start position:0%
and uh it'll go to the Senate on
Thursday

00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
Thursday
 
00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:43.860 align:start position:0%
all right so my quit the question I was
 
00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:46.799 align:start position:0%
really asking is if they did pass it and
 
00:18:48.049 --> 00:18:48.059 align:start position:0%
it's going to come over here we could
 
00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:50.039 align:start position:0%
Amendment why do we need this bill
 
00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:51.780 align:start position:0%
why could we just pull this bill and let
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
wait for the Senate version and amend it
 
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
for a couple of reasons one of which if
 
00:18:59.870 --> 00:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
we put our position on regarding the cap
 
00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
on the amount of monies within the bill
 
00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:04.980 align:start position:0%
then we can put the two together but uh
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
and as I said earlier there is per there
 
00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:09.900 align:start position:0%
are Provisions within Senator langsville
 
00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:11.940 align:start position:0%
that were not included in this bill
 
00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:14.700 align:start position:0%
although he's a close uh co-sponsor of
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
this bill that need to be merged
 
00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
together but we need to get set our
 
00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:20.700 align:start position:0%
position so that we can discuss it with
 
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:22.380 align:start position:0%
their position so we can come up with a
 
00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:24.660 align:start position:0%
joint position so we can have a position
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:31.980 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative Phyllis
 
00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:35.820 align:start position:0%
I have a lot of questions but the only
 
00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:38.700 align:start position:0%
one I want to ask now is it has to do
 
00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:39.770 align:start position:0%
one I want to ask now is it has to do
with

00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:39.780 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:41.940 align:start position:0%
the the timing
 
00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:44.460 align:start position:0%
of this so
 
00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
it says effective it it's an FN bill
 
00:19:51.529 --> 00:19:51.539 align:start position:0%
which I thought meant we needed to have
 
00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
taken care of it
 
00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.350 align:start position:0%
taken care of it
quickly

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:56.220 align:start position:0%
but this is the second committee so we
 
00:19:59.390 --> 00:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
gotta because it's FN it has to be taken
 
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
care of quickly
 
00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:05.700 align:start position:0%
but the effective date is 60 days after
 
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
passage and I'm just confused of how
 
00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.190 align:start position:0%
passage and I'm just confused of how
that

00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:12.289 --> 00:20:12.299 align:start position:0%
would even work because that doesn't
 
00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
that gets into the following biennium
 
00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
and just
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
now it creates the fun that's all it
 
00:20:19.919 --> 00:20:21.250 align:start position:0%
now it creates the fun that's all it
does

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:21.260 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
and you're creating the fund the fund
 
00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:28.260 align:start position:0%
will could be set up by uh dra
 
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
today it's the lapsing part that it
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't go to
 
00:20:36.049 --> 00:20:36.059 align:start position:0%
yeah when would it lapse it would lapse
 
00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:49.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:55.559 align:start position:0%
excellent question anything else from
 
00:20:58.610 --> 00:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
the committee okay seeing none thank you
 
00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:00.660 align:start position:0%

cannot read your last name Lindsay I
 
00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:11.820 align:start position:0%

well that's my apology Madam chair I
 
00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:16.140 align:start position:0%
have terrible handwriting
 
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair members of the
 
00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:20.039 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
Lindsay Courtney I am the executive
 
00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:23.400 align:start position:0%
director of The Office of professional
 
00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
lace Insurance certification and wish to
 
00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:28.140 align:start position:0%
thank representative ulery for bringing
 
00:21:30.649 --> 00:21:30.659 align:start position:0%
this bill forward we are fully in
 
00:21:33.409 --> 00:21:33.419 align:start position:0%
support of this bill just to take a step
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
back oplc is
 
00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
um completely agency funded we don't
 
00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:41.460 align:start position:0%
receive any general funds we don't
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
receive any funds from any other source
 
00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
other than licensing fees with the
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
exception of on occasion
 
00:21:51.289 --> 00:21:51.299 align:start position:0%
um fees or fines administrative fines we
 
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
also receive
 
00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
some funds from the Department of Health
 
00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
and Human Services because we perform
 
00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:01.860 align:start position:0%
certain tasks on their behalf as part of
 
00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
compliance with CMS regulations but by
 
00:22:07.029 --> 00:22:07.039 align:start position:0%
and large we are completely fully
 
00:22:09.409 --> 00:22:09.419 align:start position:0%
self-funded agency
 
00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:11.580 align:start position:0%
our budget is typically approximately
 
00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:15.860 align:start position:0%
13.5 million dollars our Revenue varies
 
00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:19.799 align:start position:0%
fairly substantially because our renewal
 
00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:23.460 align:start position:0%
time periods are inconsistent we have
 
00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:25.860 align:start position:0%
some months that are incredibly high in
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
terms of renewals and then some months
 
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
where we don't receive many renewals at
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
all most of our licensees renew within a
 
00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:35.700 align:start position:0%
biennium although that up until recently
 
00:22:37.549 --> 00:22:37.559 align:start position:0%
we did have several license types that
 
00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
renewed every three years which created
 
00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.730 align:start position:0%
renewed every three years which created
a

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:40.740 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:42.559 align:start position:0%
you know varying
 
00:22:45.529 --> 00:22:45.539 align:start position:0%
varying degrees of Revenue over the
 
00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
course of several years
 
00:22:51.529 --> 00:22:51.539 align:start position:0%
our fund is already a dedicated fund the
 
00:22:54.529 --> 00:22:54.539 align:start position:0%
purpose of our fund is solely to provide
 
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
for the operational expenses of the
 
00:22:59.149 --> 00:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
office which is really to give back to
 
00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:00.900 align:start position:0%
the licensees and making sure that we're
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
administratively supporting the boards
 
00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:04.740 align:start position:0%
within the office
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
right now however our fund's significant
 
00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:09.780 align:start position:0%
portion of our funds lapse to the
 
00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
general fund the change to the lapse uh
 
00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
at the at the biennium card last year up
 
00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:18.780 align:start position:0%
until that point our Labs had occurred
 
00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:20.460 align:start position:0%
every fiscal year
 
00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
and to give you an idea in 2016 we
 
00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:29.720 align:start position:0%
lapsed 4.7 million 2017 5.5 2018 5.5
 
00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
2019 we didn't lapse anything because
 
00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:34.799 align:start position:0%
there was a change in the statute 2020
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
relapsed 6.9 2021 four million dollars
 
00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
and last year we left 6 3.6 this is
 
00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:44.220 align:start position:0%
problematic when you consider the fact
 
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:46.380 align:start position:0%
that our budget is only 13.5 million
 
00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:48.860 align:start position:0%
dollars we are lapsing a large
 
00:23:51.289 --> 00:23:51.299 align:start position:0%
significant portion of that into the
 
00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:53.820 align:start position:0%
general fund so it's in essence our
 
00:23:55.669 --> 00:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
licensee dollars are being utilized for
 
00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:57.900 align:start position:0%
general fund purposes which obviously is
 
00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
not the intent of our licensing fees
 
00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:02.460 align:start position:0%
we believe it's important for us to
 
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
retain the licensee phase for two
 
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
purposes one that would allow us to
 
00:24:08.649 --> 00:24:08.659 align:start position:0%
essentially reduce fees if appropriate
 
00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
and two be able to save for Capital
 
00:24:13.789 --> 00:24:13.799 align:start position:0%
expenditures those would typically
 
00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
include software updates
 
00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
um obviously that costs a significant
 
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
sum of money so we need to be able to
 
00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
save for that and then two
 
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
we are looking into other alternatives
 
00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:29.820 align:start position:0%
for physical location that is not least
 
00:24:33.409 --> 00:24:33.419 align:start position:0%
space because presently we are paying a
 
00:24:36.289 --> 00:24:36.299 align:start position:0%
significant sum toward our lease so
 
00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:37.980 align:start position:0%
those are the two Capital expenditures
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
which I can think that we would say for
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
but it's very important that the office
 
00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:44.460 align:start position:0%
be able to maintain some buffer because
 
00:24:46.909 --> 00:24:46.919 align:start position:0%
we do see inconsistencies in our Revenue
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
that are at times driven by the market
 
00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:51.900 align:start position:0%
for example real estate when Real Estate
 
00:24:54.529 --> 00:24:54.539 align:start position:0%
is is really hot and the market is going
 
00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:56.580 align:start position:0%
well we see an influx of applicants so
 
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
we see an influx in fees but we also see
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
an influx in the need for the support
 
00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:03.780 align:start position:0%
that we provide we need to be able to
 
00:25:06.649 --> 00:25:06.659 align:start position:0%
respond to that additionally unlike
 
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
other agencies on July 1 we start with
 
00:25:11.169 --> 00:25:11.179 align:start position:0%
zero dollars we have no money
 
00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
and July is not a renewal time frame so
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
it it's difficult for us obviously to
 
00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
maintain our expenditures fortunately we
 
00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:24.900 align:start position:0%
can make payroll even though we do not
 
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
have the money to cover that because of
 
00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:29.700 align:start position:0%
the rsas surrounding that but it is
 
00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:31.380 align:start position:0%
important for us and I think for the
 
00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
agency operations to be able to have
 
00:25:36.409 --> 00:25:36.419 align:start position:0%
some buffer some funds in the bank
 
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
and then lastly I would just say again
 
00:25:41.149 --> 00:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
that the purpose of our funds is not to
 
00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:43.980 align:start position:0%
fund anything other than the office and
 
00:25:45.409 --> 00:25:45.419 align:start position:0%
so to the extent that we could reduce
 
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
those fees modify fees making sure that
 
00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
we're not you know taxing people
 
00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:53.220 align:start position:0%
inappropriately that is really the
 
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
intent behind this bill would that be
 
00:25:58.370 --> 00:25:58.380 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any other questions
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Platt
 
00:26:03.049 --> 00:26:03.059 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for letting me
 
00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:04.740 align:start position:0%
take make the question thank you for
 
00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:07.020 align:start position:0%
taking it Miss Courtney
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
if my mathematical mind says that this
 
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
is essentially a one-time loss of five
 
00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:14.940 align:start position:0%
million bucks maybe to the estate in
 
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:16.559 align:start position:0%
front from there now it's the same
 
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
because we're just allowing you to keep
 
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
a buffer is that right
 
00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:25.430 align:start position:0%
a buffer is that right
correct

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
representative rodford
 
00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:29.220 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you director
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
Courtney I just want to and and just for
 
00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:34.500 align:start position:0%
the record I I am licensed by oplc uh I
 
00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:35.940 align:start position:0%
have a professional pharmacist license
 
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
and I I do want to hit on something that
 
00:26:41.029 --> 00:26:41.039 align:start position:0%
representative ulery talked about but
 
00:26:42.409 --> 00:26:42.419 align:start position:0%
it's because it's something I think that
 
00:26:45.409 --> 00:26:45.419 align:start position:0%
that warrants discussion in that you've
 
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
got a number of boards that are charged
 
00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:49.740 align:start position:0%
all kinds of fees
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%
um and it sounds like some boards and
 
00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:55.860 align:start position:0%
some professions utilize oplc perhaps
 
00:26:58.909 --> 00:26:58.919 align:start position:0%
more than others yet
 
00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
some professions like mine we pay a lot
 
00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799 align:start position:0%
of money for our licenses you know I
 
00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:06.900 align:start position:0%
know like he mentioned Midwifery I think
 
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
they're 136 dollars for a license my
 
00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:11.820 align:start position:0%
license is 278 dollars we charge two
 
00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for a non-resident
 
00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:16.140 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy to just mail penicillin in in
 
00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
into the state so I looking at this bill
 
00:27:21.409 --> 00:27:21.419 align:start position:0%
I think it's a good time for us to
 
00:27:26.029 --> 00:27:26.039 align:start position:0%
understand really how this would provide
 
00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:28.980 align:start position:0%
more Equitable uh allocations of fees
 
00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
and how we can reduce fees so have have
 
00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
you do we have a plan or do you have a
 
00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:36.900 align:start position:0%
plan that would would take us past this
 
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
bill into what what operationally we
 
00:27:42.169 --> 00:27:42.179 align:start position:0%
would see to do that certainly and thank
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
you representative for the question this
 
00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:46.340 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't directly address allocation
 
00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
of indirect costs or costs back to the
 
00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:53.460 align:start position:0%
boards allocation of Goss remains a a
 
00:27:54.649 --> 00:27:54.659 align:start position:0%
huge problem
 
00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:55.980 align:start position:0%
um and a challenge that we've been
 
00:27:58.730 --> 00:27:58.740 align:start position:0%
working with the committee discusses at
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
least that was established by Senate
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
Bill 330. historically all of the boards
 
00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
had statutory authority to establish
 
00:28:07.789 --> 00:28:07.799 align:start position:0%
their own fees so most of the fees that
 
00:28:09.529 --> 00:28:09.539 align:start position:0%
are established were established by the
 
00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:11.700 align:start position:0%
boards via rulemaking or they were
 
00:28:14.409 --> 00:28:14.419 align:start position:0%
established in statute which led to some
 
00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
boards being essentially required to
 
00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
charge you know 300 percent of their
 
00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:21.900 align:start position:0%
expenses or not being able to meet their
 
00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
expenses and cover their costs because
 
00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
the statute provided a ceiling as to
 
00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:27.900 align:start position:0%
what they could charge
 
00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
so over the years oplc statute has been
 
00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:34.260 align:start position:0%
amended to allow us to enact rules
 
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
regarding fees and I think the intent
 
00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:38.580 align:start position:0%
was to allow us to basically Implement
 
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
an allocation method that was fair and
 
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
Equitable and ensured that all of the
 
00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:44.340 align:start position:0%
boards were covering their costs but
 
00:28:45.769 --> 00:28:45.779 align:start position:0%
they were not completely exceeding their
 
00:28:46.909 --> 00:28:46.919 align:start position:0%
costs such that it became an
 
00:28:48.649 --> 00:28:48.659 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional attacks
 
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
the problem with that legally was that
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
the board's authority to set fees and
 
00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
the statutory fees were not removed from
 
00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
the board statutes and so there was a
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
conflict a legal conflict and over the
 
00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:01.860 align:start position:0%
last couple of years we had worked with
 
00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:06.020 align:start position:0%
the legislature to remove portions of
 
00:29:08.029 --> 00:29:08.039 align:start position:0%
fee setting Authority from the board
 
00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
statutes we were not successful with the
 
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
exception of removing the statutory fees
 
00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
but the committee or the commission
 
00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
established by Senate Bill 330 has
 
00:29:21.049 --> 00:29:21.059 align:start position:0%
recommended removing the board's ability
 
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
to promulgate rules regarding fees and
 
00:29:26.269 --> 00:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
there is a bill a separate bill pending
 
00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
that would basically perform that
 
00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.590 align:start position:0%
that would basically perform that
cleanup

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
cleanup
 
00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
and so we are planning to move forward
 
00:29:36.649 --> 00:29:36.659 align:start position:0%
with uh once we have the authority
 
00:29:39.169 --> 00:29:39.179 align:start position:0%
establishing fees we do need to address
 
00:29:42.889 --> 00:29:42.899 align:start position:0%
the cost allocation method and recently
 
00:29:45.549 --> 00:29:45.559 align:start position:0%
we sat down with a bureau of accounts
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
to discuss what options were available
 
00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:50.940 align:start position:0%
to us us from an administrative
 
00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:53.700 align:start position:0%
standpoint to monitor to track what
 
00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:56.460 align:start position:0%
staff are doing a large portion of our
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
costs are come from Personnel related
 
00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
costs and so they presented some options
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
to us utilizing what the state already
 
00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:08.700 align:start position:0%
has and we do plan to implement a new
 
00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
cost allocation method starting with the
 
00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:13.740 align:start position:0%
next fiscal year that'll require staff
 
00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:16.860 align:start position:0%
who are providing support to more than
 
00:30:18.529 --> 00:30:18.539 align:start position:0%
one board to track their time
 
00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:20.820 align:start position:0%
accordingly so that then we can
 
00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
determine which boards are utilizing
 
00:30:27.889 --> 00:30:27.899 align:start position:0%
staff how often what that costs and then
 
00:30:30.289 --> 00:30:30.299 align:start position:0%
we can allocate those costs directly to
 
00:30:33.049 --> 00:30:33.059 align:start position:0%
the boards and reassess fees based on
 
00:30:34.669 --> 00:30:34.679 align:start position:0%
those costs so we get a little bit more
 
00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
of an accurate picture of what boards
 
00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
are actually using
 
00:30:38.279 --> 00:30:40.789 align:start position:0%
are actually using
we

00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:30:44.029 --> 00:30:44.039 align:start position:0%
but until such time uh we you know we
 
00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:46.140 align:start position:0%
need that data I don't think we'll see
 
00:30:48.409 --> 00:30:48.419 align:start position:0%
all of the fees essentially be level set
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
it's going to take a couple of years to
 
00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:58.730 --> 00:30:58.740 align:start position:0%
representative Olney
 
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
thank you on
 
00:31:04.909 --> 00:31:04.919 align:start position:0%
representative abrami and I worked
 
00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:08.220 align:start position:0%
maybe 10 years ago now on the first of
 
00:31:12.169 --> 00:31:12.179 align:start position:0%
these mergers that finally created olpc
 
00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:14.340 align:start position:0%
and then this committee got totally
 
00:31:16.549 --> 00:31:16.559 align:start position:0%
removed from the process
 
00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:17.720 align:start position:0%
to that
 
00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:22.740 align:start position:0%
but we set the fees at that point after
 
00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of work with all of the
 
00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
stakeholders for the smaller Medical
 
00:31:33.169 --> 00:31:33.179 align:start position:0%
health related including there were two
 
00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
groups of midwives at that point and one
 
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
of them refused to talk to us
 
00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:41.220 align:start position:0%
and their
 
00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
there is the manufactured housing board
 
00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:47.820 align:start position:0%
which is the odd person out
 
00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:53.460 align:start position:0%
of the system and there is the
 
00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:56.330 align:start position:0%
of the system and there is the
uh

00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
dropped out of my mind right now there's
 
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
another one oh the the optician's
 
00:32:01.679 --> 00:32:04.490 align:start position:0%
another one oh the the optician's
assistance

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
Group which I forget whether it's called
 
00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:11.460 align:start position:0%
the board or not and I on those
 
00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
really are incapable of paying for
 
00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.190 align:start position:0%
really are incapable of paying for
themselves

00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:32:19.549 --> 00:32:19.559 align:start position:0%
are you eliminating I haven't been able
 
00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:22.620 align:start position:0%
to find time to read hb2 yet to find out
 
00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:23.690 align:start position:0%
to find time to read hb2 yet to find out
what

00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:23.700 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:32:25.549 --> 00:32:25.559 align:start position:0%
besides the ones that have been
 
00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
screaming at us are being eliminated I
 
00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
do know that one of the reasons that
 
00:32:38.149 --> 00:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
some of them are screaming is that it is
 
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
going to be much more difficult for
 
00:32:43.549 --> 00:32:43.559 align:start position:0%
consumers to find what they need
 
00:32:47.389 --> 00:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
and it's also means that oh people like
 
00:32:49.549 --> 00:32:49.559 align:start position:0%
the cosmetologists aren't going to be
 
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
able to get the regular information
 
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
they've been getting about the poisons
 
00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:56.100 align:start position:0%
and the chemicals they use
 
00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:57.549 align:start position:0%
and the chemicals they use
so

00:32:57.549 --> 00:32:57.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:59.450 --> 00:32:59.460 align:start position:0%
representative could you just clarify
 
00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:02.039 align:start position:0%
your question I would like I would just
 
00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:06.020 align:start position:0%
like to know what is going on
 
00:33:09.529 --> 00:33:09.539 align:start position:0%
most of us for most of us we're only
 
00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:11.700 align:start position:0%
hearing the people who are screaming but
 
00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:13.860 align:start position:0%
we don't real are you going to eliminate
 
00:33:15.529 --> 00:33:15.539 align:start position:0%
all the ones that can't pay for
 
00:33:18.289 --> 00:33:18.299 align:start position:0%
themselves so that that wasn't the
 
00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:19.860 align:start position:0%
objective or I don't believe that's the
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
objective of hb2
 
00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:22.909 align:start position:0%
objective of hb2
um

00:33:22.909 --> 00:33:22.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:25.740 align:start position:0%
last year and I forget the bill
 
00:33:27.769 --> 00:33:27.779 align:start position:0%
um the legislature did eliminate all
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
statutory fees and I think you're
 
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:31.389 align:start position:0%
referring to
um

00:33:31.389 --> 00:33:31.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:34.559 align:start position:0%
Opticians midwives that had a statutory
 
00:33:37.789 --> 00:33:37.799 align:start position:0%
fee of 110 dollars that statutory fee
 
00:33:39.789 --> 00:33:39.799 align:start position:0%
was insufficient to cover their costs
 
00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:43.140 align:start position:0%
and the commission that was established
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
by Senate Bill 330 discussed this at
 
00:33:47.889 --> 00:33:47.899 align:start position:0%
length I raised the issue
 
00:33:51.649 --> 00:33:51.659 align:start position:0%
in the context of lnas and I believe the
 
00:33:51.659 --> 00:33:52.630 align:start position:0%
in the context of lnas and I believe the
report

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:52.640 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:33:56.389 --> 00:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
does document that that it was the
 
00:33:57.889 --> 00:33:57.899 align:start position:0%
commission's belief and I share that
 
00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
belief that professionals need to be
 
00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:05.580 align:start position:0%
able to pay for their license and pay
 
00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:07.860 align:start position:0%
for the costs that other professionals
 
00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
should not be subsidizing the cost of
 
00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
other professionals to the extent that
 
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
there is a question of whether or not
 
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
professions can't fully pay for the cost
 
00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:19.220 align:start position:0%
of a license
 
00:34:21.649 --> 00:34:21.659 align:start position:0%
maybe they need to be subsidized but it
 
00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:22.919 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be by other people because
 
00:34:24.589 --> 00:34:24.599 align:start position:0%
then that becomes an unconstitutional
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
tax so certainly you know the committee
 
00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:29.220 align:start position:0%
could explore other mechanisms for
 
00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:32.580 align:start position:0%
funding those professions
 
00:34:34.669 --> 00:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
um but uh but I don't think it's
 
00:34:36.829 --> 00:34:36.839 align:start position:0%
appropriate for example to shift costs
 
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
from pharmacies uh to other professions
 
00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:42.899 align:start position:0%
that don't make a lot of money simply
 
00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:45.060 align:start position:0%
because pharmacies have money because
 
00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
that's not the purpose of a license fee
 
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
and so I think
 
00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:51.540 align:start position:0%
um that is part of the discussion that
 
00:34:53.930 --> 00:34:53.940 align:start position:0%
came out of this commission but I think
 
00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:56.220 align:start position:0%
you're referring to hp2 which is
 
00:34:58.250 --> 00:34:58.260 align:start position:0%
completely separate and distinct from
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
this bill and there are a couple of
 
00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:02.820 align:start position:0%
professions that are proposed to be
 
00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
eliminated in House Bill 2 you raise
 
00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
cosmetology it's just the booths that
 
00:35:09.109 --> 00:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
are a duplicative license there are a
 
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
couple of others but it's it's unrelated
 
00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:15.300 align:start position:0%
to the issues of of peace
 
00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:16.490 align:start position:0%
to the issues of of peace
so

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:16.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:24.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:26.820 align:start position:0%
it I hope still a very good website
 
00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
which is helps those places is that a
 
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
question on House Bill 2 because we
 
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
really should be focused on this I
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
really feel like we have a piece of the
 
00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
tail of the elephant and that this has
 
00:35:41.329 --> 00:35:41.339 align:start position:0%
been spread all over the place
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
and that most of us are out of the
 
00:35:47.089 --> 00:35:47.099 align:start position:0%
conversation thank you
 
00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
other questions for yes representative
 
00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:51.599 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you madam chair can we
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
get a budget from the office I would
 
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
really like to get a breakdown of costs
 
00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
and revenues before I think about voting
 
00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:00.180 align:start position:0%
on this yeah that's right I can
 
00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:01.740 align:start position:0%
certainly provide that'd be great thank
 
00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:02.990 align:start position:0%
certainly provide that'd be great thank
you

00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:04.740 align:start position:0%
other comments yes representative
 
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
fellows or questions here we're in a
 
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
public hearing questions so I'm going to
 
00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:10.140 align:start position:0%
ask a question but it's it's I'm just
 
00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
going to ask for a confirmation and that
 
00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't count as my real next question
 
00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.650 align:start position:0%
doesn't count as my real next question
so

00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:15.660 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:19.260 align:start position:0%
so when I go to the to um lba's website
 
00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
and I can find on there the oplc
 
00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
presentation to finance and I believe in
 
00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
there isn't there a little chart that
 
00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:31.380 align:start position:0%
lists the all of the ones that are
 
00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:34.140 align:start position:0%
proposed for elimination
 
00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
yes because we anticipated that the
 
00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:40.500 align:start position:0%
division one Finance may ask what the
 
00:36:43.069 --> 00:36:43.079 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact would be for eliminating a
 
00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:45.720 align:start position:0%
licenses so to be a little bit proactive
 
00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
we did the math and and if hb2 were to
 
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
go through we would lose about uh that
 
00:36:55.069 --> 00:36:55.079 align:start position:0%
was the reason I asked that question is
 
00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:57.060 align:start position:0%
because that's a reference to answer a
 
00:36:58.609 --> 00:36:58.619 align:start position:0%
lot of these questions that are coming
 
00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
up okay thank you Representatives so so
 
00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
now for my real question
 
00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.630 align:start position:0%
now for my real question
so

00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:05.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:10.849 --> 00:37:10.859 align:start position:0%
I I I I'm very concerned that the
 
00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:13.740 align:start position:0%
philosophy that apparently came out of
 
00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
this study which I have not read
 
00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:19.500 align:start position:0%
is that a a group of people who are
 
00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:22.980 align:start position:0%
licensed for a particular license are s
 
00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:24.440 align:start position:0%
are somehow
 
00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:28.140 align:start position:0%
always responsible for paying the whole
 
00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
cost of that license because in my mind
 
00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:35.460 align:start position:0%
the purpose for licensing anybody is to
 
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
protect the public
 
00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:41.000 align:start position:0%
so I can understand that maybe
 
00:37:43.690 --> 00:37:43.700 align:start position:0%
there's some issue with
 
00:37:47.089 --> 00:37:47.099 align:start position:0%
charging them more than somehow their
 
00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:50.700 align:start position:0%
allocation is but for some not to be
 
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
able to support what is a reasonable
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
license fee is not a reason to put them
 
00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:00.780 align:start position:0%
on the cut list do you agree
 
00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:02.940 align:start position:0%
um well I agree that that's not a reason
 
00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:05.820 align:start position:0%
to put them on the cut list except that
 
00:38:08.329 --> 00:38:08.339 align:start position:0%
I would disagree with the premise that
 
00:38:11.089 --> 00:38:11.099 align:start position:0%
that is the basis for the proposed
 
00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:14.940 align:start position:0%
repeals in hb2
 
00:38:17.569 --> 00:38:17.579 align:start position:0%
um that I mean again that's not an oplc
 
00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
requested bill but if you look at the
 
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
proposed professions to be eliminated in
 
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 those are not professions
 
00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:27.900 align:start position:0%
that have difficulty with paying for
 
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
their license fees I think and I can't I
 
00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
don't I'm not taking a policy position
 
00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:34.740 align:start position:0%
on this but I think the legislature has
 
00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:36.780 align:start position:0%
a question that needs to be answered
 
00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
which is if the purpose of licensure
 
00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:41.220 align:start position:0%
which it is is to protect the public
 
00:38:44.089 --> 00:38:44.099 align:start position:0%
then why are the professionals who are
 
00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
required to obtain a license forced to
 
00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:49.140 align:start position:0%
fund the cost of that license you know
 
00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:50.820 align:start position:0%
some have argued that it should be
 
00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:53.640 align:start position:0%
General funded not taking a position but
 
00:38:55.609 --> 00:38:55.619 align:start position:0%
if you are going to require their
 
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
licensed professionals to fully pay for
 
00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:00.540 align:start position:0%
the cost of having the license how is it
 
00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
fair to make other professionals pay for
 
00:39:06.589 --> 00:39:06.599 align:start position:0%
somebody else's license as opposed to
 
00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:09.060 align:start position:0%
the public as a whole and I think that's
 
00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:11.640 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about because for
 
00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:13.220 align:start position:0%
example you have
 
00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:16.140 align:start position:0%
cosmetology Cosmic the cosmetology board
 
00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
which has much more expenses than most
 
00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:21.540 align:start position:0%
other boards because they conduct
 
00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:25.500 align:start position:0%
inspections they're paying for about 46
 
00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
percent of their costs what that means
 
00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
is acupuncturists accountants other
 
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
licensed professionals are paying for
 
00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
cosmetologists now if you want other
 
00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
people to pay for cosmetologists why
 
00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:41.820 align:start position:0%
should it be limited to those who are
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
required to have a license should it not
 
00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
should the funds not come from another
 
00:39:48.109 --> 00:39:48.119 align:start position:0%
source so I think that's the policy
 
00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:49.980 align:start position:0%
question that the legislature has to
 
00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:52.740 align:start position:0%
Grapple with but if the if the
 
00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
determination is that licensees have to
 
00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
fully pay for the cost of their license
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
which is what is current currently
 
00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
statutorily required then I don't think
 
00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
it is appropriate to have other
 
00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:07.079 align:start position:0%
individuals subsidize that license and
 
00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up to that look I need
 
00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:16.380 align:start position:0%
to bring this in a little bit and remind
 
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
folks that this is directly okay let me
 
00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
just remind everyone right now we we've
 
00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
gone back and forth this is why it's a
 
00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:23.940 align:start position:0%
little confusing we've been doing uh
 
00:40:26.329 --> 00:40:26.339 align:start position:0%
full committee work sessions which is
 
00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
appropriate to do more of this
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
conversational stuff however this is an
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
actual public hearing and we are here to
 
00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
listen to testimony and ask clarifying
 
00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
questions not to debate or you know
 
00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
showcase our profession our opinions on
 
00:40:43.490 --> 00:40:43.500 align:start position:0%
things I just want to remind everyone
 
00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
that this is a public hearing and we
 
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
really do need to be focused on the
 
00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
revenue aspects of this bill and we can
 
00:40:53.569 --> 00:40:53.579 align:start position:0%
talk about hb2 separately later okay
 
00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:57.060 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead yeah so this has to do
 
00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:00.540 align:start position:0%
with transfer to the general fund do
 
00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:03.660 align:start position:0%
things that happen related to licensures
 
00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
ever impact agencies that are other
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
agencies like the AG when somebody
 
00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
um actually for example that that
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
medical technician that gave a lot of
 
00:41:19.069 --> 00:41:19.079 align:start position:0%
people hep C
 
00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
so what
 
00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:24.300 align:start position:0%
um what situations
 
00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:27.060 align:start position:0%
um that happen can be impacted outside
 
00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:30.900 align:start position:0%
your agency that that could justify
 
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
sending some of that money back to the
 
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
general fund so is your question whether
 
00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:38.700 align:start position:0%
licensed professionals have an impact on
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
other state agencies or whether the our
 
00:41:44.089 --> 00:41:44.099 align:start position:0%
agency has an impact on other state
 
00:41:44.099 --> 00:41:45.410 align:start position:0%
agency has an impact on other state
agencies

00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:45.420 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:41:48.349 --> 00:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
I'd say both with respect to our agency
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
we fully pay for the cost of the
 
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
services provided by other agencies we
 
00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
fully fund two and a half positions at
 
00:41:56.810 --> 00:41:56.820 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice we also pay
 
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
for indirect costs through doit and we
 
00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
have direct costs through doit we also
 
00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:04.079 align:start position:0%
have an agreement with division of
 
00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
personnel we pay them fifty thousand
 
00:42:07.849 --> 00:42:07.859 align:start position:0%
dollars a year to provide backup
 
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
services for the HRC so we are fully
 
00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
funded with certainly licensed
 
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
professionals can impact the state but I
 
00:42:18.109 --> 00:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
would argue that's not a licensing issue
 
00:42:21.109 --> 00:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
that is an issue of you know criminal
 
00:42:24.829 --> 00:42:24.839 align:start position:0%
nature or other types of conduct that
 
00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:27.060 align:start position:0%
don't fall within the license licensing
 
00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:31.550 align:start position:0%
don't fall within the license licensing
jurisdiction

00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:33.900 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah can you just explain the
 
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
AG positions that related to are they
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
advisory or uh
 
00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:42.200 align:start position:0%
so there is there could be some
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
impact outside your agency other than
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
paying I.T and personnel which all
 
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
agencies do
 
00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:52.079 align:start position:0%
so there could be some
 
00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:54.780 align:start position:0%
so your positions
 
00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:57.180 align:start position:0%
I I disagree with that I think that the
 
00:42:59.630 --> 00:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
agency fully pays for the cost of all
 
00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:01.069 align:start position:0%
agency fully pays for the cost of all
services

00:43:01.069 --> 00:43:01.079 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
um for the state we we pay more than our
 
00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:04.980 align:start position:0%
fair share
 
00:43:06.589 --> 00:43:06.599 align:start position:0%
um you know for example we are fully
 
00:43:10.849 --> 00:43:10.859 align:start position:0%
funding two and a half positions at doj
 
00:43:13.849 --> 00:43:13.859 align:start position:0%
to provide one legal counseling to the
 
00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:16.380 align:start position:0%
agency and two to prosecute cases of
 
00:43:19.849 --> 00:43:19.859 align:start position:0%
unlicensed practice and a paralegal now
 
00:43:22.609 --> 00:43:22.619 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that those people
 
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
likely do work on other things unrelated
 
00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
to oplc but we still pay for the full
 
00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
full cost of those positions
 
00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
so you know I do
 
00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:37.020 align:start position:0%
we are fully funding and fully paying
 
00:43:43.870 --> 00:43:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
representative Platt yes thank you madam
 
00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
does not directly apropos of this bill
 
00:43:52.849 --> 00:43:52.859 align:start position:0%
because this bill is just
 
00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
saying uh non-lapse versus lapse you
 
00:43:58.130 --> 00:43:58.140 align:start position:0%
want it to non-lapse but you brought it
 
00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:01.980 align:start position:0%
up earlier question uh about uh loss of
 
00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:05.460 align:start position:0%
Revenue coming from loss of reduction in
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
number of licenses required
 
00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:10.380 align:start position:0%
and have you also done an analysis to
 
00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:12.060 align:start position:0%
see how you could cut your cost so you
 
00:44:14.569 --> 00:44:14.579 align:start position:0%
could stay uh it's this is a net loss or
 
00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:16.260 align:start position:0%
gain out of that and if there's a net
 
00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:18.060 align:start position:0%
loss you would you have to make that up
 
00:44:19.849 --> 00:44:19.859 align:start position:0%
by increasing license to all the
 
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
remaining licenses
 
00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:24.900 align:start position:0%
I I think yes we have done an analysis
 
00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
although I think it's slightly premature
 
00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
because hb2 not only proposes to
 
00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:30.660 align:start position:0%
eliminate certain license types but it
 
00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
also proposes to transfer certain
 
00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
license types to oplc
 
00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
so it's unclear what impact that will
 
00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
have to a revenue from a revenue
 
00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
standpoint we I did provide finance
 
00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:45.660 align:start position:0%
division one without analysis of what we
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
would see in terms of reduction in
 
00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
Revenue but I'll say for example just by
 
00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
eliminating lnas that's 10 of our
 
00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:54.540 align:start position:0%
licensed population that would clearly
 
00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
result in a reduction of the necessary
 
00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:00.180 align:start position:0%
administ administrative support so I
 
00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:01.980 align:start position:0%
think we would see and observe and
 
00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
certainly have to a reduction in overall
 
00:45:08.089 --> 00:45:08.099 align:start position:0%
cost to supporting the boards that said
 
00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:09.720 align:start position:0%
you know if we were to get the boxing
 
00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
Commission in auctioneers and others
 
00:45:13.609 --> 00:45:13.619 align:start position:0%
that are proposed to transfer over we
 
00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
need to do that analysis as to the
 
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
impact of the revenue and administrative
 
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
support and our experience has been that
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
when we take on a board typically
 
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit more work involved
 
00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:25.260 align:start position:0%
on the front to basically try to
 
00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
synergize that board statutes with ours
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
kind of clean it up to make sure that it
 
00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:34.740 align:start position:0%
works with the agency but I I do
 
00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
anticipate that if the license types
 
00:45:38.089 --> 00:45:38.099 align:start position:0%
were eliminated we would see a reduction
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:49.380 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the
 
00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:51.420 align:start position:0%
members no okay great thank you so much
 
00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:54.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and um I will
 
00:45:57.050 --> 00:45:57.060 align:start position:0%
recognize representative ulery again
 
00:45:58.670 --> 00:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
um who might have forgotten to mention
 
00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:05.630 align:start position:0%
um who might have forgotten to mention
something

00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:08.089 --> 00:46:08.099 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh I was actually
 
00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:12.060 align:start position:0%
uh stimulated uh to by the by the
 
00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:12.900 align:start position:0%
question that was asked by
 
00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
representative almi yes you are getting
 
00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
the elephant's tail but there's a reason
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
for that because some of the changes
 
00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
need to take place
 
00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:27.060 align:start position:0%
of themselves not for any other reason
 
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
and they need to take place whether or
 
00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:33.540 align:start position:0%
not hb2 or any other bill passes for
 
00:46:36.829 --> 00:46:36.839 align:start position:0%
example uh last Friday open division one
 
00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:40.980 align:start position:0%
or over in division one uh we discussed
 
00:46:43.309 --> 00:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
public records public access public
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
meeting notices that needs to take place
 
00:46:49.069 --> 00:46:49.079 align:start position:0%
within oplc to make sure that the
 
00:46:50.569 --> 00:46:50.579 align:start position:0%
agencies know that they've got to follow
 
00:46:50.579 --> 00:46:52.870 align:start position:0%
agencies know that they've got to follow
91a

00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
91a
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
simple as that that stands alone this
 
00:46:59.930 --> 00:46:59.940 align:start position:0%
particular bill will stand alone as well
 
00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
as the Senate version that's why it came
 
00:47:03.109 --> 00:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
from either side
 
00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
because it needs to take place in order
 
00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:07.140 align:start position:0%
to assure the funding and they can do
 
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
the other activities that they're doing
 
00:47:13.069 --> 00:47:13.079 align:start position:0%
right now so in one sense of the of the
 
00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
fact yeah you're getting bits and pieces
 
00:47:17.089 --> 00:47:17.099 align:start position:0%
but that was done deliberately by the
 
00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
commission so we could fully examine
 
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
each of the ones that's going to stand
 
00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
alone now the entire thing is a separate
 
00:47:25.970 --> 00:47:25.980 align:start position:0%
bill and then we'll put everything
 
00:47:28.970 --> 00:47:28.980 align:start position:0%
together and those of you who have been
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
around for more than a couple of years
 
00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
understand that that meshing process
 
00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
that takes place is is an interesting
 
00:47:40.250 --> 00:47:40.260 align:start position:0%
animal in and of itself I wouldn't say
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
it's an elephant it could be a donkey it
 
00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
depends but
 
00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:47.940 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:54.589 --> 00:47:54.599 align:start position:0%
have you ever known me not to want to
 
00:48:06.609 --> 00:48:06.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:09.420 align:start position:0%
he reminded me about the question I did
 
00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:12.660 align:start position:0%
want to ask the director which is about
 
00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:15.300 align:start position:0%
how they came to the five thousand five
 
00:48:18.109 --> 00:48:18.119 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:19.980 align:start position:0%
that was a recommendation out of the
 
00:48:22.730 --> 00:48:22.740 align:start position:0%
Edna committee at the time this bill was
 
00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:24.900 align:start position:0%
presented dedna as the first committee
 
00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:27.839 align:start position:0%
uh they wanted to put a cap on it and
 
00:48:29.930 --> 00:48:29.940 align:start position:0%
the it was agreed uh that somewhere
 
00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
between three and five so I took the
 
00:48:35.569 --> 00:48:35.579 align:start position:0%
high you know it's it's a number
 
00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:37.740 align:start position:0%
director Courtney would you care to
 
00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative earlery is
 
00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:50.220 align:start position:0%
correct originally this bill did not
 
00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
contain the five million dollar ceiling
 
00:48:56.089 --> 00:48:56.099 align:start position:0%
um I I completely support a ceiling
 
00:48:57.650 --> 00:48:57.660 align:start position:0%
because I think that's necessary in
 
00:48:59.390 --> 00:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
order to avoid
 
00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:02.460 align:start position:0%
um costs you know continue to drive up
 
00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
um five million dollars is typically a
 
00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:05.510 align:start position:0%
um five million dollars is typically a
little

00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
little
 
00:49:07.730 --> 00:49:07.740 align:start position:0%
um more than what we lapse at the end of
 
00:49:09.410 --> 00:49:09.420 align:start position:0%
every fiscal year so three to five
 
00:49:10.849 --> 00:49:10.859 align:start position:0%
million it seemed like a reasonable
 
00:49:13.790 --> 00:49:13.800 align:start position:0%
buffer for us to allow us to save for
 
00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:16.500 align:start position:0%
Capital expenditures for example our
 
00:49:18.349 --> 00:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
most recent contract which was fully
 
00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
arpa funded so not funded by the state
 
00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
but the state's most recent contract was
 
00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
about 3.5 million dollars for software
 
00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
so you know it's anticipated that that
 
00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:30.660 align:start position:0%
would be a reasonable cost that we would
 
00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:39.420 align:start position:0%
representative Phyllis um yeah so I in
 
00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:42.660 align:start position:0%
terms of capital expenditures so I'm
 
00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:46.020 align:start position:0%
thinking my understanding is that admin
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
Services owns buildings so if you wanted
 
00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
or long-term leases so if you wanted to
 
00:49:54.410 --> 00:49:54.420 align:start position:0%
move to a different building that that
 
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
would have to go through the you know
 
00:50:00.349 --> 00:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
capital budget appropriation and
 
00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:02.940 align:start position:0%
the other thing you said
 
00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna forget in terms of lapsing
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
um you're trying you're lapsing the in
 
00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:11.640 align:start position:0%
like the entire operation oh the I know
 
00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:15.180 align:start position:0%
the um the I thought the an upgrade in
 
00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:18.180 align:start position:0%
the computer system is all already in
 
00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:20.460 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget
 
00:50:22.370 --> 00:50:22.380 align:start position:0%
not correct or
 
00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm not I'm not aware of a computer
 
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
upgrade for or PLC it could be that
 
00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:30.660 align:start position:0%
there's an upgrade a system-wide upgrade
 
00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:32.450 align:start position:0%
there's an upgrade a system-wide upgrade
but

00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:32.460 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
um our licensing portal is the upgrade
 
00:50:37.849 --> 00:50:37.859 align:start position:0%
that I was talking about
 
00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
um it is currently an Enterprise
 
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
solution but oplc utilizes at least 90
 
00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
percent of it
 
00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
um and it is uh right now the fact that
 
00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:48.780 align:start position:0%
we don't have a functioning licensing
 
00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
portal has required us to utilize
 
00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:53.220 align:start position:0%
additional Personnel I think with the
 
00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:55.140 align:start position:0%
state and you'll and I think
 
00:50:57.049 --> 00:50:57.059 align:start position:0%
you've probably observed this what the
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
state is is facing is a Workforce
 
00:51:01.309 --> 00:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
Challenge and so there's a need to
 
00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
really leverage technology and move away
 
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
from from using manual processes and
 
00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:08.940 align:start position:0%
people to technology and we're kind of
 
00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:15.049 --> 00:51:15.059 align:start position:0%
representative liebly
 
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
thank you informational question
 
00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:21.780 align:start position:0%
um the presentation that oplc did to did
 
00:51:23.930 --> 00:51:23.940 align:start position:0%
for finance is that something we can
 
00:51:25.849 --> 00:51:25.859 align:start position:0%
find on your website just a
 
00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
informational question I can certainly
 
00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:29.460 align:start position:0%
send it to you I do believe it's on the
 
00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:31.380 align:start position:0%
Gen Court website as well
 
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:40.500 align:start position:0%
representative Ames could you give us
 
00:51:45.490 --> 00:51:45.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:48.589 --> 00:51:48.599 align:start position:0%
a uh
 
00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
menus is LBA and you would then click on
 
00:51:55.609 --> 00:51:55.619 align:start position:0%
the budget documents and budget 24 to
 
00:51:55.619 --> 00:51:56.930 align:start position:0%
the budget documents and budget 24 to
25.

00:51:56.930 --> 00:51:56.940 align:start position:0%
25.
 
00:51:59.329 --> 00:51:59.339 align:start position:0%
and then go through a list and you get
 
00:52:05.569 --> 00:52:05.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:08.329 --> 00:52:08.339 align:start position:0%
yes thank you finance division one is
 
00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:11.700 align:start position:0%
another uh Pathways that you have to go
 
00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:14.940 align:start position:0%
down thank you okay thank you I don't
 
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
have any more oh go ahead representative
 
00:52:19.849 --> 00:52:19.859 align:start position:0%
we did all that research thank you what
 
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
was the name she should be looking for
 
00:52:23.829 --> 00:52:23.839 align:start position:0%
of that study
 
00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:30.900 align:start position:0%
okay I don't have any more pink cars
 
00:52:32.809 --> 00:52:32.819 align:start position:0%
anyone else here who would like to speak
 
00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
oops she's gone away
 
00:52:37.609 --> 00:52:37.619 align:start position:0%
okay all right with that then we will
 
00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
now close the public hearing on House
 
00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
Bill 445. thank you
 
00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
okay guys so now we've got 10 minutes
 
00:52:47.329 --> 00:52:47.339 align:start position:0%
before our first work session
 
00:52:47.339 --> 00:52:49.069 align:start position:0%
before our first work session
and

00:52:49.069 --> 00:52:49.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
I know there's a lot of questions about
 
00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:53.640 align:start position:0%
hb2 we have to try to stay focused on
 
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:52:57.470 --> 00:52:57.480 align:start position:0%
which I believe simply changes it from a
 
00:52:59.630 --> 00:52:59.640 align:start position:0%
lapsing fund to non-lapsing and putting
 
00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
a cap on it so let's try to focus on
 
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
that and um we have tentatively
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
scheduled an executive session on this
 
00:53:10.849 --> 00:53:10.859 align:start position:0%
next week so make sure you ask Jordan
 
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
ulery any questions you have he is the
 
00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
our resident expert and he can help us
 
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
with this and then we also now have

uh would you mind sharing your email
 
00:53:25.790 --> 00:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
address that way if folks have questions
 
00:53:31.309 --> 00:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:31.319 --> 00:53:32.390 align:start position:0%
 
perfect

00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
00:53:34.549 --> 00:53:34.559 align:start position:0%
that would be great because you could
 
00:53:36.170 --> 00:53:36.180 align:start position:0%
hear there's a little bit angst here and
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
we uh the commission report is there a
 
00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
commission report uh representative
 
00:53:42.170 --> 00:53:42.180 align:start position:0%
ulery that you could share with us as
 
00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:46.190 align:start position:0%
ulery that you could share with us as
well

00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:47.930 --> 00:53:47.940 align:start position:0%
thank you director that would be
 
00:53:50.210 --> 00:53:50.220 align:start position:0%
fabulous great because we're interested
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
in this topic and we're learning great
 
00:53:54.650 --> 00:53:54.660 align:start position:0%
all right so we'll take a little break a
 
00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
little stretch break come back 11.
 
01:07:31.210 --> 01:07:31.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:34.670 --> 01:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
we are not hearing public input unless
 
01:07:37.370 --> 01:07:37.380 align:start position:0%
we happen to see a technical expert here
 
01:07:39.109 --> 01:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
that might be able to answer a technical
 
01:07:41.329 --> 01:07:41.339 align:start position:0%
question but otherwise in general we're
 
01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
not here to listen to anyone else from
 
01:07:45.650 --> 01:07:45.660 align:start position:0%
the outside we are here to work together
 
01:07:48.109 --> 01:07:48.119 align:start position:0%
as a team and seeing if we can get some
 
01:07:50.690 --> 01:07:50.700 align:start position:0%
sort of better information on this bill
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
and maybe see if there's a direction we
 
01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
want to go so this uh bill was uh this
 
01:08:00.650 --> 01:08:00.660 align:start position:0%
is House Bill 450 and the prime sponsor
 
01:08:04.309 --> 01:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
is our own representative Schoenberg who
 
01:08:06.589 --> 01:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
um has done a lot of work on this so you
 
01:08:08.329 --> 01:08:08.339 align:start position:0%
know if you could maybe kind of get us
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
remind us about the bill let us know
 
01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
your thoughts and then kind of take it
 
01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:13.500 align:start position:0%
from there
 
01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:14.690 align:start position:0%
from there
excellent

01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:14.700 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
01:08:18.530 --> 01:08:18.540 align:start position:0%
sounds fine Madam chair uh
 
01:08:20.090 --> 01:08:20.100 align:start position:0%
first of all just a quick history
 
01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
historical lesson I brought this up back
 
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
when House Bill 435 was presented to the
 
01:08:29.450 --> 01:08:29.460 align:start position:0%
house last year
 
01:08:32.329 --> 01:08:32.339 align:start position:0%
and I took it on as
 
01:08:34.309 --> 01:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
it seemed like big Corporation was
 
01:08:34.319 --> 01:08:35.630 align:start position:0%
it seemed like big Corporation was
getting

01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
getting
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
more of the breaks than the business the
 
01:08:41.150 --> 01:08:41.160 align:start position:0%
small business World
 
01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:42.229 align:start position:0%

um

01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
I was trying to make it on Level Playing
 
01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:45.410 align:start position:0%
I was trying to make it on Level Playing
Field

01:08:45.410 --> 01:08:45.420 align:start position:0%
Field
 
01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
and uh in the research that I did I came
 
01:08:48.239 --> 01:08:49.490 align:start position:0%
and uh in the research that I did I came
across

01:08:49.490 --> 01:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
across
 
01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
the 2014 commission that did a study
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
on uh
 
01:08:58.130 --> 01:08:58.140 align:start position:0%
let me call it
 
01:09:04.910 --> 01:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:07.130 --> 01:09:07.140 align:start position:0%
just taxes
 
01:09:11.150 --> 01:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
uh and they're con their conclusion at
 
01:09:13.309 --> 01:09:13.319 align:start position:0%
the end was that tax Simplicity is a
 
01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
good tax policy
 
01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
and a competitive goal should be
 
01:09:21.729 --> 01:09:21.739 align:start position:0%
implemented where possible and
 
01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
I made my presentation of the house and
 
01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
it wasn't passed they went another
 
01:09:29.150 --> 01:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
Direction which was the 80 percent
 
01:09:31.309 --> 01:09:31.319 align:start position:0%
of the uh
 
01:09:31.319 --> 01:09:33.169 align:start position:0%
of the uh
nol

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:33.179 align:start position:0%
nol
 
01:09:35.090 --> 01:09:35.100 align:start position:0%
so this year I brought it back with Mr
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
Jim uh use am I going to say this right
 
01:09:41.150 --> 01:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
seglio who couldn't make it today he had
 
01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
a conflict he was the gentleman that
 
01:09:44.650 --> 01:09:44.660 align:start position:0%
presented last time
 
01:09:47.809 --> 01:09:47.819 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:09:50.150 --> 01:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
after my presentation and his
 
01:09:52.490 --> 01:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
presentation he met with the dra
 
01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:54.650 align:start position:0%
presentation he met with the dra
and

01:09:54.650 --> 01:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:57.410 align:start position:0%
and
presented

01:09:57.410 --> 01:09:57.420 align:start position:0%
presented
 
01:09:59.750 --> 01:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
what you have in front of you now a
 
01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:01.610 align:start position:0%
what you have in front of you now a
Amendment

01:10:01.610 --> 01:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
to house bill 450.
 
01:10:07.729 --> 01:10:07.739 align:start position:0%
he did not know which direction the
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
committee was going to go on this
 
01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
because he is of the opinion that it
 
01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:14.820 align:start position:0%
should be a 100 percent
 
01:10:17.330 --> 01:10:17.340 align:start position:0%
for the small businesses also
 
01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
well I don't think that's going to
 
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
happen now as uh the lobbyist Mr Bragdon
 
01:10:26.410 --> 01:10:26.420 align:start position:0%
made a presentation and said
 
01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
when they originally passed the 80
 
01:10:31.130 --> 01:10:31.140 align:start position:0%
percent was to take away the Dual
 
01:10:33.070 --> 01:10:33.080 align:start position:0%
appropriation not Appropriations
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
apportionment factors
 
01:10:41.209 --> 01:10:41.219 align:start position:0%
so Mr ociglio had couldn't make it today
 
01:10:44.330 --> 01:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
but he did send to me a first he said I
 
01:10:46.850 --> 01:10:46.860 align:start position:0%
think he sent to all of you this
 
01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
net operating loss Provisions by the tax
 
01:10:52.250 --> 01:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
Foundation I think it's in a black and
 
01:10:55.010 --> 01:10:55.020 align:start position:0%
white cover you have there
 
01:10:57.290 --> 01:10:57.300 align:start position:0%
and there was some good reading in there
 
01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
but he also sent to me and he he says
 
01:11:04.930 --> 01:11:04.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
here's a let me read this to you he says
 
01:11:09.709 --> 01:11:09.719 align:start position:0%
I would want to emphasize that our nol
 
01:11:11.689 --> 01:11:11.699 align:start position:0%
Provisions as previously noted and
 
01:11:14.209 --> 01:11:14.219 align:start position:0%
discussed are lacking compared to other
 
01:11:18.350 --> 01:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
states and that is addressed in this tax
 
01:11:20.090 --> 01:11:20.100 align:start position:0%
Foundation note
 
01:11:22.910 --> 01:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
especially on page four
 
01:11:25.669 --> 01:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
are hiking compared to other States
 
01:11:29.209 --> 01:11:29.219 align:start position:0%
including our neighbors this doesn't go
 
01:11:31.850 --> 01:11:31.860 align:start position:0%
unnoticed and he's trying to say this
 
01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:33.900 align:start position:0%
that there are businesses that are
 
01:11:36.890 --> 01:11:36.900 align:start position:0%
looking at various States so we do
 
01:11:39.890 --> 01:11:39.900 align:start position:0%
nothing or we address this
 
01:11:43.729 --> 01:11:43.739 align:start position:0%
problem that he feels is there by going
 
01:11:46.850 --> 01:11:46.860 align:start position:0%
to the 80 percent increase our 10-year
 
01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
carry forward period
 
01:11:50.930 --> 01:11:50.940 align:start position:0%
to 20 years
 
01:11:54.649 --> 01:11:54.659 align:start position:0%
or conform to the federal provisions
 
01:11:58.310 --> 01:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
which is indefinite and that's on page
 
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
five I believe it shows you what the nol
 
01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
provisions are for the other states
 
01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:08.570 align:start position:0%
provisions are for the other states
uh

01:12:08.570 --> 01:12:08.580 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
or we remove the 10 million dollar cap
 
01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
and keep the 80 percent
 
01:12:16.910 --> 01:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
with the 10-year limit
 
01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:18.649 align:start position:0%
with the 10-year limit
or

01:12:18.649 --> 01:12:18.659 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:12:21.649 --> 01:12:21.659 align:start position:0%
remove the eighty percent taxable income
 
01:12:28.250 --> 01:12:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:30.110 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:12:30.110 --> 01:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:12:32.810 --> 01:12:32.820 align:start position:0%
states of New England Maine is on the
 
01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:34.090 align:start position:0%
states of New England Maine is on the
Federal

01:12:34.090 --> 01:12:34.100 align:start position:0%
Federal
 
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
IRC which is unlimited about years 100
 
01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
percent uh no 80 I think it is no
 
01:12:46.250 --> 01:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
80 percent
 
01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:47.810 align:start position:0%
80 percent
uh

01:12:47.810 --> 01:12:47.820 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:12:51.530 --> 01:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
Vermont on page five you will see that
 
01:12:55.130 --> 01:12:55.140 align:start position:0%
it it has the 10 years but it does not
 
01:12:59.810 --> 01:12:59.820 align:start position:0%
have uh any limit on the carry forward
 
01:13:03.169 --> 01:13:03.179 align:start position:0%
the amount uh
 
01:13:06.169 --> 01:13:06.179 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is the 20 years
 
01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:07.860 align:start position:0%
but no limit on the amount of carry
 
01:13:07.860 --> 01:13:08.870 align:start position:0%
but no limit on the amount of carry
forward

01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
Connecticut is 20 years no amount
 
01:13:13.490 --> 01:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
carried forward
 
01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
no restriction and Rhode Island's only
 
01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
five years
 
01:13:22.130 --> 01:13:22.140 align:start position:0%
so that is where we're at he felt that
 
01:13:25.550 --> 01:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
we should do something as a committee
 
01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
to maybe change one of our approaches
 
01:13:30.649 --> 01:13:30.659 align:start position:0%
and they were once again
 
01:13:32.630 --> 01:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
increase our 10-year carry forward
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
period to 20 years
 
01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
or remove the 10 million dollar limit
 
01:13:42.169 --> 01:13:42.179 align:start position:0%
or remove the 80 percent
 
01:13:44.209 --> 01:13:44.219 align:start position:0%
and I would be happy with any
 
01:13:46.370 --> 01:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
suggestions any way that this committee
 
01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
would like to go with this we do have
 
01:13:51.229 --> 01:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
this amendment that if we do nothing at
 
01:13:53.169 --> 01:13:53.179 align:start position:0%
least we change the applicability date
 
01:13:58.189 --> 01:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:01.669 --> 01:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:04.250 --> 01:14:04.260 align:start position:0%
yeah I have the same problem at home I
 
01:14:07.130 --> 01:14:07.140 align:start position:0%
dropped papers and I uh
 
01:14:10.610 --> 01:14:10.620 align:start position:0%
I'm line eight I believe it says uh
 
01:14:13.610 --> 01:14:13.620 align:start position:0%
limited and adjusted is one of the
 
01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
the changes and then the line 13
 
01:14:20.810 --> 01:14:20.820 align:start position:0%
the effective date shall take effect
 
01:14:24.590 --> 01:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
December 31st 2023 instead of July 1st
 
01:14:26.510 --> 01:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
of this year
 
01:14:32.030 --> 01:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:35.689 --> 01:14:35.699 align:start position:0%
your opinions are valued on this may I
 
01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
just ask a quick so this is changing
 
01:14:40.610 --> 01:14:40.620 align:start position:0%
from your original Bill does it also
 
01:14:44.510 --> 01:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
remove the 10-year Max oh it does not it
 
01:14:47.930 --> 01:14:47.940 align:start position:0%
changes nothing else except those two
 
01:14:50.290 --> 01:14:50.300 align:start position:0%
dates those two lines
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
limited and adjusted and the effective
 
01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:54.350 align:start position:0%
limited and adjusted and the effective
date

01:14:54.350 --> 01:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
date
 
01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:55.490 align:start position:0%
date
okay

01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:15:01.850 --> 01:15:01.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:04.370 --> 01:15:04.380 align:start position:0%
just about in fact I think all the other
 
01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:05.810 align:start position:0%
just about in fact I think all the other
states

01:15:05.810 --> 01:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:15:10.450 --> 01:15:10.460 align:start position:0%
we depend hugely on the business taxes
 
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
as part of our revenues
 
01:15:19.130 --> 01:15:19.140 align:start position:0%
on for them it's 10 20 15 of their
 
01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
revenues at the most for us it's around
 
01:15:26.270 --> 01:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
35 now it used to be 40.
 
01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:27.830 align:start position:0%
35 now it used to be 40.
uh

01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:31.070 align:start position:0%
uh
and

01:15:31.070 --> 01:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:34.570 --> 01:15:34.580 align:start position:0%
we don't have a fiscal note for anything
 
01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
except what's in this bill at this point
 
01:15:41.209 --> 01:15:41.219 align:start position:0%
I have no idea how much it would cost us
 
01:15:42.890 --> 01:15:42.900 align:start position:0%
to go unlimited
 
01:15:45.649 --> 01:15:45.659 align:start position:0%
or to
 
01:15:45.659 --> 01:15:47.870 align:start position:0%
or to
um

01:15:47.870 --> 01:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:49.610 --> 01:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
to make it
 
01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:51.290 align:start position:0%
to make it
um

01:15:51.290 --> 01:15:51.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:55.010 --> 01:15:55.020 align:start position:0%
to not limit on
 
01:15:57.229 --> 01:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
the amount
 
01:16:02.689 --> 01:16:02.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:06.770 --> 01:16:06.780 align:start position:0%
and I've never heard such a note being
 
01:16:09.649 --> 01:16:09.659 align:start position:0%
created since the time when we had some
 
01:16:13.850 --> 01:16:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:16.790 --> 01:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
we do have our friends from the dra here
 
01:16:19.250 --> 01:16:19.260 align:start position:0%
no could we ask you to this would be a
 
01:16:22.910 --> 01:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
technical in input that we need from you
 
01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
um on House Bill 450
 
01:16:28.010 --> 01:16:28.020 align:start position:0%
obviously you guys did a fiscal note on
 
01:16:29.510 --> 01:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
the original bill
 
01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
but we're talking about a couple of
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
different scenarios and wondered if you
 
01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
could weigh in on the fiscal impact if
 
01:16:41.090 --> 01:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
you can so
 
01:16:42.890 --> 01:16:42.900 align:start position:0%
the current bill
 
01:16:46.610 --> 01:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
removes the 80 percent limitation
 
01:16:49.010 --> 01:16:49.020 align:start position:0%
other Concepts that I think were brought
 
01:16:51.950 --> 01:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
forward was to remove
 
01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
the number of year
 
01:16:56.270 --> 01:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
the number of year cap
 
01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
and then there's a to remove the dollar
 
01:17:02.930 --> 01:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
cap so on those two things
 
01:17:06.290 --> 01:17:06.300 align:start position:0%
is there any way that you could do a
 
01:17:07.610 --> 01:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
fiscal note
 
01:17:13.490 --> 01:17:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:15.070 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:17:15.070 --> 01:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:17:18.350 --> 01:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
tax policy Council from a dra and uh
 
01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
Lauren O'Sullivan senior financial
 
01:17:24.110 --> 01:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
so I'm just thinking about the um
 
01:17:31.010 --> 01:17:31.020 align:start position:0%
the scenario when if we're removing the
 
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
um the 10-year limitation
 
01:17:36.530 --> 01:17:36.540 align:start position:0%
for the carryovers
 
01:17:38.149 --> 01:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
that's one scenario and then the other
 
01:17:40.910 --> 01:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
scenario is removing the 10 million
 
01:17:43.790 --> 01:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:45.890 --> 01:17:45.900 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
how would we calculate the fiscal note
 
01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:52.550 align:start position:0%
how would we calculate the fiscal note
impact

01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:53.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:12.239 --> 01:18:14.209 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:18:14.209 --> 01:18:14.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:15.410 --> 01:18:15.420 align:start position:0%
I think we have to think about it
 
01:18:17.149 --> 01:18:17.159 align:start position:0%
further to see if we can actually
 
01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
produce a fiscal note
 
01:18:23.290 --> 01:18:23.300 align:start position:0%
a fiscal impact on that or not because
 
01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
what we have is information from the
 
01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
past so that's how we've been doing our
 
01:18:29.810 --> 01:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
fiscal knows it's been a static analysis
 
01:18:33.470 --> 01:18:33.480 align:start position:0%
of these situations in the past and
 
01:18:36.770 --> 01:18:36.780 align:start position:0%
we've always had that income limitation
 
01:18:39.770 --> 01:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
sorry the um the cap of the 10 million
 
01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
limitation or one one form or the other
 
01:18:45.229 --> 01:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
in older years it was not 10 million
 
01:18:47.290 --> 01:18:47.300 align:start position:0%
dollars it was another another amount
 
01:18:51.169 --> 01:18:51.179 align:start position:0%
and then we've always had that um that
 
01:18:51.179 --> 01:18:52.610 align:start position:0%
and then we've always had that um that
10-year

01:18:52.610 --> 01:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
10-year
 
01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
limitation as well in terms of the
 
01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
carryovers from the year the loss was
 
01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:57.890 align:start position:0%
carryovers from the year the loss was
generated

01:18:57.890 --> 01:18:57.900 align:start position:0%
generated
 
01:19:00.050 --> 01:19:00.060 align:start position:0%
so in terms of
 
01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:02.090 align:start position:0%
so in terms of
um

01:19:02.090 --> 01:19:02.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:04.669 --> 01:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
whether if we can
 
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
perform a calculation without those
 
01:19:08.450 --> 01:19:08.460 align:start position:0%
limitations I'm not sure we'll just have
 
01:19:11.090 --> 01:19:11.100 align:start position:0%
to look at the data once again
 
01:19:14.450 --> 01:19:14.460 align:start position:0%
um but bear in mind uh i s just just
 
01:19:18.410 --> 01:19:18.420 align:start position:0%
speaking anecdotally if um 10 years
 
01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:22.010 align:start position:0%
speaking anecdotally if um 10 years
limitation

01:19:22.010 --> 01:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:24.890 --> 01:19:24.900 align:start position:0%
potentially just thinking potentially
 
01:19:27.410 --> 01:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
the the nols could have been awfully
 
01:19:30.050 --> 01:19:30.060 align:start position:0%
claimed within that 10 years I'm not
 
01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:30.830 align:start position:0%
claimed within that 10 years I'm not
sure

01:19:30.830 --> 01:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:19:33.709 --> 01:19:33.719 align:start position:0%
um but that could be that potential
 
01:19:35.870 --> 01:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
um and therefore there would be no you
 
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
know okay over the past 10 years could
 
01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:40.189 align:start position:0%
know okay over the past 10 years could
be

01:19:40.189 --> 01:19:40.199 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:19:40.199 --> 01:19:40.970 align:start position:0%
be
um

01:19:40.970 --> 01:19:40.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:43.729 --> 01:19:43.739 align:start position:0%
and then with the 10 million dollar uh
 
01:19:46.490 --> 01:19:46.500 align:start position:0%
limitation that is on a year by year
 
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
basis every year where there's an animal
 
01:19:51.229 --> 01:19:51.239 align:start position:0%
that's loss is generated that 10 million
 
01:19:52.729 --> 01:19:52.739 align:start position:0%
dollars is applied to that particular
 
01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
year for carryover to next year and if
 
01:19:56.990 --> 01:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
next year this organization has another
 
01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
nol year again and then there's a that
 
01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
10 that 10 million dollars
 
01:20:04.189 --> 01:20:04.199 align:start position:0%
could be a new 10 million dollar limit
 
01:20:06.770 --> 01:20:06.780 align:start position:0%
on on that particular year as well so
 
01:20:08.149 --> 01:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
every year that's going to be that 10
 
01:20:10.130 --> 01:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
million dollar limitation as opposed to
 
01:20:12.649 --> 01:20:12.659 align:start position:0%
a a 10 million dollar limitation
 
01:20:15.950 --> 01:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
throughout the entire situation
 
01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:16.729 align:start position:0%
throughout the entire situation
um

01:20:16.729 --> 01:20:16.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:18.169 --> 01:20:18.179 align:start position:0%
so I guess
 
01:20:18.179 --> 01:20:19.550 align:start position:0%
so I guess
just

01:20:19.550 --> 01:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:20:22.250 --> 01:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
so summarize I think we we just have to
 
01:20:25.490 --> 01:20:25.500 align:start position:0%
look at what we have and see how look at
 
01:20:27.110 --> 01:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
it carefully see if we can really
 
01:20:30.649 --> 01:20:30.659 align:start position:0%
generate some kind of calculation
 
01:20:32.510 --> 01:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
representative Army
 
01:20:36.050 --> 01:20:36.060 align:start position:0%
thank you uh could you approach this a
 
01:20:38.290 --> 01:20:38.300 align:start position:0%
different way and find out from
 
01:20:41.330 --> 01:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and
 
01:20:46.189 --> 01:20:46.199 align:start position:0%
and anyplace else that seems relevant on
 
01:20:48.830 --> 01:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
if they could tell you about what
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
percentage of uh the losses that they
 
01:20:55.130 --> 01:20:55.140 align:start position:0%
take on these are after those
 
01:20:55.140 --> 01:20:58.010 align:start position:0%
take on these are after those
limitations

01:20:58.010 --> 01:20:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:02.990 --> 01:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
after after the 10 million or after the
 
01:21:07.250 --> 01:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
10-year I know that those two cross-sect
 
01:21:08.630 --> 01:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
each other which makes it different
 
01:21:12.290 --> 01:21:12.300 align:start position:0%
difficult right but
 
01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:14.810 align:start position:0%
difficult right but
um

01:21:14.810 --> 01:21:14.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
we could try that but however just bear
 
01:21:18.830 --> 01:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
in mind that uh
 
01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts have their own tax laws
 
01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
and and they calculate differently
 
01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:21:28.970 --> 01:21:28.980 align:start position:0%
whatever result from their nol could be
 
01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
potentially very vastly different from
 
01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:32.450 align:start position:0%
potentially very vastly different from
our

01:21:32.450 --> 01:21:32.460 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
what we get from for our nols
 
01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:37.669 align:start position:0%
what we get from for our nols
yeah

01:21:37.669 --> 01:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:21:39.370 --> 01:21:39.380 align:start position:0%
it it
 
01:21:42.229 --> 01:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
does seem to me if I could
 
01:21:46.189 --> 01:21:46.199 align:start position:0%
say something about that that
 
01:21:49.490 --> 01:21:49.500 align:start position:0%
in the past I've always thought okay if
 
01:21:52.610 --> 01:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
you can't stay if you're still losing a
 
01:21:56.390 --> 01:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
profit in at the 10th year you must
 
01:21:59.390 --> 01:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
be dying or you have a major sugar daddy
 
01:22:03.830 --> 01:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
but with the merging of businesses and
 
01:22:06.290 --> 01:22:06.300 align:start position:0%
the Takeover of businesses in order to
 
01:22:08.750 --> 01:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
have a loss later in one place to offset
 
01:22:12.110 --> 01:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
another I don't think that works these
 
01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:13.850 align:start position:0%
another I don't think that works these
days

01:22:13.850 --> 01:22:13.860 align:start position:0%
days
 
01:22:16.729 --> 01:22:16.739 align:start position:0%
the nol is still
 
01:22:17.930 --> 01:22:17.940 align:start position:0%
um according to our New Hampshire
 
01:22:21.950 --> 01:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
statutes the nol is oh it's still
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
um applicable to that particular entity
 
01:22:28.850 --> 01:22:28.860 align:start position:0%
so it's it is um you calculate the
 
01:22:30.350 --> 01:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
annual for that particular entity and
 
01:22:32.689 --> 01:22:32.699 align:start position:0%
you aggregate out to calculate your when
 
01:22:35.090 --> 01:22:35.100 align:start position:0%
you file combined return
 
01:22:38.330 --> 01:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
um so that that that tax
 
01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:39.590 align:start position:0%
um so that that that tax
um

01:22:39.590 --> 01:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:43.250 --> 01:22:43.260 align:start position:0%
that the nol element remains with that
 
01:22:45.890 --> 01:22:45.900 align:start position:0%
particular entity even though if it gets
 
01:22:47.390 --> 01:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
bought up so it's still that particular
 
01:22:48.770 --> 01:22:48.780 align:start position:0%
entity yeah
 
01:22:52.430 --> 01:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
so that a company could come along and
 
01:22:55.010 --> 01:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
just buy up a couple of our failed
 
01:22:59.450 --> 01:22:59.460 align:start position:0%
businesses and absorb their nols
 
01:23:02.030 --> 01:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
as long as as long as the entity that's
 
01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
being bought up Still Remains
 
01:23:07.370 --> 01:23:07.380 align:start position:0%
semi-functional yeah so the animal
 
01:23:09.350 --> 01:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
remains with that particular entity it
 
01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:16.010 --> 01:23:16.020 align:start position:0%
representative Phyllis did I see your
 
01:23:17.209 --> 01:23:17.219 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
01:23:19.910 --> 01:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
um yes but this is the kind of question
 
01:23:21.649 --> 01:23:21.659 align:start position:0%
I was
 
01:23:23.930 --> 01:23:23.940 align:start position:0%
thinking about and
 
01:23:23.940 --> 01:23:26.209 align:start position:0%
thinking about and
that

01:23:26.209 --> 01:23:26.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:28.189 --> 01:23:28.199 align:start position:0%
the only other thing I can think of to
 
01:23:32.450 --> 01:23:32.460 align:start position:0%
to ask related to this is can you tell
 
01:23:37.669 --> 01:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
us if there were or how many companies
 
01:23:40.850 --> 01:23:40.860 align:start position:0%
currently are are taking their nol out
 
01:23:44.810 --> 01:23:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:47.810 --> 01:23:47.820 align:start position:0%
or or some amount of time
 
01:23:47.820 --> 01:23:56.810 align:start position:0%
or or some amount of time
um

01:23:56.810 --> 01:23:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:58.850 --> 01:23:58.860 align:start position:0%
I'm just thinking how our system works
 
01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
and I I don't think we have that
 
01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
information because once our system
 
01:24:06.530 --> 01:24:06.540 align:start position:0%
limits the um the schedule to 10 years
 
01:24:09.709 --> 01:24:09.719 align:start position:0%
and then once that
 
01:24:12.530 --> 01:24:12.540 align:start position:0%
very first nol year
 
01:24:15.169 --> 01:24:15.179 align:start position:0%
passes that 10 years it gets dropped off
 
01:24:18.050 --> 01:24:18.060 align:start position:0%
so um it's
 
01:24:20.270 --> 01:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't we don't capture that
 
01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:22.430 align:start position:0%
it doesn't we don't capture that
information

01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:23.990 align:start position:0%
information
um

01:24:23.990 --> 01:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:27.530 --> 01:24:27.540 align:start position:0%
as a carryover next year and a year
 
01:24:30.050 --> 01:24:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:33.530 --> 01:24:33.540 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah if you didn't go out to
 
01:24:36.530 --> 01:24:36.540 align:start position:0%
could you look at nine years and would
 
01:24:38.450 --> 01:24:38.460 align:start position:0%
you know that who's carried it out for
 
01:24:42.169 --> 01:24:42.179 align:start position:0%
nine years right yep so so look up to
 
01:24:45.470 --> 01:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
the to the 10th year and see the very
 
01:24:48.050 --> 01:24:48.060 align:start position:0%
first year if there's still any nols
 
01:24:51.290 --> 01:24:51.300 align:start position:0%
available to be carried over
 
01:24:56.149 --> 01:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:58.250 --> 01:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
do you have any sense of what that would
 
01:25:01.189 --> 01:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
be or you'd have to go and look I I we
 
01:25:02.930 --> 01:25:02.940 align:start position:0%
would have to go back in and look at
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
that yes
 
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
other hands representative putt yes this
 
01:25:09.050 --> 01:25:09.060 align:start position:0%
is directed to representative Schomburg
 
01:25:12.229 --> 01:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Schomburg the
 
01:25:15.590 --> 01:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
80 percent of yeah right here 80 I'm a
 
01:25:17.270 --> 01:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
little reluctant to do away with because
 
01:25:19.370 --> 01:25:19.380 align:start position:0%
to me it's a revenue smoothing mechanism
 
01:25:22.669 --> 01:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
uh when you hit a real deep recession
 
01:25:26.149 --> 01:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
like 2008 it protects the state from too
 
01:25:28.910 --> 01:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
much of a downturn and it's no real even
 
01:25:30.649 --> 01:25:30.659 align:start position:0%
though it's it's a timing issue because
 
01:25:33.530 --> 01:25:33.540 align:start position:0%
then the business can carry the rest of
 
01:25:35.810 --> 01:25:35.820 align:start position:0%
it Forward would you be amenable too
 
01:25:37.790 --> 01:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
what you said you were amenable to
 
01:25:40.430 --> 01:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
something like uh a 20-year limitation
 
01:25:43.010 --> 01:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
and 20 million dollars and keep the 80
 
01:25:43.020 --> 01:25:44.209 align:start position:0%
and 20 million dollars and keep the 80
percent

01:25:44.209 --> 01:25:44.219 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:25:44.219 --> 01:25:46.250 align:start position:0%
percent
huh

01:25:46.250 --> 01:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
huh
 
01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
I would go along with what the committee
 
01:25:51.530 --> 01:25:51.540 align:start position:0%
would do I think when it came over from
 
01:25:53.510 --> 01:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
the other body
 
01:25:56.510 --> 01:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
to this committee last year and it was a
 
01:25:58.790 --> 01:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
19 or 20 to 1 vote
 
01:26:01.370 --> 01:26:01.380 align:start position:0%
to move forward with it I don't think
 
01:26:03.530 --> 01:26:03.540 align:start position:0%
they understood all the implications
 
01:26:07.010 --> 01:26:07.020 align:start position:0%
that went with it as uh the obvious Mr
 
01:26:10.669 --> 01:26:10.679 align:start position:0%
Brighton pointed out at that time that
 
01:26:13.910 --> 01:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
they weren't thinking so much of
 
01:26:15.530 --> 01:26:15.540 align:start position:0%
they were looking at the chapter C
 
01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
companies at that time trying to help
 
01:26:22.490 --> 01:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
them out and I I sometimes raises the
 
01:26:24.290 --> 01:26:24.300 align:start position:0%
hair on the back of my neck when I hear
 
01:26:27.770 --> 01:26:27.780 align:start position:0%
just one side being presented so uh I
 
01:26:30.050 --> 01:26:30.060 align:start position:0%
have no problem with an amenable
 
01:26:32.990 --> 01:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
approach to this I don't know what my uh
 
01:26:34.430 --> 01:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
leader might say
 
01:26:40.430 --> 01:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:42.290 --> 01:26:42.300 align:start position:0%
but just in listening to what your
 
01:26:44.209 --> 01:26:44.219 align:start position:0%
initial presentation today was you also
 
01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
talked about simplification so I don't
 
01:26:47.149 --> 01:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
know how we incorporate that
 
01:26:48.410 --> 01:26:48.420 align:start position:0%
representative almond did you have
 
01:26:51.290 --> 01:26:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:54.770 --> 01:26:54.780 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm opposed to the other ones the
 
01:26:58.090 --> 01:26:58.100 align:start position:0%
the reason that I can
 
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
grudgingly support taking five to six
 
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
million a year out of our revenues is
 
01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:06.770 align:start position:0%
million a year out of our revenues is
that

01:27:06.770 --> 01:27:06.780 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:27:12.169 --> 01:27:12.179 align:start position:0%
it looks like the people that are
 
01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:14.639 align:start position:0%
are suffering most from this would be
 
01:27:18.590 --> 01:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
the businesses that just got started and
 
01:27:22.209 --> 01:27:22.219 align:start position:0%
that are operating on a shoestruct
 
01:27:25.129 --> 01:27:25.139 align:start position:0%
shoestring for the first few years and
 
01:27:27.410 --> 01:27:27.420 align:start position:0%
the recession comes along they get a
 
01:27:30.890 --> 01:27:30.900 align:start position:0%
loss and the loss
 
01:27:33.890 --> 01:27:33.900 align:start position:0%
only they can only take 80 percent of
 
01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
that loss the
 
01:27:39.350 --> 01:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
and until they finish that loss off and
 
01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:40.490 align:start position:0%
and until they finish that loss off and
maybe

01:27:40.490 --> 01:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:41.090 align:start position:0%
maybe
um

01:27:41.090 --> 01:27:41.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:43.610 --> 01:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
they're operating on too little money to
 
01:27:45.770 --> 01:27:45.780 align:start position:0%
continue that first and second year
 
01:27:48.530 --> 01:27:48.540 align:start position:0%
while they're trying to get all of their
 
01:27:51.729 --> 01:27:51.739 align:start position:0%
their loss back from before
 
01:27:55.370 --> 01:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
and drop out of the market and
 
01:27:59.530 --> 01:27:59.540 align:start position:0%
and so we're discouraging
 
01:28:02.990 --> 01:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
startups with that started with maybe a
 
01:28:04.610 --> 01:28:04.620 align:start position:0%
really good idea but insufficient
 
01:28:04.620 --> 01:28:05.870 align:start position:0%
really good idea but insufficient
capital

01:28:05.870 --> 01:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
capital
 
01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
you do know that FedEx started that way
 
01:28:11.930 --> 01:28:11.940 align:start position:0%
too and they lost first five years of
 
01:28:14.149 --> 01:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
their operation they lost money
 
01:28:17.629 --> 01:28:17.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:19.790 --> 01:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
in a few years in between him
 
01:28:22.129 --> 01:28:22.139 align:start position:0%
I don't know if there's any way to get
 
01:28:25.370 --> 01:28:25.380 align:start position:0%
some kind of statistics on
 
01:28:29.390 --> 01:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
on the businesses aggregated statistics
 
01:28:32.450 --> 01:28:32.460 align:start position:0%
on the businesses that that
 
01:28:32.460 --> 01:28:34.250 align:start position:0%
on the businesses that that
um

01:28:34.250 --> 01:28:34.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:38.330 --> 01:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
got that had losses
 
01:28:38.340 --> 01:28:39.590 align:start position:0%
got that had losses
on

01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:28:41.209 --> 01:28:41.219 align:start position:0%
that they're going to have to be taking
 
01:28:44.149 --> 01:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
over multiple years
 
01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
um the the statistics that I brought
 
01:28:48.590 --> 01:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
today is a compilation of the
 
01:28:50.450 --> 01:28:50.460 align:start position:0%
information that we have from our tax
 
01:28:52.189 --> 01:28:52.199 align:start position:0%
expenditure report
 
01:28:54.649 --> 01:28:54.659 align:start position:0%
and it details out
 
01:28:56.870 --> 01:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:28:58.250 --> 01:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
amount of the number of business
 
01:29:00.169 --> 01:29:00.179 align:start position:0%
organizations that used an animal
 
01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
deduction for any particular fiscal year
 
01:29:06.410 --> 01:29:06.420 align:start position:0%
and a total the total nol used in that
 
01:29:08.810 --> 01:29:08.820 align:start position:0%
particular fiscal year and the total tax
 
01:29:11.810 --> 01:29:11.820 align:start position:0%
decrease due to the nol
 
01:29:16.149 --> 01:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
um for fiscal year 22 there was about uh
 
01:29:19.370 --> 01:29:19.380 align:start position:0%
6995 business organizations that used to
 
01:29:21.290 --> 01:29:21.300 align:start position:0%
I know nol deduction
 
01:29:25.310 --> 01:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
uh the total animal used was 470
 
01:29:28.610 --> 01:29:28.620 align:start position:0%
approximately 470 million and a total
 
01:29:31.930 --> 01:29:31.940 align:start position:0%
tax decrease due to nol was at 36
 
01:29:35.810 --> 01:29:35.820 align:start position:0%
approximately 36.2 million
 
01:29:35.820 --> 01:29:36.530 align:start position:0%
approximately 36.2 million
um

01:29:36.530 --> 01:29:36.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:39.470 --> 01:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
and the year before that facilia 21 the
 
01:29:41.450 --> 01:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
total tax decrease due to annual was at
 
01:29:43.129 --> 01:29:43.139 align:start position:0%
28 million
 
01:29:46.970 --> 01:29:46.980 align:start position:0%
and before that was 27.8 Million so it's
 
01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
around it's around a year
 
01:29:53.030 --> 01:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
the 30 million Mark for uh
 
01:29:56.510 --> 01:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
tax decrease due to nol and the the
 
01:29:58.010 --> 01:29:58.020 align:start position:0%
number of business organizations that
 
01:29:59.990 --> 01:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
had been claiming the nol deductions
 
01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:02.940 align:start position:0%
year over year has been around
 
01:30:05.030 --> 01:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
averaging about maybe
 
01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:05.810 align:start position:0%
averaging about maybe
um

01:30:05.810 --> 01:30:05.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:08.270 --> 01:30:08.280 align:start position:0%
six thousand seven hundred business
 
01:30:08.280 --> 01:30:12.169 align:start position:0%
six thousand seven hundred business
organizations

01:30:12.169 --> 01:30:12.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:15.050 --> 01:30:15.060 align:start position:0%
representative only could we
 
01:30:17.629 --> 01:30:17.639 align:start position:0%
could you apply the inverted triangle to
 
01:30:17.639 --> 01:30:25.910 align:start position:0%
could you apply the inverted triangle to
that

01:30:25.910 --> 01:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:28.610 --> 01:30:28.620 align:start position:0%
so that we knew which ones were pretty
 
01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
large businesses that can probably
 
01:30:32.750 --> 01:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
handle this and
 
01:30:36.950 --> 01:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh but not who they are yes we could try
 
01:30:38.570 --> 01:30:38.580 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
01:30:40.910 --> 01:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
this you know
 
01:30:42.950 --> 01:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
making sure not to cross the line of
 
01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:45.470 align:start position:0%
making sure not to cross the line of
disclosure

01:30:45.470 --> 01:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
disclosure
 
01:30:52.129 --> 01:30:52.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:55.030 --> 01:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
a thousand dollars
 
01:30:57.350 --> 01:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
representative horse thank you madam
 
01:30:58.910 --> 01:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:31:01.330 --> 01:31:01.340 align:start position:0%
question so if we were to look back
 
01:31:05.830 --> 01:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
after say 2010 to 2017
 
01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
the statistics you gave just a little
 
01:31:10.729 --> 01:31:10.739 align:start position:0%
while ago does that hold true from like
 
01:31:13.010 --> 01:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
10 to 17 after the recession the big
 
01:31:18.530 --> 01:31:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:20.689 --> 01:31:20.699 align:start position:0%
uh the information I have is all the way
 
01:31:22.930 --> 01:31:22.940 align:start position:0%
back to fiscal year 20 of 2015.
 
01:31:26.450 --> 01:31:26.460 align:start position:0%
excellent okay um so for 2015
 
01:31:28.189 --> 01:31:28.199 align:start position:0%
it's about the same so the business
 
01:31:30.290 --> 01:31:30.300 align:start position:0%
organizations that use the NL deductions
 
01:31:33.070 --> 01:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
was about 5 000 business organizations
 
01:31:37.310 --> 01:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
and the total tax decrease due to nol uh
 
01:31:39.410 --> 01:31:39.420 align:start position:0%
was 21 million
 
01:31:43.070 --> 01:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
and then in 2016 fiscally 2016 went up
 
01:31:46.129 --> 01:31:46.139 align:start position:0%
to 34 million of total tax decrease and
 
01:31:48.290 --> 01:31:48.300 align:start position:0%
it went back down to 25 million 23
 
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
million so it's about it's around that
 
01:31:53.810 --> 01:31:53.820 align:start position:0%
neighborhood of of numbers okay very
 
01:31:55.970 --> 01:31:55.980 align:start position:0%
good so it's probably in that 25 to 30
 
01:31:58.189 --> 01:31:58.199 align:start position:0%
range somewhere right thank you very
 
01:32:03.050 --> 01:32:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:12.830 --> 01:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
to wrap my mind around this so prior to
 
01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:15.290 align:start position:0%
to wrap my mind around this so prior to
2018

01:32:15.290 --> 01:32:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:17.390 --> 01:32:17.400 align:start position:0%
um the nol
 
01:32:20.149 --> 01:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
that businesses could take was 100 not
 
01:32:23.629 --> 01:32:23.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:26.570 --> 01:32:26.580 align:start position:0%
yes sorry so those numbers that you gave
 
01:32:28.390 --> 01:32:28.400 align:start position:0%
us prior to 2018
 
01:32:31.129 --> 01:32:31.139 align:start position:0%
that was a higher
 
01:32:34.990 --> 01:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
businesses could take 100 it's not 2018.
 
01:32:38.030 --> 01:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:32:39.770 --> 01:32:39.780 align:start position:0%
text year
 
01:32:39.780 --> 01:32:41.689 align:start position:0%
text year
um

01:32:41.689 --> 01:32:41.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
text texture 22 oh it takes you 21.
 
01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
um because I'm sorry for
 
01:32:55.550 --> 01:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
tax year 22 is when we uh
 
01:32:58.970 --> 01:32:58.980 align:start position:0%
when we conform to the tcga the the IRC
 
01:33:01.610 --> 01:33:01.620 align:start position:0%
of 2018 ah okay
 
01:33:03.950 --> 01:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
so um and that's when we have the 80
 
01:33:08.270 --> 01:33:08.280 align:start position:0%
percent uh cap okay prior to that so
 
01:33:11.870 --> 01:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
prior to tax year 22
 
01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
um we were not we were using the the the
 
01:33:22.629 --> 01:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:25.850 --> 01:33:25.860 align:start position:0%
2016. it was some some old old year it
 
01:33:28.129 --> 01:33:28.139 align:start position:0%
wasn't it wasn't conformant it wasn't
 
01:33:30.830 --> 01:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
the same Conformity as the rest of the
 
01:33:33.890 --> 01:33:33.900 align:start position:0%
BPT statutes for in terms of IRC has it
 
01:33:35.870 --> 01:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
had its own um
 
01:33:38.990 --> 01:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
Conformity year okay so let me restate
 
01:33:40.610 --> 01:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
my question and make sure I have it
 
01:33:45.890 --> 01:33:45.900 align:start position:0%
right so prior to 2022 the numbers that
 
01:33:47.629 --> 01:33:47.639 align:start position:0%
you're referring to the nol that
 
01:33:50.030 --> 01:33:50.040 align:start position:0%
businesses could write off was 100 not
 
01:33:53.209 --> 01:33:53.219 align:start position:0%
80. that's great okay so we have very
 
01:33:53.219 --> 01:33:54.050 align:start position:0%
80. that's great okay so we have very
little

01:33:54.050 --> 01:33:54.060 align:start position:0%
little
 
01:33:57.590 --> 01:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
information actually that where
 
01:33:59.510 --> 01:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
businesses will only be able to write
 
01:34:02.689 --> 01:34:02.699 align:start position:0%
off 80. it'll be this this year this
 
01:34:04.970 --> 01:34:04.980 align:start position:0%
year yes okay so the numbers that you're
 
01:34:06.350 --> 01:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
giving us
 
01:34:10.370 --> 01:34:10.380 align:start position:0%
are with an nol of 100 really
 
01:34:12.649 --> 01:34:12.659 align:start position:0%
that is correct okay so moving to the 80
 
01:34:14.870 --> 01:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
will be new for businesses in New
 
01:34:17.810 --> 01:34:17.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and for Revenue
 
01:34:22.850 --> 01:34:22.860 align:start position:0%
uh that is correct yes um yep okay so
 
01:34:26.270 --> 01:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
one more kind of how this works question
 
01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
and then kind of a policy question so
 
01:34:32.570 --> 01:34:32.580 align:start position:0%
the nol
 
01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:35.880 align:start position:0%
um the 10-year limit and the 10 million
 
01:34:37.790 --> 01:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
dollar limit
 
01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:39.169 align:start position:0%
dollar limit
um

01:34:39.169 --> 01:34:39.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:41.830 --> 01:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
so if I lose money
 
01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
in 2000
 
01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
I it let's say I lose a lot of money in
 
01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:49.250 align:start position:0%
I it let's say I lose a lot of money in
2000

01:34:49.250 --> 01:34:49.260 align:start position:0%
2000
 
01:34:53.149 --> 01:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
um and I am able to write that off over
 
01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
10 years because you know I made enough
 
01:34:58.729 --> 01:34:58.739 align:start position:0%
money to offset my losses and I get to
 
01:35:00.830 --> 01:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
write that off for 10 years
 
01:35:02.990 --> 01:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
um would that mean that I could write
 
01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:03.770 align:start position:0%
um would that mean that I could write
off

01:35:03.770 --> 01:35:03.780 align:start position:0%
off
 
01:35:05.870 --> 01:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
10 million dollars
 
01:35:10.010 --> 01:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
each of those years or in total
 
01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
the 10 million dollar limit is from the
 
01:35:16.910 --> 01:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
so the year where I incur the last the
 
01:35:18.110 --> 01:35:18.120 align:start position:0%
year that you include a loss whatever
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
the loss is and then you carry it over
 
01:35:21.830 --> 01:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
because in the year of the loss you're
 
01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:22.669 align:start position:0%
because in the year of the loss you're
not

01:35:22.669 --> 01:35:22.679 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:35:25.070 --> 01:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
using the laws you're carrying it over
 
01:35:28.250 --> 01:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
to the next year to use the laws so when
 
01:35:30.350 --> 01:35:30.360 align:start position:0%
you carry over that the amount that you
 
01:35:33.410 --> 01:35:33.420 align:start position:0%
can carry over is limited to 10 million
 
01:35:35.870 --> 01:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
dollars okay and then I can write that
 
01:35:38.450 --> 01:35:38.460 align:start position:0%
off over 10 years or over one year kind
 
01:35:40.189 --> 01:35:40.199 align:start position:0%
of just depending right depending money
 
01:35:43.250 --> 01:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
I make yes okay
 
01:35:46.610 --> 01:35:46.620 align:start position:0%
now if I lose
 
01:35:49.070 --> 01:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
10 million dollars again later
 
01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
I can write it off again later
 
01:35:54.250 --> 01:35:54.260 align:start position:0%
that is correct okay thank you for that
 
01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
so as I'm thinking through this if if
 
01:36:00.890 --> 01:36:00.900 align:start position:0%
the idea here is to help level the
 
01:36:02.810 --> 01:36:02.820 align:start position:0%
playing field
 
01:36:05.209 --> 01:36:05.219 align:start position:0%
um and I guess I'm thinking about that
 
01:36:08.570 --> 01:36:08.580 align:start position:0%
in two ways one way to support small
 
01:36:08.580 --> 01:36:10.490 align:start position:0%
in two ways one way to support small
businesses

01:36:10.490 --> 01:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:36:13.189 --> 01:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
um which who I'm assuming would not lose
 
01:36:15.290 --> 01:36:15.300 align:start position:0%
10 million dollars in one year if it's a
 
01:36:16.850 --> 01:36:16.860 align:start position:0%
small business
 
01:36:16.860 --> 01:36:17.510 align:start position:0%
small business
um

01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:19.790 --> 01:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
and to support new businesses because
 
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
often businesses lose money when they're
 
01:36:26.149 --> 01:36:26.159 align:start position:0%
new to to try and get going
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm looking at the three variables
 
01:36:31.370 --> 01:36:31.380 align:start position:0%
that we might want to play with to
 
01:36:32.930 --> 01:36:32.940 align:start position:0%
support new businesses and small
 
01:36:36.290 --> 01:36:36.300 align:start position:0%
businesses and it seems to me that going
 
01:36:39.050 --> 01:36:39.060 align:start position:0%
from 10 to 20 years or 10 million
 
01:36:42.350 --> 01:36:42.360 align:start position:0%
dollars to 20 million dollars would tend
 
01:36:45.050 --> 01:36:45.060 align:start position:0%
to benefit larger corporations who are
 
01:36:46.930 --> 01:36:46.940 align:start position:0%
playing in that field
 
01:36:50.810 --> 01:36:50.820 align:start position:0%
whereas going from 80 percent to a
 
01:36:53.629 --> 01:36:53.639 align:start position:0%
hundred percent of nol could really
 
01:36:56.470 --> 01:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
benefit very small businesses because
 
01:36:59.390 --> 01:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
for a small business losing twenty
 
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and only being able to
 
01:37:04.970 --> 01:37:04.980 align:start position:0%
write off 80 percent of that could be a
 
01:37:06.649 --> 01:37:06.659 align:start position:0%
much bigger pain point
 
01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
so it seems to me like if we really want
 
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
this to benefit
 
01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
small businesses or upstart businesses
 
01:37:15.229 --> 01:37:15.239 align:start position:0%
who down the road might be able to pay
 
01:37:18.950 --> 01:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
bet or BPT to the state it seems like
 
01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:20.750 align:start position:0%
bet or BPT to the state it seems like
the

01:37:20.750 --> 01:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:37:23.570 --> 01:37:23.580 align:start position:0%
the variable we wanna
 
01:37:27.350 --> 01:37:27.360 align:start position:0%
look at is that 80 so if small
 
01:37:29.090 --> 01:37:29.100 align:start position:0%
businesses cannot can write off a
 
01:37:31.070 --> 01:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
hundred percent of their loss it may be
 
01:37:33.110 --> 01:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
a very small amount in Revenue to the
 
01:37:34.669 --> 01:37:34.679 align:start position:0%
state right it might be twenty thousand
 
01:37:34.679 --> 01:37:35.750 align:start position:0%
state right it might be twenty thousand
dollars

01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:37:37.490 --> 01:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
um as opposed to twenty million dollars
 
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
and it seems like that would really help
 
01:37:41.330 --> 01:37:41.340 align:start position:0%
small businesses survive and be
 
01:37:41.340 --> 01:37:43.010 align:start position:0%
small businesses survive and be
competitive

01:37:43.010 --> 01:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
competitive
 
01:37:44.330 --> 01:37:44.340 align:start position:0%
um and make it to the point where
 
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
they're contributing to the state's
 
01:37:48.350 --> 01:37:48.360 align:start position:0%
revenues so
 
01:37:50.030 --> 01:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
um I would be
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
grateful if anyone can kind of address
 
01:37:54.770 --> 01:37:54.780 align:start position:0%
that point and present a different
 
01:37:56.930 --> 01:37:56.940 align:start position:0%
perspective so that I know if I'm
 
01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
getting that right but that's kind of
 
01:38:02.689 --> 01:38:02.699 align:start position:0%
my understanding at this point and I
 
01:38:04.910 --> 01:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
would be grateful for people to help me
 
01:38:08.830 --> 01:38:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:11.950 --> 01:38:11.960 align:start position:0%
weigh in on that
 
01:38:14.350 --> 01:38:14.360 align:start position:0%
it representative plan
 
01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
representative I think you're right on
 
01:38:17.510 --> 01:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
the money
 
01:38:19.669 --> 01:38:19.679 align:start position:0%
with respect to who it impacts my
 
01:38:21.350 --> 01:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
concern with the eighty percent wasn't
 
01:38:23.870 --> 01:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
that it was simply Revenue stabilization
 
01:38:26.090 --> 01:38:26.100 align:start position:0%
for the state because we could have a
 
01:38:29.149 --> 01:38:29.159 align:start position:0%
real bad year I and it may be the cons
 
01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
my concern is overblown because it is
 
01:38:34.810 --> 01:38:34.820 align:start position:0%
small businesses mostly the uh that that
 
01:38:37.129 --> 01:38:37.139 align:start position:0%
would take advantage of this and that
 
01:38:39.110 --> 01:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
the amount of money isn't that it isn't
 
01:38:41.149 --> 01:38:41.159 align:start position:0%
it most of the money comes from the huge
 
01:38:43.129 --> 01:38:43.139 align:start position:0%
corporation so maybe my concern is
 
01:38:45.110 --> 01:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
overblown that's a concern I thought
 
01:38:47.149 --> 01:38:47.159 align:start position:0%
your analysis was correct
 
01:38:49.070 --> 01:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
representative Rochford
 
01:38:52.250 --> 01:38:52.260 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I I I think representative
 
01:38:55.010 --> 01:38:55.020 align:start position:0%
Leafly brings up a an excellent point
 
01:38:58.010 --> 01:38:58.020 align:start position:0%
and um and and I think that I I think
 
01:38:59.570 --> 01:38:59.580 align:start position:0%
it's important we don't get stuck on a
 
01:39:02.450 --> 01:39:02.460 align:start position:0%
10 million dollars uh you know in in
 
01:39:04.669 --> 01:39:04.679 align:start position:0%
speaking to that what you're talking
 
01:39:04.679 --> 01:39:06.050 align:start position:0%
speaking to that what you're talking
about

01:39:06.050 --> 01:39:06.060 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:39:08.030 --> 01:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
um of course eliminating the 80 to 100
 
01:39:10.490 --> 01:39:10.500 align:start position:0%
for for small businesses is excellent
 
01:39:12.350 --> 01:39:12.360 align:start position:0%
something that I can relate to as a
 
01:39:14.750 --> 01:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
small business owner but looking down
 
01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
the road as far as attracting businesses
 
01:39:19.070 --> 01:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
into the state you know we've got
 
01:39:21.169 --> 01:39:21.179 align:start position:0%
Cambridge Massachusetts which is a
 
01:39:24.050 --> 01:39:24.060 align:start position:0%
biotech capital of the east coast and
 
01:39:25.490 --> 01:39:25.500 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we like to get a little bit of
 
01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:26.629 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we like to get a little bit of
that

01:39:26.629 --> 01:39:26.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:28.010 --> 01:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
um and these are you know these are
 
01:39:30.290 --> 01:39:30.300 align:start position:0%
startup companies and you know they
 
01:39:31.910 --> 01:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
could conceivably be
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
small businesses other than the fact
 
01:39:35.689 --> 01:39:35.699 align:start position:0%
that they deal with large amounts of
 
01:39:37.850 --> 01:39:37.860 align:start position:0%
money but those large amounts of money
 
01:39:40.729 --> 01:39:40.739 align:start position:0%
are can be gone whether the FDA says yes
 
01:39:44.030 --> 01:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
or no to a New Drug and you know I think
 
01:39:46.970 --> 01:39:46.980 align:start position:0%
so so you know to us here 10 million
 
01:39:48.410 --> 01:39:48.420 align:start position:0%
dollars is a very large amount of money
 
01:39:49.550 --> 01:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
but if we're in the business of
 
01:39:51.290 --> 01:39:51.300 align:start position:0%
attracting businesses and attracting
 
01:39:54.709 --> 01:39:54.719 align:start position:0%
people who could be the next Amgen or
 
01:39:59.090 --> 01:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
ABV or or whatever I think that you know
 
01:40:01.070 --> 01:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
eliminating that cap or raising the cap
 
01:40:05.510 --> 01:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
to much higher is much more in line with
 
01:40:08.030 --> 01:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
looking down the road to Growing our bet
 
01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
and BPT
 
01:40:13.010 --> 01:40:13.020 align:start position:0%
um and and I think by going limiting the
 
01:40:15.590 --> 01:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
80 to 100 percent does what we needed to
 
01:40:18.410 --> 01:40:18.420 align:start position:0%
do for small businesses but maybe being
 
01:40:19.870 --> 01:40:19.880 align:start position:0%
a little more
 
01:40:22.390 --> 01:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
aggressive with the second part of that
 
01:40:25.610 --> 01:40:25.620 align:start position:0%
could Foster the growth of new
 
01:40:28.729 --> 01:40:28.739 align:start position:0%
Industries in the State uh with with
 
01:40:28.739 --> 01:40:30.590 align:start position:0%
Industries in the State uh with with
that

01:40:30.590 --> 01:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:40:34.850 --> 01:40:34.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:36.110 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

01:40:36.110 --> 01:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:36.950 align:start position:0%
thanks
um

01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:38.390 --> 01:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
yeah I
 
01:40:41.750 --> 01:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
I think the 80 percent has been
 
01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:42.410 align:start position:0%
I think the 80 percent has been
um

01:40:42.410 --> 01:40:42.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:44.870 --> 01:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
well supported
 
01:40:47.930 --> 01:40:47.940 align:start position:0%
um I mean eliminating it
 
01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:49.669 align:start position:0%
um I mean eliminating it
um

01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:49.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:52.490 --> 01:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
so that's good and we've got a fiscal
 
01:40:55.610 --> 01:40:55.620 align:start position:0%
analysis on that and uh a fiscal note
 
01:40:58.010 --> 01:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:41:01.370 --> 01:41:01.380 align:start position:0%
um it costs some money apparently about
 
01:41:06.050 --> 01:41:06.060 align:start position:0%
six million dollars a year was the note
 
01:41:08.450 --> 01:41:08.460 align:start position:0%
in that range and um
 
01:41:11.090 --> 01:41:11.100 align:start position:0%
so that's good I
 
01:41:14.110 --> 01:41:14.120 align:start position:0%
beyond that we don't have
 
01:41:17.689 --> 01:41:17.699 align:start position:0%
analysis in terms of impact and I
 
01:41:19.550 --> 01:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be comfortable
 
01:41:23.330 --> 01:41:23.340 align:start position:0%
making a big change like that without
 
01:41:27.649 --> 01:41:27.659 align:start position:0%
some attempt at getting solid data to
 
01:41:30.250 --> 01:41:30.260 align:start position:0%
the extent to which we can get it
 
01:41:35.290 --> 01:41:35.300 align:start position:0%
I think that at the hearing on this bill
 
01:41:39.410 --> 01:41:39.420 align:start position:0%
dra uh suggested that an amendment this
 
01:41:41.629 --> 01:41:41.639 align:start position:0%
is my note I don't remember the details
 
01:41:44.689 --> 01:41:44.699 align:start position:0%
needed is needed to apply this to all
 
01:41:46.370 --> 01:41:46.380 align:start position:0%
types of businesses does that ring a
 
01:41:48.050 --> 01:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
bell with you yes yes that's correct
 
01:41:50.570 --> 01:41:50.580 align:start position:0%
what do we need are the amendment has
 
01:41:52.250 --> 01:41:52.260 align:start position:0%
been suggested by uh representative
 
01:41:55.790 --> 01:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
Schoenberg in the uh the
 
01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
the the one that was uh that
 
01:42:00.169 --> 01:42:00.179 align:start position:0%
representative Sean book just handed out
 
01:42:02.510 --> 01:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
oh that's on there okay so we've got the
 
01:42:05.090 --> 01:42:05.100 align:start position:0%
yes um I I do want to just add one more
 
01:42:06.770 --> 01:42:06.780 align:start position:0%
uh representative Schoenberg
 
01:42:09.530 --> 01:42:09.540 align:start position:0%
to uh the effective date the one on line
 
01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:10.910 align:start position:0%
to uh the effective date the one on line
13.

01:42:10.910 --> 01:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
13.
 
01:42:13.970 --> 01:42:13.980 align:start position:0%
if we can just tweak it a bit more just
 
01:42:13.980 --> 01:42:15.410 align:start position:0%
if we can just tweak it a bit more just
slightly

01:42:15.410 --> 01:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
slightly
 
01:42:18.770 --> 01:42:18.780 align:start position:0%
um to this act shall take effect for
 
01:42:21.950 --> 01:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
taxable periods ending on or after and
 
01:42:25.390 --> 01:42:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:29.930 --> 01:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
yeah so just to add there between effect
 
01:42:33.590 --> 01:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
and December so for taxable peers ending
 
01:42:37.010 --> 01:42:37.020 align:start position:0%
on or after yeah
 
01:42:37.020 --> 01:42:38.390 align:start position:0%
on or after yeah
okay

01:42:38.390 --> 01:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:43.790 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:42:43.790 --> 01:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:46.669 --> 01:42:46.679 align:start position:0%
so I guess I guess that's yeah I think I
 
01:42:50.209 --> 01:42:50.219 align:start position:0%
I I I from my perspective only for what
 
01:42:53.810 --> 01:42:53.820 align:start position:0%
it's worth it's so a good bill and uh
 
01:42:57.790 --> 01:42:57.800 align:start position:0%
we've got some uh minor technical
 
01:43:01.370 --> 01:43:01.380 align:start position:0%
changes to it but basically it's the
 
01:43:03.410 --> 01:43:03.420 align:start position:0%
bill that was presented
 
01:43:05.290 --> 01:43:05.300 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
01:43:08.270 --> 01:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
I'm comfortable with going forward on it
 
01:43:11.149 --> 01:43:11.159 align:start position:0%
but not as I say even though some good
 
01:43:14.810 --> 01:43:14.820 align:start position:0%
concerns have been expressed uh the
 
01:43:20.030 --> 01:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
other Lids on this bill right now
 
01:43:21.770 --> 01:43:21.780 align:start position:0%
representative Phyllis
 
01:43:24.770 --> 01:43:24.780 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm still trying to get my head
 
01:43:27.530 --> 01:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
around like exactly who's using this and
 
01:43:29.629 --> 01:43:29.639 align:start position:0%
how it's being used and I think in terms
 
01:43:31.850 --> 01:43:31.860 align:start position:0%
of the small businesses you know that
 
01:43:33.830 --> 01:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
this is just like the you know Mom and
 
01:43:35.990 --> 01:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
Pop or you know just a one or two
 
01:43:39.770 --> 01:43:39.780 align:start position:0%
employees I'm I'm wondering if they
 
01:43:46.010 --> 01:43:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
um every year and the reason that they
 
01:43:52.490 --> 01:43:52.500 align:start position:0%
might be able to do that is because
 
01:43:55.370 --> 01:43:55.380 align:start position:0%
they can set their salary at anything
 
01:43:58.729 --> 01:43:58.739 align:start position:0%
that's reasonable and their salary can
 
01:44:01.310 --> 01:44:01.320 align:start position:0%
control you know what their profit is
 
01:44:03.169 --> 01:44:03.179 align:start position:0%
but they still get by there's still a
 
01:44:05.570 --> 01:44:05.580 align:start position:0%
little business and they get by
 
01:44:07.729 --> 01:44:07.739 align:start position:0%
I don't know does that make sense to you
 
01:44:10.490 --> 01:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
understand yeah yeah so that I'm
 
01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
wondering what part of the population is
 
01:44:15.590 --> 01:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
that in which case it doesn't really
 
01:44:19.070 --> 01:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
matter if it's like 80 or 100 it's just
 
01:44:20.890 --> 01:44:20.900 align:start position:0%
you know I mean you can pay yourself
 
01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
eighty thousand dollars a year or you
 
01:44:24.950 --> 01:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
can pay yourself a hundred and twenty
 
01:44:26.510 --> 01:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year no one's going
 
01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
to question that you you know just avoid
 
01:44:32.390 --> 01:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
paying the tax altogether and for the
 
01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:33.370 align:start position:0%
paying the tax altogether and for the
larger

01:44:33.370 --> 01:44:33.380 align:start position:0%
larger
 
01:44:36.109 --> 01:44:36.119 align:start position:0%
businesses the ones that move into the
 
01:44:39.709 --> 01:44:39.719 align:start position:0%
state big ones big losses if they lose
 
01:44:42.350 --> 01:44:42.360 align:start position:0%
three years in a row lose money three
 
01:44:44.810 --> 01:44:44.820 align:start position:0%
years in a row doesn't matter if it's
 
01:44:46.609 --> 01:44:46.619 align:start position:0%
like 80 percent or a hundred percent
 
01:44:48.709 --> 01:44:48.719 align:start position:0%
they're not using it at all because
 
01:44:50.689 --> 01:44:50.699 align:start position:0%
they're still those first years they
 
01:44:52.430 --> 01:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
just are not paying any taxes because
 
01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
they didn't make any profit
 
01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:55.669 align:start position:0%
they didn't make any profit
right

01:44:55.669 --> 01:44:55.679 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:44:55.679 --> 01:44:57.229 align:start position:0%
right
so

01:44:57.229 --> 01:44:57.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:44:59.689 --> 01:44:59.699 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure it matters
 
01:45:01.970 --> 01:45:01.980 align:start position:0%
bullying I don't I don't I don't really
 
01:45:05.930 --> 01:45:05.940 align:start position:0%
see a big benefit to anybody for for
 
01:45:08.270 --> 01:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
changing it but on the other hand I
 
01:45:11.270 --> 01:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
don't think it's a disaster if we
 
01:45:13.729 --> 01:45:13.739 align:start position:0%
change the uh
 
01:45:16.010 --> 01:45:16.020 align:start position:0%
the the limit you know
 
01:45:18.169 --> 01:45:18.179 align:start position:0%
the maximum
 
01:45:20.750 --> 01:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
I I prefer not to see the 10 years
 
01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
change though that just seems
 
01:45:25.370 --> 01:45:25.380 align:start position:0%
Kim did you want to comment on that yeah
 
01:45:28.370 --> 01:45:28.380 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to make aware that that 80
 
01:45:28.380 --> 01:45:29.990 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to make aware that that 80
cap

01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
cap
 
01:45:33.590 --> 01:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
um it caps the the amount of nol that
 
01:45:35.689 --> 01:45:35.699 align:start position:0%
can be claimed up to the 80 of the
 
01:45:37.430 --> 01:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
federal taxable income for that
 
01:45:38.570 --> 01:45:38.580 align:start position:0%
particular year
 
01:45:40.070 --> 01:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:45:42.530 --> 01:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
the excess of that carries over to the
 
01:45:45.770 --> 01:45:45.780 align:start position:0%
next year so it's not like 80 and that's
 
01:45:47.629 --> 01:45:47.639 align:start position:0%
it you're not gonna get the rest of the
 
01:45:48.950 --> 01:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
the nol
 
01:45:51.229 --> 01:45:51.239 align:start position:0%
it gets carried over to the next year so
 
01:45:55.010 --> 01:45:55.020 align:start position:0%
it's it sort of prolongs the uh the nol
 
01:45:59.450 --> 01:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
claim versus claiming it all in one one
 
01:45:59.460 --> 01:46:00.830 align:start position:0%
claim versus claiming it all in one one
year

01:46:00.830 --> 01:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:46:02.149 --> 01:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
um so just
 
01:46:02.159 --> 01:46:06.189 align:start position:0%
um so just
yeah

01:46:06.189 --> 01:46:06.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:09.649 --> 01:46:09.659 align:start position:0%
misunderstand so a company that loses
 
01:46:11.930 --> 01:46:11.940 align:start position:0%
for three years in a row forget forget
 
01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
about the carry board they just lose
 
01:46:15.470 --> 01:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
money three years in a row
 
01:46:18.290 --> 01:46:18.300 align:start position:0%
they don't pay any taxes
 
01:46:21.050 --> 01:46:21.060 align:start position:0%
on no business profits tax those three
 
01:46:21.060 --> 01:46:21.950 align:start position:0%
on no business profits tax those three
years

01:46:21.950 --> 01:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:46:25.129 --> 01:46:25.139 align:start position:0%
and there's no point in even using the
 
01:46:26.990 --> 01:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
carry forward they don't they don't use
 
01:46:29.510 --> 01:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
to carry forward at all so
 
01:46:32.030 --> 01:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
yes but then the the amount would still
 
01:46:34.370 --> 01:46:34.380 align:start position:0%
be carried over to the year when they
 
01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
would use it
 
01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:37.609 align:start position:0%
would use it
right

01:46:37.609 --> 01:46:37.619 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:46:37.619 --> 01:46:41.330 align:start position:0%
right
yes

01:46:41.330 --> 01:46:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:43.609 --> 01:46:43.619 align:start position:0%
representative Olney
 
01:46:46.790 --> 01:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you we've got a lot of startups in
 
01:46:49.970 --> 01:46:49.980 align:start position:0%
my community and I'm thinking also if
 
01:46:53.290 --> 01:46:53.300 align:start position:0%
the dean Cayman people on
 
01:46:55.850 --> 01:46:55.860 align:start position:0%
they attract
 
01:46:55.860 --> 01:46:57.609 align:start position:0%
they attract
Young

01:46:57.609 --> 01:46:57.619 align:start position:0%
Young
 
01:47:00.729 --> 01:47:00.739 align:start position:0%
scientists uh
 
01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
that are working for a lot less than
 
01:47:05.209 --> 01:47:05.219 align:start position:0%
they could have made if they went into
 
01:47:07.010 --> 01:47:07.020 align:start position:0%
an old business
 
01:47:11.750 --> 01:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
but on if they can't earn enough
 
01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:14.639 align:start position:0%
in the year that they can pay the rent
 
01:47:18.109 --> 01:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
in places like Lebanon and Manchester
 
01:47:22.189 --> 01:47:22.199 align:start position:0%
and and such on
 
01:47:25.189 --> 01:47:25.199 align:start position:0%
then the business has problems so there
 
01:47:27.890 --> 01:47:27.900 align:start position:0%
there it you can't just reduce
 
01:47:30.229 --> 01:47:30.239 align:start position:0%
especially in New Hampshire you can't
 
01:47:34.310 --> 01:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
reduce your cost of living enough to fit
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
under the circumstance that you're
 
01:47:43.430 --> 01:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:46.070 --> 01:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
can I just it sounds like we have a lot
 
01:47:48.169 --> 01:47:48.179 align:start position:0%
of uncertainty here that's what I'm
 
01:47:51.770 --> 01:47:51.780 align:start position:0%
hearing and uh I think we this is a very
 
01:47:53.330 --> 01:47:53.340 align:start position:0%
important topic that we all care a lot
 
01:47:55.550 --> 01:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
about representative Schamberg would
 
01:47:57.470 --> 01:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
this be something you'd consider
 
01:47:59.689 --> 01:47:59.699 align:start position:0%
retaining I don't know does it need more
 
01:48:01.850 --> 01:48:01.860 align:start position:0%
time do we because we're going to start
 
01:48:03.229 --> 01:48:03.239 align:start position:0%
running out of time soon I'm just
 
01:48:04.669 --> 01:48:04.679 align:start position:0%
throwing that out there because it just
 
01:48:06.410 --> 01:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing a lot of different things
 
01:48:10.490 --> 01:48:10.500 align:start position:0%
and please tell me your thoughts
 
01:48:12.109 --> 01:48:12.119 align:start position:0%
I think there are a lot of good points
 
01:48:13.550 --> 01:48:13.560 align:start position:0%
have been brought up
 
01:48:15.770 --> 01:48:15.780 align:start position:0%
by representatively and representative
 
01:48:15.780 --> 01:48:17.209 align:start position:0%
by representatively and representative
rofford

01:48:17.209 --> 01:48:17.219 align:start position:0%
rofford
 
01:48:22.250 --> 01:48:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:24.830 --> 01:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
maybe a longer look at it would would
 
01:48:26.450 --> 01:48:26.460 align:start position:0%
help us understand it better and give
 
01:48:30.169 --> 01:48:30.179 align:start position:0%
more time for the dra to come up with
 
01:48:32.570 --> 01:48:32.580 align:start position:0%
more uh data
 
01:48:34.970 --> 01:48:34.980 align:start position:0%
and somehow be creative and how they get
 
01:48:37.129 --> 01:48:37.139 align:start position:0%
it to show to us how it works
 
01:48:40.850 --> 01:48:40.860 align:start position:0%
so I have no objection to a retainment I
 
01:48:42.530 --> 01:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
don't know if anybody else does
 
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
I you know this is just discussion
 
01:48:46.310 --> 01:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
obviously you'll go back to your
 
01:48:48.410 --> 01:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
caucuses go back home tonight look over
 
01:48:49.790 --> 01:48:49.800 align:start position:0%
your notes think about what you want to
 
01:48:51.890 --> 01:48:51.900 align:start position:0%
do tomorrow but I just you know it just
 
01:48:54.050 --> 01:48:54.060 align:start position:0%
it's a great Bill we obviously spending
 
01:48:55.010 --> 01:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
a lot of time on because if you think
 
01:48:56.870 --> 01:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
it's a great bill but we just it seems
 
01:48:58.490 --> 01:48:58.500 align:start position:0%
like there's a lot of questions still
 
01:49:01.070 --> 01:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
out there representative Almy
 
01:49:03.830 --> 01:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
yes I do think
 
01:49:08.149 --> 01:49:08.159 align:start position:0%
on if we send this bill out now the
 
01:49:10.250 --> 01:49:10.260 align:start position:0%
finance committee isn't going to react
 
01:49:13.450 --> 01:49:13.460 align:start position:0%
positively to its existence
 
01:49:17.750 --> 01:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
taking out a 12 million more out of out
 
01:49:21.530 --> 01:49:21.540 align:start position:0%
of the stuff that they have to cut on
 
01:49:23.390 --> 01:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:49:26.930 --> 01:49:26.940 align:start position:0%
the Senate I don't know where they would
 
01:49:29.930 --> 01:49:29.940 align:start position:0%
be on that but if we wait until the fall
 
01:49:35.570 --> 01:49:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:38.030 --> 01:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be nice and maybe less
 
01:49:40.490 --> 01:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
uncertainty is I think the the biggest
 
01:49:42.649 --> 01:49:42.659 align:start position:0%
challenge we face right now in this
 
01:49:46.010 --> 01:49:46.020 align:start position:0%
committee um yes other comments while
 
01:49:49.070 --> 01:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:51.890 --> 01:49:51.900 align:start position:0%
okay uh any more questions while we have
 
01:49:54.709 --> 01:49:54.719 align:start position:0%
expert guidance here yes representative
 
01:49:54.719 --> 01:49:57.470 align:start position:0%
expert guidance here yes representative
Ames

01:49:57.470 --> 01:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:00.890 --> 01:50:00.900 align:start position:0%
the data that you were looking at
 
01:50:03.169 --> 01:50:03.179 align:start position:0%
um did you say that was from a tax
 
01:50:05.030 --> 01:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
expenditure report
 
01:50:08.030 --> 01:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
that's correct uh the Texas we publish a
 
01:50:09.950 --> 01:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
tax expenditure report annually and it's
 
01:50:12.649 --> 01:50:12.659 align:start position:0%
available on our website one of the
 
01:50:14.870 --> 01:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
items on the tax expenditure report is
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
the nol expenditure yeah glad to hear
 
01:50:23.870 --> 01:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:26.149 --> 01:50:26.159 align:start position:0%
okay any other comments before we wrap
 
01:50:29.270 --> 01:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
it up okay let's uh wrap it up now and
 
01:50:31.550 --> 01:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
then uh take a lunch break until one
 
01:50:33.229 --> 01:50:33.239 align:start position:0%
o'clock and then we'll continue with
 
01:50:34.970 --> 01:50:34.980 align:start position:0%
some more work sessions
 
01:50:37.490 --> 01:50:37.500 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that discussion
 
03:07:13.610 --> 03:07:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:13.620 --> 03:07:15.349 align:start position:0%
 
tomorrow

03:07:15.349 --> 03:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
03:07:20.030 --> 03:07:20.040 align:start position:0%
then next week so on Monday
 
03:07:25.070 --> 03:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
March 13th we have two second committee
 
03:07:29.650 --> 03:07:29.660 align:start position:0%
bills one house bill 639 which is the
 
03:07:31.969 --> 03:07:31.979 align:start position:0%
cannabis bill
 
03:07:34.550 --> 03:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to do that at 9 00 a.m and
 
03:07:36.950 --> 03:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to do it in this room
 
03:07:39.349 --> 03:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
the chairman of the former committee did
 
03:07:41.630 --> 03:07:41.640 align:start position:0%
not believe we need to go to reps Hall
 
03:07:43.330 --> 03:07:43.340 align:start position:0%
we shall see
 
03:07:45.849 --> 03:07:45.859 align:start position:0%
we shall see about that
 
03:07:48.469 --> 03:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
but we've got the whole morning planned
 
03:07:51.230 --> 03:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
for that and we will be focusing on the
 
03:07:53.690 --> 03:07:53.700 align:start position:0%
revenue aspects and trying not to go
 
03:07:57.170 --> 03:07:57.180 align:start position:0%
backwards on the policy itself
 
03:08:00.769 --> 03:08:00.779 align:start position:0%
then in the afternoon of next Monday
 
03:08:04.610 --> 03:08:04.620 align:start position:0%
we have house bill 494.
 
03:08:06.830 --> 03:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
also a second committee bill which has
 
03:08:10.010 --> 03:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
to do with the fertilizers I have not
 
03:08:11.510 --> 03:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
read that yet
 
03:08:14.150 --> 03:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
so that's what that is and then I was
 
03:08:16.610 --> 03:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
going to plan a day for next Tuesday but
 
03:08:19.130 --> 03:08:19.140 align:start position:0%
it is a town meeting day
 
03:08:21.170 --> 03:08:21.180 align:start position:0%
so that would put a lot of people in a
 
03:08:23.750 --> 03:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
tough spot so what we did is scheduled
 
03:08:26.929 --> 03:08:26.939 align:start position:0%
an exec session next Wednesday and it
 
03:08:28.370 --> 03:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
should have been listed for all
 
03:08:30.590 --> 03:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
remaining bills so anything we don't get
 
03:08:34.790 --> 03:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
done tomorrow we'll try to get done then
 
03:08:38.330 --> 03:08:38.340 align:start position:0%
and if we can deal with these two second
 
03:08:41.030 --> 03:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
committee bills then we will if we can't
 
03:08:43.070 --> 03:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
we have more time on those
 
03:08:46.330 --> 03:08:46.340 align:start position:0%
now the house clerk told us this morning
 
03:08:49.450 --> 03:08:49.460 align:start position:0%
uh let me look at my deadlines
 
03:08:53.030 --> 03:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
that we must
 
03:08:58.730 --> 03:08:58.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:02.389 --> 03:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
no to the house clerk by noon on March
 
03:09:07.610 --> 03:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:09.349 --> 03:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
so keep in mind we have to go backwards
 
03:09:10.550 --> 03:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
03:09:12.710 --> 03:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
as soon as we can get things done at an
 
03:09:15.950 --> 03:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
executive session we should have blurbs
 
03:09:18.530 --> 03:09:18.540 align:start position:0%
committee reports
 
03:09:21.650 --> 03:09:21.660 align:start position:0%
written up and ready to go so the sooner
 
03:09:23.389 --> 03:09:23.399 align:start position:0%
we can feed all that stuff to our
 
03:09:25.370 --> 03:09:25.380 align:start position:0%
committee assistant the sooner she can
 
03:09:27.530 --> 03:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
feed it to the clerk so that then we
 
03:09:30.170 --> 03:09:30.180 align:start position:0%
know for scheduling purposes how how
 
03:09:32.090 --> 03:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
sessions are going to go but we're now
 
03:09:33.650 --> 03:09:33.660 align:start position:0%
next week is going to start to be more
 
03:09:35.690 --> 03:09:35.700 align:start position:0%
deadline oriented but we're going to try
 
03:09:37.849 --> 03:09:37.859 align:start position:0%
to get done as much as we can this week
 
03:09:39.830 --> 03:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
does that make sense
 
03:09:43.070 --> 03:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
do we have copies yet
 
03:16:44.210 --> 03:16:44.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:45.769 --> 03:16:45.779 align:start position:0%
sorry everyone we're just waiting for
 
03:16:47.510 --> 03:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
copies and it's a busy day here I guess
 
03:16:53.150 --> 03:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:56.269 --> 03:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
03:16:59.389 --> 03:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
physical like it's a full copy of the
 
03:17:01.730 --> 03:17:01.740 align:start position:0%
bill was requested that included some
 
03:17:03.530 --> 03:17:03.540 align:start position:0%
sort of fiscal note was that was
 
03:17:05.030 --> 03:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
requested and then there's some sort of
 
03:17:07.730 --> 03:17:07.740 align:start position:0%
a summary of the different parts of the
 
03:17:10.550 --> 03:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
bill and it was sent out but I don't
 
03:17:13.010 --> 03:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
know if everyone has it so just making
 
03:17:13.020 --> 03:20:27.550 align:start position:0%
know if everyone has it so just making
sure

03:20:27.550 --> 03:20:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:30.469 --> 03:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
sorry about that guys all right so
 
03:20:33.769 --> 03:20:33.779 align:start position:0%
uh this is now a committee work session
 
03:20:33.779 --> 03:20:35.690 align:start position:0%
uh this is now a committee work session
on

03:20:35.690 --> 03:20:35.700 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:20:38.630 --> 03:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
House Bill 607
 
03:20:41.330 --> 03:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
so reminder This Is Us speaking amongst
 
03:20:45.290 --> 03:20:45.300 align:start position:0%
ourselves to learn more about this bill
 
03:20:47.450 --> 03:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
um and this is not a time for public
 
03:20:49.670 --> 03:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
testimony however we have experts in the
 
03:20:51.410 --> 03:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
room who are available to answer
 
03:20:54.290 --> 03:20:54.300 align:start position:0%
questions as they come up so this is
 
03:20:55.790 --> 03:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
your bill representative just said do
 
03:20:59.269 --> 03:20:59.279 align:start position:0%
you want to start us off sure and and I
 
03:20:59.279 --> 03:21:00.290 align:start position:0%
you want to start us off sure and and I
guess

03:21:00.290 --> 03:21:00.300 align:start position:0%
guess
 
03:21:03.410 --> 03:21:03.420 align:start position:0%
and forgive me for the uh copies stuff
 
03:21:05.389 --> 03:21:05.399 align:start position:0%
uh if Karen's kind of busy I'm sure
 
03:21:07.969 --> 03:21:07.979 align:start position:0%
everybody noticed the level of
 
03:21:11.269 --> 03:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
uh action over here in the lob today so
 
03:21:13.010 --> 03:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
she couldn't get it done for us rapidly
 
03:21:13.020 --> 03:21:14.750 align:start position:0%
she couldn't get it done for us rapidly
nonetheless

03:21:14.750 --> 03:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
nonetheless
 
03:21:14.760 --> 03:21:15.710 align:start position:0%
nonetheless
um

03:21:15.710 --> 03:21:15.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:18.710 --> 03:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of uh members on the
 
03:21:22.550 --> 03:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
committee that probably don't
 
03:21:22.560 --> 03:21:23.710 align:start position:0%
committee that probably don't
understand

03:21:23.710 --> 03:21:23.720 align:start position:0%
understand
 
03:21:26.450 --> 03:21:26.460 align:start position:0%
uh charitable gaming
 
03:21:26.460 --> 03:21:28.010 align:start position:0%
uh charitable gaming
uh

03:21:28.010 --> 03:21:28.020 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:21:30.769 --> 03:21:30.779 align:start position:0%
in the minutia and we're never gonna get
 
03:21:33.290 --> 03:21:33.300 align:start position:0%
through that this morning talking about
 
03:21:36.230 --> 03:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
it so I I mean if we can give it a
 
03:21:40.670 --> 03:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
peripheral kind of Rita's digest version
 
03:21:40.680 --> 03:21:41.870 align:start position:0%
peripheral kind of Rita's digest version
um

03:21:41.870 --> 03:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:46.250 --> 03:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
the state and it's in its wisdom some 10
 
03:21:49.670 --> 03:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
or so years ago after years of back and
 
03:21:54.410 --> 03:21:54.420 align:start position:0%
forth in relation to Lodge
 
03:21:59.150 --> 03:21:59.160 align:start position:0%
uh you know traditional Casino gaming
 
03:22:02.570 --> 03:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
chose to go the route that we have in
 
03:22:04.190 --> 03:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
place now the model that we have in
 
03:22:06.530 --> 03:22:06.540 align:start position:0%
place now which is the shareable gaming
 
03:22:09.710 --> 03:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
rooms as we have them in New Hampshire
 
03:22:12.650 --> 03:22:12.660 align:start position:0%
um with that
 
03:22:15.469 --> 03:22:15.479 align:start position:0%
uh me being from Salem I've I've been
 
03:22:18.410 --> 03:22:18.420 align:start position:0%
around it uh pretty much since it
 
03:22:20.630 --> 03:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
started even before then and we can go
 
03:22:21.950 --> 03:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
back to
 
03:22:24.590 --> 03:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
you know the Bingo days when Bingo was
 
03:22:24.600 --> 03:22:25.550 align:start position:0%
you know the Bingo days when Bingo was
big

03:22:25.550 --> 03:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
big
 
03:22:25.560 --> 03:22:26.990 align:start position:0%
big
but

03:22:26.990 --> 03:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:22:30.650 --> 03:22:30.660 align:start position:0%
in incremental portions each year
 
03:22:33.830 --> 03:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming has become most
 
03:22:36.650 --> 03:22:36.660 align:start position:0%
importantly a great Revenue source for
 
03:22:39.469 --> 03:22:39.479 align:start position:0%
our local charities a lot of these
 
03:22:39.479 --> 03:22:40.670 align:start position:0%
our local charities a lot of these
charities

03:22:40.670 --> 03:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
charities
 
03:22:44.929 --> 03:22:44.939 align:start position:0%
uh rely squarely rely on this Revenue to
 
03:22:46.849 --> 03:22:46.859 align:start position:0%
do their service delivery to our
 
03:22:46.859 --> 03:22:48.950 align:start position:0%
do their service delivery to our
communities

03:22:48.950 --> 03:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
communities
 
03:22:48.960 --> 03:22:51.110 align:start position:0%
communities
what

03:22:51.110 --> 03:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:22:56.330 --> 03:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
what we have now for a for a model is
 
03:22:58.550 --> 03:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
um some some of the operators choose to
 
03:23:01.150 --> 03:23:01.160 align:start position:0%
call them casinos I guess it's a better
 
03:23:03.469 --> 03:23:03.479 align:start position:0%
vernacular for advertisement or whatever
 
03:23:05.809 --> 03:23:05.819 align:start position:0%
but we'll call them charitable casinos
 
03:23:08.570 --> 03:23:08.580 align:start position:0%
I'll acknowledge that but we have all
 
03:23:11.389 --> 03:23:11.399 align:start position:0%
sorts of gaming uh from Blackjack
 
03:23:13.550 --> 03:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
roulette uh
 
03:23:15.530 --> 03:23:15.540 align:start position:0%
and pretty much all the games you can
 
03:23:18.170 --> 03:23:18.180 align:start position:0%
imagine uh poker
 
03:23:21.490 --> 03:23:21.500 align:start position:0%
uh Spanish 21 all that stuff
 
03:23:26.330 --> 03:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
and now as of last biennium we passed a
 
03:23:29.570 --> 03:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
bill that allowed for historic horse
 
03:23:32.650 --> 03:23:32.660 align:start position:0%
racing machines which is the latest
 
03:23:36.469 --> 03:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
incremental step forward for these rooms
 
03:23:40.130 --> 03:23:40.140 align:start position:0%
and with that legislation we allowed for
 
03:23:43.790 --> 03:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
at present time prior to this each
 
03:23:47.229 --> 03:23:47.239 align:start position:0%
charity was entitled to or could have 10
 
03:23:50.389 --> 03:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
calendar days at a charitable gaming
 
03:23:50.399 --> 03:23:52.010 align:start position:0%
calendar days at a charitable gaming
facility

03:23:52.010 --> 03:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
facility
 
03:23:54.710 --> 03:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
and utilize the revenue that was
 
03:23:56.990 --> 03:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
generated in those 10 days in an effort
 
03:23:58.610 --> 03:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
for their charities
 
03:24:03.469 --> 03:24:03.479 align:start position:0%
with the passage of the HHR bill
 
03:24:08.450 --> 03:24:08.460 align:start position:0%
uh last biennium we in fact doubled the
 
03:24:10.309 --> 03:24:10.319 align:start position:0%
availability for Charities if a
 
03:24:12.590 --> 03:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming room applies for and
 
03:24:16.490 --> 03:24:16.500 align:start position:0%
it's and is approved to have historic
 
03:24:19.910 --> 03:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
horse racing then instead of say 35
 
03:24:24.050 --> 03:24:24.060 align:start position:0%
Charities having 10 days 10 days we
 
03:24:26.150 --> 03:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
doubled it to 70. some of these rooms
 
03:24:30.469 --> 03:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
will split them five days you know so at
 
03:24:33.349 --> 03:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
present we probably have about 900 about
 
03:24:37.490 --> 03:24:37.500 align:start position:0%
900 Charities local charities that are
 
03:24:39.290 --> 03:24:39.300 align:start position:0%
getting revenue from these charitable
 
03:24:41.929 --> 03:24:41.939 align:start position:0%
gaming rooms we have 14 charitable
 
03:24:43.670 --> 03:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
gaming rooms in operation right now I
 
03:24:45.889 --> 03:24:45.899 align:start position:0%
believe this is a 15th in the queue am I
 
03:24:45.899 --> 03:24:47.090 align:start position:0%
believe this is a 15th in the queue am I
correct

03:24:47.090 --> 03:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:24:50.030 --> 03:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
14 charitable gaming rooms as it stands
 
03:24:52.370 --> 03:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
with a 15th uh
 
03:24:54.769 --> 03:24:54.779 align:start position:0%
fitting up I guess
 
03:24:58.370 --> 03:24:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:02.090 --> 03:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
14 rooms in relation to HHR let me
 
03:25:06.170 --> 03:25:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:06.180 --> 03:25:07.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:25:07.550 --> 03:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:10.550 --> 03:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
not all of them are operating with HHR
 
03:25:13.010 --> 03:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
at present
 
03:25:15.170 --> 03:25:15.180 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to give you the number
 
03:25:21.469 --> 03:25:21.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:23.150 --> 03:25:23.160 align:start position:0%
I think there's uh in the neighborhood
 
03:25:25.729 --> 03:25:25.739 align:start position:0%
of seven rooms that are still in process
 
03:25:28.010 --> 03:25:28.020 align:start position:0%
waiting approval or haven't been
 
03:25:30.170 --> 03:25:30.180 align:start position:0%
approved as of yet
 
03:25:33.229 --> 03:25:33.239 align:start position:0%
so uh going back to the legislation last
 
03:25:33.239 --> 03:25:34.910 align:start position:0%
so uh going back to the legislation last
year

03:25:34.910 --> 03:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:25:37.490 --> 03:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
in in the HHR bill
 
03:25:39.830 --> 03:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
for instance
 
03:25:41.870 --> 03:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
actually let me I'm getting ahead of
 
03:25:41.880 --> 03:25:42.769 align:start position:0%
actually let me I'm getting ahead of
myself

03:25:42.769 --> 03:25:42.779 align:start position:0%
myself
 
03:25:46.729 --> 03:25:46.739 align:start position:0%
so what what I we we have Set uh
 
03:25:46.739 --> 03:25:48.229 align:start position:0%
so what what I we we have Set uh
percentages

03:25:48.229 --> 03:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
percentages
 
03:25:50.929 --> 03:25:50.939 align:start position:0%
for the state to Ghana revenue and for
 
03:25:53.090 --> 03:25:53.100 align:start position:0%
the Cherry stagana revenue from the
 
03:25:56.410 --> 03:25:56.420 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming model that we have
 
03:25:59.389 --> 03:25:59.399 align:start position:0%
a lot of what is in this piece of
 
03:26:02.990 --> 03:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
legislation and I sent around a copy I
 
03:26:06.769 --> 03:26:06.779 align:start position:0%
had emailed you all a uh a copy of this
 
03:26:08.269 --> 03:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
and this came from Rick Newman it was
 
03:26:11.809 --> 03:26:11.819 align:start position:0%
great to to Bullet basically the changes
 
03:26:14.929 --> 03:26:14.939 align:start position:0%
in this piece of legislation
 
03:26:16.610 --> 03:26:16.620 align:start position:0%
um it's there's there's a lot of like
 
03:26:18.590 --> 03:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
when I presented it there's a lot of
 
03:26:21.590 --> 03:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
housekeeping stuff in here and we can go
 
03:26:24.410 --> 03:26:24.420 align:start position:0%
through it item for item if we choose to
 
03:26:25.370 --> 03:26:25.380 align:start position:0%
do so
 
03:26:27.650 --> 03:26:27.660 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to answer any questions
 
03:26:29.570 --> 03:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
in relation to
 
03:26:29.580 --> 03:26:31.370 align:start position:0%
in relation to
uh

03:26:31.370 --> 03:26:31.380 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:26:33.650 --> 03:26:33.660 align:start position:0%
my position on why I'm bringing this
 
03:26:35.389 --> 03:26:35.399 align:start position:0%
forward but but a lot of it makes sense
 
03:26:37.010 --> 03:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
a lot of it comes at the recommendation
 
03:26:38.510 --> 03:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
of the lottery
 
03:26:42.170 --> 03:26:42.180 align:start position:0%
and some of it like the
 
03:26:45.830 --> 03:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
Max bet is bringing bringing it up to
 
03:26:47.929 --> 03:26:47.939 align:start position:0%
par with what we have at present in the
 
03:26:49.370 --> 03:26:49.380 align:start position:0%
state right now
 
03:26:53.150 --> 03:26:53.160 align:start position:0%
the max maximum uh wage you can have in
 
03:26:55.070 --> 03:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
a charitable gaming room is ten dollars
 
03:26:58.610 --> 03:26:58.620 align:start position:0%
but yet we sell a 25 scratch ticket so I
 
03:27:01.729 --> 03:27:01.739 align:start position:0%
see this bringing that Max bet to 25 as
 
03:27:05.750 --> 03:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:07.790 --> 03:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
we can start with section one if we like
 
03:27:10.250 --> 03:27:10.260 align:start position:0%
anybody get a question before I start
 
03:27:13.130 --> 03:27:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:19.729 --> 03:27:19.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:22.010 --> 03:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
and what's the difference between that
 
03:27:25.370 --> 03:27:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:27.410 --> 03:27:27.420 align:start position:0%
well it's my understanding and let me
 
03:27:29.330 --> 03:27:29.340 align:start position:0%
see where I can find this and Lottery
 
03:27:31.130 --> 03:27:31.140 align:start position:0%
can probably speak to it more
 
03:27:33.290 --> 03:27:33.300 align:start position:0%
specifically but
 
03:27:36.650 --> 03:27:36.660 align:start position:0%
as of now
 
03:27:39.950 --> 03:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
eight of the rooms already have HHR
 
03:27:42.889 --> 03:27:42.899 align:start position:0%
machines and seven have yet to apply are
 
03:27:45.110 --> 03:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
yet to have been approved I guess it's
 
03:27:53.269 --> 03:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:56.269 --> 03:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
so you're just talking
 
03:27:59.450 --> 03:27:59.460 align:start position:0%
what's this 15th Place that's in the
 
03:28:01.969 --> 03:28:01.979 align:start position:0%
queue that we haven't we're always told
 
03:28:06.349 --> 03:28:06.359 align:start position:0%
about 14. okay uh we we're talking about
 
03:28:10.370 --> 03:28:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:13.309 --> 03:28:13.319 align:start position:0%
hopefully I would refer to because uh as
 
03:28:14.570 --> 03:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
long as you just introduce who you are
 
03:28:16.070 --> 03:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
and so forth so the committee knows that
 
03:28:23.450 --> 03:28:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:31.870 --> 03:28:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:34.729 --> 03:28:34.739 align:start position:0%
there are two rooms in Hampton Beach one
 
03:28:36.889 --> 03:28:36.899 align:start position:0%
runs in round one only runs in the
 
03:28:38.990 --> 03:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
summer so I think when we talk about the
 
03:28:42.610 --> 03:28:42.620 align:start position:0%
current 14 rooms for a currently 14
 
03:28:46.309 --> 03:28:46.319 align:start position:0%
rooms like in the summertime
 
03:28:50.750 --> 03:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:59.150 --> 03:28:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:02.030 --> 03:29:02.040 align:start position:0%
uh section one the changes if you if you
 
03:29:04.610 --> 03:29:04.620 align:start position:0%
refer to the little cheat sheet I made
 
03:29:06.229 --> 03:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
copies of
 
03:29:08.630 --> 03:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh requirements a primary game operator
 
03:29:11.690 --> 03:29:11.700 align:start position:0%
in secondary game operator licenses
 
03:29:13.429 --> 03:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
um it this uh
 
03:29:17.269 --> 03:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
this language is to I believe to clarify
 
03:29:21.889 --> 03:29:21.899 align:start position:0%
at at present a primary game operator
 
03:29:21.899 --> 03:29:23.210 align:start position:0%
at at present a primary game operator
is

03:29:23.210 --> 03:29:23.220 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:29:29.150 --> 03:29:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:31.790 --> 03:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
game operator employer here's where I
 
03:29:33.830 --> 03:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
get a little confused and I spoke to it
 
03:29:36.590 --> 03:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
presenting the bill
 
03:29:39.710 --> 03:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
um the primary game operator in in this
 
03:29:41.690 --> 03:29:41.700 align:start position:0%
bill is going to be changed to the
 
03:29:45.050 --> 03:29:45.060 align:start position:0%
primary basically the the uh proprietor
 
03:29:47.290 --> 03:29:47.300 align:start position:0%
the the
 
03:29:50.590 --> 03:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
license holder probably in most cases
 
03:29:52.910 --> 03:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
instead of what's happening at present
 
03:29:55.370 --> 03:29:55.380 align:start position:0%
you heard me speak of uh the the working
 
03:29:55.380 --> 03:29:57.710 align:start position:0%
you heard me speak of uh the the working
Foreman

03:29:57.710 --> 03:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
Foreman
 
03:30:01.130 --> 03:30:01.140 align:start position:0%
that help run the room the The Pit
 
03:30:03.170 --> 03:30:03.180 align:start position:0%
Bosses and and things of that nature
 
03:30:05.510 --> 03:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
they're they're lumped into primary game
 
03:30:07.610 --> 03:30:07.620 align:start position:0%
operators as it stands now as far as
 
03:30:11.210 --> 03:30:11.220 align:start position:0%
licensing so this would clarify
 
03:30:14.690 --> 03:30:14.700 align:start position:0%
uh and change primary game Operator 2
 
03:30:22.070 --> 03:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:22.080 --> 03:30:26.389 align:start position:0%
 
second

03:30:26.389 --> 03:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:28.429 --> 03:30:28.439 align:start position:0%
already just put on your light so I can
 
03:30:30.290 --> 03:30:30.300 align:start position:0%
see thanks
 
03:30:33.710 --> 03:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
uh representing to set isn't there I
 
03:30:35.510 --> 03:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
seem to recall another section in law
 
03:30:38.330 --> 03:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
where both of those terms are used and
 
03:30:41.030 --> 03:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
defined so if we change it one place we
 
03:30:42.349 --> 03:30:42.359 align:start position:0%
have to change it in others don't we
 
03:30:45.110 --> 03:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
yeah there is hold on there's a
 
03:30:45.120 --> 03:30:48.229 align:start position:0%
yeah there is hold on there's a
reference

03:30:48.229 --> 03:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:00.050 --> 03:31:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:02.030 --> 03:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
let me let me ask you
 
03:31:04.250 --> 03:31:04.260 align:start position:0%
representative do you know specifically
 
03:31:07.010 --> 03:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
where you're talking because I know that
 
03:31:07.020 --> 03:31:07.790 align:start position:0%
where you're talking because I know that
there's

03:31:07.790 --> 03:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
there's
 
03:31:14.690 --> 03:31:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:18.650 --> 03:31:18.660 align:start position:0%
no I don't know I just uh and perhaps uh
 
03:31:21.889 --> 03:31:21.899 align:start position:0%
Mr Newman might know but I I remember
 
03:31:24.889 --> 03:31:24.899 align:start position:0%
that or or maybe uh
 
03:31:27.530 --> 03:31:27.540 align:start position:0%
the commissioner might know
 
03:31:30.050 --> 03:31:30.060 align:start position:0%
um regarding its location but I I
 
03:31:32.510 --> 03:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
thought we used that term didn't just
 
03:31:35.030 --> 03:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
appear in one location it repaired up
 
03:31:39.050 --> 03:31:39.060 align:start position:0%
here on in numerous locations
 
03:31:40.729 --> 03:31:40.739 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to make sure that if
 
03:31:42.110 --> 03:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to change it one place we're
 
03:31:44.090 --> 03:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
going to change it every place I got you
 
03:31:47.030 --> 03:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
wait and to answer that there is uh
 
03:31:49.670 --> 03:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
there's a certain fee and a time frame
 
03:31:52.309 --> 03:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
as to those licenses and also in this
 
03:31:54.830 --> 03:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
legislation it changes that licensing
 
03:31:58.490 --> 03:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
from one year to three years in duration
 
03:32:01.010 --> 03:32:01.020 align:start position:0%
okay with uh we'll we'll get to that but
 
03:32:02.389 --> 03:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
I I know where you're coming from now
 
03:32:02.399 --> 03:32:05.630 align:start position:0%
I I know where you're coming from now
yeah

03:32:05.630 --> 03:32:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:07.670 --> 03:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
um representative only
 
03:32:11.090 --> 03:32:11.100 align:start position:0%
thank you on
 
03:32:14.030 --> 03:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
the game as I understand it we have
 
03:32:16.550 --> 03:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
already a number of conglomerates from
 
03:32:19.370 --> 03:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
outside of New Hampshire that are have
 
03:32:23.510 --> 03:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
taken control of local
 
03:32:26.690 --> 03:32:26.700 align:start position:0%
local parlors and
 
03:32:26.700 --> 03:32:27.590 align:start position:0%
local parlors and
um

03:32:27.590 --> 03:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:31.010 --> 03:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at this and the owner of 10
 
03:32:33.590 --> 03:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
or more of the entity partner managing
 
03:32:37.550 --> 03:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
member or chief executive who serves as
 
03:32:39.830 --> 03:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
a game operator employer
 
03:32:43.910 --> 03:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh must be listed on the game operator
 
03:32:46.670 --> 03:32:46.680 align:start position:0%
license application rather than licensed
 
03:32:46.680 --> 03:32:47.870 align:start position:0%
license application rather than licensed
himself

03:32:47.870 --> 03:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
himself
 
03:32:50.030 --> 03:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
as one
 
03:32:54.410 --> 03:32:54.420 align:start position:0%
and does this make it harder to evaluate
 
03:32:57.410 --> 03:32:57.420 align:start position:0%
any kind of Mafia
 
03:32:57.420 --> 03:32:59.690 align:start position:0%
any kind of Mafia
involvement

03:32:59.690 --> 03:32:59.700 align:start position:0%
involvement
 
03:32:59.700 --> 03:33:01.309 align:start position:0%
involvement
in

03:33:01.309 --> 03:33:01.319 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:33:05.450 --> 03:33:05.460 align:start position:0%
in these these places that are being
 
03:33:05.460 --> 03:33:06.710 align:start position:0%
in these these places that are being
developed

03:33:06.710 --> 03:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
developed
 
03:33:09.290 --> 03:33:09.300 align:start position:0%
when you're only listing them rather
 
03:33:12.650 --> 03:33:12.660 align:start position:0%
than licensing them
 
03:33:15.650 --> 03:33:15.660 align:start position:0%
I would defer it to Lottery on that one
 
03:33:21.170 --> 03:33:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:23.030 --> 03:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
director McIntyre if you would like to
 
03:33:24.590 --> 03:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
comment you don't have to it's totally
 
03:33:44.929 --> 03:33:44.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:44.939 --> 03:33:46.729 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:33:46.729 --> 03:33:46.739 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:33:50.330 --> 03:33:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:50.340 --> 03:33:51.889 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:33:51.889 --> 03:33:51.899 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:34:02.690 --> 03:34:02.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:10.309 --> 03:34:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:12.050 --> 03:34:12.060 align:start position:0%
it's a question
 
03:34:12.060 --> 03:34:16.790 align:start position:0%
it's a question
um

03:34:16.790 --> 03:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:18.950 --> 03:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
I have no idea
 
03:34:22.309 --> 03:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
um representative orrs can you ask our
 
03:34:24.170 --> 03:34:24.180 align:start position:0%
assistant if we are streaming this I
 
03:34:26.090 --> 03:34:26.100 align:start position:0%
assume we are because this is a noticed
 
03:34:26.100 --> 03:34:31.990 align:start position:0%
assume we are because this is a noticed
meeting

03:34:31.990 --> 03:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:35.210 --> 03:34:35.220 align:start position:0%
if we are being streamed then we would
 
03:34:36.590 --> 03:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
ask that if you're going to answer a
 
03:34:37.610 --> 03:34:37.620 align:start position:0%
question that you probably should come
 
03:34:39.349 --> 03:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
up to the microphone because otherwise I
 
03:34:40.849 --> 03:34:40.859 align:start position:0%
don't think people can see you or hear
 
03:34:41.809 --> 03:34:41.819 align:start position:0%
you so
 
03:34:43.670 --> 03:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
so just so we completely transparent on
 
03:34:45.530 --> 03:34:45.540 align:start position:0%
everything we're doing okay we are being
 
03:34:48.530 --> 03:34:48.540 align:start position:0%
live stream so yes next time uh come on
 
03:34:48.540 --> 03:34:50.750 align:start position:0%
live stream so yes next time uh come on
up

03:34:50.750 --> 03:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:54.830 --> 03:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
okay so could I representative always
 
03:34:59.510 --> 03:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
what so what is the process and is it
 
03:35:02.170 --> 03:35:02.180 align:start position:0%
going to change for people that
 
03:35:05.690 --> 03:35:05.700 align:start position:0%
businesses or individuals or contacts
 
03:35:05.700 --> 03:35:06.950 align:start position:0%
businesses or individuals or contacts
that

03:35:06.950 --> 03:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:35:08.750 --> 03:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
that are
 
03:35:08.760 --> 03:35:09.889 align:start position:0%
that are
on

03:35:09.889 --> 03:35:09.899 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:35:13.429 --> 03:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
have bought more than 10 percent
 
03:35:13.439 --> 03:35:14.750 align:start position:0%
have bought more than 10 percent
of

03:35:14.750 --> 03:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:35:16.849 --> 03:35:16.859 align:start position:0%
the operation
 
03:35:20.410 --> 03:35:20.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:23.090 --> 03:35:23.100 align:start position:0%
forget I said the books since you're not
 
03:35:26.389 --> 03:35:26.399 align:start position:0%
allowed to talk about individual ones
 
03:35:29.090 --> 03:35:29.100 align:start position:0%
so so basically we look at the LLC
 
03:35:32.870 --> 03:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
generally that is the owner of the game
 
03:35:35.690 --> 03:35:35.700 align:start position:0%
operator and within that LLC we're going
 
03:35:38.389 --> 03:35:38.399 align:start position:0%
to look at anybody associated with that
 
03:35:38.399 --> 03:35:40.010 align:start position:0%
to look at anybody associated with that
LLC

03:35:40.010 --> 03:35:40.020 align:start position:0%
LLC
 
03:35:43.670 --> 03:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
um to a 10 level and deeper if we feel
 
03:35:46.429 --> 03:35:46.439 align:start position:0%
that it needs to go deeper
 
03:35:50.690 --> 03:35:50.700 align:start position:0%
in this bill just clarifies this is it
 
03:35:52.250 --> 03:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
you guys know I'm in this industry a
 
03:35:53.510 --> 03:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
little bit so this I think just
 
03:35:56.090 --> 03:35:56.100 align:start position:0%
clarifies who goes in what category with
 
03:35:58.010 --> 03:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
these different titles it's because a
 
03:36:00.050 --> 03:36:00.060 align:start position:0%
little confusing right now I think and
 
03:36:02.269 --> 03:36:02.279 align:start position:0%
so this is just trying to clarify that
 
03:36:04.969 --> 03:36:04.979 align:start position:0%
the game operator employer is the
 
03:36:06.830 --> 03:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
business is that correct
 
03:36:09.170 --> 03:36:09.180 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong because the
 
03:36:11.750 --> 03:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
language talks about Indian individuals
 
03:36:15.710 --> 03:36:15.720 align:start position:0%
and yes but I also um to the question to
 
03:36:17.750 --> 03:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
Fred about the primary versus the game
 
03:36:19.790 --> 03:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
operator what happened was
 
03:36:22.429 --> 03:36:22.439 align:start position:0%
prior to the game operator employer
 
03:36:25.010 --> 03:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
designation the rule used to just refer
 
03:36:27.769 --> 03:36:27.779 align:start position:0%
to a primary when they added game
 
03:36:30.050 --> 03:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
operator employer they forgot to remove
 
03:36:32.090 --> 03:36:32.100 align:start position:0%
the references to the primary in some
 
03:36:34.130 --> 03:36:34.140 align:start position:0%
sections so it doesn't make sense so
 
03:36:36.170 --> 03:36:36.180 align:start position:0%
that's why they're being removed in
 
03:36:38.090 --> 03:36:38.100 align:start position:0%
places because it's really the primary
 
03:36:39.769 --> 03:36:39.779 align:start position:0%
game operator that has those
 
03:36:39.779 --> 03:36:44.030 align:start position:0%
game operator that has those
responsibilities

03:36:44.030 --> 03:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:45.710 --> 03:36:45.720 align:start position:0%
representative black I didn't understand
 
03:36:48.229 --> 03:36:48.239 align:start position:0%
what does a 10 level mean
 
03:36:51.830 --> 03:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
10 ownership oh okay ownership okay
 
03:36:55.550 --> 03:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
follow on please follow up yeah there
 
03:36:58.490 --> 03:36:58.500 align:start position:0%
was a reference by another rep about uh
 
03:37:00.349 --> 03:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
potential for people of ill repute
 
03:37:02.570 --> 03:37:02.580 align:start position:0%
getting into the business wouldn't they
 
03:37:04.969 --> 03:37:04.979 align:start position:0%
be more likely to attack them go after
 
03:37:07.910 --> 03:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
the major casinos in other states as
 
03:37:09.950 --> 03:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
opposed to these charitable game
 
03:37:13.370 --> 03:37:13.380 align:start position:0%
operations were limited size
 
03:37:14.809 --> 03:37:14.819 align:start position:0%
um I could tell you it was a prior life
 
03:37:16.309 --> 03:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
representative I was an organized crime
 
03:37:19.130 --> 03:37:19.140 align:start position:0%
prosecutor and they don't tend to go
 
03:37:21.229 --> 03:37:21.239 align:start position:0%
after anything like this the review
 
03:37:23.210 --> 03:37:23.220 align:start position:0%
process is
 
03:37:25.729 --> 03:37:25.739 align:start position:0%
um remarkably onerous
 
03:37:27.469 --> 03:37:27.479 align:start position:0%
remarkably onerous and we've had a
 
03:37:29.229 --> 03:37:29.239 align:start position:0%
number of applicants
 
03:37:31.610 --> 03:37:31.620 align:start position:0%
withdraw based on that
 
03:37:31.620 --> 03:37:33.530 align:start position:0%
withdraw based on that
so

03:37:33.530 --> 03:37:33.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:37:34.910 --> 03:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
I didn't make you an author you couldn't
 
03:37:34.920 --> 03:37:35.889 align:start position:0%
I didn't make you an author you couldn't
refuse

03:37:35.889 --> 03:37:35.899 align:start position:0%
refuse
 
03:37:38.210 --> 03:37:38.220 align:start position:0%
even when I was a prosecutor they didn't
 
03:37:40.849 --> 03:37:40.859 align:start position:0%
sadly you know representative all me
 
03:37:43.790 --> 03:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
yes and could you give us an idea of
 
03:37:48.290 --> 03:37:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:48.300 --> 03:37:49.610 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:37:49.610 --> 03:37:49.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:52.670 --> 03:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
a criminal blemish a financial blemish
 
03:37:52.680 --> 03:37:53.389 align:start position:0%
a criminal blemish a financial blemish
um

03:37:53.389 --> 03:37:53.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:58.910 --> 03:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:58.920 --> 03:38:00.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:38:00.190 --> 03:38:00.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:05.210 --> 03:38:05.220 align:start position:0%
a conviction that related to
 
03:38:07.250 --> 03:38:07.260 align:start position:0%
um less than best of being honest for
 
03:38:09.349 --> 03:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
example like if you were charged with
 
03:38:11.570 --> 03:38:11.580 align:start position:0%
larceny or a bad check
 
03:38:11.580 --> 03:38:12.349 align:start position:0%
larceny or a bad check
um

03:38:12.349 --> 03:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:13.849 --> 03:38:13.859 align:start position:0%
I don't want to get into specifics
 
03:38:15.229 --> 03:38:15.239 align:start position:0%
because that it would be like I said
 
03:38:16.809 --> 03:38:16.819 align:start position:0%
violating the state law but essentially
 
03:38:21.349 --> 03:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
it's a review and candidly we're not the
 
03:38:24.410 --> 03:38:24.420 align:start position:0%
reviewing agency We Are The Gatherer of
 
03:38:24.420 --> 03:38:25.330 align:start position:0%
reviewing agency We Are The Gatherer of
information

03:38:25.330 --> 03:38:25.340 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:38:28.010 --> 03:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
based on the past law the session you
 
03:38:30.469 --> 03:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
folks proved our investigation and
 
03:38:32.030 --> 03:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement division does the review
 
03:38:34.790 --> 03:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
would stash with ex-police officers and
 
03:38:36.290 --> 03:38:36.300 align:start position:0%
Auditors who do a review of the
 
03:38:38.809 --> 03:38:38.819 align:start position:0%
financial history criminal history
 
03:38:42.050 --> 03:38:42.060 align:start position:0%
Etc and that document is it's not a
 
03:38:43.490 --> 03:38:43.500 align:start position:0%
document it's a very large pack of
 
03:38:45.050 --> 03:38:45.060 align:start position:0%
information it's past the attorney
 
03:38:48.290 --> 03:38:48.300 align:start position:0%
general and he reviews it himself and so
 
03:38:52.370 --> 03:38:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:53.929 --> 03:38:53.939 align:start position:0%
all right I think I saw some hands over
 
03:38:56.330 --> 03:38:56.340 align:start position:0%
here representative Schamberg
 
03:38:59.809 --> 03:38:59.819 align:start position:0%
yes and mine is more on financial if you
 
03:39:01.550 --> 03:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
want to continue on with
 
03:39:04.070 --> 03:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
what we're discussing I
 
03:39:06.170 --> 03:39:06.180 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean it's up to the pleasure of
 
03:39:07.550 --> 03:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
the committee we can keep going through
 
03:39:09.889 --> 03:39:09.899 align:start position:0%
the Section by section or if I can make
 
03:39:11.510 --> 03:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
a suggestion if we go through this
 
03:39:13.670 --> 03:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
section by section we're never going to
 
03:39:15.710 --> 03:39:15.720 align:start position:0%
make Headway at all so I think every
 
03:39:17.690 --> 03:39:17.700 align:start position:0%
pretty much committee's had a chance to
 
03:39:19.070 --> 03:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
review it if they have questions it's
 
03:39:20.510 --> 03:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
probably uh do you want to just do a
 
03:39:22.790 --> 03:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
high level overview of a
 
03:39:25.010 --> 03:39:25.020 align:start position:0%
basically what this does is it it
 
03:39:27.170 --> 03:39:27.180 align:start position:0%
Narrows down the fees for the employees
 
03:39:29.150 --> 03:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
and the time frames for which the
 
03:39:31.309 --> 03:39:31.319 align:start position:0%
employees have to be licensed so so if
 
03:39:33.830 --> 03:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
somebody is dealing Blackjack they have
 
03:39:36.229 --> 03:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
to apply to Lottery go through the
 
03:39:38.330 --> 03:39:38.340 align:start position:0%
clearances pay out of pocket for these
 
03:39:41.030 --> 03:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
licenses on an annual basis this would
 
03:39:43.010 --> 03:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
allow for them to do it every three
 
03:39:46.550 --> 03:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
years but they file an affidavit if
 
03:39:48.530 --> 03:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
there's a change in their status if
 
03:39:52.070 --> 03:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
they're convicted of something at l
 
03:39:56.150 --> 03:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
okay but follow-up Madam chair but going
 
03:40:00.710 --> 03:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
to the Lawson licensing Revenue
 
03:40:02.870 --> 03:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
overall when you change from a one year
 
03:40:04.309 --> 03:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
to a three year
 
03:40:06.910 --> 03:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
why are we reducing the
 
03:40:13.010 --> 03:40:13.020 align:start position:0%
fee like in the facility from uh 250 a
 
03:40:16.849 --> 03:40:16.859 align:start position:0%
year for the 14 facilities to 83 83 33
 
03:40:18.110 --> 03:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
every year
 
03:40:20.630 --> 03:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
are they losing money
 
03:40:23.210 --> 03:40:23.220 align:start position:0%
is that why the the fee is being reduced
 
03:40:25.729 --> 03:40:25.739 align:start position:0%
for over those three-year periods
 
03:40:26.809 --> 03:40:26.819 align:start position:0%
I think you're talking about the
 
03:40:28.610 --> 03:40:28.620 align:start position:0%
Charities fee
 
03:40:31.070 --> 03:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
the Charities fee how much the charity
 
03:40:33.410 --> 03:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
is paying for their license dates is
 
03:40:35.210 --> 03:40:35.220 align:start position:0%
going down
 
03:40:36.830 --> 03:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
right is that there's a component in
 
03:40:38.630 --> 03:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
there for the facility license also
 
03:40:43.370 --> 03:40:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:45.650 --> 03:40:45.660 align:start position:0%
well uh
 
03:40:48.830 --> 03:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
I look at the game operator employers
 
03:40:50.690 --> 03:40:50.700 align:start position:0%
they have a three year period from a
 
03:40:53.150 --> 03:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
date of issue and
 
03:40:55.910 --> 03:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
the proposed fee will be 750 for the
 
03:40:58.309 --> 03:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
three-year period equal to 250 a year
 
03:41:02.269 --> 03:41:02.279 align:start position:0%
but for each year there were 750.
 
03:41:04.610 --> 03:41:04.620 align:start position:0%
I I just looking at the loss of revenue
 
03:41:08.570 --> 03:41:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:11.630 --> 03:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
uh maybe I
 
03:41:14.150 --> 03:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
I see a point representative and agree
 
03:41:16.070 --> 03:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
with your point but when it when it
 
03:41:17.990 --> 03:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
comes to the employees paying out of
 
03:41:19.729 --> 03:41:19.739 align:start position:0%
pocket I I do have issue because
 
03:41:21.590 --> 03:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
everybody's having the same issue with
 
03:41:24.349 --> 03:41:24.359 align:start position:0%
uh recruitment retention
 
03:41:26.510 --> 03:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
um and the fact that a lot of these
 
03:41:28.490 --> 03:41:28.500 align:start position:0%
folks that work these rooms are jumping
 
03:41:29.870 --> 03:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
through hoops a lot of them work in
 
03:41:32.210 --> 03:41:32.220 align:start position:0%
different rooms and supplement their
 
03:41:33.769 --> 03:41:33.779 align:start position:0%
income that way work a couple different
 
03:41:35.750 --> 03:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
rooms but uh you know that's something
 
03:41:39.410 --> 03:41:39.420 align:start position:0%
we can look at keeping the game operator
 
03:41:45.889 --> 03:41:45.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:47.809 --> 03:41:47.819 align:start position:0%
now I think I see what you're looking at
 
03:41:49.490 --> 03:41:49.500 align:start position:0%
so you're looking at this latest handout
 
03:41:51.830 --> 03:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
with the fiscal impact so if you look at
 
03:41:54.650 --> 03:41:54.660 align:start position:0%
page three of five and you'll see
 
03:41:56.870 --> 03:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
there's a little table there which gives
 
03:41:58.670 --> 03:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
the current for the different types of
 
03:42:01.610 --> 03:42:01.620 align:start position:0%
licenses versus the proposed in the bill
 
03:42:03.469 --> 03:42:03.479 align:start position:0%
and what the fiscal impact will be and
 
03:42:05.690 --> 03:42:05.700 align:start position:0%
so what I was mentioning is the the most
 
03:42:05.700 --> 03:42:07.010 align:start position:0%
so what I was mentioning is the the most
notable

03:42:07.010 --> 03:42:07.020 align:start position:0%
notable
 
03:42:08.990 --> 03:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
but is the charity reduction because
 
03:42:11.150 --> 03:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
right now they pay twenty five dollars
 
03:42:13.370 --> 03:42:13.380 align:start position:0%
per game day
 
03:42:15.950 --> 03:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
and then this would propose that would
 
03:42:18.410 --> 03:42:18.420 align:start position:0%
pay a straight dollar amount for a
 
03:42:21.290 --> 03:42:21.300 align:start position:0%
10-day period is that correct okay
 
03:42:21.300 --> 03:42:30.250 align:start position:0%
10-day period is that correct okay
so

03:42:30.250 --> 03:42:30.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:33.349 --> 03:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
okay well yeah go ahead I'm surprised
 
03:42:35.090 --> 03:42:35.100 align:start position:0%
um and
 
03:42:38.690 --> 03:42:38.700 align:start position:0%
let's see so so also I spoke briefly
 
03:42:41.690 --> 03:42:41.700 align:start position:0%
about raising the uh the maximum wage
 
03:42:47.389 --> 03:42:47.399 align:start position:0%
limit to 25 uh coupled with that is a uh
 
03:42:49.670 --> 03:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
a section nine that talks about removing
 
03:42:52.070 --> 03:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
the requirement the prize is above 500
 
03:42:54.950 --> 03:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
be paid by check
 
03:42:57.530 --> 03:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
um and also increases the tournament
 
03:42:59.990 --> 03:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
buy-in to twenty five hundred dollars
 
03:43:03.070 --> 03:43:03.080 align:start position:0%
from the current 250 dollars and and
 
03:43:06.410 --> 03:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
what what I'm shooting at with that I I
 
03:43:09.349 --> 03:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
try to play poker on on a Monday I enjoy
 
03:43:11.570 --> 03:43:11.580 align:start position:0%
playing poker if I can get out I I play
 
03:43:13.490 --> 03:43:13.500 align:start position:0%
and I like to play tournament poker
 
03:43:15.469 --> 03:43:15.479 align:start position:0%
especially when they used to have it at
 
03:43:17.030 --> 03:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
Rockingham Park
 
03:43:19.729 --> 03:43:19.739 align:start position:0%
and it drives a lot of business for
 
03:43:23.210 --> 03:43:23.220 align:start position:0%
these uh Casino rooms these charitable
 
03:43:25.729 --> 03:43:25.739 align:start position:0%
gaming rooms which the peripheral
 
03:43:29.450 --> 03:43:29.460 align:start position:0%
business from the poker tournaments uh
 
03:43:31.250 --> 03:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
adds Revenue to the pot for the
 
03:43:33.710 --> 03:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
Charities and the state
 
03:43:35.269 --> 03:43:35.279 align:start position:0%
um this would allow for and I don't
 
03:43:36.889 --> 03:43:36.899 align:start position:0%
suspect by any stretch of the
 
03:43:40.070 --> 03:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
imagination so the the biggest uh
 
03:43:42.590 --> 03:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
tournament tournaments in the state are
 
03:43:44.870 --> 03:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
obviously 250 I think they've run them
 
03:43:47.030 --> 03:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
maybe once a month month a couple of the
 
03:43:49.910 --> 03:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
rooms do that but this allows for the
 
03:43:53.030 --> 03:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
availability for if there's a special
 
03:43:55.729 --> 03:43:55.739 align:start position:0%
you know like on a Super Bowl Sunday or
 
03:43:58.130 --> 03:43:58.140 align:start position:0%
a special date and they wanted to do a
 
03:44:00.950 --> 03:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
larger buy-in a 500 tournament or a
 
03:44:03.530 --> 03:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar tournament these poker
 
03:44:06.110 --> 03:44:06.120 align:start position:0%
plays on one of them will travel I'll go
 
03:44:08.750 --> 03:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
to Foxwoods I'm contemplating going to
 
03:44:10.910 --> 03:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
New York for a satellite kind of
 
03:44:10.920 --> 03:44:11.990 align:start position:0%
New York for a satellite kind of
tournament

03:44:11.990 --> 03:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
tournament
 
03:44:13.910 --> 03:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
that they have for the World Series of
 
03:44:15.530 --> 03:44:15.540 align:start position:0%
Poker out there but I'm a little
 
03:44:17.150 --> 03:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
committed to what we're doing here right
 
03:44:19.790 --> 03:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
now so you know it's it's something that
 
03:44:22.370 --> 03:44:22.380 align:start position:0%
I enjoy and I think uh that would drive
 
03:44:25.070 --> 03:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
Revenue peripherally around the rooms
 
03:44:27.710 --> 03:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
hotels and stuff like that and some of
 
03:44:29.809 --> 03:44:29.819 align:start position:0%
these bigger operations would would do
 
03:44:31.429 --> 03:44:31.439 align:start position:0%
well with that it just
 
03:44:33.830 --> 03:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
gives them the opportunity to to have
 
03:44:36.590 --> 03:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
the option to run a 500 tournament if
 
03:44:39.190 --> 03:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
they chose to do so
 
03:44:39.200 --> 03:44:40.849 align:start position:0%
they chose to do so
uh

03:44:40.849 --> 03:44:40.859 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:44:43.849 --> 03:44:43.859 align:start position:0%
a lot of these changes were suggested by
 
03:44:45.229 --> 03:44:45.239 align:start position:0%
Lottery and I don't know if anything
 
03:44:48.670 --> 03:44:48.680 align:start position:0%
another question Madam chair
 
03:44:52.010 --> 03:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:56.330 --> 03:44:56.340 align:start position:0%
Mr McIntyre I see on a summary
 
03:44:58.250 --> 03:44:58.260 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
03:45:00.830 --> 03:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
the suggestion of raising the bond from
 
03:45:03.710 --> 03:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
a million to from 500 000 to a million
 
03:45:06.410 --> 03:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
was recommended by the lottery
 
03:45:08.450 --> 03:45:08.460 align:start position:0%
uh but you're removing the certificate
 
03:45:10.729 --> 03:45:10.739 align:start position:0%
of good standing by the dra requirement
 
03:45:14.150 --> 03:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:16.309 --> 03:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
so the requirement for the dra was put
 
03:45:18.650 --> 03:45:18.660 align:start position:0%
in several years ago and it it's
 
03:45:22.429 --> 03:45:22.439 align:start position:0%
difficult for the dra to process those
 
03:45:25.190 --> 03:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
quickly so we're often just waiting for
 
03:45:27.110 --> 03:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
them and they really don't provide us
 
03:45:30.250 --> 03:45:30.260 align:start position:0%
with information that's really needed to
 
03:45:35.450 --> 03:45:35.460 align:start position:0%
vet and and license a game room
 
03:45:35.460 --> 03:45:36.889 align:start position:0%
vet and and license a game room
follow-up

03:45:36.889 --> 03:45:36.899 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:45:38.870 --> 03:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
is your investigative technique
 
03:45:41.090 --> 03:45:41.100 align:start position:0%
different or just do you have a faster
 
03:45:42.590 --> 03:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
system or what do you have that's
 
03:45:44.990 --> 03:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
different the dra isn't doing an
 
03:45:47.389 --> 03:45:47.399 align:start position:0%
investigation so we're doing a thorough
 
03:45:50.750 --> 03:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
investigation and the dra portion is not
 
03:45:54.790 --> 03:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:58.190 --> 03:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
oh and the bond we've increased the bond
 
03:46:00.229 --> 03:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
because many of our well at least one of
 
03:46:02.929 --> 03:46:02.939 align:start position:0%
our room is hitting that 500 000 cap
 
03:46:06.110 --> 03:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
already and as we get HHR and whatnot
 
03:46:08.450 --> 03:46:08.460 align:start position:0%
it's expected to go higher so we need a
 
03:46:11.090 --> 03:46:11.100 align:start position:0%
higher cap to cover what we base the
 
03:46:13.250 --> 03:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
bond on is three months worth of
 
03:46:15.349 --> 03:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
obligations what they would owe to the
 
03:46:17.450 --> 03:46:17.460 align:start position:0%
state and the Charities and so we want
 
03:46:19.130 --> 03:46:19.140 align:start position:0%
to make sure there's enough in that bond
 
03:46:24.710 --> 03:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:27.110 --> 03:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
yes representative Ellery
 
03:46:29.570 --> 03:46:29.580 align:start position:0%
while you're discussing the bond
 
03:46:32.389 --> 03:46:32.399 align:start position:0%
could you explain to us uh
 
03:46:35.450 --> 03:46:35.460 align:start position:0%
how that works I know how it works uh
 
03:46:36.889 --> 03:46:36.899 align:start position:0%
under my license
 
03:46:38.450 --> 03:46:38.460 align:start position:0%
and I want to make sure that it works
 
03:46:41.929 --> 03:46:41.939 align:start position:0%
the same under yours under your scheme
 
03:46:45.349 --> 03:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
so basically if there's a violation
 
03:46:47.870 --> 03:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
um we could we could get the bond but
 
03:46:50.090 --> 03:46:50.100 align:start position:0%
we're mostly doing that and I don't know
 
03:46:51.830 --> 03:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
that we've ever done it but it would
 
03:46:53.750 --> 03:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
mostly be if they suddenly went out of
 
03:46:55.849 --> 03:46:55.859 align:start position:0%
business and didn't pay the Charities of
 
03:46:57.410 --> 03:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
the state that's what we need the bond
 
03:46:57.420 --> 03:46:59.630 align:start position:0%
the state that's what we need the bond
for

03:46:59.630 --> 03:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:47:02.150 --> 03:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
so the bond
 
03:47:05.269 --> 03:47:05.279 align:start position:0%
is a methodology an insurance policy
 
03:47:06.290 --> 03:47:06.300 align:start position:0%
because you buy it through insurance
 
03:47:09.229 --> 03:47:09.239 align:start position:0%
companies that pays for when you screw
 
03:47:11.030 --> 03:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
up so you're paying for your own
 
03:47:13.790 --> 03:47:13.800 align:start position:0%
screw-up in advance
 
03:47:13.800 --> 03:47:18.889 align:start position:0%
screw-up in advance
just

03:47:18.889 --> 03:47:18.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:18.899 --> 03:47:20.450 align:start position:0%
 
Elber

03:47:20.450 --> 03:47:20.460 align:start position:0%
Elber
 
03:47:22.790 --> 03:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I apologize for
 
03:47:24.950 --> 03:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
not having this information
 
03:47:27.590 --> 03:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
um but can you give us I I remember
 
03:47:28.969 --> 03:47:28.979 align:start position:0%
seeing the pie chart but I don't
 
03:47:31.309 --> 03:47:31.319 align:start position:0%
remember the numbers of the total
 
03:47:35.690 --> 03:47:35.700 align:start position:0%
profits coming in uh to the casino's
 
03:47:35.700 --> 03:47:37.610 align:start position:0%
profits coming in uh to the casino's
um

03:47:37.610 --> 03:47:37.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:41.269 --> 03:47:41.279 align:start position:0%
game charitable gaming and the total
 
03:47:44.330 --> 03:47:44.340 align:start position:0%
number to the State education fund and
 
03:47:47.030 --> 03:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
the total number to charities
 
03:47:49.250 --> 03:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
so that information obviously changes
 
03:47:51.050 --> 03:47:51.060 align:start position:0%
month by month I don't have an updated
 
03:47:52.610 --> 03:47:52.620 align:start position:0%
number to hand you but I certainly we
 
03:47:54.590 --> 03:47:54.600 align:start position:0%
can get you one because we wouldn't know
 
03:47:56.570 --> 03:47:56.580 align:start position:0%
you asked the question regarding profits
 
03:47:59.210 --> 03:47:59.220 align:start position:0%
we would only know Revenue so the
 
03:48:01.190 --> 03:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
operator themselves we would know what
 
03:48:02.630 --> 03:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
portion they were able to keep we would
 
03:48:04.849 --> 03:48:04.859 align:start position:0%
not know what was profit so but we can
 
03:48:06.290 --> 03:48:06.300 align:start position:0%
get you an updated numbers in terms of
 
03:48:06.300 --> 03:48:07.490 align:start position:0%
get you an updated numbers in terms of
each

03:48:07.490 --> 03:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
each
 
03:48:07.500 --> 03:48:08.090 align:start position:0%
each
um

03:48:08.090 --> 03:48:08.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:10.550 --> 03:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
each area
 
03:48:12.769 --> 03:48:12.779 align:start position:0%
we have every month we
 
03:48:15.590 --> 03:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
've on our on our website which is
 
03:48:17.630 --> 03:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
connected to the main lottery one we
 
03:48:19.610 --> 03:48:19.620 align:start position:0%
have what we call market trends which
 
03:48:28.849 --> 03:48:28.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:31.490 --> 03:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm
 
03:48:33.110 --> 03:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
question I don't know if this is a
 
03:48:35.929 --> 03:48:35.939 align:start position:0%
question or a comment for representative
 
03:48:39.110 --> 03:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
Doucet or members of the lottery but
 
03:48:39.120 --> 03:48:40.610 align:start position:0%
Doucet or members of the lottery but
um

03:48:40.610 --> 03:48:40.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:43.969 --> 03:48:43.979 align:start position:0%
we heard earlier today oplc uh was here
 
03:48:46.130 --> 03:48:46.140 align:start position:0%
and I know this is not related to oplc
 
03:48:48.229 --> 03:48:48.239 align:start position:0%
but I think that there's something I
 
03:48:50.750 --> 03:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
want to comment on and that's the
 
03:48:54.590 --> 03:48:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:57.229 --> 03:48:57.239 align:start position:0%
the legislative intent that we're
 
03:48:59.510 --> 03:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
talking about today and and that we have
 
03:49:01.010 --> 03:49:01.020 align:start position:0%
in front of us is one thing and I think
 
03:49:02.570 --> 03:49:02.580 align:start position:0%
we're all going to come to a discussion
 
03:49:04.010 --> 03:49:04.020 align:start position:0%
here we're having a good discussion here
 
03:49:07.070 --> 03:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
but looking at section four section five
 
03:49:09.950 --> 03:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of other areas in there
 
03:49:11.809 --> 03:49:11.819 align:start position:0%
that I worry
 
03:49:14.210 --> 03:49:14.220 align:start position:0%
that we may want to tighten up on
 
03:49:18.229 --> 03:49:18.239 align:start position:0%
um for instance in section four uh it's
 
03:49:19.670 --> 03:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
repealed and reenacted to read as
 
03:49:22.729 --> 03:49:22.739 align:start position:0%
follows if you look at line number 14.
 
03:49:26.090 --> 03:49:26.100 align:start position:0%
requirements of RSA 287 D5 provided that
 
03:49:28.729 --> 03:49:28.739 align:start position:0%
the commission may by rule establish
 
03:49:31.550 --> 03:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
additional items to be submitted on the
 
03:49:33.590 --> 03:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
application form or attached to it and
 
03:49:35.229 --> 03:49:35.239 align:start position:0%
that phrase is used several times
 
03:49:37.490 --> 03:49:37.500 align:start position:0%
throughout the bill
 
03:49:40.550 --> 03:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
um you look going on line 27 the Lottery
 
03:49:42.769 --> 03:49:42.779 align:start position:0%
Commission made by rule establish
 
03:49:44.510 --> 03:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
additional items to be submitted on the
 
03:49:46.670 --> 03:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
application form attached to it
 
03:49:49.309 --> 03:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
the thing that I worry about is that you
 
03:49:51.170 --> 03:49:51.180 align:start position:0%
know we have legislation that is going
 
03:49:51.180 --> 03:49:52.250 align:start position:0%
know we have legislation that is going
to

03:49:52.250 --> 03:49:52.260 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:49:52.260 --> 03:49:53.090 align:start position:0%
to
um

03:49:53.090 --> 03:49:53.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:55.309 --> 03:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to may or may not take
 
03:49:57.889 --> 03:49:57.899 align:start position:0%
action on on this but hopefully we we
 
03:50:00.349 --> 03:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
can get to some resolution here but that
 
03:50:02.510 --> 03:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
comment by rule
 
03:50:04.849 --> 03:50:04.859 align:start position:0%
I just worry if that's opening up a back
 
03:50:04.859 --> 03:50:05.870 align:start position:0%
I just worry if that's opening up a back
door

03:50:05.870 --> 03:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
door
 
03:50:09.410 --> 03:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
for and I'm not making any accusation uh
 
03:50:11.870 --> 03:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
um I'm not this is not but I I've seen
 
03:50:14.389 --> 03:50:14.399 align:start position:0%
it I've experienced it where
 
03:50:16.250 --> 03:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
rules kind of take on a life of
 
03:50:16.260 --> 03:50:17.210 align:start position:0%
rules kind of take on a life of
themselves

03:50:17.210 --> 03:50:17.220 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
03:50:20.510 --> 03:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
and can kind of grow and turn into this
 
03:50:22.610 --> 03:50:22.620 align:start position:0%
big thing that we didn't anticipate
 
03:50:25.550 --> 03:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
could I I apologize I lost you can you
 
03:50:28.210 --> 03:50:28.220 align:start position:0%
go give us page number and line numbers
 
03:50:30.889 --> 03:50:30.899 align:start position:0%
page page two
 
03:50:32.929 --> 03:50:32.939 align:start position:0%
um and we're on Section Five but it was
 
03:50:34.309 --> 03:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
mentioned on section four as well so
 
03:50:36.710 --> 03:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
it's page two line 14.
 
03:50:38.990 --> 03:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
page two
 
03:50:42.650 --> 03:50:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:46.670 --> 03:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:49.309 --> 03:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know if maybe we want to
 
03:50:52.190 --> 03:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
to to to be a little more
 
03:50:54.650 --> 03:50:54.660 align:start position:0%
prescriptive in what we expect out of
 
03:50:55.729 --> 03:50:55.739 align:start position:0%
the rules
 
03:50:58.429 --> 03:50:58.439 align:start position:0%
uh rather than just leave the door open
 
03:50:58.439 --> 03:50:59.990 align:start position:0%
uh rather than just leave the door open
for

03:50:59.990 --> 03:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:51:02.510 --> 03:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
four rules
 
03:51:05.090 --> 03:51:05.100 align:start position:0%
and I'm not not making any comments on
 
03:51:07.010 --> 03:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
the Lottery's ability to write rules but
 
03:51:08.929 --> 03:51:08.939 align:start position:0%
having been on the receiving end of this
 
03:51:11.330 --> 03:51:11.340 align:start position:0%
having listened to testimony from oplc
 
03:51:13.370 --> 03:51:13.380 align:start position:0%
which has kind of turned into a
 
03:51:16.490 --> 03:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
rule-making uh octopus
 
03:51:16.500 --> 03:51:18.170 align:start position:0%
rule-making uh octopus
um

03:51:18.170 --> 03:51:18.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:20.150 --> 03:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
it's just a comment
 
03:51:22.910 --> 03:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
so can I just when you do this is it by
 
03:51:25.250 --> 03:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
rule through gel car or what did that
 
03:51:25.260 --> 03:51:27.370 align:start position:0%
rule through gel car or what did that
mean

03:51:27.370 --> 03:51:27.380 align:start position:0%
mean
 
03:51:29.690 --> 03:51:29.700 align:start position:0%
because usually it would say that's the
 
03:51:32.809 --> 03:51:32.819 align:start position:0%
process yeah so I mean if that needs to
 
03:51:34.790 --> 03:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
be added
 
03:51:38.150 --> 03:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
so go ahead yes if I'd even follow up I
 
03:51:41.030 --> 03:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
mean I and I don't know if how Orthodox
 
03:51:42.830 --> 03:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
this is but
 
03:51:45.469 --> 03:51:45.479 align:start position:0%
I would love to have you as the primary
 
03:51:46.790 --> 03:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
sponsor to be able to take a look at
 
03:51:48.290 --> 03:51:48.300 align:start position:0%
whatever rule comes out just to make
 
03:51:49.610 --> 03:51:49.620 align:start position:0%
sure it's consistent with what your
 
03:51:53.150 --> 03:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
intent was with with the law
 
03:51:54.830 --> 03:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
um you know I think that's one of the
 
03:51:57.710 --> 03:51:57.720 align:start position:0%
things you know having working in in a
 
03:51:57.720 --> 03:51:58.610 align:start position:0%
things you know having working in in a
board

03:51:58.610 --> 03:51:58.620 align:start position:0%
board
 
03:52:01.070 --> 03:52:01.080 align:start position:0%
we struggle oftentimes with what the
 
03:52:03.710 --> 03:52:03.720 align:start position:0%
legislative intent is and as years go on
 
03:52:06.229 --> 03:52:06.239 align:start position:0%
and things change the legislative intent
 
03:52:09.410 --> 03:52:09.420 align:start position:0%
is kind of lost but if we can have a you
 
03:52:11.090 --> 03:52:11.100 align:start position:0%
you have the input from the primary
 
03:52:13.550 --> 03:52:13.560 align:start position:0%
sponsor on the rule then we would know
 
03:52:15.769 --> 03:52:15.779 align:start position:0%
that the legislative intent is
 
03:52:19.429 --> 03:52:19.439 align:start position:0%
is there and we're comfortable with with
 
03:52:21.469 --> 03:52:21.479 align:start position:0%
that I mean that's again I've never seen
 
03:52:22.790 --> 03:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
that done
 
03:52:25.490 --> 03:52:25.500 align:start position:0%
um but I know somebody who works on the
 
03:52:27.769 --> 03:52:27.779 align:start position:0%
rule side for us is frustrated sometimes
 
03:52:30.050 --> 03:52:30.060 align:start position:0%
with the fact that uh you know things
 
03:52:32.690 --> 03:52:32.700 align:start position:0%
can kind of grow and and and and and and
 
03:52:39.590 --> 03:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:41.750 --> 03:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
anything else on that yeah
 
03:52:44.150 --> 03:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative Ames
 
03:52:44.160 --> 03:52:45.410 align:start position:0%
representative Ames
just

03:52:45.410 --> 03:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:52:49.490 --> 03:52:49.500 align:start position:0%
to comment on that I I think that um
 
03:52:51.410 --> 03:52:51.420 align:start position:0%
I guess we all have to make our choices
 
03:52:54.710 --> 03:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
but the nature of legislation like this
 
03:52:58.210 --> 03:52:58.220 align:start position:0%
is that it assigns to the agency
 
03:53:01.250 --> 03:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
Authority within specified parameters
 
03:53:03.769 --> 03:53:03.779 align:start position:0%
and then there's a rule making process
 
03:53:05.750 --> 03:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
that's defined very carefully in the
 
03:53:08.389 --> 03:53:08.399 align:start position:0%
state law that involves a public review
 
03:53:13.070 --> 03:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
and comment and the the frame that the
 
03:53:16.610 --> 03:53:16.620 align:start position:0%
agency has to work within is the
 
03:53:19.849 --> 03:53:19.859 align:start position:0%
legislation and then there are the you
 
03:53:22.729 --> 03:53:22.739 align:start position:0%
know the statute of the what the prime
 
03:53:25.670 --> 03:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
sponsor may or may not have said in my
 
03:53:28.910 --> 03:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
experience is is not the final word and
 
03:53:32.690 --> 03:53:32.700 align:start position:0%
what the meaning of the legislation is
 
03:53:34.429 --> 03:53:34.439 align:start position:0%
um you know there may have been reports
 
03:53:36.650 --> 03:53:36.660 align:start position:0%
in the calendar on the bill when it went
 
03:53:39.950 --> 03:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
through that maybe more interesting but
 
03:53:41.929 --> 03:53:41.939 align:start position:0%
uh but there are a whole lot of law
 
03:53:41.939 --> 03:53:42.950 align:start position:0%
uh but there are a whole lot of law
around

03:53:42.950 --> 03:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
around
 
03:53:44.809 --> 03:53:44.819 align:start position:0%
around this and I think maybe you're
 
03:53:46.729 --> 03:53:46.739 align:start position:0%
talking more about how much do you want
 
03:53:50.809 --> 03:53:50.819 align:start position:0%
to delegate to the to the agency I can
 
03:53:53.330 --> 03:53:53.340 align:start position:0%
understand that discussion I do think
 
03:53:53.340 --> 03:53:54.710 align:start position:0%
understand that discussion I do think
for

03:53:54.710 --> 03:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:53:56.750 --> 03:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
for a situation like this where we've
 
03:53:59.030 --> 03:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
got a very experienced agency that's
 
03:54:01.070 --> 03:54:01.080 align:start position:0%
worked through the rule making process
 
03:54:03.590 --> 03:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
time and time again
 
03:54:03.600 --> 03:54:04.450 align:start position:0%
time and time again
um

03:54:04.450 --> 03:54:04.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:06.710 --> 03:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
and uh you know there's always going to
 
03:54:08.389 --> 03:54:08.399 align:start position:0%
be some dispute as to whether they went
 
03:54:11.229 --> 03:54:11.239 align:start position:0%
too far or didn't go far enough but
 
03:54:14.210 --> 03:54:14.220 align:start position:0%
they've done so as far as I can tell
 
03:54:16.309 --> 03:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
good jobs so I wouldn't want to over
 
03:54:19.429 --> 03:54:19.439 align:start position:0%
specify and try to do that I think that
 
03:54:21.950 --> 03:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
would be a mistake and you know maybe
 
03:54:23.809 --> 03:54:23.819 align:start position:0%
there's a particular suggestion that
 
03:54:27.530 --> 03:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
you'd have on a particular one of these
 
03:54:30.610 --> 03:54:30.620 align:start position:0%
um areas that you've identified
 
03:54:33.530 --> 03:54:33.540 align:start position:0%
but that's my background I I used to
 
03:54:36.650 --> 03:54:36.660 align:start position:0%
write rules in Massachusetts for some
 
03:54:40.070 --> 03:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
big agencies so I've been through both
 
03:54:44.090 --> 03:54:44.100 align:start position:0%
sides of this thing I I know they're
 
03:54:45.950 --> 03:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
there's never going to be a good answer
 
03:54:48.110 --> 03:54:48.120 align:start position:0%
and in the end you get down to details
 
03:54:51.950 --> 03:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:54.110 --> 03:54:54.120 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
03:54:56.210 --> 03:54:56.220 align:start position:0%
um yes I'd kind of like to
 
03:54:59.450 --> 03:54:59.460 align:start position:0%
look at the financial part of this
 
03:55:02.809 --> 03:55:02.819 align:start position:0%
is it is it your expectation that we
 
03:55:05.750 --> 03:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
will have more facilities
 
03:55:08.389 --> 03:55:08.399 align:start position:0%
seeking licenses
 
03:55:10.670 --> 03:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
if we pass this
 
03:55:14.150 --> 03:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
well no as the bill reads now section 18
 
03:55:14.160 --> 03:55:16.429 align:start position:0%
well no as the bill reads now section 18
um

03:55:16.429 --> 03:55:16.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:19.010 --> 03:55:19.020 align:start position:0%
blocks any future facilities from being
 
03:55:21.769 --> 03:55:21.779 align:start position:0%
available which would limit obviously
 
03:55:24.769 --> 03:55:24.779 align:start position:0%
the market and competition
 
03:55:27.110 --> 03:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
so the answer is no quite the opposite
 
03:55:28.969 --> 03:55:28.979 align:start position:0%
yeah you would you would be codifying
 
03:55:31.010 --> 03:55:31.020 align:start position:0%
for permanently a Prohibition on
 
03:55:31.020 --> 03:55:32.349 align:start position:0%
for permanently a Prohibition on
expansion

03:55:32.349 --> 03:55:32.359 align:start position:0%
expansion
 
03:55:36.710 --> 03:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
specifically to HHR yeah I didn't say
 
03:55:38.630 --> 03:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
anything about HH oh sorry that's sort
 
03:55:40.610 --> 03:55:40.620 align:start position:0%
of a yeah so
 
03:55:42.229 --> 03:55:42.239 align:start position:0%
when I see
 
03:55:43.670 --> 03:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
no because you would have seen one
 
03:55:46.010 --> 03:55:46.020 align:start position:0%
before this the it's been an open market
 
03:55:50.150 --> 03:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
for a number of years and
 
03:55:52.189 --> 03:55:52.199 align:start position:0%
the number of applications has not grown
 
03:55:52.199 --> 03:55:54.050 align:start position:0%
the number of applications has not grown
dramatically

03:55:54.050 --> 03:55:54.060 align:start position:0%
dramatically
 
03:55:58.070 --> 03:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so so is there no limitation right
 
03:56:01.670 --> 03:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
now on more forget about the HHR yes
 
03:56:04.550 --> 03:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
your facilities there's no limitation on
 
03:56:06.650 --> 03:56:06.660 align:start position:0%
the correct there's no limitation but
 
03:56:09.950 --> 03:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
when you if we were to raise
 
03:56:12.710 --> 03:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
the betting limit
 
03:56:15.769 --> 03:56:15.779 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that make it more profitable to
 
03:56:18.050 --> 03:56:18.060 align:start position:0%
operate and so because of that we might
 
03:56:19.790 --> 03:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
see more
 
03:56:22.250 --> 03:56:22.260 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that's possible like and I'll
 
03:56:24.290 --> 03:56:24.300 align:start position:0%
use the example um blackjack
 
03:56:27.229 --> 03:56:27.239 align:start position:0%
Blackjack a dealer minimally has to do
 
03:56:29.929 --> 03:56:29.939 align:start position:0%
30 deals an hour in order to be
 
03:56:32.570 --> 03:56:32.580 align:start position:0%
profitable at this current rate if a
 
03:56:34.429 --> 03:56:34.439 align:start position:0%
higher wager was allowed particularly on
 
03:56:34.439 --> 03:56:35.210 align:start position:0%
higher wager was allowed particularly on
a

03:56:35.210 --> 03:56:35.220 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:56:37.010 --> 03:56:37.020 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get a 25 bet on
 
03:56:39.110 --> 03:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
Tuesday afternoon that's for Friday and
 
03:56:40.610 --> 03:56:40.620 align:start position:0%
Saturday nights that would make it more
 
03:56:43.729 --> 03:56:43.739 align:start position:0%
profitable correct for the house as well
 
03:56:46.130 --> 03:56:46.140 align:start position:0%
as the dealers they do better with
 
03:56:47.570 --> 03:56:47.580 align:start position:0%
higher wage limits because it increases
 
03:56:51.729 --> 03:56:51.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:54.229 --> 03:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
represents did you have anything else to
 
03:56:57.110 --> 03:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:57.120 --> 03:56:59.090 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:56:59.090 --> 03:56:59.100 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:57:01.610 --> 03:57:01.620 align:start position:0%
representative I was letting in Valley
 
03:57:03.349 --> 03:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
came over here too I was letting people
 
03:57:06.590 --> 03:57:06.600 align:start position:0%
air out it there's although I share
 
03:57:09.889 --> 03:57:09.899 align:start position:0%
representative rofit's frustration and
 
03:57:11.510 --> 03:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
I've shared that with you in the rules
 
03:57:14.090 --> 03:57:14.100 align:start position:0%
making process this this is current law
 
03:57:16.490 --> 03:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
so it's not changing anything that's not
 
03:57:23.750 --> 03:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:26.450 --> 03:57:26.460 align:start position:0%
okay representative said you want to
 
03:57:28.429 --> 03:57:28.439 align:start position:0%
continue with high level if yeah if I
 
03:57:29.990 --> 03:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
can elaborate on this and and
 
03:57:32.030 --> 03:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
representative fellows asked a great
 
03:57:36.229 --> 03:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
question What in in section 19 of this
 
03:57:39.650 --> 03:57:39.660 align:start position:0%
uh sorry section 18 of this we we at
 
03:57:39.660 --> 03:57:40.969 align:start position:0%
uh sorry section 18 of this we we at
present

03:57:40.969 --> 03:57:40.979 align:start position:0%
present
 
03:57:44.210 --> 03:57:44.220 align:start position:0%
uh with with the passage of HHR
 
03:57:47.990 --> 03:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh Last by Anna worked in a a moratorium
 
03:57:50.570 --> 03:57:50.580 align:start position:0%
date of I believe it's July is it July
 
03:57:56.210 --> 03:57:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:58.910 --> 03:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
um that was in part to
 
03:58:01.550 --> 03:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
allow for lottery to get up and running
 
03:58:03.290 --> 03:58:03.300 align:start position:0%
allow for The Operators to get up and
 
03:58:05.210 --> 03:58:05.220 align:start position:0%
running allow for the charity list to
 
03:58:08.630 --> 03:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
grow and and to be filled and all the
 
03:58:11.570 --> 03:58:11.580 align:start position:0%
um the minutia work uh the work through
 
03:58:14.030 --> 03:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
gel car and and setting the rules and
 
03:58:14.040 --> 03:58:15.590 align:start position:0%
gel car and and setting the rules and
whatnot

03:58:15.590 --> 03:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
whatnot
 
03:58:18.229 --> 03:58:18.239 align:start position:0%
um that process took a little more than
 
03:58:20.210 --> 03:58:20.220 align:start position:0%
some of us a little more time than some
 
03:58:21.710 --> 03:58:21.720 align:start position:0%
of us expected
 
03:58:25.729 --> 03:58:25.739 align:start position:0%
and the the subsequent uh result of that
 
03:58:28.790 --> 03:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
and representative Ami touched on it is
 
03:58:31.309 --> 03:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
there's been some massive interests
 
03:58:33.590 --> 03:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
because of this particular component in
 
03:58:37.969 --> 03:58:37.979 align:start position:0%
our charitable gaming although not a
 
03:58:39.790 --> 03:58:39.800 align:start position:0%
slot machine
 
03:58:43.370 --> 03:58:43.380 align:start position:0%
they they have
 
03:58:45.410 --> 03:58:45.420 align:start position:0%
I didn't say anyone called it a slot
 
03:58:47.389 --> 03:58:47.399 align:start position:0%
machine but although not a slot machine
 
03:58:51.469 --> 03:58:51.479 align:start position:0%
the electronic gaming is driving Revenue
 
03:58:54.469 --> 03:58:54.479 align:start position:0%
and some big operators have come in and
 
03:58:56.330 --> 03:58:56.340 align:start position:0%
bought up some of the rooms
 
03:58:59.450 --> 03:58:59.460 align:start position:0%
and we don't see a lot of applications
 
03:59:00.889 --> 03:59:00.899 align:start position:0%
and I'll stand corrected if Lottery
 
03:59:03.469 --> 03:59:03.479 align:start position:0%
tells us otherwise applications for
 
03:59:05.990 --> 03:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming rooms but I can tell
 
03:59:08.090 --> 03:59:08.100 align:start position:0%
you personally that I'm getting a lot of
 
03:59:09.889 --> 03:59:09.899 align:start position:0%
incoming because I'm from Salem and
 
03:59:11.990 --> 03:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
Salem is seems to be one of those places
 
03:59:14.510 --> 03:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
much like Nashua probably Seabrook
 
03:59:17.750 --> 03:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
border towns that get targeted for this
 
03:59:20.689 --> 03:59:20.699 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:23.330 --> 03:59:23.340 align:start position:0%
I don't think we'll see an influx of
 
03:59:25.790 --> 03:59:25.800 align:start position:0%
people applying our entities employ
 
03:59:28.910 --> 03:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
applying for gaming licenses until after
 
03:59:30.889 --> 03:59:30.899 align:start position:0%
this moratorium
 
03:59:33.170 --> 03:59:33.180 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
03:59:36.170 --> 03:59:36.180 align:start position:0%
we have the ability
 
03:59:40.610 --> 03:59:40.620 align:start position:0%
maybe to put that in check this this
 
03:59:43.969 --> 03:59:43.979 align:start position:0%
particular component keeps in place the
 
03:59:48.229 --> 03:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
15 current rooms 14 15 current rooms to
 
03:59:51.410 --> 03:59:51.420 align:start position:0%
be available to offer HHR gaming
 
03:59:54.650 --> 03:59:54.660 align:start position:0%
it does not allow and when I presented
 
03:59:57.229 --> 03:59:57.239 align:start position:0%
this legislation to the committee we at
 
04:00:00.290 --> 04:00:00.300 align:start position:0%
president have those 14 15 rooms in the
 
04:00:02.090 --> 04:00:02.100 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and the whole of
 
04:00:04.790 --> 04:00:04.800 align:start position:0%
New England there are nine in total
 
04:00:07.670 --> 04:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
casinos in New England we we at
 
04:00:10.330 --> 04:00:10.340 align:start position:0%
president have 14 and one pot time
 
04:00:14.269 --> 04:00:14.279 align:start position:0%
Casino 15 casinos in New Hampshire I for
 
04:00:16.309 --> 04:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
one coming from where I come from in the
 
04:00:19.370 --> 04:00:19.380 align:start position:0%
history of what went on as far as the
 
04:00:22.849 --> 04:00:22.859 align:start position:0%
back and forth of uh big Casino gaming
 
04:00:25.490 --> 04:00:25.500 align:start position:0%
in in the subsequent model that we have
 
04:00:25.500 --> 04:00:26.689 align:start position:0%
in in the subsequent model that we have
now

04:00:26.689 --> 04:00:26.699 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:00:29.269 --> 04:00:29.279 align:start position:0%
I don't want to be
 
04:00:31.610 --> 04:00:31.620 align:start position:0%
in a position where at least in the town
 
04:00:34.790 --> 04:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
of Salem we're turning that place into a
 
04:00:37.490 --> 04:00:37.500 align:start position:0%
little Atlantic City that's that's not
 
04:00:39.110 --> 04:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
what New Hampshire is
 
04:00:40.969 --> 04:00:40.979 align:start position:0%
we're not about gaming this is a great
 
04:00:44.389 --> 04:00:44.399 align:start position:0%
component for our Charities I think
 
04:00:47.630 --> 04:00:47.640 align:start position:0%
Lottery does an outstanding job
 
04:00:49.790 --> 04:00:49.800 align:start position:0%
getting the product out
 
04:00:49.800 --> 04:00:50.410 align:start position:0%
getting the product out
um

04:00:50.410 --> 04:00:50.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:54.650 --> 04:00:54.660 align:start position:0%
enforcing what needs to be enforced and
 
04:00:56.689 --> 04:00:56.699 align:start position:0%
helping those revenues get out to the
 
04:00:59.870 --> 04:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
Charities to deliver the services I just
 
04:01:02.210 --> 04:01:02.220 align:start position:0%
believe it's time that we take a step
 
04:01:07.269 --> 04:01:07.279 align:start position:0%
back and say maybe maybe we don't want
 
04:01:11.150 --> 04:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
HHR Barnes popping up on every corner as
 
04:01:13.309 --> 04:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
I spoke to in my presentation I have a
 
04:01:14.929 --> 04:01:14.939 align:start position:0%
place in Nova Scotia you can walk into
 
04:01:14.939 --> 04:01:16.070 align:start position:0%
place in Nova Scotia you can walk into
any

04:01:16.070 --> 04:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:01:18.590 --> 04:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
it seems like any restaurant whatever in
 
04:01:20.809 --> 04:01:20.819 align:start position:0%
this gaming everywhere I I don't want
 
04:01:22.309 --> 04:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire to look like
 
04:01:24.710 --> 04:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
that so I think we have to take a solid
 
04:01:27.170 --> 04:01:27.180 align:start position:0%
look at the fact that maybe we should
 
04:01:30.170 --> 04:01:30.180 align:start position:0%
put some limitations on this and I don't
 
04:01:35.870 --> 04:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
know that the the July 1 of 24 date is
 
04:01:38.150 --> 04:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
going to be any measure for us
 
04:01:40.849 --> 04:01:40.859 align:start position:0%
to look back and say well hhr's working
 
04:01:43.189 --> 04:01:43.199 align:start position:0%
here or maybe it needs to be tweaked
 
04:01:45.229 --> 04:01:45.239 align:start position:0%
there I think with the slower rollout
 
04:01:47.630 --> 04:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
than expected to these rooms for that
 
04:01:49.610 --> 04:01:49.620 align:start position:0%
particular component I think we need a
 
04:01:52.070 --> 04:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
longer look at it and my suggestion is
 
04:01:55.070 --> 04:01:55.080 align:start position:0%
we stop it at 15 rooms and we don't
 
04:01:56.630 --> 04:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
allow for these things to pop up
 
04:01:56.640 --> 04:02:03.229 align:start position:0%
allow for these things to pop up
everywhere

04:02:03.229 --> 04:02:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:08.210 --> 04:02:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:11.929 --> 04:02:11.939 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'm a little confused don't I
 
04:02:15.490 --> 04:02:15.500 align:start position:0%
um and maybe this is obvious but if
 
04:02:21.349 --> 04:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:23.510 --> 04:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
um that will
 
04:02:26.030 --> 04:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
do I understand this correctly that will
 
04:02:26.040 --> 04:02:27.290 align:start position:0%
do I understand this correctly that will
mean

04:02:27.290 --> 04:02:27.300 align:start position:0%
mean
 
04:02:32.030 --> 04:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
that they will remain a limit
 
04:02:34.189 --> 04:02:34.199 align:start position:0%
of 14.
 
04:02:37.570 --> 04:02:37.580 align:start position:0%
of these HHR facilities
 
04:02:40.910 --> 04:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
without limitation going forward is that
 
04:02:44.809 --> 04:02:44.819 align:start position:0%
correct correct okay the the and let me
 
04:02:49.610 --> 04:02:49.620 align:start position:0%
specify Lottery deems as to how many uh
 
04:02:51.530 --> 04:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
machines can be
 
04:02:54.469 --> 04:02:54.479 align:start position:0%
in in a facility via the size of the
 
04:02:56.750 --> 04:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
facility by percentage of table games
 
04:02:59.269 --> 04:02:59.279 align:start position:0%
and others so it's not like somebody can
 
04:03:00.590 --> 04:03:00.600 align:start position:0%
come in and buy a hundred thousand
 
04:03:02.689 --> 04:03:02.699 align:start position:0%
square foot place and put machines in it
 
04:03:06.650 --> 04:03:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:06.660 --> 04:03:08.269 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:03:08.269 --> 04:03:08.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:13.429 --> 04:03:13.439 align:start position:0%
my question to you is uh why not
 
04:03:16.370 --> 04:03:16.380 align:start position:0%
if you're concerned that maybe this
 
04:03:20.570 --> 04:03:20.580 align:start position:0%
doing away with this limit is premature
 
04:03:24.229 --> 04:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
why why not propose
 
04:03:28.490 --> 04:03:28.500 align:start position:0%
delay for a couple of years of the
 
04:03:28.500 --> 04:03:30.410 align:start position:0%
delay for a couple of years of the
um

04:03:30.410 --> 04:03:30.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:32.689 --> 04:03:32.699 align:start position:0%
a decision on whether or not to continue
 
04:03:35.210 --> 04:03:35.220 align:start position:0%
this limit
 
04:03:37.729 --> 04:03:37.739 align:start position:0%
that's a great question representative
 
04:03:41.689 --> 04:03:41.699 align:start position:0%
and and I guess I'm looking from and we
 
04:03:43.790 --> 04:03:43.800 align:start position:0%
spoke a little earlier from the
 
04:03:47.150 --> 04:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
perspective of the interest and the
 
04:03:49.370 --> 04:03:49.380 align:start position:0%
interests that have already come in and
 
04:03:51.849 --> 04:03:51.859 align:start position:0%
bought some of these smaller operations
 
04:03:56.210 --> 04:03:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:58.370 --> 04:03:58.380 align:start position:0%
if if we were to add a few more years
 
04:04:00.950 --> 04:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
onto it we'd have a better measure and a
 
04:04:04.189 --> 04:04:04.199 align:start position:0%
better look at the impact of that but
 
04:04:06.830 --> 04:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
again we'll be sitting here
 
04:04:09.769 --> 04:04:09.779 align:start position:0%
talking about this the same issue I feel
 
04:04:13.189 --> 04:04:13.199 align:start position:0%
because there are going to be more of
 
04:04:16.010 --> 04:04:16.020 align:start position:0%
that if if this is as profitable as we
 
04:04:17.990 --> 04:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
projected last biennium
 
04:04:20.030 --> 04:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
that I mean the cat's out of the bag
 
04:04:22.010 --> 04:04:22.020 align:start position:0%
these these big players are coming in
 
04:04:24.530 --> 04:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
and buying these rooms up it's not going
 
04:04:26.090 --> 04:04:26.100 align:start position:0%
to stop there so
 
04:04:29.269 --> 04:04:29.279 align:start position:0%
let's set the mark let's set the limit
 
04:04:33.710 --> 04:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
as a state as to how much gaming and and
 
04:04:35.870 --> 04:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
in moreover if if we don't allow for
 
04:04:38.750 --> 04:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
that it it lessens the pool for these
 
04:04:41.570 --> 04:04:41.580 align:start position:0%
Charities that count on these dollars
 
04:04:43.910 --> 04:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
too if they stop popping up these
 
04:04:45.530 --> 04:04:45.540 align:start position:0%
smaller sites
 
04:04:47.330 --> 04:04:47.340 align:start position:0%
they're going to take away for instance
 
04:04:49.370 --> 04:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
Salem's Lucky in that
 
04:04:52.490 --> 04:04:52.500 align:start position:0%
that room is pretty profitable it does
 
04:04:54.710 --> 04:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
not have HHR but it's a very profitable
 
04:04:58.550 --> 04:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
room so some I'll say 35 Charities some
 
04:05:00.229 --> 04:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
of them are the Legacy Charities going
 
04:05:01.370 --> 04:05:01.380 align:start position:0%
back to
 
04:05:05.030 --> 04:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
06 or earlier that literally build out
 
04:05:06.349 --> 04:05:06.359 align:start position:0%
everything they do for the community
 
04:05:09.530 --> 04:05:09.540 align:start position:0%
from these dollars if five more rooms
 
04:05:11.570 --> 04:05:11.580 align:start position:0%
were to pop up in Salem
 
04:05:13.969 --> 04:05:13.979 align:start position:0%
that the available dollars for those
 
04:05:16.490 --> 04:05:16.500 align:start position:0%
core Charities to the community you know
 
04:05:19.670 --> 04:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
they'll be scrambling you know what
 
04:05:21.650 --> 04:05:21.660 align:start position:0%
charities are going to fill these slots
 
04:05:24.650 --> 04:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
I mean Lottery does a phenomenal job I
 
04:05:26.450 --> 04:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
believe these operators do a phenomenal
 
04:05:28.729 --> 04:05:28.739 align:start position:0%
job with their charity coordinators and
 
04:05:30.410 --> 04:05:30.420 align:start position:0%
we've all heard the testimony from the
 
04:05:32.389 --> 04:05:32.399 align:start position:0%
Charities that come in and tell us the
 
04:05:34.370 --> 04:05:34.380 align:start position:0%
impact of these dollars
 
04:05:36.769 --> 04:05:36.779 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
04:05:40.309 --> 04:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
the industry you know when is saturation
 
04:05:43.309 --> 04:05:43.319 align:start position:0%
point for the industry too
 
04:05:46.130 --> 04:05:46.140 align:start position:0%
I definitely don't want be and want to
 
04:05:49.969 --> 04:05:49.979 align:start position:0%
be you know uh Atlantic City North
 
04:05:51.889 --> 04:05:51.899 align:start position:0%
up here this is still New Hampshire so
 
04:05:53.929 --> 04:05:53.939 align:start position:0%
and you know I'm a very pro-gaming guy
 
04:05:56.510 --> 04:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
but there's there's a there's a limit to
 
04:05:56.520 --> 04:05:59.630 align:start position:0%
but there's there's a there's a limit to
everything

04:05:59.630 --> 04:05:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:07.189 --> 04:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:10.330 --> 04:06:10.340 align:start position:0%
just a quick question to you um
 
04:06:13.630 --> 04:06:13.640 align:start position:0%
what's your understanding of the
 
04:06:16.070 --> 04:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
demand to
 
04:06:16.080 --> 04:06:17.330 align:start position:0%
demand to
um

04:06:17.330 --> 04:06:17.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:20.630 --> 04:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
open more facilities
 
04:06:23.389 --> 04:06:23.399 align:start position:0%
um So currently there are the number is
 
04:06:25.070 --> 04:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
the number right there are eight
 
04:06:27.950 --> 04:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
operating with HHR there are others in a
 
04:06:30.349 --> 04:06:30.359 align:start position:0%
Queue at various stages
 
04:06:32.570 --> 04:06:32.580 align:start position:0%
um and there are approximately 1200
 
04:06:35.330 --> 04:06:35.340 align:start position:0%
machines in place in the state
 
04:06:38.870 --> 04:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
the plurality are in Seabrook not quite
 
04:06:38.880 --> 04:06:40.309 align:start position:0%
the plurality are in Seabrook not quite
half

04:06:40.309 --> 04:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
half
 
04:06:43.370 --> 04:06:43.380 align:start position:0%
Seabrook the brook
 
04:06:43.380 --> 04:06:44.689 align:start position:0%
Seabrook the brook
um

04:06:44.689 --> 04:06:44.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:48.229 --> 04:06:48.239 align:start position:0%
I would submit I think soon but I don't
 
04:06:50.030 --> 04:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
know when we'll hit a place where
 
04:06:53.870 --> 04:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
there'll be saturation without even this
 
04:06:53.880 --> 04:06:55.969 align:start position:0%
there'll be saturation without even this
expansion

04:06:55.969 --> 04:06:55.979 align:start position:0%
expansion
 
04:07:00.110 --> 04:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
but candidly um I often I think we said
 
04:07:01.969 --> 04:07:01.979 align:start position:0%
that saturation is probably two two
 
04:07:03.410 --> 04:07:03.420 align:start position:0%
thousand of these things across the
 
04:07:06.769 --> 04:07:06.779 align:start position:0%
state the bulk of which would be if the
 
04:07:08.269 --> 04:07:08.279 align:start position:0%
market dictated would be in Rockham
 
04:07:10.729 --> 04:07:10.739 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County
 
04:07:13.189 --> 04:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
um not because the most people in the
 
04:07:15.769 --> 04:07:15.779 align:start position:0%
State live there but because it's closer
 
04:07:18.469 --> 04:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
to where more people in Massachusetts
 
04:07:21.830 --> 04:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
and uh Encore is not a friendly place to
 
04:07:23.870 --> 04:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
visit in terms of a customer it's hard
 
04:07:26.150 --> 04:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
to get to parking's not great traffic is
 
04:07:26.160 --> 04:07:27.950 align:start position:0%
to get to parking's not great traffic is
ridiculous

04:07:27.950 --> 04:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
ridiculous
 
04:07:27.960 --> 04:07:28.729 align:start position:0%
ridiculous
um

04:07:28.729 --> 04:07:28.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:31.070 --> 04:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:07:32.630 --> 04:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
I think as soon as the others come
 
04:07:33.889 --> 04:07:33.899 align:start position:0%
online I think you're going to hit a
 
04:07:35.689 --> 04:07:35.699 align:start position:0%
saturation point of the state by the
 
04:07:37.010 --> 04:07:37.020 align:start position:0%
same token you know I think we're free
 
04:07:39.950 --> 04:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
market folks and would the market would
 
04:07:42.170 --> 04:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
dictate where they're going how uh as
 
04:07:44.990 --> 04:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
representative Jose said there are
 
04:07:46.790 --> 04:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
things in place that we put in through
 
04:07:50.050 --> 04:07:50.060 align:start position:0%
rule that limit the size of these places
 
04:07:52.070 --> 04:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
meaning there has to be so much square
 
04:07:54.710 --> 04:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
footage dedicated to floors dedicated to
 
04:07:54.720 --> 04:07:55.670 align:start position:0%
footage dedicated to floors dedicated to
machines

04:07:55.670 --> 04:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
machines
 
04:07:58.070 --> 04:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
that the max amount of Revenue can
 
04:08:01.010 --> 04:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
exceed more than 6.3 times the table
 
04:08:03.469 --> 04:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
Revenue so that there's the balance of
 
04:08:05.030 --> 04:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
what it looks like as well as what the
 
04:08:07.729 --> 04:08:07.739 align:start position:0%
Charities receive a revenue so as he has
 
04:08:09.950 --> 04:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
he suggested there's no ability to
 
04:08:11.450 --> 04:08:11.460 align:start position:0%
airdrop a thousand of these things into
 
04:08:14.650 --> 04:08:14.660 align:start position:0%
an abandoned Sears the limits are there
 
04:08:17.210 --> 04:08:17.220 align:start position:0%
moreover the cost to stand one of these
 
04:08:20.150 --> 04:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
things up on its own is in the mid seven
 
04:08:22.550 --> 04:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
figures because of our requirements for
 
04:08:22.560 --> 04:08:23.650 align:start position:0%
figures because of our requirements for
controls

04:08:23.650 --> 04:08:23.660 align:start position:0%
controls
 
04:08:26.170 --> 04:08:26.180 align:start position:0%
anti-money laundering surveillance
 
04:08:26.180 --> 04:08:27.729 align:start position:0%
anti-money laundering surveillance
floors

04:08:27.729 --> 04:08:27.739 align:start position:0%
floors
 
04:08:31.130 --> 04:08:31.140 align:start position:0%
the licensing through not licensing the
 
04:08:32.870 --> 04:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
certification through the laboratory
 
04:08:36.170 --> 04:08:36.180 align:start position:0%
it's it's a complicated process so that
 
04:08:37.729 --> 04:08:37.739 align:start position:0%
has a natural barrier to things all
 
04:08:40.610 --> 04:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:43.610 --> 04:08:43.620 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair uh
 
04:08:45.410 --> 04:08:45.420 align:start position:0%
representative Doucette I compliment you
 
04:08:48.469 --> 04:08:48.479 align:start position:0%
on on the charity reduction
 
04:08:50.689 --> 04:08:50.699 align:start position:0%
so that they get more the on their fee
 
04:08:53.929 --> 04:08:53.939 align:start position:0%
when they file you know what was it 50 a
 
04:08:57.170 --> 04:08:57.180 align:start position:0%
year okay and the sgo
 
04:08:59.870 --> 04:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
the single you know the game
 
04:09:02.389 --> 04:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
how about the pgo the goe and the
 
04:09:04.490 --> 04:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
facility are those
 
04:09:08.090 --> 04:09:08.100 align:start position:0%
people that do not have any money when
 
04:09:10.189 --> 04:09:10.199 align:start position:0%
they come into this or they can't afford
 
04:09:14.929 --> 04:09:14.939 align:start position:0%
the like the two the facility 250 a year
 
04:09:16.969 --> 04:09:16.979 align:start position:0%
they can't afford whoever owns that
 
04:09:16.979 --> 04:09:17.990 align:start position:0%
they can't afford whoever owns that
facility

04:09:17.990 --> 04:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
facility
 
04:09:18.000 --> 04:09:19.090 align:start position:0%
facility
um

04:09:19.090 --> 04:09:19.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:22.370 --> 04:09:22.380 align:start position:0%
uh could be a big owner
 
04:09:26.030 --> 04:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh if they own 10 I'm sure they can
 
04:09:29.750 --> 04:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
afford to 250 a year times three and I'm
 
04:09:32.570 --> 04:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
sure the goe the game operator can
 
04:09:35.809 --> 04:09:35.819 align:start position:0%
afford the 750 a year
 
04:09:38.510 --> 04:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
I just wonder why those are reduced for
 
04:09:40.729 --> 04:09:40.739 align:start position:0%
those three areas
 
04:09:43.189 --> 04:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
and and thank you for the question and
 
04:09:45.650 --> 04:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
you're welcome as as stated earlier I
 
04:09:48.349 --> 04:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
agree with you I agree with you I I just
 
04:09:50.929 --> 04:09:50.939 align:start position:0%
saw lowering fees as
 
04:09:53.389 --> 04:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
the thing to do I think most
 
04:09:54.710 --> 04:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
specifically the most important
 
04:09:56.870 --> 04:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
component of this in all seriousness is
 
04:09:58.849 --> 04:09:58.859 align:start position:0%
the Feast of the charities in in the
 
04:10:02.210 --> 04:10:02.220 align:start position:0%
work of bees let's make it easier to go
 
04:10:03.110 --> 04:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
to work
 
04:10:04.969 --> 04:10:04.979 align:start position:0%
on Monday and not have to worry about
 
04:10:07.790 --> 04:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
paying to do that work I'm going to
 
04:10:09.349 --> 04:10:09.359 align:start position:0%
agreement with you and and I would I
 
04:10:11.210 --> 04:10:11.220 align:start position:0%
guess I would ask Lottery too does does
 
04:10:14.689 --> 04:10:14.699 align:start position:0%
this reflect on your does it help you in
 
04:10:17.570 --> 04:10:17.580 align:start position:0%
any way only having to license these
 
04:10:19.490 --> 04:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
these folks every three years I'm
 
04:10:21.710 --> 04:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
talking about the dealers and the in The
 
04:10:24.170 --> 04:10:24.180 align:start position:0%
Pit Bosses and whatnot
 
04:10:26.570 --> 04:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
just want to make a correction to I did
 
04:10:28.849 --> 04:10:28.859 align:start position:0%
the fiscal impact and I did it thinking
 
04:10:31.250 --> 04:10:31.260 align:start position:0%
that it was one fee to cover the
 
04:10:32.870 --> 04:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
three-year period
 
04:10:35.389 --> 04:10:35.399 align:start position:0%
but Mr Newman pointed out to me that no
 
04:10:38.570 --> 04:10:38.580 align:start position:0%
it's the same fee every year
 
04:10:41.570 --> 04:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
they're just not having to submit for a
 
04:10:43.849 --> 04:10:43.859 align:start position:0%
criminal background check that's really
 
04:10:45.530 --> 04:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
what this does the only reduction
 
04:10:47.809 --> 04:10:47.819 align:start position:0%
actually in the fees has to do with the
 
04:10:50.290 --> 04:10:50.300 align:start position:0%
primary game operator I believe it was
 
04:10:54.590 --> 04:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
500 and it's down to 100 now those are
 
04:10:57.469 --> 04:10:57.479 align:start position:0%
basically your Pit Bosses and the
 
04:10:59.030 --> 04:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
Charities it used to be twenty five
 
04:11:01.010 --> 04:11:01.020 align:start position:0%
dollars per game date now it's a solid
 
04:11:02.990 --> 04:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
fifty dollar regardless of how many game
 
04:11:05.950 --> 04:11:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:09.229 --> 04:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
just uh interject here and I failed to
 
04:11:11.750 --> 04:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
when they filed that affidavit annually
 
04:11:14.090 --> 04:11:14.100 align:start position:0%
they pay Lottery the fee
 
04:11:16.189 --> 04:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
but they don't have to pay the extra 75
 
04:11:17.870 --> 04:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
bucks to have their fingerprints checked
 
04:11:22.189 --> 04:11:22.199 align:start position:0%
they attest the uh the affidavit and
 
04:11:24.889 --> 04:11:24.899 align:start position:0%
go back on checks almost 25 20 25 but
 
04:11:26.750 --> 04:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
whatever okay it saves them some money
 
04:11:30.349 --> 04:11:30.359 align:start position:0%
and and it it frees up some some time
 
04:11:32.870 --> 04:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
for lottery I would think and I I would
 
04:11:34.429 --> 04:11:34.439 align:start position:0%
imagine that
 
04:11:37.010 --> 04:11:37.020 align:start position:0%
if something were to come to pass in in
 
04:11:38.510 --> 04:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
a three-year spin that they would find
 
04:11:40.010 --> 04:11:40.020 align:start position:0%
out and they they have to attest to
 
04:11:42.229 --> 04:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
these affidavits it just
 
04:11:44.150 --> 04:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
smoother operation
 
04:11:46.969 --> 04:11:46.979 align:start position:0%
I I will just mention as an employer
 
04:11:49.250 --> 04:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
um hiring is hard and we're hiring
 
04:11:50.630 --> 04:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
dealers a lot of them in New Hampshire
 
04:11:52.010 --> 04:11:52.020 align:start position:0%
we have to train ourselves because
 
04:11:53.630 --> 04:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
they're not there's not a lot of other
 
04:11:55.550 --> 04:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
casinos you have to train them so you
 
04:11:57.290 --> 04:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
know to get them to apply to get them
 
04:11:59.330 --> 04:11:59.340 align:start position:0%
trained is quite a big deal and then to
 
04:12:01.550 --> 04:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
have them go through a lot of Hoops and
 
04:12:04.189 --> 04:12:04.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of expense to get their license is
 
04:12:06.530 --> 04:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
is hard so anything we could do for the
 
04:12:09.469 --> 04:12:09.479 align:start position:0%
for them would be wonderful yes
 
04:12:11.809 --> 04:12:11.819 align:start position:0%
representative ulery
 
04:12:14.750 --> 04:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
regarding fingerprinting
 
04:12:16.490 --> 04:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding they don't change
 
04:12:16.500 --> 04:12:18.830 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding they don't change
much

04:12:18.830 --> 04:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
much
 
04:12:22.849 --> 04:12:22.859 align:start position:0%
so and the question is did you or safety
 
04:12:26.650 --> 04:12:26.660 align:start position:0%
retain the fingerprints
 
04:12:28.910 --> 04:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
safety would be the better person to
 
04:12:30.229 --> 04:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
answer this question but it's my
 
04:12:32.030 --> 04:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
understanding that no after a certain
 
04:12:34.450 --> 04:12:34.460 align:start position:0%
brief period I think it's like 30 days
 
04:12:37.490 --> 04:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
they don't maintain them after that
 
04:12:37.500 --> 04:12:39.769 align:start position:0%
they don't maintain them after that
period

04:12:39.769 --> 04:12:39.779 align:start position:0%
period
 
04:12:39.779 --> 04:12:41.269 align:start position:0%
period
follow-up

04:12:41.269 --> 04:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:12:43.309 --> 04:12:43.319 align:start position:0%
so if we were to put a clause in here
 
04:12:46.610 --> 04:12:46.620 align:start position:0%
that says retain for three years
 
04:12:50.030 --> 04:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
or retain for as long as they have a
 
04:12:50.040 --> 04:12:51.229 align:start position:0%
or retain for as long as they have a
license

04:12:51.229 --> 04:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
license
 
04:12:53.090 --> 04:12:53.100 align:start position:0%
then you'd have those fingerprints on
 
04:12:54.769 --> 04:12:54.779 align:start position:0%
file at all times you wouldn't need to
 
04:12:57.170 --> 04:12:57.180 align:start position:0%
redo them all the time you wouldn't and
 
04:12:59.090 --> 04:12:59.100 align:start position:0%
if they're not keeping them for very
 
04:13:01.130 --> 04:13:01.140 align:start position:0%
long they're useless because they're
 
04:13:03.530 --> 04:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
only there for 30 days
 
04:13:08.030 --> 04:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
so if if a carve out for retention of
 
04:13:10.550 --> 04:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
these fingerprints or it's included in
 
04:13:13.849 --> 04:13:13.859 align:start position:0%
this and somebody else had to do it and
 
04:13:15.950 --> 04:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
by the way the only place they're wiped
 
04:13:19.189 --> 04:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
out of is conquered not where they were
 
04:13:20.990 --> 04:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
sent down to be checked in Washington
 
04:13:22.969 --> 04:13:22.979 align:start position:0%
they're still on file down there believe
 
04:13:22.979 --> 04:13:24.349 align:start position:0%
they're still on file down there believe
me

04:13:24.349 --> 04:13:24.359 align:start position:0%
me
 
04:13:24.359 --> 04:13:25.130 align:start position:0%
me
um

04:13:25.130 --> 04:13:25.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:27.950 --> 04:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
so I'm just trying to get around this
 
04:13:32.229 --> 04:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
concern about having uh uh somebody
 
04:13:34.729 --> 04:13:34.739 align:start position:0%
bypassing it's not it's not the it's not
 
04:13:36.830 --> 04:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
the fingerprint so much that to keep on
 
04:13:39.170 --> 04:13:39.180 align:start position:0%
file it's more going through the
 
04:13:42.229 --> 04:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
criminal background check and I can tell
 
04:13:43.910 --> 04:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
you it's a huge hardship for the dealers
 
04:13:46.550 --> 04:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
and the Charities who
 
04:13:48.530 --> 04:13:48.540 align:start position:0%
um you know they haven't done anything
 
04:13:51.050 --> 04:13:51.060 align:start position:0%
wrong nothing changes over time but they
 
04:13:53.210 --> 04:13:53.220 align:start position:0%
are going they're going to attest that
 
04:13:55.429 --> 04:13:55.439 align:start position:0%
nothing has changed and then every three
 
04:13:56.510 --> 04:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
years they'll go through the whole
 
04:13:58.309 --> 04:13:58.319 align:start position:0%
process again
 
04:13:59.689 --> 04:13:59.699 align:start position:0%
it's not the fingerprint so much it's
 
04:14:01.370 --> 04:14:01.380 align:start position:0%
the criminal background check would you
 
04:14:04.189 --> 04:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
agree yeah okay yeah
 
04:14:07.010 --> 04:14:07.020 align:start position:0%
when I had my PI license
 
04:14:10.250 --> 04:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
we had to have it's 25 for the criminal
 
04:14:11.570 --> 04:14:11.580 align:start position:0%
background check
 
04:14:14.689 --> 04:14:14.699 align:start position:0%
and that's the state one it's 75 if you
 
04:14:18.710 --> 04:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
would do the multi-state uh ncic uh
 
04:14:21.110 --> 04:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
check uh which should or should not uh
 
04:14:24.170 --> 04:14:24.180 align:start position:0%
it may or may not I should say include a
 
04:14:28.070 --> 04:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh a provinces check through RCMP but
 
04:14:30.710 --> 04:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
it's only because we're close
 
04:14:30.720 --> 04:14:32.389 align:start position:0%
it's only because we're close
um

04:14:32.389 --> 04:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:35.389 --> 04:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
and we did that every two years
 
04:14:38.750 --> 04:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
as part of the the fee but then again
 
04:14:40.610 --> 04:14:40.620 align:start position:0%
arrive investigators are doing some
 
04:14:42.769 --> 04:14:42.779 align:start position:0%
stuff that deals directly with people as
 
04:14:46.309 --> 04:14:46.319 align:start position:0%
opposed to Mere Money to your point
 
04:14:47.870 --> 04:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
representative I mean these these folks
 
04:14:49.729 --> 04:14:49.739 align:start position:0%
are on camera 24 7. so when they're
 
04:14:51.769 --> 04:14:51.779 align:start position:0%
dealing there's never the issue in terms
 
04:14:53.809 --> 04:14:53.819 align:start position:0%
of the activity because they're
 
04:14:53.819 --> 04:14:55.250 align:start position:0%
of the activity because they're
surveilled

04:14:55.250 --> 04:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
surveilled
 
04:14:57.050 --> 04:14:57.060 align:start position:0%
um we'll go back to video so the
 
04:14:58.610 --> 04:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
activity is less
 
04:15:01.490 --> 04:15:01.500 align:start position:0%
um intrusive in the pis license yeah I I
 
04:15:05.030 --> 04:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
want to uh be in the uh control room
 
04:15:06.950 --> 04:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
because then I can make sure I know what
 
04:15:09.469 --> 04:15:09.479 align:start position:0%
I'm getting uh
 
04:15:11.809 --> 04:15:11.819 align:start position:0%
yeah just so you know our dealers and
 
04:15:14.269 --> 04:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
our staff are highly regulated you know
 
04:15:16.250 --> 04:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
watched constantly if there's any
 
04:15:18.769 --> 04:15:18.779 align:start position:0%
aberration it's looked at I mean this is
 
04:15:21.170 --> 04:15:21.180 align:start position:0%
really tight because we do believe that
 
04:15:23.269 --> 04:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
we're stewards of Charity money and
 
04:15:25.189 --> 04:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
state money so we we are very very
 
04:15:25.199 --> 04:15:26.630 align:start position:0%
state money so we we are very very
careful

04:15:26.630 --> 04:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
careful
 
04:15:28.790 --> 04:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
um so to have people go through a full
 
04:15:30.710 --> 04:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
criminal background check every year is
 
04:15:32.990 --> 04:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
it's I don't know it's a little bit
 
04:15:35.090 --> 04:15:35.100 align:start position:0%
demoralizing for some of our Charities
 
04:15:37.309 --> 04:15:37.319 align:start position:0%
especially many of whom who run these
 
04:15:39.469 --> 04:15:39.479 align:start position:0%
local charities or Bank presidents and
 
04:15:40.550 --> 04:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
they don't have to go through a criminal
 
04:15:42.769 --> 04:15:42.779 align:start position:0%
Jam Echo and check for that so it is it
 
04:15:44.510 --> 04:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
does seem excessive and I know it's it's
 
04:15:47.030 --> 04:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
hard on lottery staff to be chasing all
 
04:15:49.010 --> 04:15:49.020 align:start position:0%
this stuff all the time it's just like a
 
04:15:50.290 --> 04:15:50.300 align:start position:0%
huge paperwork
 
04:15:54.710 --> 04:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:57.229 --> 04:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
all right anything else you wanted to
 
04:15:57.239 --> 04:16:00.650 align:start position:0%
all right anything else you wanted to
highlight

04:16:00.650 --> 04:16:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:02.330 --> 04:16:02.340 align:start position:0%
you know one thing I just should mention
 
04:16:04.370 --> 04:16:04.380 align:start position:0%
if you know I'm just being transparent
 
04:16:05.689 --> 04:16:05.699 align:start position:0%
here you guys know I've got a little
 
04:16:08.510 --> 04:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
place down the street you know we work
 
04:16:10.849 --> 04:16:10.859 align:start position:0%
very hard to make money for Charities
 
04:16:13.370 --> 04:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
and keep the lights on but we don't
 
04:16:16.849 --> 04:16:16.859 align:start position:0%
always make money every day it is it's
 
04:16:19.250 --> 04:16:19.260 align:start position:0%
gaming and there were days several days
 
04:16:22.250 --> 04:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
a month maybe that the operator loses
 
04:16:24.349 --> 04:16:24.359 align:start position:0%
money just so you know
 
04:16:26.269 --> 04:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
um but over the 10-day period of course
 
04:16:27.950 --> 04:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
the Charities are held completely
 
04:16:31.969 --> 04:16:31.979 align:start position:0%
harmless but over the 10-day period the
 
04:16:34.010 --> 04:16:34.020 align:start position:0%
Charities always make money the state
 
04:16:35.510 --> 04:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
always makes money and we get to keep
 
04:16:38.510 --> 04:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
the lights on but I recently this came
 
04:16:40.189 --> 04:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
to my attention so I just want to be
 
04:16:41.570 --> 04:16:41.580 align:start position:0%
transparent about it that there was a
 
04:16:44.570 --> 04:16:44.580 align:start position:0%
change in a form that that we fill out
 
04:16:48.229 --> 04:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
every month and if we lost money on a
 
04:16:49.910 --> 04:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
day we didn't have to pay the tax but
 
04:16:51.889 --> 04:16:51.899 align:start position:0%
now the way the form has changed we're
 
04:16:55.729 --> 04:16:55.739 align:start position:0%
paying taxes on a zero Revenue day while
 
04:16:57.910 --> 04:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
I have you here is that something
 
04:17:01.309 --> 04:17:01.319 align:start position:0%
you can comment on or that's probably
 
04:17:03.710 --> 04:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
best discussed outside since it's
 
04:17:07.189 --> 04:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
particular to your game operator oh okay
 
04:17:08.870 --> 04:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
I've heard this from other operators so
 
04:17:10.429 --> 04:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
I'm just like I didn't know where that
 
04:17:12.769 --> 04:17:12.779 align:start position:0%
came from I have been given the comment
 
04:17:14.809 --> 04:17:14.819 align:start position:0%
I am going to be looking at it but I
 
04:17:16.610 --> 04:17:16.620 align:start position:0%
can't answer that right okay great this
 
04:17:18.410 --> 04:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
is I've heard this not just myself but
 
04:17:20.030 --> 04:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
just just want to make sure that I'm
 
04:17:22.250 --> 04:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
being transparent okay anything else on
 
04:17:24.469 --> 04:17:24.479 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:17:26.750 --> 04:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative prep I just say I'm
 
04:17:28.550 --> 04:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
treasurer of lion sight and hearing
 
04:17:30.650 --> 04:17:30.660 align:start position:0%
Foundation of New Hampshire and we
 
04:17:34.130 --> 04:17:34.140 align:start position:0%
received a thirty thousand dollars which
 
04:17:37.729 --> 04:17:37.739 align:start position:0%
has gone to a purchase of uh of ice
 
04:17:40.370 --> 04:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
cleaners so we go into schools and I
 
04:17:41.929 --> 04:17:41.939 align:start position:0%
won't call it a camera because parents
 
04:17:44.750 --> 04:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
freak it's a screener it automatically
 
04:17:46.250 --> 04:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
takes a picture it tells anything wrong
 
04:17:48.469 --> 04:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
that might be wrong with a kid and it
 
04:17:50.510 --> 04:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
comes out with needs referral and we
 
04:17:52.429 --> 04:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
refer through the school nurse and we've
 
04:17:53.870 --> 04:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
caught a lot of cases of kids who
 
04:17:55.670 --> 04:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
couldn't see well
 
04:17:57.710 --> 04:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
including one who had cancer behind the
 
04:18:01.150 --> 04:18:01.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:03.950 --> 04:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
anything else on this yes representative
 
04:18:03.960 --> 04:18:05.150 align:start position:0%
anything else on this yes representative
liebly

04:18:05.150 --> 04:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
liebly
 
04:18:07.610 --> 04:18:07.620 align:start position:0%
um sorry this is a um I just have two
 
04:18:11.269 --> 04:18:11.279 align:start position:0%
things one the if we're thinking about
 
04:18:14.090 --> 04:18:14.100 align:start position:0%
the worker I guess have a couple of
 
04:18:16.189 --> 04:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
thoughts one like when you hire could
 
04:18:18.530 --> 04:18:18.540 align:start position:0%
make part of your hiring like we'll pay
 
04:18:21.410 --> 04:18:21.420 align:start position:0%
your fees for this right
 
04:18:24.290 --> 04:18:24.300 align:start position:0%
um it does say that the
 
04:18:26.389 --> 04:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
the person if they're dealing for a
 
04:18:28.189 --> 04:18:28.199 align:start position:0%
variety of places they would have to
 
04:18:30.590 --> 04:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
have a different badge for each place
 
04:18:32.750 --> 04:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
which seems like if they're paying the
 
04:18:35.030 --> 04:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
licensing fee they are licensed to do
 
04:18:37.429 --> 04:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
something like they should have a badge
 
04:18:39.650 --> 04:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
that says this is who I am I'm licensed
 
04:18:41.990 --> 04:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
to do this why do they have to have
 
04:18:47.210 --> 04:18:47.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:49.849 --> 04:18:49.859 align:start position:0%
so they would pay one application fee
 
04:18:52.010 --> 04:18:52.020 align:start position:0%
and and currently it's different but
 
04:18:55.250 --> 04:18:55.260 align:start position:0%
under this change they would pay one
 
04:18:57.830 --> 04:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
application fee the badge fee is ten
 
04:18:59.630 --> 04:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
dollars it's just so that they have one
 
04:19:02.269 --> 04:19:02.279 align:start position:0%
that gives the game room because each
 
04:19:04.070 --> 04:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
each employer that they're working for
 
04:19:06.229 --> 04:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
is going to want us their game room
 
04:19:09.050 --> 04:19:09.060 align:start position:0%
specified on their name badge so they'll
 
04:19:12.050 --> 04:19:12.060 align:start position:0%
be licensed like you said for wherever
 
04:19:14.689 --> 04:19:14.699 align:start position:0%
but they'll need a badge that says so
 
04:19:17.570 --> 04:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
for that particular room
 
04:19:19.670 --> 04:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
which seems weird to charge the employee
 
04:19:22.250 --> 04:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
to advertise for their employer but if
 
04:19:24.050 --> 04:19:24.060 align:start position:0%
that's how it's done I guess that's how
 
04:19:25.309 --> 04:19:25.319 align:start position:0%
it's done
 
04:19:27.830 --> 04:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
um it looks like two I'm just looking at
 
04:19:27.840 --> 04:19:28.790 align:start position:0%
um it looks like two I'm just looking at
the

04:19:28.790 --> 04:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:19:30.650 --> 04:19:30.660 align:start position:0%
the internet as we're sitting here and
 
04:19:33.650 --> 04:19:33.660 align:start position:0%
it looks like the two proposed new
 
04:19:35.870 --> 04:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
gaming uh
 
04:19:40.389 --> 04:19:40.399 align:start position:0%
Charities one in Lebanon one in Concord
 
04:19:44.090 --> 04:19:44.100 align:start position:0%
are one is 17 000 square feet that's
 
04:19:46.729 --> 04:19:46.739 align:start position:0%
being proposed and one is
 
04:19:49.250 --> 04:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
um 24 000 square feet how does that
 
04:19:52.490 --> 04:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
compare with the size of the places that
 
04:19:57.590 --> 04:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:00.349 --> 04:20:00.359 align:start position:0%
this sounds big to me
 
04:20:02.330 --> 04:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
those are obviously big but those aren't
 
04:20:04.370 --> 04:20:04.380 align:start position:0%
new licenses those are current licensed
 
04:20:06.650 --> 04:20:06.660 align:start position:0%
holders that are applying if you're
 
04:20:08.510 --> 04:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
looking into buying a different property
 
04:20:11.150 --> 04:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
and expanding their operation and I'm
 
04:20:12.110 --> 04:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
sure the
 
04:20:14.750 --> 04:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
director can speak to it certainly
 
04:20:14.760 --> 04:20:15.710 align:start position:0%
director can speak to it certainly
um

04:20:15.710 --> 04:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:17.510 --> 04:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
compared to certain facilities they're
 
04:20:19.010 --> 04:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
they're large like for example if you
 
04:20:21.170 --> 04:20:21.180 align:start position:0%
compare it to Berlin Berlin's very small
 
04:20:23.269 --> 04:20:23.279 align:start position:0%
but others they're actually much much
 
04:20:25.610 --> 04:20:25.620 align:start position:0%
smaller then when you compare it to a
 
04:20:28.189 --> 04:20:28.199 align:start position:0%
normal size Casino it's dwarfed okay I'd
 
04:20:29.990 --> 04:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
make the MGM comparison it's like the
 
04:20:31.910 --> 04:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
difference between a lion and a kitten
 
04:20:33.889 --> 04:20:33.899 align:start position:0%
in terms of size difference they're very
 
04:20:36.530 --> 04:20:36.540 align:start position:0%
small because a lot of that facility to
 
04:20:39.769 --> 04:20:39.779 align:start position:0%
be sure we require a significant table
 
04:20:42.469 --> 04:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
presence as part of their license and
 
04:20:45.290 --> 04:20:45.300 align:start position:0%
also the surveillance room account rooms
 
04:20:46.849 --> 04:20:46.859 align:start position:0%
there's significant back office
 
04:20:49.370 --> 04:20:49.380 align:start position:0%
facilities that absorb a lot of space
 
04:20:51.590 --> 04:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
so 70 000 square feet seems like a lot
 
04:20:53.030 --> 04:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
but it's not as big as you'd think once
 
04:20:54.590 --> 04:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
you get to when you walked in and see
 
04:20:56.210 --> 04:20:56.220 align:start position:0%
what the floor would look like
 
04:20:58.610 --> 04:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
so to go back to the question
 
04:21:00.769 --> 04:21:00.779 align:start position:0%
14 and limiting you know whatever the
 
04:21:04.250 --> 04:21:04.260 align:start position:0%
number is 14 15. it it are we talking
 
04:21:05.990 --> 04:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
about limiting
 
04:21:09.349 --> 04:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
the game room number or the licensees
 
04:21:10.910 --> 04:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
because if these are being opened by
 
04:21:12.170 --> 04:21:12.180 align:start position:0%
people who already hold a license
 
04:21:14.630 --> 04:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
couldn't they open
 
04:21:17.269 --> 04:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
multiple new rooms no it was our
 
04:21:19.250 --> 04:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
interpretation and it's been enforced
 
04:21:21.650 --> 04:21:21.660 align:start position:0%
personally by me that said no if there
 
04:21:23.570 --> 04:21:23.580 align:start position:0%
was one facility that's through one
 
04:21:25.849 --> 04:21:25.859 align:start position:0%
facility and you can move it under the
 
04:21:28.010 --> 04:21:28.020 align:start position:0%
provisions of the prior law within the
 
04:21:29.570 --> 04:21:29.580 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction so if it was within
 
04:21:31.189 --> 04:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
concrete could stay within Concord to go
 
04:21:33.110 --> 04:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
someplace else uh representative
 
04:21:35.389 --> 04:21:35.399 align:start position:0%
doucet's Town Salem has Provisions that
 
04:21:36.889 --> 04:21:36.899 align:start position:0%
say it could only go in certain places
 
04:21:38.510 --> 04:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
some jurisdictions have those
 
04:21:41.150 --> 04:21:41.160 align:start position:0%
restrictions so they can only go in res
 
04:21:43.849 --> 04:21:43.859 align:start position:0%
you know industry a for example
 
04:21:45.590 --> 04:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
um but that would limit it it's not like
 
04:21:48.830 --> 04:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
you can split off and there's no
 
04:21:50.870 --> 04:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify I'm understanding
 
04:21:53.870 --> 04:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
right so the new place in Lebanon if it
 
04:21:57.170 --> 04:21:57.180 align:start position:0%
opens yes it's not an additional place
 
04:21:59.330 --> 04:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
they had it over here they're moving it
 
04:22:00.530 --> 04:22:00.540 align:start position:0%
over here to expand or for whatever
 
04:22:03.050 --> 04:22:03.060 align:start position:0%
correct so okay to make sure so that
 
04:22:05.990 --> 04:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
you're clear I'm clear to your clear
 
04:22:08.269 --> 04:22:08.279 align:start position:0%
um that's for historic horse racing as
 
04:22:09.650 --> 04:22:09.660 align:start position:0%
for games of chance as we said before
 
04:22:11.510 --> 04:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
there's no limit on the applications
 
04:22:13.130 --> 04:22:13.140 align:start position:0%
that can be for that
 
04:22:15.590 --> 04:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
but a games your chance license would
 
04:22:17.870 --> 04:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
have to go with the new HHR location and
 
04:22:19.250 --> 04:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
would only be one
 
04:22:22.849 --> 04:22:22.859 align:start position:0%
and the bill in front of us is limiting
 
04:22:29.330 --> 04:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:32.450 --> 04:22:32.460 align:start position:0%
and and to my to my argument if if there
 
04:22:35.210 --> 04:22:35.220 align:start position:0%
was going to be an influx of of people
 
04:22:37.189 --> 04:22:37.199 align:start position:0%
who wanted open charitable gaming rooms
 
04:22:39.290 --> 04:22:39.300 align:start position:0%
they would be right now would happen
 
04:22:42.889 --> 04:22:42.899 align:start position:0%
right now but my suspicion and fear is
 
04:22:46.490 --> 04:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
when we hit that July one date of 24
 
04:22:49.070 --> 04:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
then all bets are off so
 
04:22:52.910 --> 04:22:52.920 align:start position:0%
best offer defense is a good offense
 
04:22:54.530 --> 04:22:54.540 align:start position:0%
representative almond did you have your
 
04:22:56.929 --> 04:22:56.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:59.929 --> 04:22:59.939 align:start position:0%
I I could comment on the Lebanon thing
 
04:23:03.110 --> 04:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
it's a very small room now I don't know
 
04:23:06.889 --> 04:23:06.899 align:start position:0%
how they fit in both machines and poker
 
04:23:10.969 --> 04:23:10.979 align:start position:0%
tables frankly and I some people say
 
04:23:13.189 --> 04:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
that there's almost nobody in it and
 
04:23:15.650 --> 04:23:15.660 align:start position:0%
other people say that some days it's
 
04:23:20.630 --> 04:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
crowded but it's a former Honda dealer
 
04:23:23.330 --> 04:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
down the street from me
 
04:23:28.010 --> 04:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
and it's one building off from the
 
04:23:30.830 --> 04:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
largest thrift store in our region
 
04:23:33.590 --> 04:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
which I don't especially appreciate but
 
04:23:36.170 --> 04:23:36.180 align:start position:0%
it's there it is uh what I wanted to ask
 
04:23:39.110 --> 04:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
about was uh technical or mechanical
 
04:23:42.410 --> 04:23:42.420 align:start position:0%
defects this building this bill was not
 
04:23:45.769 --> 04:23:45.779 align:start position:0%
amended when it left Edna they just sent
 
04:23:49.309 --> 04:23:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:52.250 --> 04:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
was this bill any DNA I don't think
 
04:23:53.689 --> 04:23:53.699 align:start position:0%
no I don't think
 
04:23:53.699 --> 04:23:55.990 align:start position:0%
no I don't think
um

04:23:55.990 --> 04:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:59.809 --> 04:23:59.819 align:start position:0%
oh no this one this one
 
04:24:02.170 --> 04:24:02.180 align:start position:0%
did we get this first why are we
 
04:24:04.610 --> 04:24:04.620 align:start position:0%
discussing it now
 
04:24:05.929 --> 04:24:05.939 align:start position:0%
just because there was a lot of
 
04:24:09.170 --> 04:24:09.180 align:start position:0%
questions no but what I mean is we
 
04:24:11.510 --> 04:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
didn't start to know about this bill
 
04:24:16.250 --> 04:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:18.229 --> 04:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
well we did the original hearing on this
 
04:24:22.750 --> 04:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
what two three weeks ago and February
 
04:24:26.570 --> 04:24:26.580 align:start position:0%
9th super steering was okay so now we're
 
04:24:27.830 --> 04:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
just doing follow-up with all the bills
 
04:24:29.990 --> 04:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
there was lots of questions on I figured
 
04:24:32.330 --> 04:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
we'd okay there's a whole lots of
 
04:24:35.030 --> 04:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
technical or mechanical defects they
 
04:24:36.889 --> 04:24:36.899 align:start position:0%
wanted corrected and
 
04:24:39.170 --> 04:24:39.180 align:start position:0%
somebody ought to pay some attention to
 
04:24:40.910 --> 04:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
those there is put our fiscal
 
04:24:42.349 --> 04:24:42.359 align:start position:0%
representative we submitted what we
 
04:24:43.610 --> 04:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
thought were technical defects with the
 
04:24:43.620 --> 04:24:44.809 align:start position:0%
thought were technical defects with the
bill

04:24:44.809 --> 04:24:44.819 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:24:46.550 --> 04:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
um the fiscal note for us we I think I'd
 
04:24:48.710 --> 04:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
apologize my are probably hearing we
 
04:24:50.809 --> 04:24:50.819 align:start position:0%
submitted this the day the day of the
 
04:24:53.269 --> 04:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
hearing last time so these what what our
 
04:24:54.830 --> 04:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
suggested technical changes to the bill
 
04:24:58.729 --> 04:24:58.739 align:start position:0%
yeah only a few of us got it okay so the
 
04:25:00.290 --> 04:25:00.300 align:start position:0%
what we handed out today that's what
 
04:25:01.910 --> 04:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking about is the technical
 
04:25:05.150 --> 04:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
things we need to look at okay final
 
04:25:08.929 --> 04:25:08.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:08.939 --> 04:25:10.070 align:start position:0%
 
four

04:25:10.070 --> 04:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
four
 
04:25:16.550 --> 04:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:23.410 --> 04:25:23.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:26.330 --> 04:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
okay so we do need to read through these
 
04:25:29.870 --> 04:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
probably and uh
 
04:25:32.389 --> 04:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
representative just said do you want to
 
04:25:33.530 --> 04:25:33.540 align:start position:0%
take a look at these a little bit more
 
04:25:35.870 --> 04:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
detail and just see what we need to do
 
04:25:37.729 --> 04:25:37.739 align:start position:0%
okay great
 
04:25:41.450 --> 04:25:41.460 align:start position:0%
thank you anything else awesome okay we
 
04:25:43.849 --> 04:25:43.859 align:start position:0%
will stop the work session on House Bill
 
04:25:51.349 --> 04:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:53.689 --> 04:25:53.699 align:start position:0%
and we will
 
04:25:56.269 --> 04:25:56.279 align:start position:0%

04:25:56.279 --> 04:26:14.149 align:start position:0%
go to house bill
486.

04:26:14.149 --> 04:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:14.159 --> 04:26:18.830 align:start position:0%
 
production

04:26:18.830 --> 04:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:18.840 --> 04:26:42.050 align:start position:0%
 
s

04:26:42.050 --> 04:26:42.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:42.060 --> 04:26:50.889 align:start position:0%
 
beautiful

04:26:50.889 --> 04:26:50.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:54.649 --> 04:26:54.659 align:start position:0%
okay 486 is relative to Vehicle
 
04:26:56.929 --> 04:26:56.939 align:start position:0%
registrations and reciprocal toll
 
04:26:59.990 --> 04:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
collection enforcement agreements
 
04:27:06.110 --> 04:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:09.469 --> 04:27:09.479 align:start position:0%
January 31st going way back
 
04:27:11.929 --> 04:27:11.939 align:start position:0%
uh there was a lot of questions
 
04:27:11.939 --> 04:27:13.010 align:start position:0%
uh there was a lot of questions
um

04:27:13.010 --> 04:27:13.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:15.229 --> 04:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
I asked representative orrs to take a
 
04:27:18.229 --> 04:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
little more of a detailed look at it and
 
04:27:19.969 --> 04:27:19.979 align:start position:0%
love to hear what you learned and then
 
04:27:22.610 --> 04:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
kind of go from there and learn see what
 
04:27:24.530 --> 04:27:24.540 align:start position:0%
we are do you want to tell us what you
 
04:27:26.929 --> 04:27:26.939 align:start position:0%
think yes okay thank you madam chair
 
04:27:29.750 --> 04:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
I want to offer a special thanks to
 
04:27:32.330 --> 04:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
representative ulrey for volunteering me
 
04:27:34.429 --> 04:27:34.439 align:start position:0%
for this task
 
04:27:36.649 --> 04:27:36.659 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to congratulate the rest of
 
04:27:38.570 --> 04:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
you for hanging in here all day and you
 
04:27:40.849 --> 04:27:40.859 align:start position:0%
get to you get the we saved the best for
 
04:27:42.710 --> 04:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
last let me just put it that way how's
 
04:27:42.720 --> 04:27:44.809 align:start position:0%
last let me just put it that way how's
that

04:27:44.809 --> 04:27:44.819 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:27:46.729 --> 04:27:46.739 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
04:27:51.349 --> 04:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh I believe HB 486 is inexpedient to
 
04:27:51.359 --> 04:27:53.030 align:start position:0%
uh I believe HB 486 is inexpedient to
legislate

04:27:53.030 --> 04:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
04:27:57.290 --> 04:27:57.300 align:start position:0%
to do anything other than to I believe
 
04:27:59.990 --> 04:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
Leaf things as they are is gonna hurt
 
04:28:03.290 --> 04:28:03.300 align:start position:0%
D.O.T and DMV's collection of tolls and
 
04:28:05.030 --> 04:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
fines and so on
 
04:28:09.590 --> 04:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh in addition to that we have
 
04:28:12.830 --> 04:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
a fee schedule that I've learned the
 
04:28:15.649 --> 04:28:15.659 align:start position:0%
initial fine is fifty dollars if it ever
 
04:28:17.269 --> 04:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
goes that far
 
04:28:21.710 --> 04:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
it isn't the 250 dollars that
 
04:28:24.349 --> 04:28:24.359 align:start position:0%
the representative that sponsored the
 
04:28:27.110 --> 04:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
bill initially said so that was that was
 
04:28:28.910 --> 04:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
just an error I'm sure
 
04:28:31.130 --> 04:28:31.140 align:start position:0%
I could not confirm that anywhere with
 
04:28:33.610 --> 04:28:33.620 align:start position:0%
DLT or DMV
 
04:28:36.710 --> 04:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
I did try to contact the representative
 
04:28:40.189 --> 04:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
that sponsored the bill and uh my
 
04:28:43.250 --> 04:28:43.260 align:start position:0%
request for information was not returned
 
04:28:45.590 --> 04:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at several points here
 
04:28:47.530 --> 04:28:47.540 align:start position:0%
until violations toll collection
 
04:28:50.630 --> 04:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
notification and eventually DMV and
 
04:28:50.640 --> 04:28:53.149 align:start position:0%
notification and eventually DMV and
suspension

04:28:53.149 --> 04:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
suspension
 
04:28:56.030 --> 04:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
after uh I did not get a response I did
 
04:28:59.929 --> 04:28:59.939 align:start position:0%
go back and watch the the
 
04:29:02.510 --> 04:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill I watched their
 
04:29:08.030 --> 04:29:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:10.070 --> 04:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
I believe that
 
04:29:12.790 --> 04:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
the system could be improved
 
04:29:16.450 --> 04:29:16.460 align:start position:0%
and Improvement would basically be
 
04:29:25.610 --> 04:29:25.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:28.429 --> 04:29:28.439 align:start position:0%
the other Improvement that could be done
 
04:29:31.429 --> 04:29:31.439 align:start position:0%
which is already being done is instead
 
04:29:34.429 --> 04:29:34.439 align:start position:0%
of 20 manual
 
04:29:37.849 --> 04:29:37.859 align:start position:0%
requests for payment a month of the
 
04:29:40.670 --> 04:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
other states the system is being
 
04:29:43.849 --> 04:29:43.859 align:start position:0%
automated uh it's currently pretty much
 
04:29:46.670 --> 04:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
done with Massachusetts and they're
 
04:29:48.590 --> 04:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
testing it and so on
 
04:29:56.330 --> 04:29:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:59.030 --> 04:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
personal notification seems to be very
 
04:29:59.040 --> 04:30:00.050 align:start position:0%
personal notification seems to be very
adequate

04:30:00.050 --> 04:30:00.060 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
04:30:03.469 --> 04:30:03.479 align:start position:0%
it was testified that the representative
 
04:30:05.750 --> 04:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
son or young adult teenage son or young
 
04:30:07.429 --> 04:30:07.439 align:start position:0%
adult went through the toll booth one
 
04:30:10.729 --> 04:30:10.739 align:start position:0%
time and got fined 250
 
04:30:10.739 --> 04:30:11.809 align:start position:0%
time and got fined 250
Etc

04:30:11.809 --> 04:30:11.819 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
04:30:14.090 --> 04:30:14.100 align:start position:0%
this does not seem to be the case I'm
 
04:30:16.130 --> 04:30:16.140 align:start position:0%
sure the world can turn upside down and
 
04:30:19.370 --> 04:30:19.380 align:start position:0%
accidents do happen however
 
04:30:22.429 --> 04:30:22.439 align:start position:0%
if it did happen it was a one-off
 
04:30:25.849 --> 04:30:25.859 align:start position:0%
so the way to process actually works is
 
04:30:29.389 --> 04:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
once there are 10 violations a
 
04:30:31.429 --> 04:30:31.439 align:start position:0%
notification goes out
 
04:30:34.309 --> 04:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
and they have 30 days to respond
 
04:30:35.809 --> 04:30:35.819 align:start position:0%
after that
 
04:30:38.809 --> 04:30:38.819 align:start position:0%
30 days a second notification goes out
 
04:30:41.210 --> 04:30:41.220 align:start position:0%
on a pink card
 
04:30:43.189 --> 04:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
and the reason for the pink card is to
 
04:30:44.570 --> 04:30:44.580 align:start position:0%
get their attention
 
04:30:46.130 --> 04:30:46.140 align:start position:0%
make sure that they've seen the
 
04:30:46.140 --> 04:30:48.649 align:start position:0%
make sure that they've seen the
notification

04:30:48.649 --> 04:30:48.659 align:start position:0%
notification
 
04:30:51.170 --> 04:30:51.180 align:start position:0%
if 30 days go by and there's no response
 
04:30:54.229 --> 04:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
there is a third notification which
 
04:30:56.630 --> 04:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
takes approximately 30 days
 
04:30:58.670 --> 04:30:58.680 align:start position:0%
it is 30 days
 
04:31:01.309 --> 04:31:01.319 align:start position:0%
if there's no response the fourth
 
04:31:01.319 --> 04:31:02.750 align:start position:0%
if there's no response the fourth
notification

04:31:02.750 --> 04:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
notification
 
04:31:05.450 --> 04:31:05.460 align:start position:0%
they get is 30 days so now we're up to
 
04:31:07.969 --> 04:31:07.979 align:start position:0%
120 days and
 
04:31:11.809 --> 04:31:11.819 align:start position:0%
along with that the DMV process to
 
04:31:16.130 --> 04:31:16.140 align:start position:0%
suspend the registration begins however
 
04:31:18.710 --> 04:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
nothing is done it just it sets it up
 
04:31:20.330 --> 04:31:20.340 align:start position:0%
like an Excel spreadsheet you're going
 
04:31:22.130 --> 04:31:22.140 align:start position:0%
to work on and do a project or whatever
 
04:31:24.889 --> 04:31:24.899 align:start position:0%
it just sets it up
 
04:31:28.670 --> 04:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
then if in 30 days
 
04:31:31.969 --> 04:31:31.979 align:start position:0%
there is no response that's when the DMV
 
04:31:34.969 --> 04:31:34.979 align:start position:0%
suspension comes into play and of course
 
04:31:38.510 --> 04:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
the individual would not know their
 
04:31:40.630 --> 04:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
suspension is going to be
 
04:31:43.790 --> 04:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
forthcoming unless they either read the
 
04:31:47.510 --> 04:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
notifications or had some idea as to
 
04:31:49.309 --> 04:31:49.319 align:start position:0%
what's going on in their life or
 
04:31:49.319 --> 04:31:50.330 align:start position:0%
what's going on in their life or
whatever

04:31:50.330 --> 04:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
04:31:54.790 --> 04:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
so we are at the 150 day Mark minimum
 
04:31:57.410 --> 04:31:57.420 align:start position:0%
considering that there may be time in
 
04:31:59.389 --> 04:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
between each of those 30 note day
 
04:32:01.370 --> 04:32:01.380 align:start position:0%
notifications of a couple days maybe
 
04:32:04.250 --> 04:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
part of a week whatever
 
04:32:07.070 --> 04:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion the DMV's whole line of
 
04:32:09.590 --> 04:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
registration is definitely not targeting
 
04:32:11.809 --> 04:32:11.819 align:start position:0%
the occasional tow Violator
 
04:32:15.729 --> 04:32:15.739 align:start position:0%
based on my review and in my experience
 
04:32:20.269 --> 04:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
DMV is targeting habitual toll violators
 
04:32:22.370 --> 04:32:22.380 align:start position:0%
that accumulate approximately five
 
04:32:24.649 --> 04:32:24.659 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars plus or minus
 
04:32:26.689 --> 04:32:26.699 align:start position:0%
in delinquent tolls
 
04:32:29.990 --> 04:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
now it's beyond the scope I'm sure of
 
04:32:32.689 --> 04:32:32.699 align:start position:0%
the committee in my time and so on and
 
04:32:34.729 --> 04:32:34.739 align:start position:0%
so forth for me to go in person and do a
 
04:32:36.769 --> 04:32:36.779 align:start position:0%
personal audit which normally I would do
 
04:32:39.469 --> 04:32:39.479 align:start position:0%
if I was doing an audit
 
04:32:41.990 --> 04:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
in this case I think the
 
04:32:44.809 --> 04:32:44.819 align:start position:0%
information I've received
 
04:32:48.290 --> 04:32:48.300 align:start position:0%
and being an auditor you may have seen
 
04:32:50.149 --> 04:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
me a couple times question people in
 
04:32:51.229 --> 04:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
here and sometimes I got a little
 
04:32:54.050 --> 04:32:54.060 align:start position:0%
carried away and I apologize for that
 
04:32:56.870 --> 04:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
I believe I've covered this like 14 Ways
 
04:32:59.750 --> 04:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
to Sunday I've peeled back the onion and
 
04:33:01.429 --> 04:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's anything left on
 
04:33:03.889 --> 04:33:03.899 align:start position:0%
the table again I could have missed
 
04:33:05.150 --> 04:33:05.160 align:start position:0%
something somebody could have lied to me
 
04:33:06.709 --> 04:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
I don't think D.O.T
 
04:33:09.470 --> 04:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
would lie to me I don't think DMV would
 
04:33:12.529 --> 04:33:12.539 align:start position:0%
I think they're very forthcoming I think
 
04:33:14.570 --> 04:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
they're actually fantastic organization
 
04:33:17.390 --> 04:33:17.400 align:start position:0%
the way they operate and my hat's off to
 
04:33:19.369 --> 04:33:19.379 align:start position:0%
them for the way they do this whole
 
04:33:21.830 --> 04:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
operation again I don't think it can be
 
04:33:24.849 --> 04:33:24.859 align:start position:0%
improved unless a we get the Automation
 
04:33:27.769 --> 04:33:27.779 align:start position:0%
and b or we just canceled the whole toll
 
04:33:29.929 --> 04:33:29.939 align:start position:0%
Easy Pass system altogether entirely
 
04:33:32.510 --> 04:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
thank you I think you've generated some
 
04:33:34.849 --> 04:33:34.859 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative Platt yes
 
04:33:36.529 --> 04:33:36.539 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question Madam
 
04:33:38.289 --> 04:33:38.299 align:start position:0%
chair do I have to take questions
 
04:33:41.449 --> 04:33:41.459 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:41.459 --> 04:33:43.310 align:start position:0%
 
discussion

04:33:43.310 --> 04:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
04:33:48.910 --> 04:33:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:52.849 --> 04:33:52.859 align:start position:0%
representative hands representative
 
04:33:56.810 --> 04:33:56.820 align:start position:0%
thank you it had two quick questions one
 
04:33:58.490 --> 04:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
the way you describe it sounds like a
 
04:34:01.310 --> 04:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
very operational uh system that would
 
04:34:03.949 --> 04:34:03.959 align:start position:0%
work uh personal experience with them
 
04:34:06.830 --> 04:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
and for getting to move my transponder
 
04:34:10.250 --> 04:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
from vehicle to vehicle uh it's not the
 
04:34:13.970 --> 04:34:13.980 align:start position:0%
way that they operate uh number two did
 
04:34:16.010 --> 04:34:16.020 align:start position:0%
you discuss with them the corruption
 
04:34:18.769 --> 04:34:18.779 align:start position:0%
that exists that has been made very
 
04:34:22.131 --> 04:34:22.141 align:start position:0%
obvious in the Press regarding uh
 
04:34:25.010 --> 04:34:25.020 align:start position:0%
suspension of uh registrations for
 
04:34:27.890 --> 04:34:27.900 align:start position:0%
violating Massachusetts or Maine toll
 
04:34:27.900 --> 04:34:29.390 align:start position:0%
violating Massachusetts or Maine toll
provisions

04:34:29.390 --> 04:34:29.400 align:start position:0%
provisions
 
04:34:31.910 --> 04:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh so excuse me what was your first
 
04:34:34.670 --> 04:34:34.680 align:start position:0%
point your experience doesn't follow
 
04:34:37.609 --> 04:34:37.619 align:start position:0%
doesn't comport with uh what the rules
 
04:34:40.970 --> 04:34:40.980 align:start position:0%
are uh when I get a uh Pink the first
 
04:34:43.490 --> 04:34:43.500 align:start position:0%
notification spank and it's six months
 
04:34:46.250 --> 04:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
after and that's the only notification
 
04:34:49.429 --> 04:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
received but that's personal experience
 
04:34:53.390 --> 04:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
and that's with legislative plates on uh
 
04:34:56.709 --> 04:34:56.719 align:start position:0%
second issue was regarding the
 
04:34:59.510 --> 04:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
well-publicized problems that both Main
 
04:35:00.709 --> 04:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
and Mass
 
04:35:04.730 --> 04:35:04.740 align:start position:0%
uh have regarding their uh their
 
04:35:07.730 --> 04:35:07.740 align:start position:0%
operations and their demands to suspend
 
04:35:09.289 --> 04:35:09.299 align:start position:0%
the registrations of New Hampshire
 
04:35:09.299 --> 04:35:10.849 align:start position:0%
the registrations of New Hampshire
residents

04:35:10.849 --> 04:35:10.859 align:start position:0%
residents
 
04:35:14.029 --> 04:35:14.039 align:start position:0%
so the your first point
 
04:35:16.789 --> 04:35:16.799 align:start position:0%
in my experience I have gone through the
 
04:35:18.769 --> 04:35:18.779 align:start position:0%
tolls I went through three or four I was
 
04:35:21.410 --> 04:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
discussing this with uh Rhett brochure
 
04:35:23.330 --> 04:35:23.340 align:start position:0%
today and
 
04:35:25.490 --> 04:35:25.500 align:start position:0%
it picked up my transponder on one did
 
04:35:28.070 --> 04:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
it on the second it did on the third and
 
04:35:30.051 --> 04:35:30.061 align:start position:0%
if there was a fourth it also picked
 
04:35:31.310 --> 04:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
that up
 
04:35:33.529 --> 04:35:33.539 align:start position:0%
within a week I had a picture of me
 
04:35:35.689 --> 04:35:35.699 align:start position:0%
obviously driving the car
 
04:35:37.970 --> 04:35:37.980 align:start position:0%
my car plates and everything and here's
 
04:35:39.769 --> 04:35:39.779 align:start position:0%
my here's my fee I think it was like
 
04:35:42.051 --> 04:35:42.061 align:start position:0%
twenty one dollars in change
 
04:35:45.289 --> 04:35:45.299 align:start position:0%
I picked up the phone called the EZ Pass
 
04:35:47.650 --> 04:35:47.660 align:start position:0%
system the 800 number I think it was
 
04:35:49.551 --> 04:35:49.561 align:start position:0%
within a couple of minutes I had
 
04:35:51.349 --> 04:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
somebody on the line
 
04:35:53.631 --> 04:35:53.641 align:start position:0%
I explained to them what happened they
 
04:35:53.641 --> 04:35:54.590 align:start position:0%
I explained to them what happened they
checked

04:35:54.590 --> 04:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
checked
 
04:35:57.830 --> 04:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
their system and they said you're good
 
04:36:01.131 --> 04:36:01.141 align:start position:0%
we cleared it all said and done so like
 
04:36:03.830 --> 04:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
I said earlier in my pitch
 
04:36:06.051 --> 04:36:06.061 align:start position:0%
like anything else in life especially in
 
04:36:07.789 --> 04:36:07.799 align:start position:0%
the world of automation there could be a
 
04:36:07.799 --> 04:36:09.289 align:start position:0%
the world of automation there could be a
one-off

04:36:09.289 --> 04:36:09.299 align:start position:0%
one-off
 
04:36:11.090 --> 04:36:11.100 align:start position:0%
but okay you're shaking your head and
 
04:36:14.029 --> 04:36:14.039 align:start position:0%
also yeah I can't speak to that now as
 
04:36:16.490 --> 04:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
for the corruption in the mass in Maine
 
04:36:19.551 --> 04:36:19.561 align:start position:0%
and as far as collecting tolls I am on
 
04:36:21.890 --> 04:36:21.900 align:start position:0%
the take so I can no I'm just kidding
 
04:36:23.750 --> 04:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to see if anybody was
 
04:36:25.789 --> 04:36:25.799 align:start position:0%
paying attention
 
04:36:28.849 --> 04:36:28.859 align:start position:0%
so that that subject never came up I
 
04:36:31.310 --> 04:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
have not heard of that I don't know how
 
04:36:33.830 --> 04:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
that would impact the individual in
 
04:36:35.810 --> 04:36:35.820 align:start position:0%
terms of paying a fine of fifty dollars
 
04:36:37.609 --> 04:36:37.619 align:start position:0%
or whatever but are you saying that
 
04:36:39.830 --> 04:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
they're using this as blackmail
 
04:36:43.730 --> 04:36:43.740 align:start position:0%
no um Massachusetts if you evade the
 
04:36:46.250 --> 04:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
tolls in Massachusetts on the Easy Pass
 
04:36:48.890 --> 04:36:48.900 align:start position:0%
system they have the ability to spend
 
04:36:51.230 --> 04:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
your registration in New Hampshire just
 
04:36:53.631 --> 04:36:53.641 align:start position:0%
like New Hampshire has the ability to
 
04:36:55.551 --> 04:36:55.561 align:start position:0%
suspend the registration of a
 
04:36:57.949 --> 04:36:57.959 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts resident for evading New
 
04:36:59.570 --> 04:36:59.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yes I believe that is correct
 
04:37:02.689 --> 04:37:02.699 align:start position:0%
so the problem with Massachusetts which
 
04:37:05.929 --> 04:37:05.939 align:start position:0%
re I think they fired one director and
 
04:37:08.090 --> 04:37:08.100 align:start position:0%
they had to redo their entire thing
 
04:37:11.810 --> 04:37:11.820 align:start position:0%
there are literally
 
04:37:14.209 --> 04:37:14.219 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars sitting out there
 
04:37:17.929 --> 04:37:17.939 align:start position:0%
someplace uh which hasn't been really
 
04:37:20.510 --> 04:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
taken care of because
 
04:37:24.590 --> 04:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
well it's Massachusetts and Maine
 
04:37:26.689 --> 04:37:26.699 align:start position:0%
views the same system
 
04:37:28.910 --> 04:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
for a long time so
 
04:37:31.070 --> 04:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
I won't mention names or companies but
 
04:37:34.189 --> 04:37:34.199 align:start position:0%
as an auditor a young auditor has handed
 
04:37:37.189 --> 04:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
a file worth millions of dollars I was
 
04:37:40.070 --> 04:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
told to bury that file and I did I
 
04:37:42.051 --> 04:37:42.061 align:start position:0%
buried it right where I could find it
 
04:37:43.849 --> 04:37:43.859 align:start position:0%
and after I looked at it and the
 
04:37:45.769 --> 04:37:45.779 align:start position:0%
Auditors came through about six months
 
04:37:45.779 --> 04:37:46.670 align:start position:0%
Auditors came through about six months
later

04:37:46.670 --> 04:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
later
 
04:37:48.830 --> 04:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
I handed that filed to the Auditors
 
04:37:52.070 --> 04:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
explain the situation and in less than a
 
04:37:53.570 --> 04:37:53.580 align:start position:0%
year the vice president and the
 
04:37:56.330 --> 04:37:56.340 align:start position:0%
president and Company were fired
 
04:37:59.449 --> 04:37:59.459 align:start position:0%
so corruption corruption is out there
 
04:38:01.670 --> 04:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't mean we're going to
 
04:38:05.449 --> 04:38:05.459 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:08.269 --> 04:38:08.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:09.529 --> 04:38:09.539 align:start position:0%
point is
 
04:38:11.869 --> 04:38:11.879 align:start position:0%
is I believe that was the uh the Bill's
 
04:38:15.070 --> 04:38:15.080 align:start position:0%
author point is we shouldn't be
 
04:38:18.349 --> 04:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
subjecting New Hampshire residents
 
04:38:22.910 --> 04:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
to abuse by a foreign state
 
04:38:26.750 --> 04:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
because of their problems I I absolutely
 
04:38:29.090 --> 04:38:29.100 align:start position:0%
absolutely agree and the same would go
 
04:38:31.250 --> 04:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
for our own state New Hampshire
 
04:38:34.209 --> 04:38:34.219 align:start position:0%
in this situation as far as I can tell
 
04:38:38.209 --> 04:38:38.219 align:start position:0%
unless I was to go in and do an audit
 
04:38:41.590 --> 04:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
it appears that this system it doesn't
 
04:38:44.269 --> 04:38:44.279 align:start position:0%
introduce the first fine
 
04:38:49.310 --> 04:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
until after 150 days notification and
 
04:38:51.529 --> 04:38:51.539 align:start position:0%
it's not until after 90 days
 
04:38:53.869 --> 04:38:53.879 align:start position:0%
notification does the if you want to
 
04:38:55.730 --> 04:38:55.740 align:start position:0%
call it a ticket as I mentioned earlier
 
04:38:57.709 --> 04:38:57.719 align:start position:0%
the possible if you think of it as an
 
04:38:59.390 --> 04:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
Excel spreadsheet
 
04:39:01.970 --> 04:39:01.980 align:start position:0%
for suspension this started
 
04:39:01.980 --> 04:39:03.289 align:start position:0%
for suspension this started
so

04:39:03.289 --> 04:39:03.299 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:39:06.830 --> 04:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know if your Situation's one-off
 
04:39:09.470 --> 04:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
the corruption obviously is sounds to me
 
04:39:11.869 --> 04:39:11.879 align:start position:0%
like it's well publicized but I am not
 
04:39:14.510 --> 04:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
aware of it and the fact that corruption
 
04:39:16.369 --> 04:39:16.379 align:start position:0%
could exist all shocking off the
 
04:39:18.289 --> 04:39:18.299 align:start position:0%
government's involved
 
04:39:18.299 --> 04:39:19.490 align:start position:0%
government's involved
so

04:39:19.490 --> 04:39:19.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:39:22.250 --> 04:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
as far as I can tell though a fine of
 
04:39:24.830 --> 04:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars I mean I started I went to
 
04:39:27.289 --> 04:39:27.299 align:start position:0%
OLS I had an amendment drafted up to
 
04:39:30.230 --> 04:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
start to find a 300 and end the fine at
 
04:39:32.570 --> 04:39:32.580 align:start position:0%
three hundred dollars thinking that what
 
04:39:34.670 --> 04:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
we were told initially to find for 250
 
04:39:36.949 --> 04:39:36.959 align:start position:0%
500 and a thousand
 
04:39:39.770 --> 04:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
but after I got all the information it's
 
04:39:41.570 --> 04:39:41.580 align:start position:0%
like well that Amendment would have hurt
 
04:39:45.110 --> 04:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
people more than help people and so I
 
04:39:46.550 --> 04:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
just trashed it
 
04:39:49.610 --> 04:39:49.620 align:start position:0%
I believe that this system works I
 
04:39:51.410 --> 04:39:51.420 align:start position:0%
believe that once it's automated it's
 
04:39:52.970 --> 04:39:52.980 align:start position:0%
going to be better
 
04:39:55.910 --> 04:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
I can't speak to corruption there are
 
04:39:59.570 --> 04:39:59.580 align:start position:0%
problems in all areas of our society
 
04:40:01.730 --> 04:40:01.740 align:start position:0%
but I think the system works I think it
 
04:40:07.368 --> 04:40:07.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:13.910 --> 04:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:17.208 --> 04:40:17.218 align:start position:0%
Ames oops I just want to uh thank the
 
04:40:19.670 --> 04:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
representative for um
 
04:40:22.670 --> 04:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
doing a thorough job and making it
 
04:40:24.530 --> 04:40:24.540 align:start position:0%
easier for the rest of us thank you
 
04:40:25.970 --> 04:40:25.980 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:40:28.010 --> 04:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
representative Platt yeah the one
 
04:40:30.110 --> 04:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
concern I walked away with is the public
 
04:40:32.510 --> 04:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
hearing I think you've addressed
 
04:40:35.208 --> 04:40:35.218 align:start position:0%
which was whether the penalty was
 
04:40:39.310 --> 04:40:39.320 align:start position:0%
proportionate with the level of uh a
 
04:40:44.050 --> 04:40:44.060 align:start position:0%
mildew but after all that length of time
 
04:40:46.610 --> 04:40:46.620 align:start position:0%
several notices they get and it's only
 
04:40:49.970 --> 04:40:49.980 align:start position:0%
50 bucks I don't see that at all and so
 
04:40:51.830 --> 04:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
I think this this week this bill should
 
04:40:54.708 --> 04:40:54.718 align:start position:0%
be itl period thank you thank you for
 
04:40:56.570 --> 04:40:56.580 align:start position:0%
making that point I agree that's what I
 
04:40:59.410 --> 04:40:59.420 align:start position:0%
I thought after five notices
 
04:41:03.350 --> 04:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
spanning at least 150 days a fifty
 
04:41:04.550 --> 04:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
dollar fine
 
04:41:07.310 --> 04:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
it's it's like nothing considering the
 
04:41:08.750 --> 04:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
amount of time that's been wasted
 
04:41:11.390 --> 04:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
tracking this thing and to think that
 
04:41:13.310 --> 04:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
the second level find is only a hundred
 
04:41:15.530 --> 04:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
dollars I mean if they ever got the 500
 
04:41:20.270 --> 04:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:22.070 --> 04:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
well I think it was also a discussion if
 
04:41:23.990 --> 04:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
I remember I can read my notes was the
 
04:41:26.090 --> 04:41:26.100 align:start position:0%
proportionality right losing someone's
 
04:41:28.128 --> 04:41:28.138 align:start position:0%
ability to register their vehicle is
 
04:41:30.530 --> 04:41:30.540 align:start position:0%
seems harsh was the other thing I
 
04:41:33.470 --> 04:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
remembered representative El Booker
 
04:41:36.590 --> 04:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I agree but
 
04:41:38.110 --> 04:41:38.120 align:start position:0%
um the information
 
04:41:41.570 --> 04:41:41.580 align:start position:0%
that representative orrs has gotten us
 
04:41:44.510 --> 04:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
not only talks about the fines but that
 
04:41:47.750 --> 04:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
um there are usually 10 violations that
 
04:41:49.610 --> 04:41:49.620 align:start position:0%
have happened before so we're not
 
04:41:52.010 --> 04:41:52.020 align:start position:0%
talking about oh I forgot to put my
 
04:41:56.690 --> 04:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
transponder on the car oops my bad it
 
04:41:59.448 --> 04:41:59.458 align:start position:0%
was I chose to not do it at least 10
 
04:42:02.390 --> 04:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
times uh even after I noticed it the
 
04:42:03.890 --> 04:42:03.900 align:start position:0%
first one
 
04:42:05.868 --> 04:42:05.878 align:start position:0%
um I
 
04:42:08.030 --> 04:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
you know corruption occurs everywhere in
 
04:42:10.550 --> 04:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
life you know there's always there are
 
04:42:13.670 --> 04:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
bad people in every profession I have no
 
04:42:15.830 --> 04:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
doubt about that
 
04:42:19.550 --> 04:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
I think though that this system works
 
04:42:19.560 --> 04:42:22.010 align:start position:0%
I think though that this system works
and

04:42:22.010 --> 04:42:22.020 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:42:22.020 --> 04:42:22.550 align:start position:0%
and
um

04:42:22.550 --> 04:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:25.430 --> 04:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
doing anything with this bill other than
 
04:42:31.150 --> 04:42:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:33.708 --> 04:42:33.718 align:start position:0%
representative ulery and oh I'm sorry I
 
04:42:35.448 --> 04:42:35.458 align:start position:0%
apologize representative had his hand up
 
04:42:38.330 --> 04:42:38.340 align:start position:0%
I apologize thank you um
 
04:42:41.448 --> 04:42:41.458 align:start position:0%
so the issue I just so I get it I mean
 
04:42:43.610 --> 04:42:43.620 align:start position:0%
it's not the one-time offense that
 
04:42:45.230 --> 04:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
you're going to lose your ability to
 
04:42:47.690 --> 04:42:47.700 align:start position:0%
register your cards 10.
 
04:42:50.628 --> 04:42:50.638 align:start position:0%
but you think about times 10 times back
 
04:42:53.270 --> 04:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
and forth the Callahan tunnel it's two
 
04:42:55.368 --> 04:42:55.378 align:start position:0%
dollars and five cents one way so you
 
04:42:58.850 --> 04:42:58.860 align:start position:0%
know you go back to Logan five times and
 
04:43:01.970 --> 04:43:01.980 align:start position:0%
yes there could be intentional right
 
04:43:04.550 --> 04:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
but to violate something in
 
04:43:06.110 --> 04:43:06.120 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts for twenty dollars and
 
04:43:07.788 --> 04:43:07.798 align:start position:0%
fifty cents and granted you're ignoring
 
04:43:12.110 --> 04:43:12.120 align:start position:0%
the whatever uh subsequent notices
 
04:43:15.288 --> 04:43:15.298 align:start position:0%
and losing the privilege to drive in New
 
04:43:17.390 --> 04:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for something that occurs in
 
04:43:20.448 --> 04:43:20.458 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that's my hang up on it I
 
04:43:22.430 --> 04:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think that
 
04:43:25.010 --> 04:43:25.020 align:start position:0%
were they intentional absolutely at that
 
04:43:27.110 --> 04:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
point right I mean are they ignoring the
 
04:43:29.150 --> 04:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
the fines yes
 
04:43:31.850 --> 04:43:31.860 align:start position:0%
but I the you know we're not talking
 
04:43:33.830 --> 04:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
about a public safety issue we're not
 
04:43:34.910 --> 04:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
talking about somebody drunk driving
 
04:43:37.670 --> 04:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
putting people's lives in danger we're
 
04:43:39.350 --> 04:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
skipping out on a toll that happened in
 
04:43:42.110 --> 04:43:42.120 align:start position:0%
another state that's the part that I am
 
04:43:44.510 --> 04:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
struggling with is that
 
04:43:46.310 --> 04:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
I don't think again I don't think the
 
04:43:48.470 --> 04:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
punishment fits the crime and you know
 
04:43:50.150 --> 04:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
fully admitted driving is a privilege
 
04:43:52.690 --> 04:43:52.700 align:start position:0%
you're ignoring things I just
 
04:43:54.590 --> 04:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
acknowledge everything that you're
 
04:43:54.600 --> 04:43:55.610 align:start position:0%
acknowledge everything that you're
saying

04:43:55.610 --> 04:43:55.620 align:start position:0%
saying
 
04:43:57.770 --> 04:43:57.780 align:start position:0%
but to say that it doesn't rise to the
 
04:44:00.230 --> 04:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
level of the inability to register your
 
04:44:00.240 --> 04:44:01.368 align:start position:0%
level of the inability to register your
car

04:44:01.368 --> 04:44:01.378 align:start position:0%
car
 
04:44:03.650 --> 04:44:03.660 align:start position:0%
that's where I'm stuck on and I and I I
 
04:44:05.750 --> 04:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
don't see it that way I mean I I think
 
04:44:07.368 --> 04:44:07.378 align:start position:0%
there may be some workarounds we could
 
04:44:09.230 --> 04:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
probably work through this but I I don't
 
04:44:11.448 --> 04:44:11.458 align:start position:0%
see it it rises to that level Something
 
04:44:13.190 --> 04:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
committing in something another state
 
04:44:15.410 --> 04:44:15.420 align:start position:0%
yeah so thank you very much for making
 
04:44:17.868 --> 04:44:17.878 align:start position:0%
that point uh first of all I absolutely
 
04:44:20.330 --> 04:44:20.340 align:start position:0%
agree with you uh second of all full
 
04:44:21.948 --> 04:44:21.958 align:start position:0%
disclosure we had lunch together and he
 
04:44:23.390 --> 04:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
bought my lunch so I got to be careful
 
04:44:25.910 --> 04:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
no I'm just kidding
 
04:44:27.590 --> 04:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
see you're still paying attention that's
 
04:44:31.190 --> 04:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
good so uh representative I do agree
 
04:44:34.010 --> 04:44:34.020 align:start position:0%
with you however it's not just the the
 
04:44:37.430 --> 04:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
ten tolls right in and out five times so
 
04:44:40.850 --> 04:44:40.860 align:start position:0%
after the ten tolls they got 30 days to
 
04:44:43.850 --> 04:44:43.860 align:start position:0%
respond to paying that toll then if they
 
04:44:46.070 --> 04:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
never ran another toll booth they got
 
04:44:48.350 --> 04:44:48.360 align:start position:0%
another 30 days and then if they haven't
 
04:44:50.150 --> 04:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
run another toll booth they got in their
 
04:44:51.288 --> 04:44:51.298 align:start position:0%
30 days
 
04:44:53.868 --> 04:44:53.878 align:start position:0%
and then if they haven't run yeah well
 
04:44:56.390 --> 04:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
that happens five times so all I'm
 
04:45:00.170 --> 04:45:00.180 align:start position:0%
saying is after 120 days that starts the
 
04:45:02.350 --> 04:45:02.360 align:start position:0%
clock where eventually if they don't pay
 
04:45:05.810 --> 04:45:05.820 align:start position:0%
they're going to get dinged and even
 
04:45:08.750 --> 04:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
with that if they walked in and paid
 
04:45:11.390 --> 04:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
it would go away and and the and the
 
04:45:13.070 --> 04:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
worst they would have to do is pay their
 
04:45:16.128 --> 04:45:16.138 align:start position:0%
tolls and fifty dollars and and what we
 
04:45:18.530 --> 04:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
see in our society is
 
04:45:20.628 --> 04:45:20.638 align:start position:0%
the person that's habitually picked up
 
04:45:23.750 --> 04:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
for having a headlight out or they their
 
04:45:26.810 --> 04:45:26.820 align:start position:0%
car is uninspected it's usually
 
04:45:29.270 --> 04:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
a chain of events that's going on like
 
04:45:30.948 --> 04:45:30.958 align:start position:0%
the person that was picked up just
 
04:45:33.470 --> 04:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
recently just read it and the conquered
 
04:45:35.150 --> 04:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
paper where they were picked up for
 
04:45:36.830 --> 04:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
having they were pulled over for having
 
04:45:38.990 --> 04:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
a shattered windshield and they're
 
04:45:40.850 --> 04:45:40.860 align:start position:0%
driving around well they had they didn't
 
04:45:42.830 --> 04:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
have a license I don't believe no
 
04:45:46.490 --> 04:45:46.500 align:start position:0%
suspense no uh registration yeah but
 
04:45:49.190 --> 04:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
they let me go yeah and
 
04:45:52.128 --> 04:45:52.138 align:start position:0%
charges and I'm like and all it was was
 
04:45:54.590 --> 04:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
a broken windshield so I'm saying the
 
04:45:56.990 --> 04:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
person that's going to habitually run
 
04:45:59.990 --> 04:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
these tolls and the pattern is if you
 
04:46:02.270 --> 04:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
looked at the spreadsheet in there I
 
04:46:04.430 --> 04:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
mean we're talking thousands some of
 
04:46:07.190 --> 04:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
these people I mean you had the big ones
 
04:46:08.990 --> 04:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
up and you're talking thousands of
 
04:46:12.890 --> 04:46:12.900 align:start position:0%
violations so at at what point even if
 
04:46:14.990 --> 04:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
they did it in Massachusetts I don't
 
04:46:16.910 --> 04:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
care if they did in Massachusetts New
 
04:46:18.830 --> 04:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Maine it doesn't matter to me
 
04:46:21.730 --> 04:46:21.740 align:start position:0%
I mean this is an irresponsible person
 
04:46:24.550 --> 04:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
that doesn't give a
 
04:46:27.708 --> 04:46:27.718 align:start position:0%
who thank you all right I see lots of
 
04:46:29.390 --> 04:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
hands up so what I'd like to do is start
 
04:46:31.190 --> 04:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
in this corner and work my way all the
 
04:46:32.448 --> 04:46:32.458 align:start position:0%
way around that way everyone gets a
 
04:46:34.250 --> 04:46:34.260 align:start position:0%
chance anything else representative
 
04:46:35.990 --> 04:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
right now representative fellows did you
 
04:46:38.030 --> 04:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
have anything to question or add on this
 
04:46:38.040 --> 04:46:41.510 align:start position:0%
have anything to question or add on this
discussion

04:46:41.510 --> 04:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:43.610 --> 04:46:43.620 align:start position:0%
okay I think we should I TL that bill
 
04:46:45.350 --> 04:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
okay and moving along to representative
 
04:46:46.850 --> 04:46:46.860 align:start position:0%
chamber did you have your hand up no
 
04:46:49.610 --> 04:46:49.620 align:start position:0%
representative ulery yeah what uh two
 
04:46:54.050 --> 04:46:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:57.050 --> 04:46:57.060 align:start position:0%
DLT has been before criminal justice and
 
04:47:00.110 --> 04:47:00.120 align:start position:0%
the house dot committee and before both
 
04:47:01.910 --> 04:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
of those committees where I was sitting
 
04:47:01.920 --> 04:47:02.628 align:start position:0%
of those committees where I was sitting
in

04:47:02.628 --> 04:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:47:05.150 --> 04:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
they said we're not bill collectors we
 
04:47:06.288 --> 04:47:06.298 align:start position:0%
don't have anything to do with bill
 
04:47:09.650 --> 04:47:09.660 align:start position:0%
collecting we have no system in place to
 
04:47:11.510 --> 04:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
do bill collection and now you're
 
04:47:13.430 --> 04:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
telling us they do have a system so
 
04:47:15.350 --> 04:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
either they were lying them or they're
 
04:47:18.288 --> 04:47:18.298 align:start position:0%
lying to you sir well I I think we have
 
04:47:20.570 --> 04:47:20.580 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a
 
04:47:22.788 --> 04:47:22.798 align:start position:0%
disconnect there D.O.T is not a bill
 
04:47:25.310 --> 04:47:25.320 align:start position:0%
collector DMV does collect money it's
 
04:47:29.090 --> 04:47:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:32.750 --> 04:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
okay representative uh wait Jay James
 
04:47:34.128 --> 04:47:34.138 align:start position:0%
you didn't have any representative all
 
04:47:34.138 --> 04:47:35.390 align:start position:0%
you didn't have any representative all
me

04:47:35.390 --> 04:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
me
 
04:47:38.208 --> 04:47:38.218 align:start position:0%
uh I do we're not
 
04:47:41.750 --> 04:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
just talking about people that aren't
 
04:47:44.510 --> 04:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
paying attention and don't want to pay
 
04:47:46.310 --> 04:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
in particular what we're talking about
 
04:47:50.030 --> 04:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
is the Integrity of the turnpike fund
 
04:47:53.030 --> 04:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
and the ability of the turnpike fund to
 
04:47:55.670 --> 04:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
pay for the turnpike to continue to
 
04:47:55.680 --> 04:47:56.810 align:start position:0%
pay for the turnpike to continue to
operate

04:47:56.810 --> 04:47:56.820 align:start position:0%
operate
 
04:47:58.930 --> 04:47:58.940 align:start position:0%
and if we
 
04:48:01.910 --> 04:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
if we make it known to the people of
 
04:48:04.128 --> 04:48:04.138 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that they can come here
 
04:48:07.128 --> 04:48:07.138 align:start position:0%
and go scot-free
 
04:48:09.830 --> 04:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
by not paying our tolls
 
04:48:12.110 --> 04:48:12.120 align:start position:0%
which a lot of them do come into the
 
04:48:14.930 --> 04:48:14.940 align:start position:0%
southern part of the State uh and
 
04:48:18.530 --> 04:48:18.540 align:start position:0%
through towards Maine then
 
04:48:20.690 --> 04:48:20.700 align:start position:0%
there are going to be a lot more of them
 
04:48:24.470 --> 04:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
not paying their tolls I guarantee you I
 
04:48:28.690 --> 04:48:28.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:31.070 --> 04:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
in full disclosure okay representative
 
04:48:34.490 --> 04:48:34.500 align:start position:0%
plan I think uh representative Almy just
 
04:48:36.050 --> 04:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
said what I'm going to say is different
 
04:48:39.650 --> 04:48:39.660 align:start position:0%
words but this is a three-state
 
04:48:42.470 --> 04:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
agreement reciprocal agreement so yes we
 
04:48:44.810 --> 04:48:44.820 align:start position:0%
may be suspending New Hampshire licenses
 
04:48:48.650 --> 04:48:48.660 align:start position:0%
for uh for uh tolls old in Massachusetts
 
04:48:51.850 --> 04:48:51.860 align:start position:0%
but the opposite is also true
 
04:48:54.590 --> 04:48:54.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts driver's licenses get
 
04:48:57.530 --> 04:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
suspended uh registrations get suspended
 
04:48:58.670 --> 04:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
when they're not paying New Hampshire
 
04:49:00.890 --> 04:49:00.900 align:start position:0%
tolls and I think that benefits New
 
04:49:02.448 --> 04:49:02.458 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a whole bunch more than Mass
 
04:49:04.970 --> 04:49:04.980 align:start position:0%
just because of the number of of
 
04:49:06.948 --> 04:49:06.958 align:start position:0%
southern people coming up here into our
 
04:49:08.868 --> 04:49:08.878 align:start position:0%
state you know I'm from the
 
04:49:10.910 --> 04:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts originally myself
 
04:49:13.788 --> 04:49:13.798 align:start position:0%
I moved when I was nine so forgive me
 
04:49:16.670 --> 04:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
okay other comments hands over here
 
04:49:19.208 --> 04:49:19.218 align:start position:0%
representative Doucet anything well
 
04:49:21.650 --> 04:49:21.660 align:start position:0%
representative so I have to say that uh
 
04:49:23.270 --> 04:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair but um you just
 
04:49:24.970 --> 04:49:24.980 align:start position:0%
took the words out of my mouth
 
04:49:28.670 --> 04:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
you son of a so um but I also it's more
 
04:49:29.990 --> 04:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
than a three-state agreement though I
 
04:49:30.770 --> 04:49:30.780 align:start position:0%
think it was like you know Connecticut
 
04:49:32.570 --> 04:49:32.580 align:start position:0%
Vermont Rhode Island New York and New
 
04:49:35.270 --> 04:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
Jersey that's correct so um yeah I think
 
04:49:37.250 --> 04:49:37.260 align:start position:0%
it would be the other states are
 
04:49:39.410 --> 04:49:39.420 align:start position:0%
insignificant in terms of materiality
 
04:49:42.890 --> 04:49:42.900 align:start position:0%
it's 1.3 percent I believe so but you're
 
04:49:45.530 --> 04:49:45.540 align:start position:0%
right it is the other states too and
 
04:49:46.670 --> 04:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
they're and they're listed in your
 
04:49:46.680 --> 04:49:47.690 align:start position:0%
they're and they're listed in your
paperwork

04:49:47.690 --> 04:49:47.700 align:start position:0%
paperwork
 
04:49:49.610 --> 04:49:49.620 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:49:51.410 --> 04:49:51.420 align:start position:0%
okay representatively not to put you on
 
04:49:52.430 --> 04:49:52.440 align:start position:0%

04:49:53.990 --> 04:49:54.000 align:start position:0%

04:50:11.090 --> 04:50:11.100 align:start position:0%
at our exec session
 
04:50:13.190 --> 04:50:13.200 align:start position:0%

04:50:33.470 --> 04:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
drafted up to so that we can you can
 
04:50:35.150 --> 04:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
fine tune it we can hand it off to the
