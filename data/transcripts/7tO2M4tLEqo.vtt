00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to uh open the subcommittee
 
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
work session on House Bill
 
00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:55.160 align:start position:0%
1272 um hopefully the other member of
 
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee will get here and
 
00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:57.800 align:start position:0%
direct report and he should be here at
 
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
some point but I think I think we can
 
00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
proceed um this is the bill
 
00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.509 align:start position:0%
proceed um this is the bill
on

00:12:06.509 --> 00:12:06.519 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.230 align:start position:0%
 
1272

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
1272
 
00:12:16.189 --> 00:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
and you know as I'm reading it um it
 
00:12:19.629 --> 00:12:19.639 align:start position:0%
strikes out the language um the
 
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
substantially similar as to you know
 
00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:25.839 align:start position:0%
which licenses will will uh permit you
 
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
know licensing by endorsement from and
 
00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
and as I recall some of the stuff that
 
00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
was raised last time other than you
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
know you know we just passed that we
 
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
just passed the rest proy that's there
 
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
now and they're have in the middle of Ru
 
00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.509 align:start position:0%
now and they're have in the middle of Ru
making

00:12:42.509 --> 00:12:42.519 align:start position:0%
making
 
00:12:44.829 --> 00:12:44.839 align:start position:0%
um and there were concerns about
 
00:12:47.189 --> 00:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
particular licenses in particular as I
 
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
call Realtors land
 
00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.269 align:start position:0%
call Realtors land
surveyors

00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
surveyors
 
00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:54.440 align:start position:0%
um and naturopaths because natural paths
 
00:12:56.829 --> 00:12:56.839 align:start position:0%
are very different here in and in other
 
00:12:59.350 --> 00:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
states they can do a lot more here I
 
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:00.680 align:start position:0%
spoke with director Courtney I mean I'll
 
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
let her speak for herself when she gets
 
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
here but my understanding is that
 
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
uh you know because they have a very
 
00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:08.680 align:start position:0%
different scope of practice they
 
00:13:10.189 --> 00:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be recognized as equivalent
 
00:13:13.389 --> 00:13:13.399 align:start position:0%
licenses anyway and so there wouldn't be
 
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
an option for I don't know if you can
 
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
speak to that Doug or someone someone
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:34.509 --> 00:13:34.519 align:start position:0%
just so everyone's aware when I do that
 
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
weird chair switch thing I'm actually uh
 
00:13:39.189 --> 00:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
very hard of hearing in my right ear
 
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
based on something that happened to me
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
as a kid so it's hard for me to hear out
 
00:13:44.189 --> 00:13:44.199 align:start position:0%
of my right ear so that's not just some
 
00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.870 align:start position:0%
 
thing

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
okay I'll have to remember that never
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
heard that
 
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
particular I may need
 
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
it very good comp you don't want it's
 
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
not that you don't want anyone on your
 
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
right it's a very good compensatory
 
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
strategy that you're using as an
 
00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:11.560 align:start position:0%
ideologist in the past life so yeah
 
00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
similar if someone's I have trouble
 
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:13.720 align:start position:0%
hearing this especially with the
 
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
background noise so someone speaking to
 
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:17.240 align:start position:0%
me I'll often turn and put my ear
 
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
towards their mouth it's not that I'm
 
00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:19.720 align:start position:0%
ignoring you and turning away it's just
 
00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:21.720 align:start position:0%
I want to hear what you say I get it
 
00:14:26.069 --> 00:14:26.079 align:start position:0%
yeah okay um so I guess the the F the
 
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
question I have the first one is around
 
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:32.120 align:start position:0%
it's a more the more general question is
 
00:14:35.069 --> 00:14:35.079 align:start position:0%
you know the bill talks about you know
 
00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:37.240 align:start position:0%
comparing the requirements to get a
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
license and you know what is the
 
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
standard for that how close should they
 
00:14:43.949 --> 00:14:43.959 align:start position:0%
be but what I was wondering is where is
 
00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:46.959 align:start position:0%
it defined or how is it decided whether
 
00:14:48.509 --> 00:14:48.519 align:start position:0%
the scope of practice of the two
 
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
licenses are close enough that you even
 
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
get to the point of
 
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
comparing other
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
things and is that in rules or what I
 
00:14:59.110 --> 00:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
think it's an interesting question I I
 
00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:01.720 align:start position:0%
think the language was designed to be a
 
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
little bit flexible because we have 57
 
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
professional boards and 200 different
 
00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
types of licenses and I think the
 
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
substantially similar piece is kind of a
 
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
board by board question we can go to
 
00:15:14.829 --> 00:15:14.839 align:start position:0%
them because we have to work in
 
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the boards and we're
 
00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
not cramming things through so it's sort
 
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
of we let the subject matter experts
 
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
inform sure I get that but I guess the
 
00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
subst my understanding it may be that
 
00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:28.360 align:start position:0%
I'm off on this is that the
 
00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:32.120 align:start position:0%
substantially similar is is um is
 
00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.749 align:start position:0%
substantially similar is is um is
talking

00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:33.759 align:start position:0%
talking
 
00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:37.880 align:start position:0%
about um it's the licensing requirements
 
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
so the licensing requirements have to be
 
00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:41.560 align:start position:0%
substantially similar
 
00:15:43.949 --> 00:15:43.959 align:start position:0%
now that's kind of tied to scope of
 
00:15:45.309 --> 00:15:45.319 align:start position:0%
practice you'd hope because you'd hope
 
00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
the licensing requirements would you
 
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
know make some sense with regard to what
 
00:15:54.389 --> 00:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
are you letting people do but my
 
00:15:57.509 --> 00:15:57.519 align:start position:0%
understanding um is that before you even
 
00:15:59.550 --> 00:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
get to comparing the licensing
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
requirements you have to say is this an
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
equivalent license or we'd even think
 
00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
about that and the question is how is
 
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:13.269 --> 00:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
that that has been discussion with the
 
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:15.240 align:start position:0%
boards as well and
 
00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.749 align:start position:0%
boards as well and
so

00:16:16.749 --> 00:16:16.759 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
um the conversations have been around
 
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
mainly those requirements but with
 
00:16:26.949 --> 00:16:26.959 align:start position:0%
other conversations around what other
 
00:16:28.629 --> 00:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
states currently have so we're looking
 
00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:31.839 align:start position:0%
to see what are the license types or the
 
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
titles um do they equal what we have
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire if they do not for
 
00:16:40.309 --> 00:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
example Maine has a sales agent license
 
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
and an associate broker license in New
 
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have a salesperson license
 
00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
and an associate broker license but in
 
00:16:49.749 --> 00:16:49.759 align:start position:0%
Maine the associate broker is actually a
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire salesperson so there's
 
00:16:53.949 --> 00:16:53.959 align:start position:0%
been a lot of legal review through board
 
00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
counsel discussion with the boards the
 
00:16:59.949 --> 00:16:59.959 align:start position:0%
associations to say what do these equal
 
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
what does this mean um so that way when
 
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
we then set those requirements it's an
 
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
education piece so that's where we're
 
00:17:08.309 --> 00:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
using those subject matter experts uh
 
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
and those stakeholder Partnerships that
 
00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:13.000 align:start position:0%
we currently have okay and I I assume um
 
00:17:14.789 --> 00:17:14.799 align:start position:0%
you know is there something similar
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
going on with regard to scope of
 
00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
practice to compare to see if the
 
00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:20.799 align:start position:0%
licenses I'm assuming you let me know
 
00:17:22.949 --> 00:17:22.959 align:start position:0%
that they don't have to be identical but
 
00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
presumably they have to be at least
 
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
close enough that it makes sense is that
 
00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding as well before
 
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
even getting to the board that the legal
 
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
review is being done so for example like
 
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
with natural paths um there hasn't been
 
00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of movement forward with what the
 
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
rules would be for the requirements
 
00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
around substantially similar because
 
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
we're not seeing a similar substantially
 
00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:45.640 align:start position:0%
similar scope of practice in other
 
00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
states for that so there's uh some work
 
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
that's being done prior to it even
 
00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:53.480 align:start position:0%
getting to that rulemaking process okay
 
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:55.720 align:start position:0%
so again let's see if my understanding
 
00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
is correct that that even though doesn't
 
00:18:00.909 --> 00:18:00.919 align:start position:0%
quite say it in statute you're you're
 
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
basically expanding the substantially
 
00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
similar for licensing requirements to
 
00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
say you're also going to be looking for
 
00:18:10.669 --> 00:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
at least substantially similar on scope
 
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
of practice types of issues and that I
 
00:18:14.909 --> 00:18:14.919 align:start position:0%
believe has been a business practice and
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
operationally what we have been doing um
 
00:18:21.789 --> 00:18:21.799 align:start position:0%
to do our due diligence uh not based on
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
right that I mean I'm not objecting that
 
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:26.440 align:start position:0%
makes sense but that's not in statute or
 
00:18:30.149 --> 00:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
in rules is it in rules any process okay
 
00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's explicitly stated but
 
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
it sort of has to be implicit that if
 
00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:35.720 align:start position:0%
you're going to do reciprocity it has to
 
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
be kind of one for one or at least close
 
00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:38.590 align:start position:0%
be kind of one for one or at least close
maybe

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
1.1 okay that that I mean looking
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
through this was that question came up
 
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
it's like how do you decide so thank you
 
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
for that uh represent mipi thank you Mr
 
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
chair thank you I have some
 
00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
clarification needing in this uh when
 
00:18:54.029 --> 00:18:54.039 align:start position:0%
you say
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
reciprocity um is it is there national
 
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
standards for these uh professions with
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
licensing that have a national uh
 
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
standards and subsect each state and is
 
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
there a way to compare or the Nom I mean
 
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
each title is so different that it's
 
00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:16.120 align:start position:0%
hard to
 
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
compare I think you have to go
 
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
profession by profession some
 
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
professions do have national standards
 
00:19:22.909 --> 00:19:22.919 align:start position:0%
others are state by state and there's a
 
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
website that we used what is the website
 
00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
I'm completely drawing a blank but they
 
00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:29.720 align:start position:0%
have done
 
00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
um is it clear doesn't matter there's a
 
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
website that we use uh that does these
 
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
comparisons so they'll put the nursing
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
up there and it'll just go state by
 
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
state this is what they require this
 
00:19:43.669 --> 00:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
type of education this many hours
 
00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:46.600 align:start position:0%
whatever it may be so there there are
 
00:19:50.029 --> 00:19:50.039 align:start position:0%
um resources available for us to not
 
00:19:53.149 --> 00:19:53.159 align:start position:0%
have to do on our own a you know 49
 
00:19:56.549 --> 00:19:56.559 align:start position:0%
states every time we wanna want to do
 
00:19:59.310 --> 00:19:59.320 align:start position:0%
this follow up sorry
 
00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:02.559 align:start position:0%
yeah the other piece is so although
 
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
we're doing those comparisons and I'm
 
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
sorry I it's the West Virginia research
 
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
University something or other uh but it
 
00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so we use them and clear which is
 
00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
our national regulatory membership
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
agency to assist with the comparison
 
00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
piece um the the professions that have a
 
00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
national standard or best practice are
 
00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
typically those ones that we're involved
 
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
in the compacts with or working towards
 
00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
building those compacts and so that
 
00:20:32.549 --> 00:20:32.559 align:start position:0%
would be where that National process
 
00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
would um would come in the this part
 
00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:36.799 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about reciprocity
 
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
within the state is where we are using
 
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
those resources to compare state to
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
state and if I could add to that I mean
 
00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
does that Source those sources of
 
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:47.240 align:start position:0%
information include scope of practice
 
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
info on the licenses for the um I I
 
00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
don't know if we've been provided that
 
00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:55.919 align:start position:0%
information but I do believe that those
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
research facilities uh agencies have
 
00:20:59.909 --> 00:20:59.919 align:start position:0%
looked at that but I'm not sure how
 
00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
clear that is because I was wondering
 
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
where you get how you go about DET you
 
00:21:05.549 --> 00:21:05.559 align:start position:0%
actually have to look at the detailed
 
00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
scope of practice in every state when
 
00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
you're looking at
 
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
this um representative yeah reciprocity
 
00:21:14.789 --> 00:21:14.799 align:start position:0%
is both two-way street correct um you
 
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
know I can tell you from my experience
 
00:21:19.269 --> 00:21:19.279 align:start position:0%
as a speech language pathologist I
 
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
started in Massachusetts and I had
 
00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
National American speech engering
 
00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:27.320 align:start position:0%
Association accreditation then
 
00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and then when I moved to
 
00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:32.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I had to get all over
 
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
again and continuing both States
 
00:21:40.909 --> 00:21:40.919 align:start position:0%
licensing you know I had to New
 
00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire did not take Massachusetts I
 
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
mean it's neighboring and I live in a
 
00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:48.200 align:start position:0%
border thing
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
so that kind of hurdle do you you
 
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:55.240 align:start position:0%
probably see in a lot of those and that
 
00:21:58.830 --> 00:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
to me is a Crux of the reciprocity for
 
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
our neighboring states in neighboring
 
00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
right if I can make a comment and and
 
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
they can say what whatever I I think
 
00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
calling this bill relative to occupation
 
00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:11.039 align:start position:0%
license reciprocity was unfortunate
 
00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:13.640 align:start position:0%
because I don't the issue I don't think
 
00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
is reciprocity it's it's licensing by
 
00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:20.559 align:start position:0%
endorsement um I don't think and I know
 
00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
there's this feeling of fairness but but
 
00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
really uh the benefit is not for the
 
00:22:30.029 --> 00:22:30.039 align:start position:0%
leny the benefit is to make uh more
 
00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
people available to provide um resources
 
00:22:34.269 --> 00:22:34.279 align:start position:0%
and services to the people in New
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire while still doing it safely
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
and that doesn't require you know have
 
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
forcing that requiring the other state
 
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
recognize ours first does not contribute
 
00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
to that so I think the idea of putting
 
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
getting actual reciprocity in here I
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
think is not appropriate actually I I
 
00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
agree with you uh Mr chair that was my
 
00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
point reciprocity is not you accept mine
 
00:23:03.789 --> 00:23:03.799 align:start position:0%
and I accept you and it's like helping
 
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
the workforce to straddle especially in
 
00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
the Border towns and it it was a pain to
 
00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
do two different uh paths when I was
 
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
working uh you know I would consult in
 
00:23:19.549 --> 00:23:19.559 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts bard of town but I had to
 
00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
you know it was a different cycle New
 
00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire had their own thing did not
 
00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
take any of the reciprocity whereas you
 
00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
know Mass chusetts no problem yeah so
 
00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:35.039 align:start position:0%
that is a big impediment in the whole
 
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
language I try to look through there's
 
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
really not much addressed in that way Mr
 
00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
chair that's my concern is the key thing
 
00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
is reciprocity and I think that is
 
00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:55.480 align:start position:0%
not the that's not going to alleviate
 
00:23:58.630 --> 00:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
the problem of Workforce shortage we
 
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
could if we decide to move forward with
 
00:24:02.789 --> 00:24:02.799 align:start position:0%
this bill uh the subcommittee and then
 
00:24:05.549 --> 00:24:05.559 align:start position:0%
the full committee could consider
 
00:24:09.149 --> 00:24:09.159 align:start position:0%
changing um the word reciprocity to
 
00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:10.840 align:start position:0%
licensing by endorsement or something to
 
00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:13.400 align:start position:0%
clarify that you know but it looks like
 
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
or or both um but it is interesting to
 
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
point out because line nine individuals
 
00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
seeking a license by endorsement it's
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
not in the title but it's in the
 
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
language and I think that's sort of
 
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
where we're able to you know through the
 
00:24:29.269 --> 00:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
PLC 313 make those adjustments so that
 
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
even if there isn't reciprocity working
 
00:24:32.789 --> 00:24:32.799 align:start position:0%
with the boards we can get those people
 
00:24:35.549 --> 00:24:35.559 align:start position:0%
licensed in the state okay so uh thank
 
00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:37.240 align:start position:0%
you for clarify are treating it as
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
endorsement as well because of that
 
00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
because of the word endorsement in that
 
00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:46.120 align:start position:0%
uh language okay that that helps clarify
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
I couldn't figure out thank you
 
00:24:49.389 --> 00:24:49.399 align:start position:0%
representative Schmid or did you have
 
00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:52.600 align:start position:0%
something thank you Mr chair so I I I
 
00:24:55.029 --> 00:24:55.039 align:start position:0%
think the the col we that we've been
 
00:24:57.549 --> 00:24:57.559 align:start position:0%
engaging up to this point has been
 
00:24:59.669 --> 00:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
helpful and use in terms of
 
00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
understanding kind of where we're going
 
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
uh and what our things uh what our goals
 
00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
are um and I do agree with the with the
 
00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:11.720 align:start position:0%
chair's earlier remark that it's to uh
 
00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
to make um the the situation better for
 
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire in providing
 
00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:21.919 align:start position:0%
services that they can't get because you
 
00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
got you know uh musical chairs as people
 
00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
are being left out because we don't have
 
00:25:29.789 --> 00:25:29.799 align:start position:0%
enough people of our own to take care of
 
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
the thing uh and and that is that is
 
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely in the interest of the
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire the and I I
 
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
want to add to that that that the to my
 
00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:43.480 align:start position:0%
way of thinking that one of the central
 
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
aspects of Licensing is the idea of
 
00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
protecting the public and not letting
 
00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
people loose on them that are untrained
 
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
I mean the situation in M Missouri for
 
00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
example as I understand it is they ain't
 
00:26:00.269 --> 00:26:00.279 align:start position:0%
got Li lensing in Missouri so how do
 
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
they have any idea what people are
 
00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:05.480 align:start position:0%
bringing to the table before they're
 
00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:07.480 align:start position:0%
it's if it's all buyer
 
00:26:09.789 --> 00:26:09.799 align:start position:0%
beware I don't that's not the way New
 
00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:11.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has structured its whole
 
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
situation for basically the the
 
00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:16.120 align:start position:0%
certainly the 20 years I've been here
 
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
but also I think that the structure that
 
00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
exists clearly is is has the same idea
 
00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
protecting the public and it's been that
 
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
way for probably a hundred years um so
 
00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:29.480 align:start position:0%
then it becomes a question of as you
 
00:26:34.149 --> 00:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
said earlier Doug um that that uh you're
 
00:26:36.149 --> 00:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
going to have to go profession by
 
00:26:39.549 --> 00:26:39.559 align:start position:0%
profession because there's some things
 
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
where if it doesn't go exactly right
 
00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
there's no problem uh if you're dealing
 
00:26:47.669 --> 00:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
with somebody's Health people putting
 
00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:50.360 align:start position:0%
hands on somebody's body in some fashion
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
for some service then you got to be sure
 
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
that you have the criminal background
 
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
checks and all those things for
 
00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:58.360 align:start position:0%
protecting the public so you have to to
 
00:27:02.669 --> 00:27:02.679 align:start position:0%
do it profession by profession and one
 
00:27:05.789 --> 00:27:05.799 align:start position:0%
final thing in that is that a body is a
 
00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
body in Arizona or in New Hampshire uh
 
00:27:11.149 --> 00:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
but an architect for example who's used
 
00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:14.440 align:start position:0%
to designing structures for Arizona may
 
00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
find some's different in in New
 
00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:20.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from Arizona and vice versa so
 
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
then you have to go profession by
 
00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:25.480 align:start position:0%
profession but uh you know uh and so I
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
think we're on we're we're heading in
 
00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
the right direction
 
00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
and so it's more than just reciprocity
 
00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
you you recognize me I recognize you
 
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
what is the profession and what are the
 
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
ramifications of that profession for
 
00:27:43.149 --> 00:27:43.159 align:start position:0%
providing the service safely and
 
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
beneficially to our people
 
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
here representative Brown had a question
 
00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr
 
00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
chair so looking back through my notes
 
00:27:56.669 --> 00:27:56.679 align:start position:0%
from the first hearing there was a lot
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
of opposition to this the New Hampshire
 
00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:02.120 align:start position:0%
Association Realtors the uh licensed
 
00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
electricians they have reciprocity with
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
21 States but they oppose this as
 
00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
written mechanical licensing Chief uh
 
00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:10.200 align:start position:0%
the board of
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
accountancy um and a number of others
 
00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:17.720 align:start position:0%
so because of that I want to be really
 
00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:19.960 align:start position:0%
clear that I know what I'm doing here
 
00:28:22.509 --> 00:28:22.519 align:start position:0%
which and I will apologize
 
00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
to my much more knowledgeable fellow
 
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:28.120 align:start position:0%
committee members uh as this is this is
 
00:28:29.549 --> 00:28:29.559 align:start position:0%
is new to me this
 
00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:31.919 align:start position:0%
year don't don't worry we were all new
 
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
at some point thank you very much Mr
 
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
chair I appreciate that um it would I be
 
00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
accurate in translating this into saying
 
00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
that licensing requirements include
 
00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
scopo practice is there are we defining
 
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
that that way licensing you want to get
 
00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:51.640 align:start position:0%
a license in New Hampshire here's your
 
00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:53.320 align:start position:0%
requirements and that would include
 
00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
scoper practice or am I wrong I wouldn't
 
00:28:58.149 --> 00:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
say that's the case I think the
 
00:29:00.029 --> 00:29:00.039 align:start position:0%
licensing requirements are more the
 
00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:01.919 align:start position:0%
training the
 
00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
experience the education those types of
 
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
things that you need to obtain licensure
 
00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
and then once you have that license the
 
00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
scope of practice sets the parameters on
 
00:29:13.549 --> 00:29:13.559 align:start position:0%
what you're able to do with that license
 
00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
okay all right um follow thank you for
 
00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
that followup yep having although I'm
 
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
not experienced in this I did serve on
 
00:29:23.509 --> 00:29:23.519 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Dees Board of
 
00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:25.240 align:start position:0%
certification for wastewater treatment
 
00:29:28.389 --> 00:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
plan operators for a number of years and
 
00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:31.919 align:start position:0%
are are the way that we we compared a
 
00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:34.360 align:start position:0%
grade six from State X to a grade four
 
00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
in New
 
00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:39.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Not only was education and
 
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:41.240 align:start position:0%
experience but it was also scoper
 
00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
practice so we had this conversation as
 
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
a whole when we sat in committee and
 
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
that resolved that now under rules is
 
00:29:52.909 --> 00:29:52.919 align:start position:0%
that what oplc is going to be
 
00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
doing I think that goes back to
 
00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:57.039 align:start position:0%
representative lakes's question earlier
 
00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
sort of in that first instance when we
 
00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:01.480 align:start position:0%
do a license by license comparison that
 
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
would be where we would take a look at
 
00:30:04.669 --> 00:30:04.679 align:start position:0%
the scope of
 
00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
practice and one more followup follow up
 
00:30:10.509 --> 00:30:10.519 align:start position:0%
and I'm not supposed to ask you of your
 
00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:13.720 align:start position:0%
opinion do you feel that that process
 
00:30:16.389 --> 00:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
answers some of the questions some of
 
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
the the hesitation from the boards on
 
00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:22.310 align:start position:0%
the the hesitation from the boards on
this

00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
bill I know that's a that's a broad
 
00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
question but no that's I'm not sure how
 
00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:29.480 align:start position:0%
much that question about scope of
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
practice relates to this the proposed
 
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
language in this bill because I think
 
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
the proposed language in this bill is is
 
00:30:40.389 --> 00:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
saying that there does not if we remove
 
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
the substantially similar requirements
 
00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
for licensing it lends more towards um
 
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
what was initially what was said prior
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
of the you just need to have a license
 
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
in this state to be able to come to New
 
00:30:53.669 --> 00:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it doesn't matter what their
 
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
requirements are um which also would
 
00:31:00.669 --> 00:31:00.679 align:start position:0%
effect how we operationalize that by
 
00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
looking at the scope of practice and it
 
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
would not necessarily require us to do
 
00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
that either that's actually useful I
 
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
hadn't thought about so so your take is
 
00:31:13.389 --> 00:31:13.399 align:start position:0%
that if we got rid of the substantially
 
00:31:15.389 --> 00:31:15.399 align:start position:0%
similar it would remove or at least
 
00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:18.559 align:start position:0%
limit the the uh look into the relative
 
00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
scope of practice I mean I think they
 
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
have to have
 
00:31:24.909 --> 00:31:24.919 align:start position:0%
somewh and I don't know if this is a
 
00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:28.120 align:start position:0%
question you can answer but um I I don't
 
00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:29.960 align:start position:0%
know if it would I and I haven't thought
 
00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:32.200 align:start position:0%
about this but my my initial reaction is
 
00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:34.559 align:start position:0%
that if we're still the requirement
 
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
would still be if you're licensed in a
 
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
state to do X and you're trying to do X
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
in this state okay we would still have
 
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
to make that comparison in some regard
 
00:31:46.629 --> 00:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
right so I even if regardless of this
 
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
language I think that consp comparison
 
00:31:51.149 --> 00:31:51.159 align:start position:0%
would still have to happen Okay but I
 
00:31:52.509 --> 00:31:52.519 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know I haven't thought
 
00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
about it long okay and just
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh oh just just not directly on this
 
00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:00.679 align:start position:0%
bill but uh you know I don't know it
 
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
might make sense it's more a comment on
 
00:32:03.789 --> 00:32:03.799 align:start position:0%
the rul making to actually put something
 
00:32:06.389 --> 00:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
in the rules about how you're deciding
 
00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:08.120 align:start position:0%
whether or not whether the two are even
 
00:32:09.629 --> 00:32:09.639 align:start position:0%
comparable and you're going to do this
 
00:32:11.789 --> 00:32:11.799 align:start position:0%
but I don't have a strong feeling on it
 
00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:13.720 align:start position:0%
but it might would have clarified things
 
00:32:15.789 --> 00:32:15.799 align:start position:0%
when I was looking at it represent M py
 
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair um another
 
00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
question um this is not excluding
 
00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
Licensing in New Hampshire you have to
 
00:32:26.789 --> 00:32:26.799 align:start position:0%
have licensing in Massachusetts for
 
00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
example in apply for licensing it's just
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
the reciprocity is what the you know
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
educational needs or continuing
 
00:32:38.629 --> 00:32:38.639 align:start position:0%
education some of it you know if we do
 
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
it in one state we don't have to do it
 
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
again in another state to keep that
 
00:32:47.789 --> 00:32:47.799 align:start position:0%
continuity right so speak follow another
 
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
followup followup yeah so in a border
 
00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:54.440 align:start position:0%
towns you know it was brought to my
 
00:32:57.029 --> 00:32:57.039 align:start position:0%
attention that Physicians who see
 
00:32:59.629 --> 00:32:59.639 align:start position:0%
patients from Massachusetts there's no
 
00:33:01.789 --> 00:33:01.799 align:start position:0%
problem with insurance covering their
 
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
visit to their Physician's office in
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
Nashua they are coming from
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and but the physicians in
 
00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:17.480 align:start position:0%
now New Hampshire cannot do tele
 
00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:20.519 align:start position:0%
medicine to their patients in
 
00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:23.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts because there is no
 
00:33:27.789 --> 00:33:27.799 align:start position:0%
reciprocity in their practice which C
 
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
kind of makes it similar to what I faced
 
00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
as a speech language
 
00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
pathologist you know would this address
 
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
some of it because Massachusetts takes
 
00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
National thing New Hampshire does not
 
00:33:46.509 --> 00:33:46.519 align:start position:0%
participate in the federal registry or
 
00:33:49.149 --> 00:33:49.159 align:start position:0%
federal licensing
 
00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:51.880 align:start position:0%
for medical not in
 
00:33:55.389 --> 00:33:55.399 align:start position:0%
this uh thing so there's lot of little
 
00:33:55.399 --> 00:33:58.029 align:start position:0%
this uh thing so there's lot of little
gaps

00:33:58.029 --> 00:33:58.039 align:start position:0%
gaps
 
00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
so it's creating problem for people in
 
00:34:01.799 --> 00:34:04.389 align:start position:0%
so it's creating problem for people in
border

00:34:04.389 --> 00:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:08.069 --> 00:34:08.079 align:start position:0%
cities the the way that we're I think
 
00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:11.720 align:start position:0%
and Doug can um follow up but if this
 
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
was to pass with this language my
 
00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:15.800 align:start position:0%
understanding is you would still have
 
00:34:17.869 --> 00:34:17.879 align:start position:0%
that same issue if they didn't apply
 
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
this is still saying that they have to
 
00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:22.520 align:start position:0%
apply for lure in New Hampshire so even
 
00:34:23.829 --> 00:34:23.839 align:start position:0%
if you have your license in
 
00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts you would still have to
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
apply for that license here in New
 
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it sounds like this this
 
00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:31.399 align:start position:0%
particular issue isn't it it's Mass
 
00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:33.320 align:start position:0%
actually that's preventing her from
 
00:34:35.149 --> 00:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
practicing it's not New Hampshire right
 
00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:37.240 align:start position:0%
so it would be a mass thing Mass would
 
00:34:41.149 --> 00:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
say Mass would say yes we can you know
 
00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
they don't object if the insurance is
 
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
willing to pay but New Hampshire
 
00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
prohibits them from PR practicing tele
 
00:34:52.669 --> 00:34:52.679 align:start position:0%
medicine going this way going that way
 
00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
so because there's you know the
 
00:34:59.109 --> 00:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
standards here is higher whatever it is
 
00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
because we don't participate in the same
 
00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:05.240 align:start position:0%
Federal registry and there are some
 
00:35:06.829 --> 00:35:06.839 align:start position:0%
conversations with many of our medical
 
00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:09.160 align:start position:0%
boards medicine mental health um
 
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
psychology around teleah health and so
 
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
that may be a conversation on the rule
 
00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:15.880 align:start position:0%
making around teleah health because
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
there are some caveats to that okay just
 
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
to clarify my thought uh Mr chair is I'm
 
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
very aware I mean I'm all for you have
 
00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
to be licensed in both States in order
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
to practice it's just that if one state
 
00:35:35.589 --> 00:35:35.599 align:start position:0%
saying you're qualified you can do it
 
00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
why do I have to do the whole set again
 
00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
for and New Hampshire that's the biggest
 
00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
challenge I feel in New
 
00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:45.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that is to me is the
 
00:35:47.589 --> 00:35:47.599 align:start position:0%
reciprocity representer
 
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you Mr chair so coming back
 
00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.390 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you Mr chair so coming back
to

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
you if you're licensed in New Hampshire
 
00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
and you want to do tella Health in Mass
 
00:35:59.230 --> 00:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
it it can't be New Hampshire that's
 
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:00.640 align:start position:0%
saying you can't do that it has to be
 
00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.109 align:start position:0%
saying you can't do that it has to be
Massachusetts

00:36:02.109 --> 00:36:02.119 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
right no because you're licensed in your
 
00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
practice scop of practice in New
 
00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:10.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you're seeing the patient from
 
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts here it's okay for you to
 
00:36:16.309 --> 00:36:16.319 align:start position:0%
see that in person but if the same
 
00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:19.640 align:start position:0%
patient is across the border New
 
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire board says I would suggest
 
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
taking this offline it's an interesting
 
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:31.960 align:start position:0%
I I I I don't think it does it would be
 
00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
an issue if the if there was a doctor
 
00:36:36.910 --> 00:36:36.920 align:start position:0%
that came up from Massachusetts to here
 
00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:38.440 align:start position:0%
but this doesn't really deal with teleah
 
00:36:40.829 --> 00:36:40.839 align:start position:0%
health which is why I suggest taking it
 
00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
um so kind of a question with the
 
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
committee is what do we want to do with
 
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
this um I don't have a set view on that
 
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
at this point I mean I certainly support
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
much have a comment sure can I one more
 
00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
thing that this is a fairly new bill as
 
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
is and the office was tasked with
 
00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
drafting rules we have one set of
 
00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
interum rules in place um but we have a
 
00:37:08.589 --> 00:37:08.599 align:start position:0%
public hearing on the PLC 313 stemming
 
00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
from this uh statute on I believe March
 
00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:13.240 align:start position:0%
7th so we haven't even had an
 
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity yet right I was actually
 
00:37:16.349 --> 00:37:16.359 align:start position:0%
just going to make that comment okay I
 
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
just wanted to yeah and and uh
 
00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
so we got sent I don't know if anybody
 
00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
had a chance to look at I skimmed
 
00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:25.400 align:start position:0%
through them you know there are proposed
 
00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
rules on reciprocity um um you're not
 
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
done with all the professions yet is
 
00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
that correct or are they all cover no
 
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
not yet it it we're doing it rolling so
 
00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
the the rules we did propose I think the
 
00:37:42.109 --> 00:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
interim rules had 12 or 15 of the boards
 
00:37:44.309 --> 00:37:44.319 align:start position:0%
covered and the the new proposed rules
 
00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:45.800 align:start position:0%
have significantly more but I don't have
 
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
a number off the top of my head so so
 
00:37:49.589 --> 00:37:49.599 align:start position:0%
given that um and I know there is some
 
00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
concern that um there you know there
 
00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:54.200 align:start position:0%
appears to be in the current law that
 
00:37:56.309 --> 00:37:56.319 align:start position:0%
was put in place last year a lot of
 
00:37:58.270 --> 00:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
discretion the executive director and
 
00:37:59.829 --> 00:37:59.839 align:start position:0%
while we may believe that director
 
00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
Courtney is going to do the right thing
 
00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:03.560 align:start position:0%
you know can't predict who's going to be
 
00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:05.240 align:start position:0%
there in the future so I that's part of
 
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
I think the motivation behind this
 
00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
however you know once it's in rules it's
 
00:38:13.069 --> 00:38:13.079 align:start position:0%
got some inertia so what I was wondering
 
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
is do we really need this
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
now um you know let the blw from last
 
00:38:22.309 --> 00:38:22.319 align:start position:0%
year sort out let them finish the ru
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
making and then if in the future there
 
00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
are um
 
00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:30.280 align:start position:0%
problems or concerns saying well they're
 
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
really too restrictive and there we
 
00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
should you know there should be things
 
00:38:36.309 --> 00:38:36.319 align:start position:0%
that reply by
 
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
endorsement um that uh I see you um that
 
00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:42.680 align:start position:0%
um you know where we should be
 
00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:44.440 align:start position:0%
recognizing we're not I mean the
 
00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:47.480 align:start position:0%
legislature can step in and fix it at
 
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
that point um so just thoughts on that
 
00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
I'll get to you with Mama but
 
00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.309 align:start position:0%
I'll get to you with Mama but
representative

00:38:53.309 --> 00:38:53.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:38:56.910 --> 00:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
G thank you Mr chair I've been listening
 
00:38:59.069 --> 00:38:59.079 align:start position:0%
and trying and I came to the exact same
 
00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
conclusion is that this my question is
 
00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
can't this be handled through
 
00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:08.440 align:start position:0%
rules and so I really like what you're
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
saying is that let's listen to let's
 
00:39:13.589 --> 00:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
finish the rul making process that we're
 
00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
engaged in hear what those rules are and
 
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
and I'm ready to make a motion to I on
 
00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:21.880 align:start position:0%
this um okay is there a
 
00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:24.440 align:start position:0%
second yeah then we'll have discussion
 
00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
yeah so I I agree I think you seconding
 
00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:29.720 align:start position:0%
motion correct I can second the motion
 
00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
and I think we can uh all agree or at
 
00:39:35.589 --> 00:39:35.599 align:start position:0%
least in my mind it's more clear it's
 
00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
too premature to change everything all
 
00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
at once before knowing what the big
 
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
changes rul making hasn't happened this
 
00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
year which came last year and so you
 
00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
don't know what is affecting in a
 
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
positive way what's not affecting before
 
00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
we get one Clarity that was a huge
 
00:39:57.950 --> 00:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
change from oplc
 
00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:03.560 align:start position:0%
board regulatory boards to divide the
 
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:11.560 align:start position:0%
brief man we're just running a little
 
00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:13.430 align:start position:0%
brief man we're just running a little
late

00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
late
 
00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:17.480 align:start position:0%
um the point I wanted to make is uh
 
00:40:20.109 --> 00:40:20.119 align:start position:0%
director Courtney is a significant
 
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
player in all of this can we find out
 
00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
whether she's going to be here or not
 
00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:25.480 align:start position:0%
because but if we're if we're moving in
 
00:40:28.109 --> 00:40:28.119 align:start position:0%
the direction of itl already then it's
 
00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
not so crucial but otherwise can we find
 
00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
out whether she's going to make it we
 
00:40:35.309 --> 00:40:35.319 align:start position:0%
can't commit her to no but I'm just
 
00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
trying to find out I mean I joked with
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
her that uh that she she's not permitted
 
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
to uh either resign or
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
die but unfortunately that's not
 
00:40:46.309 --> 00:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
enforcable if we're going in the
 
00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
direction of itl anyway then I think
 
00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:51.800 align:start position:0%
we're we're not in as much of a bind to
 
00:40:54.109 --> 00:40:54.119 align:start position:0%
have her here so thank you any any other
 
00:40:57.150 --> 00:40:57.160 align:start position:0%
discussion on the represent Brown thank
 
00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:01.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I will try to be brief y
 
00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
reciprocity now am I correct in saying
 
00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
that we have a licensing by endorsement
 
00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:15.640 align:start position:0%
process that was um the Sor Authority
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
was given to the office after the last
 
00:41:19.829 --> 00:41:19.839 align:start position:0%
legislative session and we've started
 
00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
developing rules with the boards and
 
00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
commissions as noted in the previous
 
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
bill with their consultation so we have
 
00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:27.750 align:start position:0%
bill with their consultation so we have
some

00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:31.240 align:start position:0%
um rules that have been uh adop been uh
 
00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
interim rules that have been adopted and
 
00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
we have another public hearing coming up
 
00:41:37.589 --> 00:41:37.599 align:start position:0%
in March so we are currently F starting
 
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
that process for the licensing by
 
00:41:42.069 --> 00:41:42.079 align:start position:0%
endorsement and followup followup is
 
00:41:44.589 --> 00:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
that eventually going to get to a point
 
00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
out uh through the rules where someone
 
00:41:52.349 --> 00:41:52.359 align:start position:0%
can say to a PLC I have a license here
 
00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
in X state for this and you
 
00:41:57.470 --> 00:41:57.480 align:start position:0%
automatically say here's your license
 
00:41:58.990 --> 00:41:59.000 align:start position:0%
for that in New Hampshire without any
 
00:42:01.109 --> 00:42:01.119 align:start position:0%
conversation that's reciprocity to me
 
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
actually we right if I I can we were
 
00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
emailed um their proposed the interim
 
00:42:09.309 --> 00:42:09.319 align:start position:0%
rules um on Reciprocity for the
 
00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:10.520 align:start position:0%
professions that they've already
 
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
reviewed and you can look through it it
 
00:42:13.829 --> 00:42:13.839 align:start position:0%
is asking for more information that I
 
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
would have expected but we don't need to
 
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
get into the details of of commenting on
 
00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:19.640 align:start position:0%
on the rul making but it didn't look
 
00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
unreasonable so but if you want to look
 
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
at the details and my take my thing is
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
this if we itl it um you know this is is
 
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
the end of the second year and so it it
 
00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
we we're not going to bind what's going
 
00:42:34.309 --> 00:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
to happen the new legislature next year
 
00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
so you know if it turns out that the
 
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
legislature or anybody any member who
 
00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:42.440 align:start position:0%
wants to put a bill in thinks that the
 
00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:44.200 align:start position:0%
rules are not appropriate or they're not
 
00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
being executed properly they can put a
 
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
bill like this or whatever in at that
 
00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
time to fix it but yeah I'm I'm on R ony
 
00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
and then G um thank you Mr chair so the
 
00:42:58.950 --> 00:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh licensing by endorsement is already
 
00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:03.160 align:start position:0%
it was in last year's thing so this is
 
00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:06.200 align:start position:0%
not necessary this bill is not necessary
 
00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:09.800 align:start position:0%
for that process to be unfolded correct
 
00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
correct okay you're asking them for an
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
opinion though so you got to watch out I
 
00:43:17.109 --> 00:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
took the question to be clear as do we
 
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
need this to have that process right
 
00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:22.520 align:start position:0%
take place yeah we have a bunch of new
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
people on the committee we we we slogged
 
00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:27.640 align:start position:0%
through all of this last year and uh
 
00:43:29.349 --> 00:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
and yeah that was put in place last but
 
00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
it was very clear Mr chair when they
 
00:43:34.349 --> 00:43:34.359 align:start position:0%
said that endorsement was so that makes
 
00:43:36.309 --> 00:43:36.319 align:start position:0%
me feel good okay yeah great
 
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
representative Gould I was just going to
 
00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
say hopefully if if um there are
 
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
Representatives who are concerned about
 
00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:45.800 align:start position:0%
this the outcome of the rules making
 
00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:47.720 align:start position:0%
they attend some of the public hearings
 
00:43:50.829 --> 00:43:50.839 align:start position:0%
and give their input okay um on the
 
00:43:52.549 --> 00:43:52.559 align:start position:0%
subcomment any further discussion or can
 
00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:55.960 align:start position:0%

00:43:58.510 --> 00:43:58.520 align:start position:0%
is itl on House Bill
 
00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:03.920 align:start position:0%

1272 and I'm going to open the the work
 
00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill
 
00:44:16.109 --> 00:44:16.119 align:start position:0%
1410 and give me a moment to get
 
00:44:16.119 --> 00:44:18.950 align:start position:0%
1410 and give me a moment to get
organized

00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:23.349 align:start position:0%
 
here

00:44:23.349 --> 00:44:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:25.549 --> 00:44:25.559 align:start position:0%
yeah when do you have to
 
00:44:29.349 --> 00:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:35.349 --> 00:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
well we we'll try and I'm hoping we can
 
00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
do that although we'll see yeah that's
 
00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:39.800 align:start position:0%
how much people want to talk and
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
questions and all that which I don't
 
00:44:44.829 --> 00:44:44.839 align:start position:0%
want to limit but right okay
 
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:48.640 align:start position:0%
so this ask a question certainly for
 
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
oplc if if you could come up with those
 
00:44:52.069 --> 00:44:52.079 align:start position:0%
two websites that you mentioned I was
 
00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
trying to look up clear and I couldn't
 
00:44:54.829 --> 00:44:54.839 align:start position:0%
find anything could you email us to us
 
00:44:58.150 --> 00:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
that would be great thank you okay just
 
00:44:59.549 --> 00:44:59.559 align:start position:0%
trying to get this I will say I'm not
 
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
sure if you're going to be able to get
 
00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:02.440 align:start position:0%
the information I think there a
 
00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
subscription type is that true so I'm
 
00:45:06.549 --> 00:45:06.559 align:start position:0%
not sure you'll be able to but I can we
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
can at least tell you what they are
 
00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:10.870 align:start position:0%
can at least tell you what they are
thank

00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
you okay um I sent out two emails to
 
00:45:19.109 --> 00:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
everybody one was um my notes on what we
 
00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
chose to do at the last meeting and we
 
00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:24.760 align:start position:0%
went through M most of the bill and
 
00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
actually took votes on what to do on all
 
00:45:29.069 --> 00:45:29.079 align:start position:0%
you know a bunch of the sections we were
 
00:45:29.079 --> 00:45:30.309 align:start position:0%
you know a bunch of the sections we were
left

00:45:30.309 --> 00:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
left
 
00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:33.880 align:start position:0%
with um dealing with some of the section
 
00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
you know the repeals in in uh section 10
 
00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
and we had asked uh Mr asout to to
 
00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
provide some input on that which he did
 
00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:47.720 align:start position:0%
and then I sent an email out kind of so
 
00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully making it clear and
 
00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
summarizing it um and I sent that email
 
00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
out and so what I would suggest
 
00:46:00.349 --> 00:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
is we can go through that
 
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
list um you know the email I sent out if
 
00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:04.270 align:start position:0%
list um you know the email I sent out if
that's

00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:04.280 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
okay and we can talk about um the pieces
 
00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:12.079 align:start position:0%
and and and then we can we can vote on
 
00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
pieces um and then once we're done I'll
 
00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:18.119 align:start position:0%
take everything we've decided on both
 
00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
days and go down to oplc and dump it all
 
00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
on them to turn it into one Amendment
 
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
okay so does everyone have it was the
 
00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
email I sent out on the 29 9th at I
 
00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:30.280 align:start position:0%
think it's 5:41
 
00:46:33.309 --> 00:46:33.319 align:start position:0%
p.m what's that I don't
 
00:46:33.319 --> 00:46:36.790 align:start position:0%
p.m what's that I don't
have

00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:51.589 --> 00:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
be right but this that's the minutes and
 
00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:54.200 align:start position:0%
we um I mean if anyone as I put in the
 
00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
email if anyone thinks I made a mistake
 
00:46:59.870 --> 00:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
please bring it up on that one um the
 
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
29th yeah the 29th one which is um where
 
00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
to go with the last part we didn't deal
 
00:47:09.549 --> 00:47:09.559 align:start position:0%
with then and this is um this is all I
 
00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:12.280 align:start position:0%
believe on pages six and a little bit on
 
00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
seven of hb1
 
00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:23.670 align:start position:0%
seven of hb1
1410

00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
so that's the no u but you can we can
 
00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
kind of share this if you want if you
 
00:47:31.309 --> 00:47:31.319 align:start position:0%
don't have it I yeah I could I didn't
 
00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
print extra copies of this
 
00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
one no no at this point
 
00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:43.240 align:start position:0%
um yeah I don't have but I I can I can
 
00:47:47.549 --> 00:47:47.559 align:start position:0%
talk it through that works um okay so
 
00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
the first part is on Section 10 page six
 
00:47:55.309 --> 00:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
it's lines 27 and 28
 
00:47:58.910 --> 00:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
so um this one you know
 
00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:00.760 align:start position:0%
what actually let me get a piece of
 
00:48:02.309 --> 00:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
paper so I can actually go like last
 
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
time do so I got them I got a stack of
 
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:11.800 align:start position:0%
these and one actually it's this one
 
00:48:13.069 --> 00:48:13.079 align:start position:0%
because I knew I was going to have to do
 
00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
this all
 
00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:17.960 align:start position:0%
right um I just have one clarification
 
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
with that one so um that is we are going
 
00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:23.069 align:start position:0%
with that one so um that is we are going
to

00:48:23.069 --> 00:48:23.079 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
repeal medical technicians no I that's
 
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
going to keep it at that we decided last
 
00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
time that's those lines are not MediCal
 
00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
oh actually hang on a minute 20 no I'm
 
00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:37.480 align:start position:0%
saying we we already did that that's in
 
00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
the minutes from the last meeting yeah I
 
00:48:40.829 --> 00:48:40.839 align:start position:0%
said we were going to remove that from
 
00:48:42.829 --> 00:48:42.839 align:start position:0%
the bill so we would leave the medical
 
00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
technicians in
 
00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:47.240 align:start position:0%
statute I believe okay so I I wrote it
 
00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:49.960 align:start position:0%
as keypad and then I wrote it as removed
 
00:48:52.589 --> 00:48:52.599 align:start position:0%
so my own notes is confusing to me yeah
 
00:48:56.030 --> 00:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
let me so that was lines 22 it's already
 
00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:57.470 align:start position:0%
let me so that was lines 22 it's already
24

00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
24
 
00:48:58.910 --> 00:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
right and I
 
00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
think then we said remove from the
 
00:49:05.829 --> 00:49:05.839 align:start position:0%
repeal list 25 and 26 that's the
 
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
Radiology let me find out don't repeal
 
00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:14.920 align:start position:0%
it yeah 20 I have removing 25 through
 
00:49:19.069 --> 00:49:19.079 align:start position:0%
26 um which is um the medical imaging
 
00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
ones right and the and the radi um yeah
 
00:49:23.829 --> 00:49:23.839 align:start position:0%
Radiology Radiology so if you look at
 
00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:27.400 align:start position:0%
the email I sent on the 26th um second
 
00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:30.680 align:start position:0%
it second Bullet From The Bottom it says
 
00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:33.640 align:start position:0%
page 10 section 10 Page 6 lines 25
 
00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:36.200 align:start position:0%
through 26 motion remove these lines
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
from the bill keeping the licensing of
 
00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:40.280 align:start position:0%
medical and radiation therapy
 
00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:42.200 align:start position:0%
representative G made the motion Bailey
 
00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
seconded and you know we had the vote
 
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
and it passed so so we're going to leave
 
00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:48.440 align:start position:0%
that in there that's okay stays in
 
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
statute correct that stays in statute we
 
00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
had all this confusion we're moving for
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
the bill statute and all that so yeah
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
yeah so that is that is what we Ed and
 
00:49:59.430 --> 00:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
that's can you just clarify for me then
 
00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:01.480 align:start position:0%
the one two and
 
00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:05.960 align:start position:0%
three on for the this is from 10 L you
 
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
know line 22 23
 
00:50:13.109 --> 00:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
24 that will be repealed from the
 
00:50:16.829 --> 00:50:16.839 align:start position:0%
statue um the medical technician that we
 
00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:21.640 align:start position:0%
V let go sure I'm speaking correctly um
 
00:50:24.069 --> 00:50:24.079 align:start position:0%
not 22 that's different that's medical
 
00:50:27.069 --> 00:50:27.079 align:start position:0%
technicians that's not the rate the the
 
00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
radiation and IM not the Imaging people
 
00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
correct no that I'm clear with the
 
00:50:35.549 --> 00:50:35.559 align:start position:0%
Imaging which is 25 26 is fine we are uh
 
00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
removing it from the repeal list right
 
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
so it's staying in the stat and we
 
00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
looked at 22 and 23 I believe and 24 all
 
00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
three are medical
 
00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
technicians I think we said we were
 
00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:51.880 align:start position:0%
going to strike that from the bill from
 
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
the bill because medical technicians no
 
00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
I no no I had that's keep it that's
 
00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:00.440 align:start position:0%
going to be repealed right and actually
 
00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
I may have made an error that in my in
 
00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
in my
 
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
motion okay no this is and it should be
 
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
leave I think and you correct me if if
 
00:51:14.829 --> 00:51:14.839 align:start position:0%
your memory is different than so yeah
 
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
with with what I sent in the email
 
00:51:20.069 --> 00:51:20.079 align:start position:0%
actually on the 26th and that that's one
 
00:51:22.789 --> 00:51:22.799 align:start position:0%
two third from the bottom is actually an
 
00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:25.400 align:start position:0%
error um and if anyone disagrees that's
 
00:51:28.109 --> 00:51:28.119 align:start position:0%
fine that should have been leave this
 
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
section in the bill as is for lines 22
 
00:51:33.549 --> 00:51:33.559 align:start position:0%
through 24 I made the motion I wouldn't
 
00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:34.559 align:start position:0%
have it was something different and
 
00:51:36.549 --> 00:51:36.559 align:start position:0%
representative G seconded and it was
 
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
unanimous oh it was leave it so I okay I
 
00:51:42.789 --> 00:51:42.799 align:start position:0%
I I made an error in my email of the 26
 
00:51:44.829 --> 00:51:44.839 align:start position:0%
and thank you for catching yeah that is
 
00:51:47.230 --> 00:51:47.240 align:start position:0%
we we are leaving it yeah actually it
 
00:51:48.589 --> 00:51:48.599 align:start position:0%
says remove these lines from the bill
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
but then it says in my email eliminating
 
00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
the registration medical technicians
 
00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
which that doesn't you know it's in
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
Conflict so the first part was um
 
00:51:59.549 --> 00:51:59.559 align:start position:0%
correct leave the section in the bill as
 
00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
is but thank you for
 
00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:04.230 align:start position:0%
is but thank you for
that

00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:06.069 align:start position:0%
that
okay

00:52:06.069 --> 00:52:06.079 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
certainly on the medical technicians one
 
00:52:12.309 --> 00:52:12.319 align:start position:0%
and I don't recall that we had this
 
00:52:14.789 --> 00:52:14.799 align:start position:0%
conversation but I talked to Jackie
 
00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
about what we were doing what we were
 
00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
looking at and and my question to OPC is
 
00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:23.640 align:start position:0%
is it important for us to keep the
 
00:52:26.549 --> 00:52:26.559 align:start position:0%
registry as I recall the issue was that
 
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
that she's getting complaints there's no
 
00:52:30.589 --> 00:52:30.599 align:start position:0%
active board there's a problem
 
00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
recruiting board members there's no way
 
00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:34.640 align:start position:0%
to adjudicate the complaints if they
 
00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
don't rise to the level of a criminal
 
00:52:39.549 --> 00:52:39.559 align:start position:0%
proceedings but do we want to keep a
 
00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
registry of known problems e and then
 
00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
remove the board have it be an opl
 
00:52:49.109 --> 00:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
function to have a registry I don't
 
00:52:51.309 --> 00:52:51.319 align:start position:0%
think it's necessary because as
 
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
executive director Courtney testified
 
00:52:56.789 --> 00:52:56.799 align:start position:0%
there aren't individuals who identify as
 
00:52:58.950 --> 00:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
this position so it's either it could be
 
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
contractual it could be covered under
 
00:53:02.589 --> 00:53:02.599 align:start position:0%
another board there's other places this
 
00:53:04.750 --> 00:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
could be handled I do think she made the
 
00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:07.160 align:start position:0%
suggestion if we decided to keep the
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
registry to give it to oplc so that we
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
could follow through with those
 
00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
hearings um I mean what what I I you I
 
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
mean I think maybe what I discussed last
 
00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:21.839 align:start position:0%
time what I would say is you know what
 
00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:25.000 align:start position:0%
I'd suggest and we can make a different
 
00:53:28.030 --> 00:53:28.040 align:start position:0%
decision is to to leave those in the
 
00:53:30.589 --> 00:53:30.599 align:start position:0%
bill which would remove the registration
 
00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
and then in a future Bill if somebody
 
00:53:35.829 --> 00:53:35.839 align:start position:0%
thinks that there really is a problem
 
00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
you know work with oplc to figure out
 
00:53:40.069 --> 00:53:40.079 align:start position:0%
okay what is the process that should go
 
00:53:41.589 --> 00:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
forward because the current one is
 
00:53:44.309 --> 00:53:44.319 align:start position:0%
completely dysfunctional and can't work
 
00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:45.720 align:start position:0%
because nobody identifies that
 
00:53:47.829 --> 00:53:47.839 align:start position:0%
profession nobody wants to be on the
 
00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
board they have one person on the board
 
00:53:50.829 --> 00:53:50.839 align:start position:0%
the board has never met and therefore
 
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
they cannot act on anything and there's
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
no interest I guess from what she told
 
00:53:57.150 --> 00:53:57.160 align:start position:0%
us in anyone being on it so it just
 
00:53:59.630 --> 00:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't work the way it's that's no good
 
00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
right and so you know if later somebody
 
00:54:05.829 --> 00:54:05.839 align:start position:0%
can come up with a a way that would work
 
00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
then you know can be considered and I
 
00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:10.280 align:start position:0%
don't want to try and solve that as part
 
00:54:12.670 --> 00:54:12.680 align:start position:0%
of amending this bill at this point
 
00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
is uh my to clarification on that one is
 
00:54:18.789 --> 00:54:18.799 align:start position:0%
if we
 
00:54:21.549 --> 00:54:21.559 align:start position:0%
repeal the board of registration of
 
00:54:23.950 --> 00:54:23.960 align:start position:0%
medical technician and medical
 
00:54:26.430 --> 00:54:26.440 align:start position:0%
technician registration and all that
 
00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:28.280 align:start position:0%
relating to medical
 
00:54:31.549 --> 00:54:31.559 align:start position:0%
technician is there a process then
 
00:54:33.789 --> 00:54:33.799 align:start position:0%
nobody's identifying as that but they're
 
00:54:35.829 --> 00:54:35.839 align:start position:0%
working as a medical
 
00:54:38.349 --> 00:54:38.359 align:start position:0%
technician in the hospital or in the
 
00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:43.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:45.880 align:start position:0%
that could be the employer and there's
 
00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:47.640 align:start position:0%
also depending on the profession it
 
00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
could be within the scope of practice of
 
00:54:50.079 --> 00:54:51.750 align:start position:0%
could be within the scope of practice of
the

00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
individual one more followup Mr CH
 
00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
certainly so does that come under
 
00:55:03.630 --> 00:55:03.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:08.109 --> 00:55:08.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:11.109 --> 00:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
LNA violated some form of disciplinary
 
00:55:12.829 --> 00:55:12.839 align:start position:0%
rule the Board of Nursing would have
 
00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over that okay so this is
 
00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
not that but they they wouldn't be I
 
00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
mean a mettech
 
00:55:23.589 --> 00:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
LNA is is practicing as an LNA correct
 
00:55:25.230 --> 00:55:25.240 align:start position:0%
and not and they not a medical
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
technician so they wouldn't be under
 
00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
this anyway and just one other question
 
00:55:29.950 --> 00:55:29.960 align:start position:0%
if you know so director Courtney said
 
00:55:31.390 --> 00:55:31.400 align:start position:0%
they had gotten some complaints but she
 
00:55:32.589 --> 00:55:32.599 align:start position:0%
couldn't do anything unless it was
 
00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:33.880 align:start position:0%
clearly criminal and then she could
 
00:55:35.710 --> 00:55:35.720 align:start position:0%
refer it to law enforcement but who's
 
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
making those complaints what sort of
 
00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
people that's not something I can reveal
 
00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:43.240 align:start position:0%
those are confidential can you even say
 
00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:44.270 align:start position:0%
those are confidential can you even say
is

00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:55:47.309 --> 00:55:47.319 align:start position:0%
it is it the is it the employer I don't
 
00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:49.400 align:start position:0%
know I'm not asking who yeah yeah yeah
 
00:55:50.589 --> 00:55:50.599 align:start position:0%
but I still don't I don't know the
 
00:55:53.309 --> 00:55:53.319 align:start position:0%
information even if I no what sorry yeah
 
00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
I represent go good disclose thank you I
 
00:55:58.390 --> 00:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
recall specifically um director Courtney
 
00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
saying that she could not report some of
 
00:56:03.950 --> 00:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
these to the employer because if the
 
00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:07.880 align:start position:0%
board did not adjudicate the report then
 
00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:09.640 align:start position:0%
her hands were bound so I don't think
 
00:56:12.270 --> 00:56:12.280 align:start position:0%
they're only coming from the employer or
 
00:56:14.029 --> 00:56:14.039 align:start position:0%
even you know there was nothing
 
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
indicating any of them were coming from
 
00:56:15.599 --> 00:56:17.029 align:start position:0%
indicating any of them were coming from
the

00:56:17.029 --> 00:56:17.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:19.720 align:start position:0%
employer bottom line is what we talked
 
00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
about is we're talking about
 
00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
housekeeping people th that those kind
 
00:56:25.349 --> 00:56:25.359 align:start position:0%
of scenarios where they had access to
 
00:56:28.349 --> 00:56:28.359 align:start position:0%
Medicine and I I agree with you if this
 
00:56:30.990 --> 00:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
is a problem going forward then a
 
00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
clearer bill separate from this can come
 
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
you but a men py and then Schmid thank
 
00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair so if this is repealed
 
00:56:43.150 --> 00:56:43.160 align:start position:0%
there's no board there's no registration
 
00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:44.190 align:start position:0%
there's no board there's no registration
the

00:56:44.190 --> 00:56:44.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:56:49.470 --> 00:56:49.480 align:start position:0%
employer can take action um I can ask
 
00:56:54.750 --> 00:56:54.760 align:start position:0%
specifically the exitor hospital or poou
 
00:56:57.910 --> 00:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
Hospital which it was exitor hospital
 
00:57:03.309 --> 00:57:03.319 align:start position:0%
that was public and if this was in place
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
the exitor hospital could deal with
 
00:57:11.069 --> 00:57:11.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:14.029 --> 00:57:14.039 align:start position:0%
away just let me we don't have control
 
00:57:15.829 --> 00:57:15.839 align:start position:0%
over how the employers would be dealing
 
00:57:19.309 --> 00:57:19.319 align:start position:0%
with their employee relationships so you
 
00:57:20.789 --> 00:57:20.799 align:start position:0%
know how that partnership would be
 
00:57:22.789 --> 00:57:22.799 align:start position:0%
handled but she asked if it could and
 
00:57:26.349 --> 00:57:26.359 align:start position:0%
presumably they could so just removing
 
00:57:29.870 --> 00:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
this barrier with no place to go like a
 
00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
dead end uh you know in terms of uh
 
00:57:37.829 --> 00:57:37.839 align:start position:0%
complaints and who's going to look at it
 
00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
does now oplc feels like they have a
 
00:57:44.990 --> 00:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
tool to say okay they won't come to oplc
 
00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
with complaint the employer can deal
 
00:57:49.829 --> 00:57:49.839 align:start position:0%
with it with their own because there's
 
00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
no licensing or
 
00:57:53.549 --> 00:57:53.559 align:start position:0%
registration I don't think from the
 
00:57:55.150 --> 00:57:55.160 align:start position:0%
employer's perspective that this would
 
00:57:57.069 --> 00:57:57.079 align:start position:0%
be seen as a barrier I think the problem
 
00:57:58.789 --> 00:57:58.799 align:start position:0%
here is this this doesn't really provide
 
00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:01.640 align:start position:0%
much utility I think whether this exists
 
00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
or not the employer could take action
 
00:58:04.589 --> 00:58:04.599 align:start position:0%
against that
 
00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
employee and and I mean the you know the
 
00:58:11.549 --> 00:58:11.559 align:start position:0%
the uh bad behavior could be noticed I
 
00:58:13.789 --> 00:58:13.799 align:start position:0%
suppose either by a patient um the
 
00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
employer uh practitioner at the employer
 
00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:17.750 align:start position:0%
employer uh practitioner at the employer
or

00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
whoever and um you know if they're
 
00:58:23.069 --> 00:58:23.079 align:start position:0%
employed by the facility hospital or
 
00:58:26.349 --> 00:58:26.359 align:start position:0%
whatever in that case you know plan
 
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
could go to the hospital and they're
 
00:58:28.670 --> 00:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
going to deal with it however they deal
 
00:58:31.150 --> 00:58:31.160 align:start position:0%
with it I mean ultimately if if the
 
00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
patient thinks they're harm they can sue
 
00:58:33.549 --> 00:58:33.559 align:start position:0%
the hospital and that gets into the
 
00:58:36.349 --> 00:58:36.359 align:start position:0%
whole medical insurance thing but yeah
 
00:58:38.589 --> 00:58:38.599 align:start position:0%
that was my point like as long as we
 
00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
keep the Public Safety in mind and this
 
00:58:44.190 --> 00:58:44.200 align:start position:0%
is going to provide a safer environment
 
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
for granite Staters in the field I I
 
00:58:49.230 --> 00:58:49.240 align:start position:0%
think it's not going to make any
 
00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
difference um if you know it's not
 
00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
working so it's not really doing
 
00:58:55.789 --> 00:58:55.799 align:start position:0%
anything now if we take it out it's not
 
00:58:57.510 --> 00:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
going to make it in my view at least
 
00:59:00.190 --> 00:59:00.200 align:start position:0%
more dangerous or safer and there might
 
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
be another
 
00:59:04.069 --> 00:59:04.079 align:start position:0%
solution that might help Public Safety
 
00:59:07.950 --> 00:59:07.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:11.069 --> 00:59:11.079 align:start position:0%
isn't you I'll set on that
 
00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
or so um I I think there's it's just
 
00:59:18.670 --> 00:59:18.680 align:start position:0%
irrefutable that the statement you just
 
00:59:21.870 --> 00:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
made is the case I mean if it's not
 
00:59:26.109 --> 00:59:26.119 align:start position:0%
working then no benefits being achieved
 
00:59:28.430 --> 00:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
I mean but the the bottom line is is not
 
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
whether the employer could have done
 
00:59:32.789 --> 00:59:32.799 align:start position:0%
something uh the employer clearly could
 
00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
have done something but because there
 
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
was no nothing in place Mr Kowski could
 
00:59:42.510 --> 00:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
come up from and just to from a series
 
00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
of other states where he was a bad actor
 
00:59:49.069 --> 00:59:49.079 align:start position:0%
and he was and he got to New Hampshire
 
00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:51.960 align:start position:0%
One Jump Ahead of the the people
 
00:59:55.589 --> 00:59:55.599 align:start position:0%
arresting him in States X Y and Z and
 
00:59:59.309 --> 00:59:59.319 align:start position:0%
probably ABC as well um they they never
 
01:00:01.349 --> 01:00:01.359 align:start position:0%
would have hired him if they knew what
 
01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
his background was but there was no
 
01:00:06.829 --> 01:00:06.839 align:start position:0%
basis for there was no network there was
 
01:00:08.910 --> 01:00:08.920 align:start position:0%
no registration that was the reason I
 
01:00:11.069 --> 01:00:11.079 align:start position:0%
was on the committee at the time that
 
01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:13.720 align:start position:0%
put together the bill in an attempt to
 
01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
give the give New Hampshire some kind of
 
01:00:21.390 --> 01:00:21.400 align:start position:0%
um warning network if you will of of
 
01:00:23.470 --> 01:00:23.480 align:start position:0%
people that had a history in other
 
01:00:26.589 --> 01:00:26.599 align:start position:0%
states but if it's not working
 
01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
then we got to go some other direction
 
01:00:33.069 --> 01:00:33.079 align:start position:0%
okay um so if what I'd like to do is get
 
01:00:35.549 --> 01:00:35.559 align:start position:0%
back to the male of the 29th which is
 
01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:39.880 align:start position:0%
the additional pieces no of U of 1410 um
 
01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
in section 10 if that's okay so the
 
01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:44.789 align:start position:0%
in section 10 if that's okay so the
first

01:00:44.789 --> 01:00:44.799 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:00:48.829 --> 01:00:48.839 align:start position:0%
one is um proposing to remove lines 27
 
01:00:51.069 --> 01:00:51.079 align:start position:0%
and 28 on page
 
01:00:55.309 --> 01:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
six and these are just you know we we've
 
01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
done last year maybe even prior a
 
01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
general move of certain administrative
 
01:01:03.029 --> 01:01:03.039 align:start position:0%
functions from the boards to
 
01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
oplc and also there's some disciplinary
 
01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:08.200 align:start position:0%
you know at least the the the hearings
 
01:01:10.349 --> 01:01:10.359 align:start position:0%
and other parts of discipline and that
 
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't done in all boards in all 57
 
01:01:16.510 --> 01:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
boards and so as I understand it you
 
01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
know um the one online 27 is relative to
 
01:01:21.630 --> 01:01:21.640 align:start position:0%
collection and expenditure of funds but
 
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
that's moved from the boards to oplc and
 
01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
and related relative to fees and charges
 
01:01:31.230 --> 01:01:31.240 align:start position:0%
so what this thing does is um it it
 
01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
removes the authority from the board
 
01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
we've already given it to oplc now it's
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
in two places which kind of doesn't work
 
01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:38.510 align:start position:0%
in two places which kind of doesn't work
so

01:01:38.510 --> 01:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:41.549 --> 01:01:41.559 align:start position:0%
um you know if there if people are when
 
01:01:43.029 --> 01:01:43.039 align:start position:0%
when people we have discussion but then
 
01:01:44.589 --> 01:01:44.599 align:start position:0%
I'd like to take just a quick vote on if
 
01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
people are fine with removing
 
01:01:49.349 --> 01:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
this you want a motion before we discuss
 
01:01:52.430 --> 01:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
it sure or yeah what you can do that
 
01:01:56.309 --> 01:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
okay um um so I make a motion to remove
 
01:02:00.309 --> 01:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
it okay and I I'll second it just we get
 
01:02:02.910 --> 01:02:02.920 align:start position:0%
through this um if if we want to remove
 
01:02:05.029 --> 01:02:05.039 align:start position:0%
the conflicting language we want to keep
 
01:02:06.309 --> 01:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
this language in the bill because this
 
01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
is remove the what it says here is
 
01:02:09.789 --> 01:02:09.799 align:start position:0%
remove these lines from the bill that's
 
01:02:13.589 --> 01:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
the motion no it's retain the language
 
01:02:15.549 --> 01:02:15.559 align:start position:0%
yeah it sounds like you might oh no I've
 
01:02:15.559 --> 01:02:16.910 align:start position:0%
yeah it sounds like you might oh no I've
got

01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
got
 
01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
this I'm it's okay I'm messed up
 
01:02:24.309 --> 01:02:24.319 align:start position:0%
here and I'm I'm bur keep keep the
 
01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
language all right going to be thank you
 
01:02:31.789 --> 01:02:31.799 align:start position:0%
for keeping me yeah uh not too confused
 
01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
yeah not confused you have a
 
01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:38.240 align:start position:0%
staff yeah it's me Mr chair if I can
 
01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
clarify by keeping it in section 10 it's
 
01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
going to be repealed correct which means
 
01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
the language will be removed in the
 
01:02:53.069 --> 01:02:53.079 align:start position:0%
Statue so the redundancy is gone you are
 
01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct okay um and uh
 
01:02:58.950 --> 01:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
well I under I understood that I put the
 
01:03:01.549 --> 01:03:01.559 align:start position:0%
wrong thing down okay um my apology does
 
01:03:04.309 --> 01:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
a negative and a negative make a
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
positive not in this case gu all right
 
01:03:11.029 --> 01:03:11.039 align:start position:0%
so uh I have a question for oplc Mr
 
01:03:14.029 --> 01:03:14.039 align:start position:0%
chair sure so you know when uh director
 
01:03:17.269 --> 01:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
Courtney was talking about with the LNA
 
01:03:21.470 --> 01:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
licensing if we can get the funds from
 
01:03:25.309 --> 01:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
DS for licensing and if the you know the
 
01:03:30.069 --> 01:03:30.079 align:start position:0%
double charging will end will this help
 
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
in that case this is kind of an
 
01:03:33.829 --> 01:03:33.839 align:start position:0%
unrelated matter this is more just
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
removing conflicting language okay so it
 
01:03:38.829 --> 01:03:38.839 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with we we're telling
 
01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
them to do two different things and
 
01:03:42.589 --> 01:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
we're cleaning that up okay I hope
 
01:03:47.269 --> 01:03:47.279 align:start position:0%
sounds okay um so the motion is to keep
 
01:03:49.309 --> 01:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
these lines in the bill which would
 
01:03:53.190 --> 01:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
repeal um those two sections of Statute
 
01:03:56.190 --> 01:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:03:59.549 --> 01:03:59.559 align:start position:0%
uh and we have a motion in a second yeah
 
01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
okay everybody in favor yes anyone
 
01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
oppose no okay fine we're done with that
 
01:04:07.029 --> 01:04:07.039 align:start position:0%
one the next one actually is uh
 
01:04:09.029 --> 01:04:09.039 align:start position:0%
something that was brought to us by uh
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
Mr oser house
 
01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
um he's suggests we amend RSA it's 326 B
 
01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:17.710 align:start position:0%
um he's suggests we amend RSA it's 326 B
colon

01:04:17.710 --> 01:04:17.720 align:start position:0%
colon
 
01:04:21.069 --> 01:04:21.079 align:start position:0%
161 and this is It's a similar thing
 
01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
it what no it's the 16 sorry it's says
 
01:04:28.829 --> 01:04:28.839 align:start position:0%
and the current language is submit a
 
01:04:31.150 --> 01:04:31.160 align:start position:0%
completed application in
 
01:04:34.990 --> 01:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
fees and this is um as it's just more
 
01:04:36.349 --> 01:04:36.359 align:start position:0%
clean up because I think right and and
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
we're adding as established by the board
 
01:04:41.069 --> 01:04:41.079 align:start position:0%
which is the language used we're taking
 
01:04:43.349 --> 01:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
out the language established by right
 
01:04:46.910 --> 01:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
we're removing it um so my suggestion
 
01:04:50.029 --> 01:04:50.039 align:start position:0%
was the what are we talking about B16 is
 
01:04:53.230 --> 01:04:53.240 align:start position:0%
to take out that repeal but amend
 
01:04:55.829 --> 01:04:55.839 align:start position:0%
section one of that language just just
 
01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:05.870 --> 01:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
Authority no this is no this is adding
 
01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:06.750 align:start position:0%
Authority no this is no this is adding
something

01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:06.760 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:08.890 align:start position:0%
new this is adding something
 
01:05:08.890 --> 01:05:11.430 align:start position:0%
new this is adding something
[Music]

01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:14.920 align:start position:0%
new so correct but that
 
01:05:18.990 --> 01:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
adding um submit a completed
 
01:05:23.230 --> 01:05:23.240 align:start position:0%
application so my my suggestion
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
is remove line 9 from the bill which I
 
01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:30.920 align:start position:0%
believe but then amend section one of
 
01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:33.150 align:start position:0%
believe but then amend section one of
326

01:05:33.150 --> 01:05:33.160 align:start position:0%
326
 
01:05:36.029 --> 01:05:36.039 align:start position:0%
B16 just to remove conflicting fee
 
01:05:39.269 --> 01:05:39.279 align:start position:0%
setting Authority language and I did not
 
01:05:41.069 --> 01:05:41.079 align:start position:0%
I it's in the language I sent to
 
01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
representative L right but I I'm trying
 
01:05:46.349 --> 01:05:46.359 align:start position:0%
to see if I put it in my notes or okay
 
01:05:50.190 --> 01:05:50.200 align:start position:0%
you did do that uh Mr chair you said
 
01:05:53.109 --> 01:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
substitute submit you know you did add
 
01:05:57.069 --> 01:05:57.079 align:start position:0%
in the word the uh
 
01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
add to the bill a section to amend RSA
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
326 DB colon
 
01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:09.559 align:start position:0%
16 comma one as follows so you did put
 
01:06:12.390 --> 01:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
this language to be substitute so this
 
01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
would be to replace line 29 correct is
 
01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
that or 20 is it
 
01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:24.109 align:start position:0%
that or 20 is it
29

01:06:24.109 --> 01:06:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:27.829 --> 01:06:27.839 align:start position:0%
right is it line just a moment is it is
 
01:06:30.510 --> 01:06:30.520 align:start position:0%
it okay
 
01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:32.069 align:start position:0%
it okay
29

01:06:32.069 --> 01:06:32.079 align:start position:0%
29
 
01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:35.480 align:start position:0%
no what was the question
 
01:06:39.029 --> 01:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
sorry if we if we're suggesting that we
 
01:06:41.109 --> 01:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
add language Lindsay just walk in the
 
01:06:43.789 --> 01:06:43.799 align:start position:0%
door when you great thank you
 
01:06:48.069 --> 01:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:51.150 --> 01:06:51.160 align:start position:0%
you all right so
 
01:06:54.750 --> 01:06:54.760 align:start position:0%
yeah you're you're we got a wonderful
 
01:06:56.789 --> 01:06:56.799 align:start position:0%
suggestion to
 
01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:00.760 align:start position:0%
some microphone yeah thank you we got
 
01:07:03.829 --> 01:07:03.839 align:start position:0%
some wonderful language to add oh Lord
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
this is so hard my husband's right why
 
01:07:08.990 --> 01:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
do we not all run out of the room
 
01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
screaming all right we got a wonderful
 
01:07:14.269 --> 01:07:14.279 align:start position:0%
recommendation to add some language to
 
01:07:17.710 --> 01:07:17.720 align:start position:0%
this bill on B16 semicolon 1 I if my
 
01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
memory serves me correct my question is
 
01:07:24.309 --> 01:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
other than line 29 on page six is there
 
01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the other five pages of this
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
bill we're looking at where the language
 
01:07:32.109 --> 01:07:32.119 align:start position:0%
is already there and if not where do we
 
01:07:38.789 --> 01:07:38.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
bill so RSA 326 B16 wouldn't have
 
01:07:44.670 --> 01:07:44.680 align:start position:0%
appeared anywhere else in wouldn't have
 
01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
it would not have Okay so I do think
 
01:07:49.109 --> 01:07:49.119 align:start position:0%
it's interesting right because right now
 
01:07:52.349 --> 01:07:52.359 align:start position:0%
section 10 is repeal exactly straight so
 
01:07:54.990 --> 01:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
exactly so my suggestion would be remove
 
01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.349 align:start position:0%
exactly so my suggestion would be remove
line

01:07:56.349 --> 01:07:56.359 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:07:59.789 --> 01:07:59.799 align:start position:0%
29 from section 10 and then probably
 
01:08:02.029 --> 01:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
create a new section where we could do
 
01:08:04.430 --> 01:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
that Amendment thank you okay and in the
 
01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
email I had the add a section to change
 
01:08:10.990 --> 01:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
that line what I had left off was
 
01:08:13.549 --> 01:08:13.559 align:start position:0%
removing line 29 and I've added that in
 
01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:15.760 align:start position:0%
my notes and that it would be part of
 
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
the motion so than I'll make the motion
 
01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
somebody can second okay and yeah and if
 
01:08:24.829 --> 01:08:24.839 align:start position:0%
there's no more discussion the question
 
01:08:27.669 --> 01:08:27.679 align:start position:0%
is do we remove line 29 which repeals
 
01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
326 B16 and instead add a section that's
 
01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
going to amend it to remove the uh the
 
01:08:37.470 --> 01:08:37.480 align:start position:0%
language is established by the board if
 
01:08:39.870 --> 01:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
that's what you want to remove that yeah
 
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
okay so we don't I need to add that we
 
01:08:45.749 --> 01:08:45.759 align:start position:0%
just have to remove it from this line
 
01:08:49.070 --> 01:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
and well we remove line 29 which is the
 
01:08:51.229 --> 01:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
repeal of the whole section correct and
 
01:08:53.349 --> 01:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
then we add an amendment to the section
 
01:08:55.149 --> 01:08:55.159 align:start position:0%
to take out correct the work so I'm
 
01:08:57.870 --> 01:08:57.880 align:start position:0%
saying think you're going to add another
 
01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
section out of yeah to the bill so we
 
01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
don't have to deal with that in this SE
 
01:09:05.070 --> 01:09:05.080 align:start position:0%
I mean wherever allas puts it in there
 
01:09:07.070 --> 01:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
not in this section correct correct so
 
01:09:09.470 --> 01:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
all we have to do right now is to remove
 
01:09:11.950 --> 01:09:11.960 align:start position:0%
it from repeal line which is well we're
 
01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
voting to do two things one is to remove
 
01:09:18.309 --> 01:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
line 29 and also to add the section that
 
01:09:22.030 --> 01:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
changes the language may I certainly not
 
01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:24.440 align:start position:0%
in this section no no that's what we're
 
01:09:26.309 --> 01:09:26.319 align:start position:0%
going to vot do right now but yeah it'll
 
01:09:28.349 --> 01:09:28.359 align:start position:0%
be added to the bill yeah uh
 
01:09:29.789 --> 01:09:29.799 align:start position:0%
representative Brown doing two things in
 
01:09:32.789 --> 01:09:32.799 align:start position:0%
one motion yeah which we can do Mr oer
 
01:09:35.749 --> 01:09:35.759 align:start position:0%
house would you repeat what you wanted
 
01:09:37.669 --> 01:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
for my notes for myself because I'm
 
01:09:39.430 --> 01:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
apparently slow here no that's fine what
 
01:09:42.829 --> 01:09:42.839 align:start position:0%
you wanted to change in 326 P6 so I
 
01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
would remove I would remove line 29 from
 
01:09:48.990 --> 01:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
the bill and then the language I
 
01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
proposed has fee setting Authority with
 
01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
the board so I just suggested removing
 
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
from the board piece so that it doesn't
 
01:10:00.750 --> 01:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
conflict with RSA 310 so that would fall
 
01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
right in line with what we've been doing
 
01:10:05.709 --> 01:10:05.719 align:start position:0%
in this bill the issue is it says
 
01:10:07.229 --> 01:10:07.239 align:start position:0%
currently it says submit a completed
 
01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
application fees as established by the
 
01:10:11.390 --> 01:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
board but we remove the authority to set
 
01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
fees from all the boards and gave it to
 
01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
Conflict yeah second it's the second
 
01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
part is going to be added to this bill
 
01:10:25.070 --> 01:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
in a different section correct cor all
 
01:10:29.229 --> 01:10:29.239 align:start position:0%
right so all in favor anyone opposed no
 
01:10:32.189 --> 01:10:32.199 align:start position:0%
okay well actually it's four to
 
01:10:35.550 --> 01:10:35.560 align:start position:0%
zero because Bailey's not here all right
 
01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you um do we need to add a section
 
01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:42.520 align:start position:0%
now or not no no we we voted to do it
 
01:10:44.350 --> 01:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
okay um so what I'm going to do I'll
 
01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
take this down to O OS and they'll draft
 
01:10:48.669 --> 01:10:48.679 align:start position:0%
an amendment and they'll add it wherever
 
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
they think appropriate I'm glad to leave
 
01:10:52.229 --> 01:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
that to
 
01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
them um and they they also handle things
 
01:10:57.630 --> 01:10:57.640 align:start position:0%
like if we say remove these lines they
 
01:10:59.669 --> 01:10:59.679 align:start position:0%
handle the rate of the subsequent lines
 
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
and all that we don't have to tell them
 
01:11:01.950 --> 01:11:01.960 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
that all right
 
01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
theoretically I I will not say they
 
01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
there haven't been errors made but
 
01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
that's supposed to be their job okay um
 
01:11:17.870 --> 01:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
the next one is um on page six line 30
 
01:11:20.750 --> 01:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
remove this line from the bill because
 
01:11:24.270 --> 01:11:24.280 align:start position:0%
we chose to keep the license of lnas and
 
01:11:26.430 --> 01:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
this is remove something related to
 
01:11:29.709 --> 01:11:29.719 align:start position:0%
licensing handling LNA applications can
 
01:11:33.550 --> 01:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
we combine the two 30 and 31 both are
 
01:11:36.910 --> 01:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
nice uh removing it from the repeal line
 
01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
I I would ask that we do I mean I could
 
01:11:42.629 --> 01:11:42.639 align:start position:0%
have done this differently um okay and
 
01:11:44.229 --> 01:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
but I kind of went through his things in
 
01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
order and I'm I'm confused enough as it
 
01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
as I yeah maybe we'll do extra motions
 
01:11:53.629 --> 01:11:53.639 align:start position:0%
but so wasn't excuse me Mr chair yeah so
 
01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
may wasn't this because we eliminated
 
01:11:57.990 --> 01:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
section one from the bill correct right
 
01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.470 align:start position:0%
section one from the bill correct right
exactly

01:12:00.470 --> 01:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:02.470 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
okay and second
 
01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
second all any all in favor anyone
 
01:12:14.950 --> 01:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
oppose no okay fine we got that uh okay
 
01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
31 I
 
01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
right because we decided to keep the
 
01:12:34.590 --> 01:12:34.600 align:start position:0%
licenser for LNA so we have to remove it
 
01:12:36.990 --> 01:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
from being repealed you are are
 
01:12:39.310 --> 01:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct I believe and tell me
 
01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:46.110 --> 01:12:46.120 align:start position:0%
us uh actually no no I think we want to
 
01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
keep here the issue and that's the notes
 
01:12:49.229 --> 01:12:49.239 align:start position:0%
I put in email I want to leave it in the
 
01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
bill and keep the repeal because the
 
01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
lenser by endorsement license renewal
 
01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
and license reinstate process for all
 
01:12:58.470 --> 01:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
boards that been moved to oplc so this
 
01:13:00.070 --> 01:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
repeal needs to remain in the bill even
 
01:13:02.350 --> 01:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
though we are keeping LNA
 
01:13:04.229 --> 01:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
licensing but because we moved the
 
01:13:06.149 --> 01:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
authority now it's another case where we
 
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
leave the authority in two places in
 
01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
statute which is not
 
01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
great okay with that anyone have
 
01:13:17.870 --> 01:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
so I move that we remove line 31 from
 
01:13:21.790 --> 01:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
the bill no that it's the contrary keep
 
01:13:24.830 --> 01:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
the bill keep the line in oh thank you
 
01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:25.629 align:start position:0%
the bill keep the line in oh thank you
yeah

01:13:25.629 --> 01:13:25.639 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
leave these in the bills the motion
 
01:13:30.790 --> 01:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
leave these in the bill leave line 31 in
 
01:13:32.590 --> 01:13:32.600 align:start position:0%
the so we don't have to do anything then
 
01:13:34.590 --> 01:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
we don't have to have a motion because
 
01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
if you're going to leave it right um we
 
01:13:38.830 --> 01:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
don't have to technically that's true
 
01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
this is so confusing so um unless we
 
01:13:44.270 --> 01:13:44.280 align:start position:0%
voted on I mean just oh yeah to make it
 
01:13:46.270 --> 01:13:46.280 align:start position:0%
clear on here I mean everybody anyone
 
01:13:49.189 --> 01:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
opposed to doing this not be formal okay
 
01:13:52.590 --> 01:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
keeping it to to anyone opposed to
 
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
leaving these in the bill no keeping
 
01:13:57.390 --> 01:13:57.400 align:start position:0%
them okay great yeah I mean some of
 
01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:58.550 align:start position:0%
them okay great yeah I mean some of
these

01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
yeah okay now we're dealing with 34
 
01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:02.990 align:start position:0%
yeah okay now we're dealing with 34
through

01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
35 and this is I want to remove these
 
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
lines from the bill because these deal
 
01:14:13.470 --> 01:14:13.480 align:start position:0%
with um the LI uh licensing temporary
 
01:14:15.310 --> 01:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
licensing and continuing ed for nursing
 
01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
assistance we need to pull the repeals
 
01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
out because we chose to keep license for
 
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
l&amp; I have a question about that uh this
 
01:14:25.950 --> 01:14:25.960 align:start position:0%
might be to the opl let's
 
01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
see so this is in response to um this
 
01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
this question is to oplc if you the line
 
01:14:38.790 --> 01:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
34 35 36
 
01:14:42.990 --> 01:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
37 this rule making is being
 
01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
implemented from last we're we're just
 
01:14:49.550 --> 01:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
dealing with 34 and 35 at the moment and
 
01:14:52.910 --> 01:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
because 36 is going to be
 
01:14:59.229 --> 01:14:59.239 align:start position:0%
different Okay so we're not repealing it
 
01:15:05.870 --> 01:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
because the shift in licensing process
 
01:15:09.750 --> 01:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
has been moved to oplc for even lnas
 
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
correct um because we deleted section
 
01:15:16.110 --> 01:15:16.120 align:start position:0%
well be it no it's more an issue that we
 
01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
don't want to we don't want to
 
01:15:20.950 --> 01:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
repeal the language for temporary
 
01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
licenses for lnas or for continuing
 
01:15:25.229 --> 01:15:25.239 align:start position:0%
education requirements for lnas because
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
we're keeping elna's license correct but
 
01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
what the Authority or the due
 
01:15:34.189 --> 01:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
responsibility was moved to oplc for
 
01:15:37.229 --> 01:15:37.239 align:start position:0%
licensing purposes from last which rule
 
01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
making is happening right now am I
 
01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
correct correct we have the but what the
 
01:15:43.629 --> 01:15:43.639 align:start position:0%
what these statutes did was say that a
 
01:15:46.750 --> 01:15:46.760 align:start position:0%
nurse could a licensed LNA could start
 
01:15:49.709 --> 01:15:49.719 align:start position:0%
practicing um pending the outcome of the
 
01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
criminal background check so we got
 
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
people working faster so so that that
 
01:15:57.030 --> 01:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
was my yeah if we repeal this then
 
01:15:59.870 --> 01:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
people who can practice now we get rid
 
01:16:02.629 --> 01:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
of temporary licenses for lnas which we
 
01:16:06.030 --> 01:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
don't want to do okay okay so it's
 
01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
reduced the amount of uh time that's
 
01:16:11.830 --> 01:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
needed to get licensing for lnas and
 
01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
they can start practicing right now or
 
01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
to leave it the same actually because
 
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
we're taking the lines from the bill we
 
01:16:19.070 --> 01:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
leave it the way it is now which is they
 
01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
can get the temporary license and
 
01:16:23.629 --> 01:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
practice sooner okay I think okay as
 
01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
long as the workforce is a ailable
 
01:16:28.510 --> 01:16:28.520 align:start position:0%
that's and what we talked about is that
 
01:16:31.070 --> 01:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
um the LNA question is going to be dealt
 
01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
with by another bill so we're just
 
01:16:35.950 --> 01:16:35.960 align:start position:0%
taking everything out any changes to any
 
01:16:37.550 --> 01:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
changes will happen elsewhere we're not
 
01:16:39.310 --> 01:16:39.320 align:start position:0%
worried about that in this bill or
 
01:16:40.550 --> 01:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
director Courtney thought she might be
 
01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
able to do something by rule whatever no
 
01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
I understand but we decided to keep the
 
01:16:47.910 --> 01:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
licensing for elenas that was the intent
 
01:16:50.750 --> 01:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
was to take away that and make it even
 
01:16:53.590 --> 01:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
easier but it was last discussion with
 
01:16:56.270 --> 01:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
the background check and all that we
 
01:16:58.470 --> 01:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
needed to make sure that we're keeping
 
01:17:01.870 --> 01:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
LNA licensing
 
01:17:05.629 --> 01:17:05.639 align:start position:0%
and reduce the double dual Channel
 
01:17:09.070 --> 01:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
regist registry and combine that follow
 
01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:10.110 align:start position:0%
regist registry and combine that follow
up

01:17:10.110 --> 01:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:17:15.189 --> 01:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
Mr so we we decided at the last one to
 
01:17:16.950 --> 01:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
we're not doing anything in this bill
 
01:17:19.390 --> 01:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
with lnaas so any discussion about the
 
01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
lnas other than to take out
 
01:17:25.510 --> 01:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
repeals from this bill
 
01:17:28.510 --> 01:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
just confuses the issue any anything
 
01:17:31.350 --> 01:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
that is going to change the status quo
 
01:17:33.709 --> 01:17:33.719 align:start position:0%
will be handled in the future Jackie's
 
01:17:36.669 --> 01:17:36.679 align:start position:0%
working on that so we can trust Jackie
 
01:17:39.390 --> 01:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
and we can just let that go and remove
 
01:17:41.470 --> 01:17:41.480 align:start position:0%
any of the language of the lnas from
 
01:17:42.870 --> 01:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
this bill right or if you have an
 
01:17:44.070 --> 01:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
interest get talk to her and get
 
01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
involved in that process exactly that's
 
01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
fine EXC me yeah certainly for the
 
01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
people out that Jack would be
 
01:17:52.470 --> 01:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
representative groa thank for those out
 
01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
there yeah we're
 
01:17:57.229 --> 01:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
sorry keep it move things along be a
 
01:17:58.870 --> 01:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
little informal but not too much so
 
01:18:02.430 --> 01:18:02.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for that um yeah so no I I I
 
01:18:05.550 --> 01:18:05.560 align:start position:0%
agree I did have conversation with uh
 
01:18:08.190 --> 01:18:08.200 align:start position:0%
representative gr and motion on
 
01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:09.390 align:start position:0%
representative gr and motion on
[Music]

01:18:09.390 --> 01:18:09.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:18:15.270 --> 01:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
this okay I move to remove lines uh 34
 
01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
and 35 from the bill second okay and uh
 
01:18:25.669 --> 01:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
all in favor anyone opposed
 
01:18:28.709 --> 01:18:28.719 align:start position:0%
okay good next let me sure look this
 
01:18:30.830 --> 01:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
over again to make sure I didn't make a
 
01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:33.149 align:start position:0%
over again to make sure I didn't make a
mistake

01:18:33.149 --> 01:18:33.159 align:start position:0%
mistake
 
01:18:36.669 --> 01:18:36.679 align:start position:0%
um relative to injunctive
 
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
relief now this was one um that we want
 
01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
to keep or was there an issue I'm trying
 
01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
to remember my notes on
 
01:18:54.910 --> 01:18:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:59.110 --> 01:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
here we go 36 keep in the bill remove
 
01:19:01.709 --> 01:19:01.719 align:start position:0%
and actually I had that wrong in my
 
01:19:01.719 --> 01:19:06.149 align:start position:0%
and actually I had that wrong in my
notes

01:19:06.149 --> 01:19:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:09.189 --> 01:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
um actually wait a minute you have both
 
01:19:13.470 --> 01:19:13.480 align:start position:0%
36 and 37 Le no 36 I have the notes as
 
01:19:16.590 --> 01:19:16.600 align:start position:0%
different and they may or may not be so
 
01:19:19.430 --> 01:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
let's deal with them to I I thought I
 
01:19:20.669 --> 01:19:20.679 align:start position:0%
got this straight but apparently I
 
01:19:26.229 --> 01:19:26.239 align:start position:0%
didn't which so this is line 30 3 6
 
01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
which is the injunctive relief thing
 
01:19:32.590 --> 01:19:32.600 align:start position:0%
b40 um
 
01:19:36.430 --> 01:19:36.440 align:start position:0%
is keep in the bill because we still
 
01:19:38.590 --> 01:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
want the language the injunct relief
 
01:19:40.870 --> 01:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
language around lnas if we're licens in
 
01:19:44.149 --> 01:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
them I think that your email said keep
 
01:19:46.510 --> 01:19:46.520 align:start position:0%
in the bill removed from statute keep in
 
01:19:48.110 --> 01:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
the bill removed from statute there the
 
01:19:50.629 --> 01:19:50.639 align:start position:0%
disciplinary stuff is because that
 
01:19:52.669 --> 01:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
covered in10 right this is another one
 
01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
where the responsibility moved from the
 
01:19:58.189 --> 01:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
board to so
 
01:20:02.470 --> 01:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
by by repealing it we are keeping it in
 
01:20:05.830 --> 01:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
the well it's an issue it's an issue
 
01:20:08.669 --> 01:20:08.679 align:start position:0%
again where we have the board we gave
 
01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
the board authority and opl authority
 
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
for the same thing which is not good
 
01:20:16.430 --> 01:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
that's correct correct okay so let me Mr
 
01:20:19.590 --> 01:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
chair would you accept a motion sure uh
 
01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
I I move that we REM that we keep we
 
01:20:25.390 --> 01:20:25.400 align:start position:0%
leave l
 
01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
30 well just doing uh 36 at the moment
 
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
and 37 both about um no 30 37 is a
 
01:20:38.830 --> 01:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
different it's going to go the other way
 
01:20:40.750 --> 01:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
we can talk about that separate just
 
01:20:45.629 --> 01:20:45.639 align:start position:0%
36 36 from the bill okay and I'll second
 
01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
it all right
 
01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
any this double negative is driving me
 
01:20:55.229 --> 01:20:55.239 align:start position:0%
nuts so we'll leave this in the bill
 
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
which will repeal the
 
01:21:01.030 --> 01:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
language giving giving uh the board
 
01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:02.070 align:start position:0%
language giving giving uh the board
certain

01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
certain
 
01:21:06.189 --> 01:21:06.199 align:start position:0%
Authority because oplc has it so the
 
01:21:09.430 --> 01:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
statue will change because it's
 
01:21:14.990 --> 01:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
repealed and the new Statue will cover
 
01:21:18.990 --> 01:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
what is needed because oplc has the
 
01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:20.719 align:start position:0%
right this is just repealing redundant
 
01:21:22.470 --> 01:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
language and statute the board wouldn't
 
01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
even lose the authority to right
 
01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
injection anyone oppos to this what is
 
01:21:31.070 --> 01:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
it we're doing again okay we're going to
 
01:21:35.950 --> 01:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
leave line 36 page I I know no no
 
01:21:38.910 --> 01:21:38.920 align:start position:0%
worries page page six line 36 removing
 
01:21:41.149 --> 01:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
it no we're not removing we're not
 
01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:42.719 align:start position:0%
removing it we're we're going to leave
 
01:21:45.070 --> 01:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
it in the bill which will repeal it from
 
01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:48.280 align:start position:0%
statute correct okay thank you I'm not
 
01:21:51.430 --> 01:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
the only one no I I've had issues with
 
01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:54.920 align:start position:0%
this too we we haven't had this uh we
 
01:21:56.709 --> 01:21:56.719 align:start position:0%
haven't we've gotten the lawyer mindset
 
01:21:58.149 --> 01:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
maybe which would help us with this I
 
01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
um okay the next one are and we only
 
01:22:08.629 --> 01:22:08.639 align:start position:0%
have uh we only have two more bits here
 
01:22:10.629 --> 01:22:10.639 align:start position:0%
and I apologize for being running a
 
01:22:13.110 --> 01:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
little bit late uh to everybody but uh
 
01:22:16.870 --> 01:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
this is Page Six line
 
01:22:19.310 --> 01:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
37 um
 
01:22:22.110 --> 01:22:22.120 align:start position:0%
through Page seven line one the first on
 
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
the top and
 
01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
um what I'm looking to do is remove
 
01:22:30.709 --> 01:22:30.719 align:start position:0%
these from the
 
01:22:34.590 --> 01:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
bill because these have to do with if
 
01:22:36.149 --> 01:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
someone's done something
 
01:22:36.159 --> 01:22:37.709 align:start position:0%
someone's done something
wrong

01:22:37.709 --> 01:22:37.719 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
um I guess you know the the the
 
01:22:42.830 --> 01:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
Authority for the initial part of of
 
01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:44.639 align:start position:0%
looking into these uh problems
 
01:22:48.030 --> 01:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
investigating stuff moved to oplc but
 
01:22:49.990 --> 01:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
this language left it in the board and
 
01:22:52.350 --> 01:22:52.360 align:start position:0%
with oplc is that a reasonable way of
 
01:22:55.910 --> 01:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:57.430 --> 01:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I think one of the interesting
 
01:22:59.790 --> 01:22:59.800 align:start position:0%
things about the we refer to them as
 
01:23:01.390 --> 01:23:01.400 align:start position:0%
charging statutes that's kind of if
 
01:23:03.030 --> 01:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
you've done something wrong that's a
 
01:23:04.750 --> 01:23:04.760 align:start position:0%
place where it's probably okay to have
 
01:23:07.310 --> 01:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
it both in the oplc and the board
 
01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
statutes so if if there exists language
 
01:23:11.709 --> 01:23:11.719 align:start position:0%
that says this is a violation and you
 
01:23:13.510 --> 01:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
can be held accountable this also deals
 
01:23:16.030 --> 01:23:16.040 align:start position:0%
with the penalty which yeah I mean your
 
01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation your email was to remove
 
01:23:21.149 --> 01:23:21.159 align:start position:0%
these lines from the bill correct and I
 
01:23:22.709 --> 01:23:22.719 align:start position:0%
you stick with that yeah I'm sticking
 
01:23:25.910 --> 01:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
with that so that repeal don't repeal it
 
01:23:27.510 --> 01:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
is basically don't repeal the language
 
01:23:30.229 --> 01:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
from so remove it from the repeal line
 
01:23:33.390 --> 01:23:33.400 align:start position:0%
correct correct repeal
 
01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
section Mr chair would you like a motion
 
01:23:41.149 --> 01:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
please I move that we retain lines
 
01:23:43.189 --> 01:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
remove remove them from the bill which
 
01:23:45.950 --> 01:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
would retain them inat remove
 
01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
remove line item 37 and 38 from no 37
 
01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
through Page seven line one page seven
 
01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
line one thank you yeah they're they're
 
01:23:57.629 --> 01:23:57.639 align:start position:0%
they're too adjacent but we I know I had
 
01:24:00.350 --> 01:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
to switch the page in my brain okay uh
 
01:24:04.669 --> 01:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
that's brown seconds uh all in favor
 
01:24:06.910 --> 01:24:06.920 align:start position:0%
anyone oppose
 
01:24:09.149 --> 01:24:09.159 align:start position:0%
okay I don't I don't want to Railroad
 
01:24:11.229 --> 01:24:11.239 align:start position:0%
and vote for
 
01:24:13.709 --> 01:24:13.719 align:start position:0%
everybody and make assumptions which are
 
01:24:17.950 --> 01:24:17.960 align:start position:0%
dangerous so okay last one that in W
 
01:24:21.669 --> 01:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
yeah um P okay now we're on to page
 
01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
seven line two which is the last last
 
01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
one of this section and this one is we
 
01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
want to leave this in the bill um this
 
01:24:33.950 --> 01:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
is the grandfathering statute for you
 
01:24:35.590 --> 01:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
know grandfathering and lnas that were
 
01:24:37.149 --> 01:24:37.159 align:start position:0%
licensed another way since we're keeping
 
01:24:40.350 --> 01:24:40.360 align:start position:0%
LNA licensing we should remove this from
 
01:24:43.310 --> 01:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
the bill so that it will remain in
 
01:24:45.790 --> 01:24:45.800 align:start position:0%
statute I got that
 
01:24:49.390 --> 01:24:49.400 align:start position:0%
right makes sense so remove I make a
 
01:24:54.709 --> 01:24:54.719 align:start position:0%
motion to remove to leave it in the bill
 
01:24:57.790 --> 01:24:57.800 align:start position:0%
to leave the line in the bill so we're
 
01:25:01.709 --> 01:25:01.719 align:start position:0%
going to repeal it correct oh no no
 
01:25:03.950 --> 01:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
actually no I'm I've got you're
 
01:25:06.830 --> 01:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely right you're absolutely right
 
01:25:09.310 --> 01:25:09.320 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah that's another one I got
 
01:25:13.350 --> 01:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
finally I got it right no I'm
 
01:25:17.189 --> 01:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
not okay so I there's a reason why we're
 
01:25:18.709 --> 01:25:18.719 align:start position:0%
all doing this together I ask people to
 
01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
review it we leave it no we remove it
 
01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
from the bill
 
01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
yeah remove it from the the way my brain
 
01:25:29.430 --> 01:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
works is remove it from the repeal line
 
01:25:31.950 --> 01:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
so that stays in the statute okay okay
 
01:25:36.070 --> 01:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
so we have that motion let me one a
 
01:25:40.430 --> 01:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
second all right um all in favor hi
 
01:25:44.189 --> 01:25:44.199 align:start position:0%
anyone oppose no okay
 
01:25:49.270 --> 01:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
so I will um yeah take this to O
 
01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
Olaf and we'll have an amendment and
 
01:25:56.790 --> 01:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:00.719 align:start position:0%
um when I get the amendment I will um
 
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
send it out to everybody and please take
 
01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
a look at it um to make sure I didn't I
 
01:26:14.950 --> 01:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:18.310 --> 01:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
to whoops let me go back
 
01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:20.870 align:start position:0%
to whoops let me go back
to

01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:26:23.390 --> 01:26:23.400 align:start position:0%
lineage hang on hang on let me get to it
 
01:26:28.830 --> 01:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
37 those from the B right we're removing
 
01:26:31.470 --> 01:26:31.480 align:start position:0%
please we're removing them actually is
 
01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:33.470 align:start position:0%
please we're removing them actually is
that

01:26:33.470 --> 01:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:36.270 --> 01:26:36.280 align:start position:0%
right right removing so that they stay
 
01:26:40.750 --> 01:26:40.760 align:start position:0%
in statute so they stay in statute okay
 
01:26:44.350 --> 01:26:44.360 align:start position:0%
right no that's good double check
 
01:26:47.310 --> 01:26:47.320 align:start position:0%
reinforcing my double check is
 
01:26:50.950 --> 01:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
good um all right so I am going to close
 
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee work session on House
 
01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
Bill 14 1410 and as soon as I get my
 
01:26:58.229 --> 01:26:58.239 align:start position:0%
things organized here actually I'll open
 
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
it on the work session of House Bill
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
1676 it'll just yeah but just give me a
 
01:27:12.790 --> 01:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:22.350 --> 01:27:22.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:25.590 --> 01:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
one no now this last one having some
 
01:27:30.350 --> 01:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
extra eyes on it wasn't a bad thing um
 
01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:32.950 align:start position:0%
extra eyes on it wasn't a bad thing um
okay

01:27:32.950 --> 01:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:39.149 align:start position:0%
okay
yes

01:27:39.149 --> 01:27:39.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:43.709 --> 01:27:43.719 align:start position:0%
um see membership
 
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
purpose okay so um you know it was a a
 
01:27:52.030 --> 01:27:52.040 align:start position:0%
lively hearing um and
 
01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
uh I I I can't speak for anyone
 
01:27:59.590 --> 01:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
else um so my take is there were uh
 
01:28:01.790 --> 01:28:01.800 align:start position:0%
three main objections the big one was
 
01:28:04.830 --> 01:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
that uh people perceive the repeals in
 
01:28:08.310 --> 01:28:08.320 align:start position:0%
the bill as a threat to you know
 
01:28:10.750 --> 01:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
whatever board they think is important
 
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
share my apologies which bill number
 
01:28:15.550 --> 01:28:15.560 align:start position:0%
again I'm sorry 1676 that's the sunset
 
01:28:20.229 --> 01:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:24.960 --> 01:29:05.189 align:start position:0%
 
141

01:29:05.189 --> 01:29:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:06.830 --> 01:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
I'm going to hand something around I'm
 
01:29:08.270 --> 01:29:08.280 align:start position:0%
going to read this out for the people
 
01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:09.750 align:start position:0%
going to read this out for the people
here

01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:16.070 align:start position:0%
here
but

01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:18.189 --> 01:29:18.199 align:start position:0%
yeah you can look at this and then no
 
01:29:19.950 --> 01:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
this is something extra I want and hand
 
01:29:23.350 --> 01:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
it down to people okay so there was a
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
concern about
 
01:29:24.719 --> 01:29:25.510 align:start position:0%
concern about
the

01:29:25.510 --> 01:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
repeals which I'm I think I'm going to
 
01:29:28.990 --> 01:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
get to last there's a concern about the
 
01:29:31.350 --> 01:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
membership which I completely agree with
 
01:29:33.149 --> 01:29:33.159 align:start position:0%
and there was concern about uh the
 
01:29:36.790 --> 01:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
stated purpose in the bill and I took a
 
01:29:39.070 --> 01:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
I'd like to deal with that one
 
01:29:42.070 --> 01:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
first um and and what I'd like to do
 
01:29:45.709 --> 01:29:45.719 align:start position:0%
here is um deal with those issues and
 
01:29:47.470 --> 01:29:47.480 align:start position:0%
then if anybody has any other on the
 
01:29:49.790 --> 01:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee has any other issues with
 
01:29:52.350 --> 01:29:52.360 align:start position:0%
the bill they want to bring up we can
 
01:29:54.550 --> 01:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
deal with them and then uh
 
01:29:56.750 --> 01:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
then move on from there
 
01:30:01.149 --> 01:30:01.159 align:start position:0%
so um the statement of purpose I can see
 
01:30:03.070 --> 01:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
as uh some of it's I think boiler plate
 
01:30:04.750 --> 01:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
that were put in all these bills maybe
 
01:30:08.669 --> 01:30:08.679 align:start position:0%
not appropriately in all cases and so
 
01:30:10.950 --> 01:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
the language I mean the the first
 
01:30:12.750 --> 01:30:12.760 align:start position:0%
sentence I kept the protection of health
 
01:30:14.270 --> 01:30:14.280 align:start position:0%
and safety is of utmost importance to
 
01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire state government and
 
01:30:18.790 --> 01:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
consumers of the state fine now it says
 
01:30:21.109 --> 01:30:21.119 align:start position:0%
here you know the you can look at the
 
01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
existing language but it's uh it says
 
01:30:25.709 --> 01:30:25.719 align:start position:0%
over regulation there's a barrier can
 
01:30:27.390 --> 01:30:27.400 align:start position:0%
prevent and the purpose this but it
 
01:30:28.990 --> 01:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
states the purpose of this act is to
 
01:30:31.709 --> 01:30:31.719 align:start position:0%
require legislature to reexamine the
 
01:30:33.470 --> 01:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
licy boards of the state to determine if
 
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
it is in the best interest of the
 
01:30:36.830 --> 01:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
consumers and the health and safety of
 
01:30:39.790 --> 01:30:39.800 align:start position:0%
the state to renew their Authority so
 
01:30:42.510 --> 01:30:42.520 align:start position:0%
that doesn't really go along with the
 
01:30:45.229 --> 01:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
rest of the bill because it's it's it's
 
01:30:46.470 --> 01:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
putting it out there like there's two
 
01:30:48.430 --> 01:30:48.440 align:start position:0%
options one is we keep things the way
 
01:30:50.910 --> 01:30:50.920 align:start position:0%
they are or we just get rid of them and
 
01:30:53.350 --> 01:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
that is not the intent and so what I I'm
 
01:30:55.590 --> 01:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
going to read what passed around but you
 
01:30:58.709 --> 01:30:58.719 align:start position:0%
can look at it as well I have one cop
 
01:31:00.669 --> 01:31:00.679 align:start position:0%
yeah I you can give it to Peter or or
 
01:31:01.950 --> 01:31:01.960 align:start position:0%
someone out there if they want it or
 
01:31:05.950 --> 01:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
whatever but I'll read it so the first
 
01:31:07.550 --> 01:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
sentence is the same the protection of
 
01:31:09.070 --> 01:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
health and safety is of utmost
 
01:31:10.830 --> 01:31:10.840 align:start position:0%
importance to New Hampshire state
 
01:31:12.430 --> 01:31:12.440 align:start position:0%
government and the consumers of the
 
01:31:15.070 --> 01:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
state and then it says at the same time
 
01:31:17.390 --> 01:31:17.400 align:start position:0%
the general court recognizes the right
 
01:31:19.229 --> 01:31:19.239 align:start position:0%
of an individual to pursue a lawful
 
01:31:22.030 --> 01:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
occupation is a fundamental right and
 
01:31:23.910 --> 01:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
then lastly the purpose of this act is
 
01:31:25.950 --> 01:31:25.960 align:start position:0%
is to require the legislature to
 
01:31:27.790 --> 01:31:27.800 align:start position:0%
reexamine the licensing Boards of the
 
01:31:30.109 --> 01:31:30.119 align:start position:0%
state to determine if the balance of
 
01:31:31.709 --> 01:31:31.719 align:start position:0%
those two important interests has being
 
01:31:34.229 --> 01:31:34.239 align:start position:0%
done properly and to suggest any
 
01:31:37.990 --> 01:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
improvements oh my so that's not
 
01:31:40.109 --> 01:31:40.119 align:start position:0%
presuming what the outcome is is going
 
01:31:41.830 --> 01:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
to be correct and it's not saying
 
01:31:44.109 --> 01:31:44.119 align:start position:0%
there's only two options All or Nothing
 
01:31:47.910 --> 01:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
correct um and lays out the general
 
01:31:50.830 --> 01:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
issues y i i I think you started out on
 
01:31:54.109 --> 01:31:54.119 align:start position:0%
the right note by saying when I saw the
 
01:31:55.990 --> 01:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
bill and said
 
01:31:59.310 --> 01:31:59.320 align:start position:0%
Sunset swipe clean everything wipe
 
01:32:01.030 --> 01:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
everything off the board and we don't
 
01:32:03.629 --> 01:32:03.639 align:start position:0%
need that's a threat to the public
 
01:32:05.910 --> 01:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
safety to begin with right now if you
 
01:32:07.830 --> 01:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
read the if you read even the original
 
01:32:11.669 --> 01:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
bill you know the body of the bill was
 
01:32:13.030 --> 01:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
that the commission's supposed to you
 
01:32:13.990 --> 01:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
know it's got all the things they're
 
01:32:15.470 --> 01:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
supposed to look at and all the options
 
01:32:17.470 --> 01:32:17.480 align:start position:0%
they can take one is to leave it alone
 
01:32:20.229 --> 01:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
one is to get rid of it I would be very
 
01:32:23.149 --> 01:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
surprised if uh such a commission would
 
01:32:26.590 --> 01:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
actually eliminate all regulation uh of
 
01:32:28.070 --> 01:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
any kind for the professions and that
 
01:32:29.950 --> 01:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
wasn't the intent but I understand why
 
01:32:31.990 --> 01:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
it was perceived that way and we'll get
 
01:32:33.950 --> 01:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
to the repeal issue I've got suggestions
 
01:32:37.030 --> 01:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
for that U but I at the moment I'd like
 
01:32:38.910 --> 01:32:38.920 align:start position:0%
to just see if people are happy with
 
01:32:42.030 --> 01:32:42.040 align:start position:0%
this change to the purpose I sorry I
 
01:32:44.189 --> 01:32:44.199 align:start position:0%
will in a no rep you continue and then
 
01:32:49.149 --> 01:32:49.159 align:start position:0%
we'll get to okay uh the I that makes me
 
01:32:51.750 --> 01:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
really so much more comfortable because
 
01:32:54.590 --> 01:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
I came in this morning thinking there's
 
01:32:57.149 --> 01:32:57.159 align:start position:0%
no way we can get rid of Medical Board
 
01:32:59.830 --> 01:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
starting from next year Sunset
 
01:33:03.390 --> 01:33:03.400 align:start position:0%
everything I mean this is total never
 
01:33:06.390 --> 01:33:06.400 align:start position:0%
intent yeah so uh I
 
01:33:10.830 --> 01:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
think and this is a huge task just like
 
01:33:13.830 --> 01:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
this uh body this committee did last
 
01:33:16.709 --> 01:33:16.719 align:start position:0%
year Shifting the oplc responsibility to
 
01:33:21.070 --> 01:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
oplc that was a major overhaul that took
 
01:33:23.870 --> 01:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
this committee a lot I I was not on it
 
01:33:25.470 --> 01:33:25.480 align:start position:0%
right but I can
 
01:33:29.109 --> 01:33:29.119 align:start position:0%
see this cannot be done in a haste
 
01:33:32.550 --> 01:33:32.560 align:start position:0%
correct and this would jeopardize the
 
01:33:36.669 --> 01:33:36.679 align:start position:0%
safety and integrity of our licensing
 
01:33:40.109 --> 01:33:40.119 align:start position:0%
system and and you get the the and how
 
01:33:42.109 --> 01:33:42.119 align:start position:0%
to deal with repeals there's some other
 
01:33:44.310 --> 01:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
stuff there to help with that so you
 
01:33:46.229 --> 01:33:46.239 align:start position:0%
know the part of the reason it was
 
01:33:49.229 --> 01:33:49.239 align:start position:0%
spread out is a concern that if the
 
01:33:51.350 --> 01:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
commission had too much dumped on it too
 
01:33:52.950 --> 01:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
quickly the easiest thing to deal with
 
01:33:54.629 --> 01:33:54.639 align:start position:0%
it is just say leave everything alone
 
01:33:56.830 --> 01:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
and not really take a good enough look
 
01:33:59.229 --> 01:33:59.239 align:start position:0%
to see if there are changes needed um I
 
01:34:01.430 --> 01:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
don't want that and I didn't expect
 
01:34:03.109 --> 01:34:03.119 align:start position:0%
they're going to say well we'll just get
 
01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
rid of it I mean that's um and and um
 
01:34:08.590 --> 01:34:08.600 align:start position:0%
and what we did last year was more
 
01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
looking at the overall structure of
 
01:34:13.149 --> 01:34:13.159 align:start position:0%
Licensing and the relationship between
 
01:34:14.310 --> 01:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
the boards and
 
01:34:17.109 --> 01:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
oplc and we did some stuff I hope to
 
01:34:19.229 --> 01:34:19.239 align:start position:0%
make that better this is having the
 
01:34:21.390 --> 01:34:21.400 align:start position:0%
commission look at individual boards and
 
01:34:23.870 --> 01:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
how what's going on there I mean they
 
01:34:25.229 --> 01:34:25.239 align:start position:0%
could make recommendations for the
 
01:34:27.629 --> 01:34:27.639 align:start position:0%
overall structure but it's more to look
 
01:34:31.270 --> 01:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
at you know each profession and is what
 
01:34:34.030 --> 01:34:34.040 align:start position:0%
we're doing making the right the correct
 
01:34:35.910 --> 01:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
the best balance possible between public
 
01:34:38.310 --> 01:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
health and safety and you know people's
 
01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
right to to uh to work and for the
 
01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
consumer's right to have people to do
 
01:34:45.229 --> 01:34:45.239 align:start position:0%
the service yes yeah um so in that
 
01:34:48.270 --> 01:34:48.280 align:start position:0%
regard don't you think it would be
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
prudent on this committee's part to say
 
01:34:56.270 --> 01:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
major changes happened last year the
 
01:34:59.310 --> 01:34:59.320 align:start position:0%
rule it hasn't been implemented oplc
 
01:35:01.750 --> 01:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
hasn't taken over or the boards haven't
 
01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
had a chance to readjust to the
 
01:35:11.550 --> 01:35:11.560 align:start position:0%
new uh regulations or new roles and
 
01:35:13.950 --> 01:35:13.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility instead of trying and
 
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
saying which one will go which one you
 
01:35:19.870 --> 01:35:19.880 align:start position:0%
know let's put this in a interim study
 
01:35:23.109 --> 01:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
and let's say okay let this will happen
 
01:35:26.910 --> 01:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
so the next term it will have an at
 
01:35:28.950 --> 01:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
least you would have had the rulle
 
01:35:31.950 --> 01:35:31.960 align:start position:0%
making happen with major overhaul from
 
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
last term what I'd like to do yeah I I
 
01:35:37.669 --> 01:35:37.679 align:start position:0%
would oppose that but um not that it's
 
01:35:40.390 --> 01:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
completely up to me but um what I what
 
01:35:42.590 --> 01:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
I'm asking if we can go through and deal
 
01:35:46.390 --> 01:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
with these three issues and see if we
 
01:35:48.430 --> 01:35:48.440 align:start position:0%
might still say because of that issue
 
01:35:50.750 --> 01:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
you raised we don't want to pass this
 
01:35:52.390 --> 01:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
bill now that's fine or for other
 
01:35:54.350 --> 01:35:54.360 align:start position:0%
reasons whatever reason
 
01:35:58.390 --> 01:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to go through um three
 
01:36:00.990 --> 01:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
pieces and see you know if we feel this
 
01:36:02.709 --> 01:36:02.719 align:start position:0%
would make you know be an improvement to
 
01:36:08.189 --> 01:36:08.199 align:start position:0%
the bill if we chose to pass it and then
 
01:36:10.750 --> 01:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
um then we can
 
01:36:13.350 --> 01:36:13.360 align:start position:0%
address the overall recommendation to
 
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
the committee if if that's
 
01:36:20.229 --> 01:36:20.239 align:start position:0%
okay so Mr chair do you want a motion on
 
01:36:22.629 --> 01:36:22.639 align:start position:0%
this or just an agreement a motion on
 
01:36:25.830 --> 01:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
this that that um the committee would
 
01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
like to see the statement of purpose
 
01:36:30.709 --> 01:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
changed in this way okay I actually
 
01:36:34.629 --> 01:36:34.639 align:start position:0%
represent well you got a I do have brief
 
01:36:39.550 --> 01:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
yeah okay Co thank you Mr chairman so uh
 
01:36:40.590 --> 01:36:40.600 align:start position:0%
I think you're moving in the right
 
01:36:43.950 --> 01:36:43.960 align:start position:0%
direction generally um but I I think
 
01:36:45.750 --> 01:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
there are some aspects that need to be
 
01:36:48.750 --> 01:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
addressed so I the first sentence I
 
01:36:52.030 --> 01:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
think is needs to be changed to say the
 
01:36:55.109 --> 01:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
citizens of this state not the consumers
 
01:36:57.910 --> 01:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
because you can be somebody who's uh not
 
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
a consumer but you're going like this is
 
01:37:03.189 --> 01:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
just wrong uh so I I think you should
 
01:37:06.629 --> 01:37:06.639 align:start position:0%
say citizens but well if if I can
 
01:37:09.629 --> 01:37:09.639 align:start position:0%
comment briefly just on that one I just
 
01:37:11.390 --> 01:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
because somebody doesn't like it and
 
01:37:14.189 --> 01:37:14.199 align:start position:0%
they say it's just wrong I don't know
 
01:37:16.470 --> 01:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
that that's leg now now you could argue
 
01:37:19.830 --> 01:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
that um you know somebody practicing
 
01:37:23.109 --> 01:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
profession doing something wrong could
 
01:37:24.629 --> 01:37:24.639 align:start position:0%
have a health and safety impact on
 
01:37:25.669 --> 01:37:25.679 align:start position:0%
something somebody other than the
 
01:37:27.070 --> 01:37:27.080 align:start position:0%
Consumer so I'm actually fine with
 
01:37:28.270 --> 01:37:28.280 align:start position:0%
changing that
 
01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
word right that I accept your offer yeah
 
01:37:44.910 --> 01:37:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:48.310 --> 01:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
secondly yeah I know we could go through
 
01:37:51.790 --> 01:37:51.800 align:start position:0%
it sentence by S you know okay the
 
01:37:54.589 --> 01:37:54.599 align:start position:0%
second sentence ize the right of an
 
01:37:58.310 --> 01:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
individual to pursue a lawful occupation
 
01:38:02.470 --> 01:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
I I think that's also questionable
 
01:38:07.030 --> 01:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
because uh some people could not
 
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
legitimately P pursue a lawful
 
01:38:13.870 --> 01:38:13.880 align:start position:0%
occupation because they have a criminal
 
01:38:16.430 --> 01:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
background uh that would I mean somebody
 
01:38:19.030 --> 01:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
who's guilty of been convicted of
 
01:38:23.910 --> 01:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
assault uh should not be uh in permitted
 
01:38:27.310 --> 01:38:27.320 align:start position:0%
to to uh practice a profession where
 
01:38:30.589 --> 01:38:30.599 align:start position:0%
they going to put hands on other people
 
01:38:33.229 --> 01:38:33.239 align:start position:0%
well what yeah what I'm look what I
 
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
think this is trying to do is say there
 
01:38:37.109 --> 01:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
I know where you're coming from I just
 
01:38:42.270 --> 01:38:42.280 align:start position:0%
think to say uh the right of an IND
 
01:38:45.189 --> 01:38:45.199 align:start position:0%
individual is absolutely in question
 
01:38:47.510 --> 01:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
depending on what that individual's P
 
01:38:49.350 --> 01:38:49.360 align:start position:0%
history is there there are limitations
 
01:38:51.030 --> 01:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
on almost all right so I'd like uh
 
01:38:53.589 --> 01:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
director Courtney or somebody from lplc
 
01:38:55.790 --> 01:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
I recall and I you know before we did
 
01:38:57.790 --> 01:38:57.800 align:start position:0%
all this stuff last year there was
 
01:38:59.189 --> 01:38:59.199 align:start position:0%
somewhere in statute and I don't know if
 
01:39:01.390 --> 01:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
it's still there that actually basically
 
01:39:04.750 --> 01:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
made this statement that people had the
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
right and if you know where that is yes
 
01:39:08.830 --> 01:39:08.840 align:start position:0%
it was in
 
01:39:13.270 --> 01:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
332g was it 12 I believe it was repealed
 
01:39:17.589 --> 01:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
as part of an amendment however
 
01:39:21.629 --> 01:39:21.639 align:start position:0%
um I mean obviously you you've put that
 
01:39:24.350 --> 01:39:24.360 align:start position:0%
amended language back in this bill
 
01:39:28.750 --> 01:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
um I've always questioned though what
 
01:39:30.910 --> 01:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
that actually means because when we talk
 
01:39:32.629 --> 01:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
about fundamental rights we're thinking
 
01:39:35.510 --> 01:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
about constitutional rights and you
 
01:39:38.950 --> 01:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
can't create a constitutional right in
 
01:39:42.430 --> 01:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
statute I think you know so the
 
01:39:44.229 --> 01:39:44.239 align:start position:0%
fundamental right language is a term of
 
01:39:44.239 --> 01:39:45.310 align:start position:0%
fundamental right language is a term of
art

01:39:45.310 --> 01:39:45.320 align:start position:0%
art
 
01:39:47.870 --> 01:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
constitutionally um that said you know I
 
01:39:49.709 --> 01:39:49.719 align:start position:0%
think it's it definitely demonstrates
 
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
that the legislature's intent which is
 
01:39:54.350 --> 01:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
that the right to pursue an occupation
 
01:39:56.750 --> 01:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
um is an important interest I mean would
 
01:39:58.709 --> 01:39:58.719 align:start position:0%
you feel more comfortable if the word
 
01:40:00.550 --> 01:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
fundamental were
 
01:40:02.950 --> 01:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
removed I'll ask you and
 
01:40:05.109 --> 01:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
then I mean I'm not uncomfortable with
 
01:40:07.510 --> 01:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
the language generally I just don't I
 
01:40:10.350 --> 01:40:10.360 align:start position:0%
just think that the fundamental right
 
01:40:12.709 --> 01:40:12.719 align:start position:0%
speaks usually to substantive rights
 
01:40:14.390 --> 01:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
established by the Constitution that's
 
01:40:16.109 --> 01:40:16.119 align:start position:0%
why I was trying to deal with that issue
 
01:40:18.790 --> 01:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
by taking the word out yeah I think he
 
01:40:23.669 --> 01:40:23.679 align:start position:0%
would eliminate that confusion
 
01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
grammatically that would be strange if
 
01:40:26.950 --> 01:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
you just took that word out I think no
 
01:40:29.189 --> 01:40:29.199 align:start position:0%
it's it would say and right to pursue a
 
01:40:31.750 --> 01:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
lawful is a right yeah and that's not
 
01:40:34.750 --> 01:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
grammatical I don't Mr chair I have a
 
01:40:37.390 --> 01:40:37.400 align:start position:0%
fundamental question certain all right
 
01:40:39.950 --> 01:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
fundament I have a fundamental question
 
01:40:41.589 --> 01:40:41.599 align:start position:0%
so when you
 
01:40:44.990 --> 01:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
say individual to pursue a lawful
 
01:40:47.350 --> 01:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
occupation is a
 
01:40:50.669 --> 01:40:50.679 align:start position:0%
right is that refering to not having
 
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
licensing not having any structure
 
01:40:56.510 --> 01:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing it has just like my First
 
01:40:58.750 --> 01:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment right or Second Amendment
 
01:41:02.030 --> 01:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
right I don't need to be told how to
 
01:41:05.229 --> 01:41:05.239 align:start position:0%
practice my profession am I totally off
 
01:41:09.550 --> 01:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
or is my reading anywhere in the area I
 
01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
I I can answer then if somebody else has
 
01:41:14.950 --> 01:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
something but if you look at any of the
 
01:41:17.550 --> 01:41:17.560 align:start position:0%
rights even the ones that are in the
 
01:41:20.990 --> 01:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution um there's always you have
 
01:41:26.229 --> 01:41:26.239 align:start position:0%
a right but there is um it can be
 
01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
restricted if in you know to protect
 
01:41:30.270 --> 01:41:30.280 align:start position:0%
things like public health and safety you
 
01:41:31.830 --> 01:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
need to exercise the right in a
 
01:41:34.910 --> 01:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
responsible manner I mean if my only
 
01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
experience is a car mechanic and I'm
 
01:41:37.950 --> 01:41:37.960 align:start position:0%
going to I'm want to practice brain
 
01:41:41.589 --> 01:41:41.599 align:start position:0%
surgery clearly you know do I have a
 
01:41:44.589 --> 01:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
right to in a sense you do but that
 
01:41:46.669 --> 01:41:46.679 align:start position:0%
right can be limited everybody has that
 
01:41:48.510 --> 01:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
General right but the right can be
 
01:41:50.229 --> 01:41:50.239 align:start position:0%
limited if what you're going to do is
 
01:41:51.510 --> 01:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
going to threaten public health and safy
 
01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
so what I'm trying to do here is say
 
01:41:55.790 --> 01:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
you know protecting public health and
 
01:41:58.990 --> 01:41:59.000 align:start position:0%
safety is very important people have in
 
01:42:01.470 --> 01:42:01.480 align:start position:0%
general a right to practice their
 
01:42:03.790 --> 01:42:03.800 align:start position:0%
profession and what I'm looking for the
 
01:42:08.189 --> 01:42:08.199 align:start position:0%
commission to do is to to look at how
 
01:42:11.390 --> 01:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
we're balancing those to right are we
 
01:42:13.990 --> 01:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
protecting public health and safety you
 
01:42:18.430 --> 01:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
know well well enough um while still you
 
01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
know in in intruding on that right as
 
01:42:23.950 --> 01:42:23.960 align:start position:0%
little as necessary okay that and that's
 
01:42:26.910 --> 01:42:26.920 align:start position:0%
done with almost any right I can't think
 
01:42:28.910 --> 01:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
off hand of one maybe there's one but
 
01:42:31.790 --> 01:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
one where that's not the case I I get
 
01:42:36.470 --> 01:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
your point but practicing a profession
 
01:42:40.030 --> 01:42:40.040 align:start position:0%
is a much more
 
01:42:44.470 --> 01:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
responsible higher responsibility on the
 
01:42:47.790 --> 01:42:47.800 align:start position:0%
practicing person's shoulder so I might
 
01:42:51.669 --> 01:42:51.679 align:start position:0%
be a great Veterinary uh brain surgeon
 
01:42:54.629 --> 01:42:54.639 align:start position:0%
can I just say oh I'm so good at brain
 
01:42:57.910 --> 01:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
surgery I'm going to go do it on human
 
01:43:00.470 --> 01:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
so you know what difference does it make
 
01:43:02.990 --> 01:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
so that kind of you know we are in the
 
01:43:05.709 --> 01:43:05.719 align:start position:0%
general area
 
01:43:09.550 --> 01:43:09.560 align:start position:0%
so the light the way I'm looking at this
 
01:43:14.950 --> 01:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
in a context of these commissions the uh
 
01:43:19.030 --> 01:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
licensing why do we have these things to
 
01:43:22.990 --> 01:43:23.000 align:start position:0%
protect the general public which is why
 
01:43:25.310 --> 01:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
that which is the first line and the
 
01:43:29.030 --> 01:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
second line when you say practicing a
 
01:43:32.669 --> 01:43:32.679 align:start position:0%
professional is a fundamental right I
 
01:43:36.990 --> 01:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
think it contradicts to some extent so I
 
01:43:38.790 --> 01:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
could say hey I'm not allowed to
 
01:43:42.709 --> 01:43:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:45.790 --> 01:43:45.800 align:start position:0%
on animals whatever right and you know
 
01:43:47.510 --> 01:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
that' be okay taking pH on out because
 
01:43:49.990 --> 01:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
it has some right you know it's a term
 
01:43:52.109 --> 01:43:52.119 align:start position:0%
of Art in law which might I could see be
 
01:43:55.550 --> 01:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
an issue um but but I will in a moment
 
01:43:59.709 --> 01:43:59.719 align:start position:0%
but actually after bre around but sorry
 
01:44:01.629 --> 01:44:01.639 align:start position:0%
um and I don't want to go in circles but
 
01:44:04.109 --> 01:44:04.119 align:start position:0%
you know anytime you're looking
 
01:44:08.470 --> 01:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
at you it's up to the
 
01:44:10.990 --> 01:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
legislature to do this balancing which
 
01:44:12.350 --> 01:44:12.360 align:start position:0%
has been going on and all we're saying
 
01:44:14.149 --> 01:44:14.159 align:start position:0%
is take a look at how it's being done
 
01:44:18.950 --> 01:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
now and is it being done in the best way
 
01:44:22.510 --> 01:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
right is it both protecting the public
 
01:44:24.750 --> 01:44:24.760 align:start position:0%
and imping ing on people's right to to
 
01:44:28.189 --> 01:44:28.199 align:start position:0%
work how they want the least and you
 
01:44:31.270 --> 01:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
know I would guess that having a
 
01:44:33.669 --> 01:44:33.679 align:start position:0%
Veterinary surgeon doing brain surgery
 
01:44:36.350 --> 01:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
on people is the the you know the
 
01:44:37.550 --> 01:44:37.560 align:start position:0%
commission and the legislature
 
01:44:39.990 --> 01:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
determined that that's not you know
 
01:44:41.629 --> 01:44:41.639 align:start position:0%
that's not adequately protecting public
 
01:44:44.790 --> 01:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
health and safety I I would be amazed
 
01:44:47.669 --> 01:44:47.679 align:start position:0%
and shocked if they said otherwise and
 
01:44:49.470 --> 01:44:49.480 align:start position:0%
wonder what was going on but so with
 
01:44:52.470 --> 01:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
that the whole language of the bill
 
01:44:56.709 --> 01:44:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:59.470 --> 01:44:59.480 align:start position:0%
commission well we we'll get to the
 
01:45:02.430 --> 01:45:02.440 align:start position:0%
various occupation boards I mean the
 
01:45:04.189 --> 01:45:04.199 align:start position:0%
whole this is what we did with the other
 
01:45:06.830 --> 01:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
one reciprocity because the
 
01:45:09.950 --> 01:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
whole the language of the
 
01:45:14.350 --> 01:45:14.360 align:start position:0%
bill didn't Express what was really the
 
01:45:17.950 --> 01:45:17.960 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill right we itell that I
 
01:45:20.950 --> 01:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
don't know about I mean I I think the
 
01:45:24.030 --> 01:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
intent there was we want as much
 
01:45:27.030 --> 01:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
um um licensing by endorsement is
 
01:45:30.470 --> 01:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
possible but it's got to make sense and
 
01:45:33.510 --> 01:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
we gave the authority to oplc to
 
01:45:34.950 --> 01:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
determine that through rul making and
 
01:45:38.189 --> 01:45:38.199 align:start position:0%
they're in the middle of doing it and
 
01:45:40.669 --> 01:45:40.679 align:start position:0%
I've actually reviewed it and I it's it
 
01:45:42.149 --> 01:45:42.159 align:start position:0%
looks reasonable I haven't looked at it
 
01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
in great detail hopefully there's a lot
 
01:45:44.709 --> 01:45:44.719 align:start position:0%
of people I'm sure they are looking at
 
01:45:47.950 --> 01:45:47.960 align:start position:0%
it but if in the end like any other rule
 
01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
the legislature decides they didn't make
 
01:45:52.750 --> 01:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
the right call the legislature has the
 
01:45:55.870 --> 01:45:55.880 align:start position:0%
right and the ability to impose a change
 
01:45:59.830 --> 01:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
but but I agree that that one you know
 
01:46:00.950 --> 01:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
because they're in the middle of
 
01:46:02.229 --> 01:46:02.239 align:start position:0%
actually implementing what we told them
 
01:46:04.990 --> 01:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
to implement to let it play out this is
 
01:46:06.950 --> 01:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
more dealing with the individual boards
 
01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
and what we did last time was much
 
01:46:12.709 --> 01:46:12.719 align:start position:0%
less you know changing what the
 
01:46:14.270 --> 01:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
licensing is than more the
 
01:46:16.990 --> 01:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
administrative structure within the
 
01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.950 align:start position:0%
administrative structure within the
whole

01:46:18.950 --> 01:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
whole
 
01:46:22.109 --> 01:46:22.119 align:start position:0%
department sir yeah one more and then I
 
01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
got to let other people
 
01:46:26.589 --> 01:46:26.599 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so just like what
 
01:46:30.350 --> 01:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
did we did with the previous Bill where
 
01:46:32.270 --> 01:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
the medical technician it didn't make
 
01:46:34.990 --> 01:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
sense it didn't exist we pulled it out
 
01:46:39.709 --> 01:46:39.719 align:start position:0%
right so that was and then we left LNA
 
01:46:42.270 --> 01:46:42.280 align:start position:0%
which is great so that's what the LI
 
01:46:45.109 --> 01:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
that's what the legislature does in this
 
01:46:47.589 --> 01:46:47.599 align:start position:0%
case I think it's a
 
01:46:50.990 --> 01:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
sweeping whopping change that the
 
01:46:54.510 --> 01:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
legislation this particular bill is
 
01:46:57.430 --> 01:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
saying change the fundamentally what we
 
01:46:59.109 --> 01:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
are trying to do that's how I'm seeing
 
01:47:01.189 --> 01:47:01.199 align:start position:0%
it so I can kind of see that I'll just
 
01:47:03.270 --> 01:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
respond quickly and then Brown gold and
 
01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:04.750 align:start position:0%
respond quickly and then Brown gold and
Schmid

01:47:04.750 --> 01:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
Schmid
 
01:47:07.310 --> 01:47:07.320 align:start position:0%
um it it is
 
01:47:10.669 --> 01:47:10.679 align:start position:0%
requiring a review of all of the boards
 
01:47:12.229 --> 01:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
that are listed in there so in that
 
01:47:14.350 --> 01:47:14.360 align:start position:0%
sense it's sweepy but the idea is what
 
01:47:16.030 --> 01:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
they're told to do commission is just
 
01:47:18.510 --> 01:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
look at each one individually I mean
 
01:47:19.830 --> 01:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
they could do them in parallel what
 
01:47:22.430 --> 01:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
however the commission decides to go but
 
01:47:24.189 --> 01:47:24.199 align:start position:0%
but to take a look at the details of
 
01:47:28.510 --> 01:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
each one and in the my change to the
 
01:47:31.510 --> 01:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
statement of purpose the original one
 
01:47:33.870 --> 01:47:33.880 align:start position:0%
seemed to imply an assumption that
 
01:47:35.270 --> 01:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
either we're going to leave it the way
 
01:47:37.910 --> 01:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
it is or get rid of it which was not the
 
01:47:40.229 --> 01:47:40.239 align:start position:0%
rest of the bill doesn't say that and so
 
01:47:41.669 --> 01:47:41.679 align:start position:0%
the statement of purpose was not
 
01:47:43.189 --> 01:47:43.199 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the bill and it wasn't
 
01:47:45.510 --> 01:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
the intended purpose so my intent here
 
01:47:50.229 --> 01:47:50.239 align:start position:0%
is to say the job of the commission is
 
01:47:53.030 --> 01:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
to take these two competing interests
 
01:47:54.950 --> 01:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
clearly there's an interest in Pro in
 
01:47:57.350 --> 01:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
protecting public health and safety and
 
01:47:59.750 --> 01:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
there's an interest in you know people
 
01:48:01.470 --> 01:48:01.480 align:start position:0%
do have the right to pursue their
 
01:48:03.430 --> 01:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
profession unless you know unless
 
01:48:05.070 --> 01:48:05.080 align:start position:0%
there's a reasonable government interest
 
01:48:08.830 --> 01:48:08.840 align:start position:0%
in in in interfering I mean if if the
 
01:48:11.430 --> 01:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
boards went too or oplc went too far and
 
01:48:14.350 --> 01:48:14.360 align:start position:0%
limiting it you know people could sue on
 
01:48:17.149 --> 01:48:17.159 align:start position:0%
that and and if it's you know
 
01:48:18.550 --> 01:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
unreasonable what they're doing they
 
01:48:21.070 --> 01:48:21.080 align:start position:0%
would probably win this is saying look
 
01:48:23.550 --> 01:48:23.560 align:start position:0%
at it now and say do we think does the
 
01:48:26.589 --> 01:48:26.599 align:start position:0%
legislature think in each case we're
 
01:48:28.229 --> 01:48:28.239 align:start position:0%
striking that balance right and we're
 
01:48:30.030 --> 01:48:30.040 align:start position:0%
doing it in an efficient way in a way
 
01:48:32.510 --> 01:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
that protects public health and safety
 
01:48:36.070 --> 01:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
while interfering with people working as
 
01:48:37.470 --> 01:48:37.480 align:start position:0%
you know no more than
 
01:48:40.470 --> 01:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
necessary and that and I my intent was
 
01:48:41.790 --> 01:48:41.800 align:start position:0%
the purp you know the statement of
 
01:48:44.750 --> 01:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
purpose that I revised one is intended
 
01:48:46.229 --> 01:48:46.239 align:start position:0%
that so representative
 
01:48:50.870 --> 01:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
Brown uh thank you Mr chair so um uh I
 
01:48:53.189 --> 01:48:53.199 align:start position:0%
appreciate what you did here rewriting a
 
01:48:54.830 --> 01:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
statement of
 
01:48:57.109 --> 01:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
purpose every Bill we have that has a
 
01:48:59.589 --> 01:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
statement of purpose I always read it
 
01:49:01.350 --> 01:49:01.360 align:start position:0%
because somewhere down the road 10 years
 
01:49:03.149 --> 01:49:03.159 align:start position:0%
down the road someone's going to say why
 
01:49:06.470 --> 01:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
did you do this and that's kind of what
 
01:49:08.109 --> 01:49:08.119 align:start position:0%
that statement of purpose is meant to
 
01:49:11.310 --> 01:49:11.320 align:start position:0%
say why did we follow this path so I
 
01:49:13.310 --> 01:49:13.320 align:start position:0%
like that you're trying to make it to
 
01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
make it uh more sensible I think so
 
01:49:19.750 --> 01:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
without upsetting anyone in the gallery
 
01:49:22.750 --> 01:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
or creating an individual opinion here
 
01:49:25.270 --> 01:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
here I will say that on line three in
 
01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:26.310 align:start position:0%
here I will say that on line three in
the

01:49:26.310 --> 01:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
original at the same time the general
 
01:49:31.350 --> 01:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
court recognizes that over regulation is
 
01:49:33.910 --> 01:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
a barrier to obtaining a
 
01:49:37.189 --> 01:49:37.199 align:start position:0%
license it may be that the governor's
 
01:49:38.950 --> 01:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
office feels that's the case and maybe
 
01:49:40.669 --> 01:49:40.679 align:start position:0%
that's the impetus to some of this I'm
 
01:49:43.189 --> 01:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
not speaking for the governor's office
 
01:49:46.030 --> 01:49:46.040 align:start position:0%
but there are certainly a a number
 
01:49:49.510 --> 01:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
of certain Representatives with a
 
01:49:51.430 --> 01:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
political persuasion that would agree
 
01:49:53.510 --> 01:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
with that statement
 
01:49:55.750 --> 01:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
that if you're over regulating people
 
01:49:57.589 --> 01:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
it's too hard for them to get a
 
01:50:01.350 --> 01:50:01.360 align:start position:0%
license now could we add to your
 
01:50:03.870 --> 01:50:03.880 align:start position:0%
language and you may disagree and that
 
01:50:05.629 --> 01:50:05.639 align:start position:0%
just give me one more 30 seconds here
 
01:50:08.109 --> 01:50:08.119 align:start position:0%
sure no so to your sentence where you
 
01:50:09.830 --> 01:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
say at the same time dur Court recognize
 
01:50:12.109 --> 01:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
the right of an individual to pursue a
 
01:50:14.910 --> 01:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
lawful occupation could we add something
 
01:50:18.270 --> 01:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
to the effect without burdensome
 
01:50:20.390 --> 01:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
regulation or something of that nature
 
01:50:23.390 --> 01:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
because that some that ENT is coming
 
01:50:26.790 --> 01:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
from somewhere and um I think that there
 
01:50:29.070 --> 01:50:29.080 align:start position:0%
is some support for that conversation in
 
01:50:33.350 --> 01:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
the legislature I I I recognize that
 
01:50:36.990 --> 01:50:37.000 align:start position:0%
um what I tried to do
 
01:50:40.229 --> 01:50:40.239 align:start position:0%
is you know is which is sort of sat of
 
01:50:42.030 --> 01:50:42.040 align:start position:0%
purposes should be relatively it's
 
01:50:45.430 --> 01:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
represent G and then you is uh is you
 
01:50:47.550 --> 01:50:47.560 align:start position:0%
know tend to be they should be I think
 
01:50:50.709 --> 01:50:50.719 align:start position:0%
fairly General um and the issue around
 
01:50:52.709 --> 01:50:52.719 align:start position:0%
over I mean overregulation
 
01:50:55.109 --> 01:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
it's open to interpretation it's it's
 
01:50:56.510 --> 01:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
kind of True by definition
 
01:50:59.790 --> 01:50:59.800 align:start position:0%
overregulation is a barrier sure but but
 
01:51:01.709 --> 01:51:01.719 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of you know and I'm this
 
01:51:05.950 --> 01:51:05.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any um decision as to what
 
01:51:07.950 --> 01:51:07.960 align:start position:0%
what is overregulation what isn't that's
 
01:51:09.870 --> 01:51:09.880 align:start position:0%
the commission and then the legislature
 
01:51:12.310 --> 01:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
but I think what you're looking for is
 
01:51:13.750 --> 01:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
kind of included in the last sentence
 
01:51:15.270 --> 01:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the ACT is to require the
 
01:51:17.669 --> 01:51:17.679 align:start position:0%
legislature to reexamine the licensing
 
01:51:19.350 --> 01:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
board to determine if the balance of
 
01:51:20.830 --> 01:51:20.840 align:start position:0%
those important interests would be done
 
01:51:22.589 --> 01:51:22.599 align:start position:0%
properly and suggests any Improvement
 
01:51:25.310 --> 01:51:25.320 align:start position:0%
ments because you know if the commission
 
01:51:27.910 --> 01:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
thinks there's overregulation then they
 
01:51:29.510 --> 01:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
presumably think the balance isn't been
 
01:51:30.910 --> 01:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
made appropriately and they would offer
 
01:51:34.229 --> 01:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
some suggestions for legislation to to
 
01:51:38.669 --> 01:51:38.679 align:start position:0%
fix that to make a change so I I'm I
 
01:51:41.550 --> 01:51:41.560 align:start position:0%
don't you're not wrong but I'm resisting
 
01:51:43.950 --> 01:51:43.960 align:start position:0%
trying to add more stuff in here on
 
01:51:47.069 --> 01:51:47.079 align:start position:0%
specifics I don't think it's helpful I'm
 
01:51:49.109 --> 01:51:49.119 align:start position:0%
uh thank you I'm okay with that I just
 
01:51:50.750 --> 01:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure we talked about it
 
01:51:52.910 --> 01:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
represent thank you
 
01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:51:55.440 --> 01:51:57.109 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:00.750 --> 01:52:00.760 align:start position:0%
so I I really like I I started out with
 
01:52:05.510 --> 01:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
like the change in this away from um the
 
01:52:08.629 --> 01:52:08.639 align:start position:0%
language that we had that the bill came
 
01:52:10.310 --> 01:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
to us
 
01:52:14.550 --> 01:52:14.560 align:start position:0%
with and in talking with um some of the
 
01:52:16.629 --> 01:52:16.639 align:start position:0%
folks who testified last time after the
 
01:52:19.950 --> 01:52:19.960 align:start position:0%
hearing you know this totally changes
 
01:52:21.790 --> 01:52:21.800 align:start position:0%
the flavor which is what they were
 
01:52:24.510 --> 01:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
looking for was that we not start out
 
01:52:25.750 --> 01:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
with the attitude of we're going to
 
01:52:28.229 --> 01:52:28.239 align:start position:0%
eliminate some of the conversation I've
 
01:52:31.589 --> 01:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
been listening to right now has sounded
 
01:52:33.470 --> 01:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
a little partisan and I really hope we
 
01:52:36.310 --> 01:52:36.320 align:start position:0%
can stay out of the partisan nature of
 
01:52:39.669 --> 01:52:39.679 align:start position:0%
this and and all have a head toward
 
01:52:43.510 --> 01:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
what's going to serve our um citizens
 
01:52:46.109 --> 01:52:46.119 align:start position:0%
who are also consumers and by the way on
 
01:52:48.229 --> 01:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
that word the thing earlier I wanted to
 
01:52:50.950 --> 01:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
say is that I I would hope we also want
 
01:52:55.390 --> 01:52:55.400 align:start position:0%
to protect visitors to our state who are
 
01:52:57.950 --> 01:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
um partaking of any of the services
 
01:52:59.470 --> 01:52:59.480 align:start position:0%
while they're passing through that they
 
01:53:01.750 --> 01:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
also have a confidence they were
 
01:53:04.990 --> 01:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
protecting them so I I don't think the
 
01:53:07.910 --> 01:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
word matters so much as the protection
 
01:53:11.750 --> 01:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
and and I kind of like what
 
01:53:14.189 --> 01:53:14.199 align:start position:0%
representative um Brown was saying by
 
01:53:15.990 --> 01:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
adding without the burden of
 
01:53:18.430 --> 01:53:18.440 align:start position:0%
overregulation and you put the over in
 
01:53:20.910 --> 01:53:20.920 align:start position:0%
there but I also agree with you that if
 
01:53:22.990 --> 01:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
it's going to make it more partisan
 
01:53:26.750 --> 01:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
sounding and um difficult for people to
 
01:53:28.830 --> 01:53:28.840 align:start position:0%
be able to understand the concept here
 
01:53:30.270 --> 01:53:30.280 align:start position:0%
which the concept is that we want to
 
01:53:32.669 --> 01:53:32.679 align:start position:0%
protect the safety of the people and
 
01:53:35.069 --> 01:53:35.079 align:start position:0%
lawful occupation means you follow the
 
01:53:36.950 --> 01:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
laws it means you're not a murderer
 
01:53:39.390 --> 01:53:39.400 align:start position:0%
child rapist trying to go in and do kind
 
01:53:40.750 --> 01:53:40.760 align:start position:0%
job you're not doing something that's
 
01:53:43.350 --> 01:53:43.360 align:start position:0%
illegal you're not selling is illegal ex
 
01:53:46.229 --> 01:53:46.239 align:start position:0%
exactly so the lawful the word lawful in
 
01:53:49.189 --> 01:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
there addresses that whole issue I like
 
01:53:51.990 --> 01:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
taking fundamental out I like what um
 
01:53:53.550 --> 01:53:53.560 align:start position:0%
we've talked talked about the whole
 
01:53:55.870 --> 01:53:55.880 align:start position:0%
constitutionality issue versus uh
 
01:53:59.229 --> 01:53:59.239 align:start position:0%
statute so anyway I I'd like to move
 
01:54:02.430 --> 01:54:02.440 align:start position:0%
that that we adopt this amended language
 
01:54:05.870 --> 01:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
if we can all agree to um a simple thing
 
01:54:07.950 --> 01:54:07.960 align:start position:0%
and I and I'm aware I have to leave in
 
01:54:09.910 --> 01:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
15 minutes and I'd like to help as much
 
01:54:11.870 --> 01:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
as I can and that's actually going to be
 
01:54:14.310 --> 01:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
a a process issue
 
01:54:16.790 --> 01:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
um that we're spending more time I'm not
 
01:54:18.030 --> 01:54:18.040 align:start position:0%
objecting but we're spending more time
 
01:54:21.030 --> 01:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
on this than I expected and we have uh
 
01:54:23.790 --> 01:54:23.800 align:start position:0%
even thornier issues to deal with I'm
 
01:54:29.030 --> 01:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:31.550 --> 01:54:31.560 align:start position:0%
and right I this
 
01:54:36.310 --> 01:54:36.320 align:start position:0%
is I don't think this it's an FN is this
 
01:54:40.189 --> 01:54:40.199 align:start position:0%
an early Bill I'd have to check with
 
01:54:43.149 --> 01:54:43.159 align:start position:0%
Carol um but not all FNS
 
01:54:45.589 --> 01:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
are uh she sent I don't have it with me
 
01:54:47.750 --> 01:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
she sent an email that listed all the
 
01:54:50.030 --> 01:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
bills in the subcommittees and I think
 
01:54:52.589 --> 01:54:52.599 align:start position:0%
there was an Asis by the ones early well
 
01:54:55.790 --> 01:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
we don't need to decide this here but
 
01:54:59.109 --> 01:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
yeah the the issue is is timing
 
01:55:02.189 --> 01:55:02.199 align:start position:0%
so we kind of agree not to meet on
 
01:55:03.910 --> 01:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
Mondays and at this point I couldn't
 
01:55:06.149 --> 01:55:06.159 align:start position:0%
schedule one on Monday anyway because I
 
01:55:08.669 --> 01:55:08.679 align:start position:0%
think the 24-hour notice doesn't count
 
01:55:11.229 --> 01:55:11.239 align:start position:0%
weekends I'm not sure so we couldn't
 
01:55:12.750 --> 01:55:12.760 align:start position:0%
adequately notice it so we couldn't meet
 
01:55:12.760 --> 01:55:13.550 align:start position:0%
adequately notice it so we couldn't meet
on

01:55:13.550 --> 01:55:13.560 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:55:18.430 --> 01:55:18.440 align:start position:0%
Monday um I I can miss I can miss the
 
01:55:20.629 --> 01:55:20.639 align:start position:0%
delegation meeting I think this is
 
01:55:23.109 --> 01:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
important I agree
 
01:55:25.709 --> 01:55:25.719 align:start position:0%
I I have another subcommittee that I
 
01:55:27.189 --> 01:55:27.199 align:start position:0%
have to and in one sense I'd kind of
 
01:55:30.950 --> 01:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
like to have um you know Glenn Glenn
 
01:55:33.470 --> 01:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
here or a substitute if before we really
 
01:55:35.589 --> 01:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
EXA controversial stuff
 
01:55:38.109 --> 01:55:38.119 align:start position:0%
so how about this uh let's go through
 
01:55:43.629 --> 01:55:43.639 align:start position:0%
this as far as we can and um yeah okay
 
01:55:46.470 --> 01:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
and um you're going to leave I don't
 
01:55:47.470 --> 01:55:47.480 align:start position:0%
know who else is going to leave but I
 
01:55:49.189 --> 01:55:49.199 align:start position:0%
mean we could you're not on the
 
01:55:52.350 --> 01:55:52.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I mean the issue is quorum
 
01:55:54.030 --> 01:55:54.040 align:start position:0%
you're welcome to stay I'm just
 
01:55:56.589 --> 01:55:56.599 align:start position:0%
understand but I can't because I have oh
 
01:55:58.870 --> 01:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
when do you have to leave I have to be
 
01:55:58.880 --> 01:56:00.550 align:start position:0%
when do you have to leave I have to be
there

01:56:00.550 --> 01:56:00.560 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:56:04.069 --> 01:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
2:00 an hour okay so okay I'm good today
 
01:56:07.790 --> 01:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
till probably 2:30 I need to
 
01:56:10.390 --> 01:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
go I understand
 
01:56:16.589 --> 01:56:16.599 align:start position:0%
um how about this let's try and finish
 
01:56:20.550 --> 01:56:20.560 align:start position:0%
um this one and then what I'll do is
 
01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
I've got stuff written up on the other
 
01:56:24.390 --> 01:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
two issues okay I will hand them out to
 
01:56:26.910 --> 01:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
people um if we maybe discuss them a
 
01:56:28.709 --> 01:56:28.719 align:start position:0%
little bit but then go off and think
 
01:56:30.709 --> 01:56:30.719 align:start position:0%
about it and then I'll talk to Carol
 
01:56:32.390 --> 01:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
about when we can schedule a meeting to
 
01:56:35.550 --> 01:56:35.560 align:start position:0%
continue this just for your information
 
01:56:40.629 --> 01:56:40.639 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair um I moved all my
 
01:56:40.639 --> 01:56:42.310 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair um I moved all my
Monday

01:56:42.310 --> 01:56:42.320 align:start position:0%
Monday
 
01:56:46.270 --> 01:56:46.280 align:start position:0%
appointments so I will open it up
 
01:56:50.030 --> 01:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
for subcommittee possibly if I know we
 
01:56:53.069 --> 01:56:53.079 align:start position:0%
can't do this next mon well I'll I'll
 
01:56:55.390 --> 01:56:55.400 align:start position:0%
talk to Carol something just so you know
 
01:56:57.069 --> 01:56:57.079 align:start position:0%
that thank you for that thank you very
 
01:57:02.310 --> 01:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
much for that um so something uh brief
 
01:57:03.950 --> 01:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt if
 
01:57:07.310 --> 01:57:07.320 align:start position:0%
you right what one of the things that
 
01:57:09.629 --> 01:57:09.639 align:start position:0%
needs to be said is that not every Bill
 
01:57:12.069 --> 01:57:12.079 align:start position:0%
representative Brown not every bill has
 
01:57:14.709 --> 01:57:14.719 align:start position:0%
a statement of Purpose By Any Means and
 
01:57:19.750 --> 01:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
it is actually uh found upon in many
 
01:57:23.950 --> 01:57:23.960 align:start position:0%
respects uh to do so because you see the
 
01:57:26.390 --> 01:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
wrestling that we're engaged in and in
 
01:57:30.830 --> 01:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
my re my view we have not at all dealt
 
01:57:32.790 --> 01:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
with this question of this fundamental
 
01:57:35.069 --> 01:57:35.079 align:start position:0%
rights situation I think it would be
 
01:57:37.990 --> 01:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
much better to say for example at the
 
01:57:40.350 --> 01:57:40.360 align:start position:0%
same time the general court recognizes
 
01:57:41.790 --> 01:57:41.800 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:57:45.229 --> 01:57:45.239 align:start position:0%
interest of individuals to P pursue
 
01:57:48.629 --> 01:57:48.639 align:start position:0%
lawful Prof occupations is
 
01:57:50.870 --> 01:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
fundamental it ain't a question of
 
01:57:54.390 --> 01:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
Rights folks because because not every
 
01:57:57.430 --> 01:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
individual has a right to do anything
 
01:58:00.750 --> 01:58:00.760 align:start position:0%
that's lawful um there there too many
 
01:58:03.589 --> 01:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
qualifications so anyway I I say my
 
01:58:06.310 --> 01:58:06.320 align:start position:0%
language would be better better than
 
01:58:09.510 --> 01:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
what you have and you can't get over the
 
01:58:11.669 --> 01:58:11.679 align:start position:0%
problem that I alluded to about the
 
01:58:14.669 --> 01:58:14.679 align:start position:0%
words the word right anyway we we'll
 
01:58:16.790 --> 01:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
have to disagree actually on that okay
 
01:58:19.669 --> 01:58:19.679 align:start position:0%
but anyway I still think my so it's not
 
01:58:22.550 --> 01:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
a right you may can have an interest you
 
01:58:24.149 --> 01:58:24.159 align:start position:0%
thought it was better if or you wouldn't
 
01:58:26.550 --> 01:58:26.560 align:start position:0%
have brought it Forward I get it okay so
 
01:58:28.430 --> 01:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
but but also the commission of course
 
01:58:31.149 --> 01:58:31.159 align:start position:0%
can't remove anything it can only
 
01:58:32.950 --> 01:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
propose right that's the other thing
 
01:58:35.229 --> 01:58:35.239 align:start position:0%
right right it can't do anything it can
 
01:58:38.629 --> 01:58:38.639 align:start position:0%
only propose stuff so I'm I'm completely
 
01:58:40.030 --> 01:58:40.040 align:start position:0%
fine with taking the word fundamental
 
01:58:41.830 --> 01:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
out uh director Courtney raised a good
 
01:58:45.030 --> 01:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
point on that um as far as uh consumer
 
01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:45.870 align:start position:0%
point on that um as far as uh consumer
and

01:58:45.870 --> 01:58:45.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:58:48.229 --> 01:58:48.239 align:start position:0%
citizen I lean a little more to Consumer
 
01:58:51.229 --> 01:58:51.239 align:start position:0%
and the reason is although I is that the
 
01:58:52.629 --> 01:58:52.639 align:start position:0%
issue of people coming the state there's
 
01:58:56.830 --> 01:58:56.840 align:start position:0%
still going to be consumers here
 
01:59:00.830 --> 01:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
um would you I mean yeah if you have a
 
01:59:02.350 --> 01:59:02.360 align:start position:0%
suggestion I well I agree would you
 
01:59:04.069 --> 01:59:04.079 align:start position:0%
consider someone that lives in
 
01:59:05.750 --> 01:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that has a license in New
 
01:59:08.069 --> 01:59:08.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire working here a consumer and if
 
01:59:10.950 --> 01:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
that's the case then it makes sense
 
01:59:13.750 --> 01:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
this well if they're practicing in New
 
01:59:15.510 --> 01:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they're working for some
 
01:59:17.149 --> 01:59:17.159 align:start position:0%
consumer in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:59:21.109 --> 01:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
right so I'm okay with you see the the
 
01:59:22.709 --> 01:59:22.719 align:start position:0%
you see the issue with
 
01:59:24.990 --> 01:59:25.000 align:start position:0%
with statements of purpose and this this
 
01:59:26.950 --> 01:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
one is fundamentally heard that I mean
 
01:59:28.950 --> 01:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
you if everyone wants to removal we
 
01:59:31.310 --> 01:59:31.320 align:start position:0%
could I thought on this one because
 
01:59:35.510 --> 01:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
there seemed to be some confusion about
 
01:59:38.589 --> 01:59:38.599 align:start position:0%
why we're doing this having having
 
01:59:40.109 --> 01:59:40.119 align:start position:0%
something here I thought would be of
 
01:59:42.430 --> 01:59:42.440 align:start position:0%
some some value um I'm not saying it
 
01:59:44.910 --> 01:59:44.920 align:start position:0%
isn't but also I think the question of
 
01:59:47.069 --> 01:59:47.079 align:start position:0%
workability which I addressed in my
 
01:59:49.149 --> 01:59:49.159 align:start position:0%
remarks to the committee when the bill
 
01:59:51.270 --> 01:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
was heard the the idea that you're
 
01:59:53.510 --> 01:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
setting up a test ask for the commission
 
01:59:57.669 --> 01:59:57.679 align:start position:0%
to examine all the boards is unworkable
 
01:59:58.830 --> 01:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
that's a separate question we're not
 
02:00:00.830 --> 02:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
addressing that question right now so
 
02:00:07.069 --> 02:00:07.079 align:start position:0%
please yes Mr chair so the key point in
 
02:00:10.390 --> 02:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
this bill is to establish a commission
 
02:00:10.400 --> 02:00:11.589 align:start position:0%
this bill is to establish a commission
to

02:00:11.589 --> 02:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:00:15.870 --> 02:00:15.880 align:start position:0%
evaluate various occupational
 
02:00:19.550 --> 02:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
boards instead of saying establishing a
 
02:00:23.750 --> 02:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
sunset commission EV evaluate the
 
02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:25.669 align:start position:0%
sunset commission EV evaluate the
board

02:00:25.669 --> 02:00:25.679 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:00:25.679 --> 02:00:28.229 align:start position:0%
board
boards

02:00:28.229 --> 02:00:28.239 align:start position:0%
boards
 
02:00:31.750 --> 02:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
and assess
 
02:00:35.550 --> 02:00:35.560 align:start position:0%
the efficacy
 
02:00:39.750 --> 02:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
and uh wh why you know my question is
 
02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:42.069 align:start position:0%
and uh wh why you know my question is
why

02:00:42.069 --> 02:00:42.079 align:start position:0%
why
 
02:00:46.990 --> 02:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
is sunsetting is the key point I get
 
02:00:48.750 --> 02:00:48.760 align:start position:0%
that so that's not in the statement of
 
02:00:51.069 --> 02:00:51.079 align:start position:0%
purpose but if you want to when we meet
 
02:00:53.310 --> 02:00:53.320 align:start position:0%
again if you want to come forward with a
 
02:00:55.350 --> 02:00:55.360 align:start position:0%
different name for the commission I'm
 
02:00:56.709 --> 02:00:56.719 align:start position:0%
certainly open to that and we could
 
02:00:59.950 --> 02:00:59.960 align:start position:0%
change it wherever it's used um and I I
 
02:01:03.430 --> 02:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
get the concern um because it seems to
 
02:01:06.270 --> 02:01:06.280 align:start position:0%
imply I mean this has been used in a
 
02:01:08.109 --> 02:01:08.119 align:start position:0%
number of other states the idea
 
02:01:10.830 --> 02:01:10.840 align:start position:0%
is is you set up the repeal and then the
 
02:01:12.669 --> 02:01:12.679 align:start position:0%
commission to review it and it's to push
 
02:01:14.990 --> 02:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
the process and so it's sunsetting but
 
02:01:17.669 --> 02:01:17.679 align:start position:0%
it's only going to Sunset if the
 
02:01:20.709 --> 02:01:20.719 align:start position:0%
commission wants it to or doesn't do
 
02:01:22.830 --> 02:01:22.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't say it should continue but I I
 
02:01:24.589 --> 02:01:24.599 align:start position:0%
get the concern in the message so if you
 
02:01:25.910 --> 02:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
could think of something else you'd like
 
02:01:29.870 --> 02:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
to call it for next time one question so
 
02:01:32.870 --> 02:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
each board don't they have the
 
02:01:36.589 --> 02:01:36.599 align:start position:0%
evaluatory uh clause in their function
 
02:01:39.510 --> 02:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
to say how efficient we are or not to
 
02:01:41.550 --> 02:01:41.560 align:start position:0%
look that this is to look I mean also
 
02:01:42.790 --> 02:01:42.800 align:start position:0%
that got in the question we had last
 
02:01:44.870 --> 02:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
time on uh performance audits like we
 
02:01:47.470 --> 02:01:47.480 align:start position:0%
had with the Dental Board um that's
 
02:01:50.510 --> 02:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
looking there is the board operating
 
02:01:53.189 --> 02:01:53.199 align:start position:0%
efficiently under the current statute do
 
02:01:54.990 --> 02:01:55.000 align:start position:0%
the rules go along with the statute and
 
02:01:56.910 --> 02:01:56.920 align:start position:0%
all that has anything changed are they
 
02:01:58.430 --> 02:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
doing things that they shouldn't for
 
02:02:01.030 --> 02:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
example and that's good but this is to
 
02:02:04.109 --> 02:02:04.119 align:start position:0%
step back and take a look at the whole
 
02:02:07.790 --> 02:02:07.800 align:start position:0%
structure okay of how we're
 
02:02:11.870 --> 02:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
regulating um you know this and there's
 
02:02:13.790 --> 02:02:13.800 align:start position:0%
a number of ways of doing it and what
 
02:02:15.790 --> 02:02:15.800 align:start position:0%
we're doing currently is certainly one
 
02:02:18.270 --> 02:02:18.280 align:start position:0%
way and maybe the commission will decide
 
02:02:19.790 --> 02:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
that it's going to stay the same maybe
 
02:02:22.470 --> 02:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
with some tweaks or not but it's a
 
02:02:25.189 --> 02:02:25.199 align:start position:0%
matter of stepping back because you know
 
02:02:26.750 --> 02:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
if you're looking at at like a
 
02:02:28.149 --> 02:02:28.159 align:start position:0%
performance audit you're in the weeds
 
02:02:29.430 --> 02:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
saying are they doing what the
 
02:02:30.990 --> 02:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
legislature told them to do and are they
 
02:02:32.990 --> 02:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
doing it well but this is stepping back
 
02:02:35.149 --> 02:02:35.159 align:start position:0%
and saying should the legislature change
 
02:02:37.189 --> 02:02:37.199 align:start position:0%
somewhat what we're telling them to do
 
02:02:40.430 --> 02:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
or or how to regulate so that that's um
 
02:02:42.430 --> 02:02:42.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yeah might I back up just to
 
02:02:46.629 --> 02:02:46.639 align:start position:0%
Tad certainly so I I think uh
 
02:02:49.189 --> 02:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
representative that what you were trying
 
02:02:53.350 --> 02:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
to say is what the last sentence of the
 
02:02:56.310 --> 02:02:56.320 align:start position:0%
proposed statement of purpose does say
 
02:02:58.589 --> 02:02:58.599 align:start position:0%
yeah reexamine the licensing boards you
 
02:03:00.950 --> 02:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
use the different word but same idea
 
02:03:02.910 --> 02:03:02.920 align:start position:0%
reexamine the licensing boards to
 
02:03:05.430 --> 02:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
determine if the balance of those
 
02:03:07.149 --> 02:03:07.159 align:start position:0%
interests is being done so I think that
 
02:03:08.910 --> 02:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
that's what you were getting at correct
 
02:03:11.310 --> 02:03:11.320 align:start position:0%
and I think that this says this well and
 
02:03:14.310 --> 02:03:14.320 align:start position:0%
if you want while we still have a quorum
 
02:03:16.790 --> 02:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
I I did we do a I would if we didn't do
 
02:03:19.629 --> 02:03:19.639 align:start position:0%
a motion I would motion we accept this
 
02:03:21.830 --> 02:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
statement of purpose as written with
 
02:03:25.149 --> 02:03:25.159 align:start position:0%
they change to the fundamental
 
02:03:25.159 --> 02:03:26.750 align:start position:0%
they change to the fundamental
right

02:03:26.750 --> 02:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:03:28.910 --> 02:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
um as as
 
02:03:31.310 --> 02:03:31.320 align:start position:0%
you somebody else if somebody else would
 
02:03:34.189 --> 02:03:34.199 align:start position:0%
like to Second yeah but you know it's if
 
02:03:38.950 --> 02:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
it can would that uh if it's strike
 
02:03:43.629 --> 02:03:43.639 align:start position:0%
that which the second line fundamental
 
02:03:45.870 --> 02:03:45.880 align:start position:0%
right that's what the chair I would
 
02:03:47.669 --> 02:03:47.679 align:start position:0%
strike fundamental I would leave in
 
02:03:50.069 --> 02:03:50.079 align:start position:0%
right um but it it doesn't you know it
 
02:03:52.950 --> 02:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
reduces can we just say individual to
 
02:03:56.390 --> 02:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
pursue a lawful occupation in the state
 
02:03:58.549 --> 02:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
and leave it at that rather than saying
 
02:04:01.510 --> 02:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
it's indiv I mean that actually does say
 
02:04:03.470 --> 02:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
I mean I at the same time the general
 
02:04:05.390 --> 02:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
court Riz the right of an individual to
 
02:04:08.030 --> 02:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
pursue a lawful occupation is a f so
 
02:04:10.870 --> 02:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
it's saying right twice yeah if You' be
 
02:04:13.149 --> 02:04:13.159 align:start position:0%
okay to amend your motion I'd be fine
 
02:04:15.549 --> 02:04:15.559 align:start position:0%
with taking the is a fundamental write
 
02:04:17.589 --> 02:04:17.599 align:start position:0%
out just leave strike that I'm okay with
 
02:04:20.790 --> 02:04:20.800 align:start position:0%
that okay okay so so going to amend your
 
02:04:23.549 --> 02:04:23.559 align:start position:0%
moot your motion yeah amend my motion to
 
02:04:26.870 --> 02:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
end the sentence at occupation right and
 
02:04:28.350 --> 02:04:28.360 align:start position:0%
right correct
 
02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
correct thank you and the purpose of
 
02:04:34.950 --> 02:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
this act is to require the legislator
 
02:04:37.589 --> 02:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
reexamining State DET if the balance of
 
02:04:40.030 --> 02:04:40.040 align:start position:0%
those important interest is being done
 
02:04:40.040 --> 02:04:41.669 align:start position:0%
those important interest is being done
properly

02:04:41.669 --> 02:04:41.679 align:start position:0%
properly
 
02:04:45.350 --> 02:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
yeah that you know this commission okay
 
02:04:50.430 --> 02:04:50.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:53.030 --> 02:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
require the because the whole
 
02:04:56.270 --> 02:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
legislature is not looking at it it's we
 
02:04:59.350 --> 02:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
are authorizing a commission to take a
 
02:05:01.149 --> 02:05:01.159 align:start position:0%
look at it right but they can only
 
02:05:02.950 --> 02:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
propose changes in the end the
 
02:05:05.629 --> 02:05:05.639 align:start position:0%
legislature will have to review any
 
02:05:07.510 --> 02:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
proposed changes and they can modify
 
02:05:09.109 --> 02:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
them or get rid of them or whatever they
 
02:05:11.270 --> 02:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
want the whole legisl want correct but
 
02:05:14.189 --> 02:05:14.199 align:start position:0%
that is the purpose of the commission
 
02:05:16.189 --> 02:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
the duty of a commission or the role of
 
02:05:18.430 --> 02:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
a commission is to just recommendation
 
02:05:21.950 --> 02:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
that's already in the statute correct
 
02:05:25.270 --> 02:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
correct so commissions cannot propose uh
 
02:05:28.310 --> 02:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
language for law or change
 
02:05:31.629 --> 02:05:31.639 align:start position:0%
something the commission the commission
 
02:05:35.589 --> 02:05:35.599 align:start position:0%
can propose legislation to do anything
 
02:05:37.510 --> 02:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
to the legislature to the leg but they
 
02:05:39.430 --> 02:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
can't they can't Implement anything
 
02:05:41.549 --> 02:05:41.559 align:start position:0%
correct so all they do is issue a report
 
02:05:44.470 --> 02:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
yeah so instead of saying the purpose of
 
02:05:47.990 --> 02:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
this act is to require the
 
02:05:51.629 --> 02:05:51.639 align:start position:0%
legislator require the commission to re
 
02:05:53.549 --> 02:05:53.559 align:start position:0%
if you want to change that because it's
 
02:05:55.830 --> 02:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
not the whole legislature is not that's
 
02:06:01.549 --> 02:06:01.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:04.109 --> 02:06:04.119 align:start position:0%
okay did you get that's under the
 
02:06:06.549 --> 02:06:06.559 align:start position:0%
assumption that we will leave that it
 
02:06:08.310 --> 02:06:08.320 align:start position:0%
called a commission we're calling I
 
02:06:10.189 --> 02:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
think it'll be called a commission we
 
02:06:12.149 --> 02:06:12.159 align:start position:0%
might change the name of the commission
 
02:06:14.549 --> 02:06:14.559 align:start position:0%
but correct I'm okay that's fine yeah
 
02:06:16.549 --> 02:06:16.559 align:start position:0%
because the commission the
 
02:06:19.790 --> 02:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility is to overse right so
 
02:06:21.709 --> 02:06:21.719 align:start position:0%
that's fine that makes sense yeah and
 
02:06:23.990 --> 02:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
then I will change this whole thing no
 
02:06:26.629 --> 02:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
Sunset commission well that's right
 
02:06:28.470 --> 02:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
that's that's a different question so we
 
02:06:31.189 --> 02:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
are looking at statement of purpose just
 
02:06:33.470 --> 02:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
that section and so I'll I'll read what
 
02:06:35.310 --> 02:06:35.320 align:start position:0%
I think with these changes I've got and
 
02:06:37.030 --> 02:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
so the protection of health and safety
 
02:06:38.709 --> 02:06:38.719 align:start position:0%
is of utmost importance in New Hampshire
 
02:06:40.910 --> 02:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
state government and the consumers of
 
02:06:42.990 --> 02:06:43.000 align:start position:0%
this state at the same time the general
 
02:06:44.669 --> 02:06:44.679 align:start position:0%
court recognizes the right of an
 
02:06:47.189 --> 02:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
individual to pursue a lawful occupation
 
02:06:48.990 --> 02:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this act is to require
 
02:06:50.350 --> 02:06:50.360 align:start position:0%
the commission to re-examine the
 
02:06:52.069 --> 02:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
licensing Boards of the state to
 
02:06:53.430 --> 02:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
determine if the balance of those
 
02:06:54.950 --> 02:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
important interests is being done
 
02:06:58.390 --> 02:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
properly and to suggest any improvements
 
02:07:03.390 --> 02:07:03.400 align:start position:0%
so oh something where word popped up at
 
02:07:06.109 --> 02:07:06.119 align:start position:0%
this so at the same time the general
 
02:07:08.390 --> 02:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
court recognizes that the right of an
 
02:07:10.629 --> 02:07:10.639 align:start position:0%
individual to pursue a lawful occupation
 
02:07:14.229 --> 02:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
in the state well our authorities in the
 
02:07:16.390 --> 02:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
state and we don't need to okay I have
 
02:07:18.149 --> 02:07:18.159 align:start position:0%
great sympathy to the people drafting
 
02:07:19.950 --> 02:07:19.960 align:start position:0%
the the Declaration of Independence at
 
02:07:22.990 --> 02:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
this point but
 
02:07:25.310 --> 02:07:25.320 align:start position:0%
um so which they went through the same
 
02:07:27.709 --> 02:07:27.719 align:start position:0%
process I understand it from history but
 
02:07:29.310 --> 02:07:29.320 align:start position:0%
but which which is fine I mean people
 
02:07:30.589 --> 02:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
02:07:33.510 --> 02:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
comfortable so we have a you're okay
 
02:07:35.669 --> 02:07:35.679 align:start position:0%
with that yes that's your motion so can
 
02:07:38.830 --> 02:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
we have a second all right cool all
 
02:07:44.350 --> 02:07:44.360 align:start position:0%
right um so um all in favor I okay
 
02:07:46.390 --> 02:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
nobody opposed anyone
 
02:07:49.709 --> 02:07:49.719 align:start position:0%
opposed okay thank you and I apologize
 
02:07:51.510 --> 02:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
to drag everybody in there and not get
 
02:07:54.310 --> 02:07:54.320 align:start position:0%
any further than we did but it it is
 
02:07:57.549 --> 02:07:57.559 align:start position:0%
what it is um so what I'm going to do is
 
02:07:59.790 --> 02:07:59.800 align:start position:0%
talk to representative Maguire chair
 
02:08:03.350 --> 02:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
Maguire about scheduling and figure out
 
02:08:07.069 --> 02:08:07.079 align:start position:0%
um where we go from here for members of
 
02:08:09.149 --> 02:08:09.159 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:08:11.750 --> 02:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I'm going to pass
 
02:08:14.709 --> 02:08:14.719 align:start position:0%
out um a couple things and one of them I
 
02:08:18.189 --> 02:08:18.199 align:start position:0%
actually going to I have a change um but
 
02:08:18.199 --> 02:08:19.270 align:start position:0%
actually going to I have a change um but
I

02:08:19.270 --> 02:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:08:22.069 --> 02:08:22.079 align:start position:0%
don't uh you know I've only pen in one
 
02:08:23.950 --> 02:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
of them so I'm going to have to tell you
 
02:08:27.910 --> 02:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
what it is so one of these um the first
 
02:08:31.430 --> 02:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
one is and I've gotten all disorganized
 
02:08:33.229 --> 02:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
is actually to talk about the membership
 
02:08:36.350 --> 02:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
so the real problems with the membership
 
02:08:37.430 --> 02:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
that was
 
02:08:40.310 --> 02:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
proposed uh before this meeting so I
 
02:08:44.830 --> 02:08:44.840 align:start position:0%
just need three so one for you thank you
 
02:08:49.390 --> 02:08:49.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:52.990 --> 02:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
representative all right so
 
02:08:56.430 --> 02:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
um I I spoke with uh chair Maguire this
 
02:09:00.189 --> 02:09:00.199 align:start position:0%
morning and she suggested a
 
02:09:03.750 --> 02:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
change uh one change and that is um I'll
 
02:09:03.760 --> 02:09:04.629 align:start position:0%
change uh one change and that is um I'll
I'll

02:09:04.629 --> 02:09:04.639 align:start position:0%
I'll
 
02:09:07.870 --> 02:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
quickly so it's uh two members the house
 
02:09:10.149 --> 02:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
of of Edna one of whom shall be a
 
02:09:12.430 --> 02:09:12.440 align:start position:0%
minority applied by the speaker one
 
02:09:13.910 --> 02:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
member of the House Commerce consumer
 
02:09:16.470 --> 02:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
affairs appointed by the speaker and
 
02:09:17.790 --> 02:09:17.800 align:start position:0%
often in a lot I looked at other
 
02:09:19.350 --> 02:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
Commissions in law and usually if it's
 
02:09:21.669 --> 02:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
three legislators it requires one be
 
02:09:24.149 --> 02:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
from the minority so I added that that
 
02:09:27.030 --> 02:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
was a good catch uh similarly for the
 
02:09:30.549 --> 02:09:30.559 align:start position:0%
Senate two members of the Senate Ed one
 
02:09:31.870 --> 02:09:31.880 align:start position:0%
will be in the minority and one member
 
02:09:34.390 --> 02:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
from Senate Commerce and then a public
 
02:09:35.790 --> 02:09:35.800 align:start position:0%
member representing the interest of
 
02:09:37.109 --> 02:09:37.119 align:start position:0%
businesses in New
 
02:09:41.629 --> 02:09:41.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um appointed by the Bia this
 
02:09:45.430 --> 02:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
okay um the exe uh U director Courtney
 
02:09:47.629 --> 02:09:47.639 align:start position:0%
or design you know the the executive
 
02:09:50.030 --> 02:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
director and I had in there three
 
02:09:51.709 --> 02:09:51.719 align:start position:0%
members of the public appointed by the
 
02:09:54.910 --> 02:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
Governor uh represent mire suggestion is
 
02:09:58.189 --> 02:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
to drop that to two and add one public
 
02:10:00.750 --> 02:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
member representing a healthare a
 
02:10:03.109 --> 02:10:03.119 align:start position:0%
healthare healthcare employers appointed
 
02:10:06.589 --> 02:10:06.599 align:start position:0%
by the governor um
 
02:10:08.750 --> 02:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
and and that leaves it an odd number
 
02:10:10.910 --> 02:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
it's 11 which is I think it tends to be
 
02:10:13.870 --> 02:10:13.880 align:start position:0%
a good a good number for the for a
 
02:10:16.629 --> 02:10:16.639 align:start position:0%
commission uh meets the Le the uh statut
 
02:10:18.990 --> 02:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
requirement it can't be more than 15 uh
 
02:10:20.669 --> 02:10:20.679 align:start position:0%
there's a statut requirement legislators
 
02:10:22.589 --> 02:10:22.599 align:start position:0%
have to the majority which they are six
 
02:10:24.109 --> 02:10:24.119 align:start position:0%
out of
 
02:10:26.990 --> 02:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
11 um and then for the public member
 
02:10:28.790 --> 02:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
it's got the usual language they can't
 
02:10:31.189 --> 02:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
be a liy or involved in licensing they
 
02:10:33.189 --> 02:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
have to represent the public basically
 
02:10:35.910 --> 02:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
consumers what did you say about sorry I
 
02:10:37.709 --> 02:10:37.719 align:start position:0%
change this to two uh two and then
 
02:10:39.149 --> 02:10:39.159 align:start position:0%
underneath one public member
 
02:10:41.589 --> 02:10:41.599 align:start position:0%
representing um Healthcare employers
 
02:10:43.910 --> 02:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor and counsel
 
02:10:47.589 --> 02:10:47.599 align:start position:0%
you know um I I I like this change one
 
02:10:50.030 --> 02:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
of the things that I was looking at the
 
02:10:52.830 --> 02:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
original one was that Governor gets to
 
02:10:55.910 --> 02:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
do two members and again Governor gets
 
02:10:59.790 --> 02:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
to do three public members I did get
 
02:11:01.470 --> 02:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
this bill well I'm very interested in
 
02:11:02.830 --> 02:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
this and I've thought of this idea for
 
02:11:05.069 --> 02:11:05.079 align:start position:0%
some years and I support it I got the
 
02:11:06.830 --> 02:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
actual language from the governor's
 
02:11:09.589 --> 02:11:09.599 align:start position:0%
office and the charge of the commission
 
02:11:11.229 --> 02:11:11.239 align:start position:0%
the duties of the commission I I looked
 
02:11:12.830 --> 02:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
at very carefully and had some changes
 
02:11:16.430 --> 02:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
for I admit I did not carefully review
 
02:11:18.750 --> 02:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
the members which I should have and no I
 
02:11:22.390 --> 02:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
I don't agree with what was there so
 
02:11:24.790 --> 02:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
um you know that was not yeah
 
02:11:27.109 --> 02:11:27.119 align:start position:0%
I you know as much I like or don't like
 
02:11:28.910 --> 02:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
the governor I didn't want to give him
 
02:11:31.830 --> 02:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
too much power on this not my intent
 
02:11:34.709 --> 02:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
sorry so um we've had our differences
 
02:11:37.709 --> 02:11:37.719 align:start position:0%
but I I would make a motion to accept uh
 
02:11:39.589 --> 02:11:39.599 align:start position:0%
chairman Le has Chang someone like to
 
02:11:41.830 --> 02:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
speak on this second wait wait yeah okay
 
02:11:44.149 --> 02:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
we've got the motion second but sorry
 
02:11:45.390 --> 02:11:45.400 align:start position:0%
we're not trying
 
02:11:47.390 --> 02:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
to and actually yeah if somebody has
 
02:11:50.030 --> 02:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
suggestions on this I I apologize for
 
02:11:51.669 --> 02:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
not doing that first you're trying to
 
02:11:54.229 --> 02:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
move it along Steve ran Court um from
 
02:11:57.189 --> 02:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
pelman Hampshire um we just feel it's a
 
02:11:58.629 --> 02:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
little bit possibly unfair with that
 
02:11:59.870 --> 02:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
makeup the governor's already appointing
 
02:12:01.390 --> 02:12:01.400 align:start position:0%
two at the beginning and you've
 
02:12:03.589 --> 02:12:03.599 align:start position:0%
appointed no I I if let me read through
 
02:12:06.270 --> 02:12:06.280 align:start position:0%
this we completely replaced that the
 
02:12:08.549 --> 02:12:08.559 align:start position:0%
language and the bill is gone if if we
 
02:12:11.910 --> 02:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
do this so it would be uh three members
 
02:12:15.790 --> 02:12:15.800 align:start position:0%
from the house uh two members from Edna
 
02:12:18.229 --> 02:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
one of whom from the minority party a
 
02:12:21.310 --> 02:12:21.320 align:start position:0%
minority party and then one member of
 
02:12:26.229 --> 02:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
house from oh great Commerce okay and so
 
02:12:28.270 --> 02:12:28.280 align:start position:0%
that's three members of the legislature
 
02:12:30.709 --> 02:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
two from Edna one from Commerce and one
 
02:12:32.470 --> 02:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
of the Eda ones have to be from the
 
02:12:34.629 --> 02:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
minority party and same thing for the
 
02:12:37.589 --> 02:12:37.599 align:start position:0%
Senate three Senators two from Edan one
 
02:12:40.350 --> 02:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
have to be for the minority one from
 
02:12:42.750 --> 02:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
Commerce and then a public member
 
02:12:44.109 --> 02:12:44.119 align:start position:0%
representing the interests of business
 
02:12:46.910 --> 02:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire appointed by the Bia
 
02:12:48.669 --> 02:12:48.679 align:start position:0%
and that's in this kind of language is
 
02:12:50.270 --> 02:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
in other commissions I actually went
 
02:12:53.830 --> 02:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
back and looked at number of them um and
 
02:12:55.790 --> 02:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
then uh you know the executive director
 
02:12:57.950 --> 02:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
of oplc or
 
02:13:00.830 --> 02:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
design and then what's WR I'm written
 
02:13:02.910 --> 02:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
there but the intent is to change it it
 
02:13:04.149 --> 02:13:04.159 align:start position:0%
says three members of the public
 
02:13:06.549 --> 02:13:06.559 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor that would be
 
02:13:08.669 --> 02:13:08.679 align:start position:0%
changed to two members just general
 
02:13:10.470 --> 02:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
members appointed by the governor
 
02:13:11.870 --> 02:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
although there's language down below
 
02:13:14.270 --> 02:13:14.280 align:start position:0%
saying the public members you know can't
 
02:13:17.189 --> 02:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
have a direct interest in licensing I
 
02:13:19.229 --> 02:13:19.239 align:start position:0%
mean they're to represent basically the
 
02:13:21.709 --> 02:13:21.719 align:start position:0%
consumers and then add on to it one
 
02:13:24.470 --> 02:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
public member representing a healthcare
 
02:13:27.149 --> 02:13:27.159 align:start position:0%
employer and appointed by the governor I
 
02:13:29.069 --> 02:13:29.079 align:start position:0%
was thinking about having the
 
02:13:30.350 --> 02:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
appointment be by the hospital
 
02:13:32.229 --> 02:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
Association but talking with chair
 
02:13:34.030 --> 02:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
McGuire the problem is there are a
 
02:13:36.510 --> 02:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
number of other interests in healthcare
 
02:13:38.430 --> 02:13:38.440 align:start position:0%
employers not just the
 
02:13:40.750 --> 02:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
hospitals and while the governor would
 
02:13:43.069 --> 02:13:43.079 align:start position:0%
do the appointment it's got to be
 
02:13:44.669 --> 02:13:44.679 align:start position:0%
somebody representing a healthcare
 
02:13:48.310 --> 02:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
employer so G Bia is just general all
 
02:13:49.790 --> 02:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
you know all kinds of employers but
 
02:13:52.510 --> 02:13:52.520 align:start position:0%
since a lot of the boards deal with
 
02:13:55.430 --> 02:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
Health Care stuff um she felt and I
 
02:13:56.990 --> 02:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
agree that it should there should be
 
02:13:59.069 --> 02:13:59.079 align:start position:0%
somebody there who is more knowledge
 
02:14:00.750 --> 02:14:00.760 align:start position:0%
from the healthcare employer side of the
 
02:14:03.470 --> 02:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
fence so that reduces the governor's
 
02:14:06.030 --> 02:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
appointments from five to three right
 
02:14:07.870 --> 02:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
and one of them is constrained and that
 
02:14:09.870 --> 02:14:09.880 align:start position:0%
they have to be um representing a
 
02:14:12.310 --> 02:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
healthcare employer it just feels like
 
02:14:14.350 --> 02:14:14.360 align:start position:0%
the um we're doing the healthcare side
 
02:14:15.629 --> 02:14:15.639 align:start position:0%
of it but forgetting the professional
 
02:14:16.830 --> 02:14:16.840 align:start position:0%
side they're pretty even the amount of
 
02:14:18.310 --> 02:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
boards I don't know if they're trying to
 
02:14:20.310 --> 02:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
use the Bia the consider the
 
02:14:22.750 --> 02:14:22.760 align:start position:0%
professional side yeah I mean we're not
 
02:14:24.629 --> 02:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
the intent as I said during the public
 
02:14:27.830 --> 02:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
hearing licensing is not for the people
 
02:14:30.790 --> 02:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
licensed at all I mean it hopefully will
 
02:14:33.430 --> 02:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
have some positive benefits to encourage
 
02:14:35.790 --> 02:14:35.800 align:start position:0%
you know education further development
 
02:14:37.310 --> 02:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
and all that and and maybe there's some
 
02:14:40.709 --> 02:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
Prestige or trust that's good but the
 
02:14:43.350 --> 02:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
legal the legitimate purpose for
 
02:14:45.750 --> 02:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
licensing is to protect public health
 
02:14:45.760 --> 02:14:46.750 align:start position:0%
licensing is to protect public health
and

02:14:46.750 --> 02:14:46.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:14:50.069 --> 02:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
safety so anyway that's if I may sir
 
02:14:51.750 --> 02:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
certainly of course uh thank you Mr
 
02:14:54.669 --> 02:14:54.679 align:start position:0%
chair so I I I hear what you just said
 
02:14:56.709 --> 02:14:56.719 align:start position:0%
so in here we have electricians
 
02:14:59.549 --> 02:14:59.559 align:start position:0%
electrology genetic counselors Midwifery
 
02:15:01.950 --> 02:15:01.960 align:start position:0%
naturopathic many well those are those
 
02:15:03.709 --> 02:15:03.719 align:start position:0%
are Healthcare some of them but many
 
02:15:04.870 --> 02:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
that aren't
 
02:15:07.430 --> 02:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
Health Engineers Architects all of them
 
02:15:09.430 --> 02:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
I just feel that it should be some
 
02:15:10.950 --> 02:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
balance if we're going to represent the
 
02:15:11.990 --> 02:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
healthc care industry even though
 
02:15:13.229 --> 02:15:13.239 align:start position:0%
they're not licensed there should be one
 
02:15:14.990 --> 02:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
for well nonprofessional we're looking
 
02:15:17.229 --> 02:15:17.239 align:start position:0%
for one person that commissions don't
 
02:15:18.350 --> 02:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
work if they're too big and there's
 
02:15:20.069 --> 02:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
actually statutory limitations on the
 
02:15:23.910 --> 02:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
size chair could we so um my question
 
02:15:27.030 --> 02:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
would be is do is there another
 
02:15:29.589 --> 02:15:29.599 align:start position:0%
organization besides the Bia maybe there
 
02:15:31.149 --> 02:15:31.159 align:start position:0%
somebody better but there's nothing I'm
 
02:15:33.950 --> 02:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
better be able to appoint the a couple
 
02:15:35.669 --> 02:15:35.679 align:start position:0%
you know billing associations that are
 
02:15:38.069 --> 02:15:38.079 align:start position:0%
probably more represent the professional
 
02:15:40.669 --> 02:15:40.679 align:start position:0%
side than than the Bia you know I mean
 
02:15:43.390 --> 02:15:43.400 align:start position:0%
ABC AGC things like that that might if
 
02:15:44.390 --> 02:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
you're going to appoint to something
 
02:15:47.830 --> 02:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
like that what again and this is no
 
02:15:49.830 --> 02:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
disrespect to anybody or their trade or
 
02:15:51.549 --> 02:15:51.559 align:start position:0%
their license but
 
02:15:54.390 --> 02:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
it's not the intent isn't to represent
 
02:15:56.189 --> 02:15:56.199 align:start position:0%
the people who are licensed it's the
 
02:15:58.669 --> 02:15:58.679 align:start position:0%
people who are the who who make use of
 
02:16:00.430 --> 02:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
them and business and industry as well
 
02:16:02.510 --> 02:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
as individual consumers do as well as
 
02:16:05.790 --> 02:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
healthc care employers so that's why
 
02:16:08.870 --> 02:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
those two we're in there now maybe
 
02:16:10.750 --> 02:16:10.760 align:start position:0%
there's somebody some organization
 
02:16:14.149 --> 02:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
that's more representative of businesses
 
02:16:17.430 --> 02:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
in general as they use you know those
 
02:16:19.350 --> 02:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
aren't those aren't licensed the AGC ABC
 
02:16:20.589 --> 02:16:20.599 align:start position:0%
Construction general contracts they're
 
02:16:22.510 --> 02:16:22.520 align:start position:0%
not Li Li so it's not a licensed
 
02:16:23.589 --> 02:16:23.599 align:start position:0%
individual on there and it would
 
02:16:25.149 --> 02:16:25.159 align:start position:0%
represent the business industry better I
 
02:16:27.470 --> 02:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
think but the the issue I have I'll get
 
02:16:28.870 --> 02:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
you in just a moment the issue I have is
 
02:16:30.990 --> 02:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
that we can't make it too big really
 
02:16:34.030 --> 02:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
there's room for one we look one Health
 
02:16:35.709 --> 02:16:35.719 align:start position:0%
one was healthcare because they're like
 
02:16:37.469 --> 02:16:37.479 align:start position:0%
a lot of the lenses are Healthcare
 
02:16:39.629 --> 02:16:39.639 align:start position:0%
probably in numbers probably especially
 
02:16:41.990 --> 02:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
with nursing um you know the majority so
 
02:16:43.870 --> 02:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
maybe consider changing the viia to
 
02:16:45.509 --> 02:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
something else leave it like I'm I'm
 
02:16:47.469 --> 02:16:47.479 align:start position:0%
open to suggestions on that and
 
02:16:51.309 --> 02:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
represent yeah yes so in supporting that
 
02:16:54.629 --> 02:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
um I think that your second line says at
 
02:16:55.790 --> 02:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
the same time the general court
 
02:16:57.709 --> 02:16:57.719 align:start position:0%
recognizes the right of an individual to
 
02:17:01.030 --> 02:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
pursue a lawful occupation so we know
 
02:17:03.549 --> 02:17:03.559 align:start position:0%
that as much as the primary goal is
 
02:17:07.589 --> 02:17:07.599 align:start position:0%
protecting the safety of the uh citizens
 
02:17:10.389 --> 02:17:10.399 align:start position:0%
and the the state and that licensing is
 
02:17:12.669 --> 02:17:12.679 align:start position:0%
really important we
 
02:17:15.110 --> 02:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
also there's no way to know whether
 
02:17:19.669 --> 02:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
there's a a balance if we don't have the
 
02:17:23.309 --> 02:17:23.319 align:start position:0%
right uh agencies and we've heard over
 
02:17:25.709 --> 02:17:25.719 align:start position:0%
and over D jurus has come in and other
 
02:17:28.030 --> 02:17:28.040 align:start position:0%
members of the governor's office to talk
 
02:17:30.070 --> 02:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
about some of the problems with the
 
02:17:31.469 --> 02:17:31.479 align:start position:0%
appointment process through the
 
02:17:33.589 --> 02:17:33.599 align:start position:0%
governor's office and the problems the
 
02:17:35.830 --> 02:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
public has of getting a hold of them so
 
02:17:39.669 --> 02:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
I really like what you've done by um by
 
02:17:41.669 --> 02:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
picking an organization I think we need
 
02:17:43.750 --> 02:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
to work on the right Organization for
 
02:17:46.070 --> 02:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
the professionals and for the hospital
 
02:17:49.030 --> 02:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
person I I want to challenge that there
 
02:17:50.950 --> 02:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
is a medical profession that can do it a
 
02:17:52.950 --> 02:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
direct appointment when we have
 
02:17:54.429 --> 02:17:54.439 align:start position:0%
commissions and committees where
 
02:17:55.870 --> 02:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
appointments are done outside the
 
02:17:58.150 --> 02:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
governor's office it's much easier for
 
02:18:00.389 --> 02:18:00.399 align:start position:0%
the professionals and the public to
 
02:18:03.870 --> 02:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
access and get their appointments done
 
02:18:06.469 --> 02:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
than it is if we get bottlenecked in the
 
02:18:09.389 --> 02:18:09.399 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands and thousands of
 
02:18:10.750 --> 02:18:10.760 align:start position:0%
appointments the governor's office is
 
02:18:13.190 --> 02:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
doing I mean if you can come up with a
 
02:18:16.190 --> 02:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
some health some maybe an organization
 
02:18:17.870 --> 02:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
that represents Healthcare organizations
 
02:18:19.469 --> 02:18:19.479 align:start position:0%
it's maybe broader than the hospital
 
02:18:21.549 --> 02:18:21.559 align:start position:0%
Association that'd be great
 
02:18:23.509 --> 02:18:23.519 align:start position:0%
and and that would then would pull it
 
02:18:25.270 --> 02:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
completely out of the governor's hands
 
02:18:28.990 --> 02:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
which I'm okay with um representative
 
02:18:31.830 --> 02:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
yeah the couple of comments I do you
 
02:18:33.669 --> 02:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
know to
 
02:18:36.230 --> 02:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
stakeholders not just the consumers and
 
02:18:39.709 --> 02:18:39.719 align:start position:0%
the providers but the industry experts
 
02:18:42.870 --> 02:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
is also necessary the you know I
 
02:18:45.830 --> 02:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
understand your uh intent of health care
 
02:18:47.750 --> 02:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
because there's a large portion of it
 
02:18:50.990 --> 02:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
and that really affects the safety in
 
02:18:54.349 --> 02:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
wellbeing uh same time like the
 
02:18:58.629 --> 02:18:58.639 align:start position:0%
engineering uh you know uh professions
 
02:19:00.790 --> 02:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
which is not Healthcare that should also
 
02:19:04.830 --> 02:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
be represented but I do appreciate the
 
02:19:08.030 --> 02:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
fact that not the whole all the eggs are
 
02:19:10.150 --> 02:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
in one basket that everything comes from
 
02:19:12.589 --> 02:19:12.599 align:start position:0%
the governor's office that was taken
 
02:19:17.509 --> 02:19:17.519 align:start position:0%
away so and maybe the restriction or
 
02:19:20.030 --> 02:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
suggestion to the governor's office can
 
02:19:21.870 --> 02:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
be given
 
02:19:25.589 --> 02:19:25.599 align:start position:0%
to appoint the two appointees that they
 
02:19:29.750 --> 02:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
get be from different professions so
 
02:19:31.709 --> 02:19:31.719 align:start position:0%
right well no it explicitly says the
 
02:19:35.110 --> 02:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
public members may not hold a license or
 
02:19:36.950 --> 02:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
have a spouse who holds a license or as
 
02:19:39.509 --> 02:19:39.519 align:start position:0%
a financial interest in a
 
02:19:41.750 --> 02:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
business uh in a licensed profession if
 
02:19:43.389 --> 02:19:43.399 align:start position:0%
you look at the paragraph under the
 
02:19:45.389 --> 02:19:45.399 align:start position:0%
bullets which is pretty standard for
 
02:19:47.190 --> 02:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
most public standard for public members
 
02:19:49.150 --> 02:19:49.160 align:start position:0%
I mean that you look at any one of the
 
02:19:51.110 --> 02:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
the uh the board makeups for any the
 
02:19:53.950 --> 02:19:53.960 align:start position:0%
boards that I took that language from I
 
02:19:55.790 --> 02:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
think one of the other boards I I have
 
02:19:59.230 --> 02:19:59.240 align:start position:0%
to challenge that thing just like you
 
02:19:59.240 --> 02:20:00.429 align:start position:0%
to challenge that thing just like you
know

02:20:00.429 --> 02:20:00.439 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:20:03.830 --> 02:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
the legislation is a volunteer
 
02:20:07.830 --> 02:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
legislation and you can't you know we
 
02:20:09.830 --> 02:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
can't say oh you can't if you're working
 
02:20:12.030 --> 02:20:12.040 align:start position:0%
in the health care profession you can't
 
02:20:14.590 --> 02:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
bring any bills in the health care
 
02:20:17.150 --> 02:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
that it's a lot of volunteers that want
 
02:20:20.270 --> 02:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
to work so when you say general public
 
02:20:20.280 --> 02:20:22.429 align:start position:0%
to work so when you say general public
without

02:20:22.429 --> 02:20:22.439 align:start position:0%
without
 
02:20:24.910 --> 02:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
you know you're kind of excluding the
 
02:20:28.270 --> 02:20:28.280 align:start position:0%
large portion so are you looking at just
 
02:20:31.389 --> 02:20:31.399 align:start position:0%
people who have retired or who are
 
02:20:34.510 --> 02:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
emerging and not the consumers if they
 
02:20:37.429 --> 02:20:37.439 align:start position:0%
hold license in some part the general
 
02:20:40.349 --> 02:20:40.359 align:start position:0%
public I might hold license in health
 
02:20:42.790 --> 02:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
care but I might be appointed for
 
02:20:45.950 --> 02:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
different not as a health
 
02:20:51.110 --> 02:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
um but but if I may Mr chair just if
 
02:20:52.349 --> 02:20:52.359 align:start position:0%
you're having this commission and
 
02:20:53.389 --> 02:20:53.399 align:start position:0%
they're going to determine whether or
 
02:20:54.830 --> 02:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
not they should sunset or whatever
 
02:20:56.550 --> 02:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
they're going to do to this thing and on
 
02:20:58.150 --> 02:20:58.160 align:start position:0%
this list there's still nobody that has
 
02:21:00.790 --> 02:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
any professional experience to give to
 
02:21:02.630 --> 02:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
Insight to it so that's going to address
 
02:21:05.990 --> 02:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
that and and so uh I you know I'll ask a
 
02:21:08.270 --> 02:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
fous question which is you know do you
 
02:21:11.429 --> 02:21:11.439 align:start position:0%
believe that uh that nobody in any of
 
02:21:13.750 --> 02:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
the licensed professions or their uh
 
02:21:15.309 --> 02:21:15.319 align:start position:0%
representatives are going to show up and
 
02:21:16.990 --> 02:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
provide information to the commission I
 
02:21:20.790 --> 02:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
mean the the intent is not to put
 
02:21:22.830 --> 02:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
everybody who might have expertise
 
02:21:23.990 --> 02:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
that's important to the commission on
 
02:21:25.389 --> 02:21:25.399 align:start position:0%
the commission I mean that just that'd
 
02:21:28.469 --> 02:21:28.479 align:start position:0%
be impossible so the idea is the
 
02:21:31.389 --> 02:21:31.399 align:start position:0%
commission is um you know legislators
 
02:21:33.110 --> 02:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
who are representatives of the the
 
02:21:37.270 --> 02:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
people in general um and a member from
 
02:21:39.150 --> 02:21:39.160 align:start position:0%
oplc that kind of have to be there
 
02:21:41.830 --> 02:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
they're involved in all of it and then
 
02:21:44.630 --> 02:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
so the idea then was and have public
 
02:21:46.030 --> 02:21:46.040 align:start position:0%
members who aren't licensed who are
 
02:21:48.469 --> 02:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
there to represent the general public
 
02:21:51.110 --> 02:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
and then it's kind of
 
02:21:54.110 --> 02:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
and then who else not the lies but who
 
02:21:56.270 --> 02:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
else who are in effect consumers and the
 
02:21:58.309 --> 02:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
thought was that you have you know
 
02:22:00.030 --> 02:22:00.040 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of businesses both healthc
 
02:22:02.349 --> 02:22:02.359 align:start position:0%
care is one set and then everybody else
 
02:22:05.790 --> 02:22:05.800 align:start position:0%
who hire a lot of licensed people and so
 
02:22:07.990 --> 02:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
they you know having some
 
02:22:11.030 --> 02:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative on there from those
 
02:22:15.150 --> 02:22:15.160 align:start position:0%
groups um you know would make sense but
 
02:22:16.590 --> 02:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
you know they're going to have public
 
02:22:18.349 --> 02:22:18.359 align:start position:0%
like any commission they have public
 
02:22:20.550 --> 02:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
hearings they take input a written uh in
 
02:22:23.670 --> 02:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
input public hearings uh public meetings
 
02:22:25.349 --> 02:22:25.359 align:start position:0%
the whole deal like any
 
02:22:27.910 --> 02:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
commission um and the whole process is
 
02:22:31.750 --> 02:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
public and then they come out with a
 
02:22:33.710 --> 02:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh but then that goes to
 
02:22:35.030 --> 02:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
the legislature and through the co-
 
02:22:37.750 --> 02:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
legislative process um and I understand
 
02:22:39.190 --> 02:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
I appreciate Mr chair but if you take it
 
02:22:40.389 --> 02:22:40.399 align:start position:0%
this committee and you say to them
 
02:22:41.750 --> 02:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
what's the institutional knowledge it's
 
02:22:43.469 --> 02:22:43.479 align:start position:0%
going to help them make some of these
 
02:22:45.190 --> 02:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
decisions where is that I'm not looking
 
02:22:46.510 --> 02:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
for it to be on the commission I'm
 
02:22:47.910 --> 02:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
looking to the people who come before
 
02:22:51.110 --> 02:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
the commission to provide it
 
02:22:53.270 --> 02:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
Mr and that's true you look at you look
 
02:22:56.389 --> 02:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
at this makeup of a lot of the
 
02:22:58.630 --> 02:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
commissions we have on on a wide range
 
02:23:00.750 --> 02:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
of subjects and that's generally what's
 
02:23:02.750 --> 02:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
there they're not trying to put the
 
02:23:04.670 --> 02:23:04.680 align:start position:0%
people with the institutional knowledge
 
02:23:05.870 --> 02:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
on the
 
02:23:08.870 --> 02:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
commission the the may I sir certainly
 
02:23:11.870 --> 02:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
yeah the intent of that to remain
 
02:23:16.830 --> 02:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
impartial well I so I'm I I I very much
 
02:23:18.750 --> 02:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
agree with what this gentleman is saying
 
02:23:20.990 --> 02:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
here in in
 
02:23:23.230 --> 02:23:23.240 align:start position:0%
philosophy there should be someone on
 
02:23:25.110 --> 02:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
this commission that has a clue about
 
02:23:27.830 --> 02:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
the industry you I would think should
 
02:23:29.469 --> 02:23:29.479 align:start position:0%
probably say the professional
 
02:23:30.790 --> 02:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
professional and occupational side
 
02:23:31.830 --> 02:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
should have one appointment and the
 
02:23:33.110 --> 02:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
governor should have a third one for
 
02:23:34.230 --> 02:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
whatever he wants and that would be
 
02:23:35.830 --> 02:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
balanced it doesn't have to be a
 
02:23:37.710 --> 02:23:37.720 align:start position:0%
licensed person whatever but from that
 
02:23:39.030 --> 02:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
side of it somebody representing the
 
02:23:40.790 --> 02:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
occupational somebody representing the
 
02:23:42.510 --> 02:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
professional you need some sort of
 
02:23:43.990 --> 02:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
institutional knowledge and it's I
 
02:23:45.230 --> 02:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
understand the public meetings but you
 
02:23:46.429 --> 02:23:46.439 align:start position:0%
know how hard it is and how much money
 
02:23:48.429 --> 02:23:48.439 align:start position:0%
it costs us to come to these it cost me
 
02:23:50.630 --> 02:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
$1,000 a day every time I come here not
 
02:23:52.990 --> 02:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
working my guy not working lost job so
 
02:23:54.510 --> 02:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
it's not easy to follow every one of
 
02:23:55.910 --> 02:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
them especially the amount that's going
 
02:23:58.590 --> 02:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
on now so while that's available it's
 
02:24:00.510 --> 02:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
very hard to stay on top of it at least
 
02:24:02.790 --> 02:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
if somebody's there they're watching out
 
02:24:04.790 --> 02:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
and giving that input so they understand
 
02:24:06.590 --> 02:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
how this would affect either one of
 
02:24:08.830 --> 02:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
those that's all yeah and also also I
 
02:24:11.550 --> 02:24:11.560 align:start position:0%
mean I I'm we have people in these
 
02:24:13.429 --> 02:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
meetings on licensing regularly who have
 
02:24:15.870 --> 02:24:15.880 align:start position:0%
orange badges so I assume are
 
02:24:17.630 --> 02:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
representing hired to represent the
 
02:24:19.309 --> 02:24:19.319 align:start position:0%
interests of the various group of
 
02:24:21.510 --> 02:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
licenses and and I am sure that there's
 
02:24:22.630 --> 02:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
going to be you know some of them
 
02:24:24.670 --> 02:24:24.680 align:start position:0%
present who would be doing that that's
 
02:24:27.150 --> 02:24:27.160 align:start position:0%
that's my take on it Mr chair follow up
 
02:24:29.269 --> 02:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
all right you follow
 
02:24:33.389 --> 02:24:33.399 align:start position:0%
up but and and and I also agree with I'm
 
02:24:34.750 --> 02:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
agreeing with both sides which isn't
 
02:24:37.190 --> 02:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
helpful probably but the impartiality of
 
02:24:41.070 --> 02:24:41.080 align:start position:0%
a commission is not is also a good thing
 
02:24:43.429 --> 02:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
could we without increasing the size of
 
02:24:45.870 --> 02:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
this commission could we take your last
 
02:24:47.590 --> 02:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
bullet which is now two members and
 
02:24:49.750 --> 02:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
maybe make one of those appointed by the
 
02:24:49.760 --> 02:24:50.830 align:start position:0%
maybe make one of those appointed by the
governor

02:24:50.830 --> 02:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
governor
 
02:24:53.990 --> 02:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
from an association not uh not
 
02:24:55.830 --> 02:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
Association but a group not associated
 
02:24:58.070 --> 02:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
with Healthcare or we give the Bia too
 
02:24:59.750 --> 02:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
although you didn't think to be let me
 
02:25:00.990 --> 02:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
let me make a large we're not going to
 
02:25:03.550 --> 02:25:03.560 align:start position:0%
take a vote on this today okay I brought
 
02:25:05.190 --> 02:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
this out to people to get this kind of
 
02:25:06.790 --> 02:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
discussion going get people thinking
 
02:25:10.429 --> 02:25:10.439 align:start position:0%
about it and then when we meet again so
 
02:25:12.950 --> 02:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
you know if people have specific and I'm
 
02:25:16.190 --> 02:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
not wedded to this membership okay um
 
02:25:18.950 --> 02:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
there's certain principles on it um that
 
02:25:20.429 --> 02:25:20.439 align:start position:0%
I am I mean I don't want you know
 
02:25:21.550 --> 02:25:21.560 align:start position:0%
somebody from each one of the licensed
 
02:25:23.510 --> 02:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
professions on here or something but if
 
02:25:24.990 --> 02:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
there's a better way to make and we have
 
02:25:26.910 --> 02:25:26.920 align:start position:0%
to have the majority of them have to be
 
02:25:29.150 --> 02:25:29.160 align:start position:0%
legislators and we can't have more than
 
02:25:31.389 --> 02:25:31.399 align:start position:0%
15 unless we want to override the
 
02:25:34.349 --> 02:25:34.359 align:start position:0%
statute um so I'm just putting this out
 
02:25:35.750 --> 02:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
and there's other things to discuss in
 
02:25:37.630 --> 02:25:37.640 align:start position:0%
this which with lunch hour coming and
 
02:25:38.790 --> 02:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
people having commitments we're not
 
02:25:41.830 --> 02:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
going to get to so this is just to put
 
02:25:43.870 --> 02:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
it out there so it's not sprung
 
02:25:47.469 --> 02:25:47.479 align:start position:0%
unexpectedly on people certainly my one
 
02:25:50.870 --> 02:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
little thing was um the two public
 
02:25:52.630 --> 02:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
members appointed by the governor we
 
02:25:54.230 --> 02:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
dropped it from 3 to
 
02:25:57.269 --> 02:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
two in my experience those would be the
 
02:26:00.030 --> 02:26:00.040 align:start position:0%
ones who would represent the general
 
02:26:03.150 --> 02:26:03.160 align:start position:0%
consumer and shouldn't be licensed or
 
02:26:05.190 --> 02:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
have any conflict but the business
 
02:26:07.150 --> 02:26:07.160 align:start position:0%
industry person and the public health
 
02:26:10.230 --> 02:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
person you would want of course licensed
 
02:26:12.309 --> 02:26:12.319 align:start position:0%
professionals who understand the
 
02:26:13.830 --> 02:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
profession and exactly for the reason
 
02:26:16.349 --> 02:26:16.359 align:start position:0%
the gentleman said I was most moved in
 
02:26:18.389 --> 02:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
one of the last hearings by the fact
 
02:26:21.670 --> 02:26:21.680 align:start position:0%
that um our boards and committ misss are
 
02:26:24.349 --> 02:26:24.359 align:start position:0%
volunteers and that when we're combining
 
02:26:26.590 --> 02:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
them all we're wasting people's time if
 
02:26:29.190 --> 02:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
they have to deal with unrelated matters
 
02:26:32.630 --> 02:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
so the respecting their time and I think
 
02:26:34.510 --> 02:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
is an important factor and thank you sir
 
02:26:36.670 --> 02:26:36.680 align:start position:0%
for bringing that up I I agree entirely
 
02:26:38.910 --> 02:26:38.920 align:start position:0%
and while I'm not going to prejudge what
 
02:26:40.870 --> 02:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to do with the bill we heard
 
02:26:44.990 --> 02:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
then um I will say that
 
02:26:47.150 --> 02:26:47.160 align:start position:0%
um you
 
02:26:49.550 --> 02:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
know at least the land survey and and
 
02:26:52.230 --> 02:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
and the engineer merge seem well we'll
 
02:26:54.750 --> 02:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
get to it but I'm not pushing for that
 
02:26:56.710 --> 02:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
let's put it that way okay
 
02:26:59.590 --> 02:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
representative thank you uh Mr chair
 
02:27:02.790 --> 02:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
again with this I mean the intent is
 
02:27:05.550 --> 02:27:05.560 align:start position:0%
predominantly the responsibility is put
 
02:27:09.429 --> 02:27:09.439 align:start position:0%
on the legislators to look at it take a
 
02:27:11.750 --> 02:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
hard look at what we have on the books
 
02:27:14.990 --> 02:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
right now and make any suggestion so I
 
02:27:19.510 --> 02:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
see your intent of uh three uh six of 11
 
02:27:23.150 --> 02:27:23.160 align:start position:0%
so far would be legislators and then the
 
02:27:26.389 --> 02:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
others are outside the legislation uh
 
02:27:30.670 --> 02:27:30.680 align:start position:0%
legislators so I I see that but it's
 
02:27:35.790 --> 02:27:35.800 align:start position:0%
also do we are we going to put a time
 
02:27:38.670 --> 02:27:38.680 align:start position:0%
frame for the commission to work because
 
02:27:40.309 --> 02:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
one of the things we we have a lot of
 
02:27:44.150 --> 02:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
commissions but there is no uh you know
 
02:27:47.150 --> 02:27:47.160 align:start position:0%
end it it everything starts and no yeah
 
02:27:50.590 --> 02:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
so this one has to be a short yeah so f
 
02:27:53.309 --> 02:27:53.319 align:start position:0%
it for the commission the third thing I
 
02:27:55.830 --> 02:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
was going to hand out relates to that
 
02:27:57.510 --> 02:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
okay and and I don't think we're going
 
02:27:58.750 --> 02:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
to be able to debate this and I think
 
02:28:00.550 --> 02:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a long one I'm just
 
02:28:03.269 --> 02:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
handing out for people to think about uh
 
02:28:05.309 --> 02:28:05.319 align:start position:0%
but in general terms and there may need
 
02:28:08.389 --> 02:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
to be some tweaking what it would say is
 
02:28:11.469 --> 02:28:11.479 align:start position:0%
that um if the commission you know the
 
02:28:13.830 --> 02:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
commission's required to issue a report
 
02:28:15.670 --> 02:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
on each one of these boards and the
 
02:28:17.269 --> 02:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
requirement in here is they issue it at
 
02:28:20.110 --> 02:28:20.120 align:start position:0%
least a year before the repeal date I
 
02:28:21.790 --> 02:28:21.800 align:start position:0%
I'd like to leave the repeals in general
 
02:28:24.230 --> 02:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
in there but to loosen this up so what
 
02:28:26.790 --> 02:28:26.800 align:start position:0%
it what the change that I'm proposing is
 
02:28:31.670 --> 02:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
to say if the um commission does not
 
02:28:34.910 --> 02:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
issue their report by the date required
 
02:28:37.590 --> 02:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
by the bill by Statute if it went
 
02:28:40.389 --> 02:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
through then the repeal date for that
 
02:28:42.269 --> 02:28:42.279 align:start position:0%
board for which did get a report is
 
02:28:44.750 --> 02:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
extended by a
 
02:28:47.510 --> 02:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
year so and there may be other way
 
02:28:49.030 --> 02:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
that's a whole different discussion I'm
 
02:28:50.349 --> 02:28:50.359 align:start position:0%
not going to get into that what I'm
 
02:28:54.150 --> 02:28:54.160 align:start position:0%
saying is I recognize the concern I mean
 
02:28:56.190 --> 02:28:56.200 align:start position:0%
I don't personally it's my opinion I
 
02:28:58.269 --> 02:28:58.279 align:start position:0%
don't think it's a real realistic that
 
02:28:59.790 --> 02:28:59.800 align:start position:0%
the board's the commission's not going
 
02:29:01.950 --> 02:29:01.960 align:start position:0%
to do anything and then nobody's going
 
02:29:04.510 --> 02:29:04.520 align:start position:0%
to put in a be Bill to repeal the repeal
 
02:29:07.750 --> 02:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
okay I mean in my view personally no no
 
02:29:09.670 --> 02:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
no disrespect to anybody's I think
 
02:29:11.550 --> 02:29:11.560 align:start position:0%
that's fantasy but I could be wrong I
 
02:29:14.230 --> 02:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
recognize that but so I'm trying to deal
 
02:29:16.630 --> 02:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
with that but still have something that
 
02:29:18.469 --> 02:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
that at least in some sense puts
 
02:29:19.590 --> 02:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
pressure on the commission to actually
 
02:29:20.950 --> 02:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
do something
 
02:29:24.870 --> 02:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
is my fear I I think Mr chair yeah I
 
02:29:29.070 --> 02:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
mean with all due respect I do
 
02:29:32.790 --> 02:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
think your your presumption is that
 
02:29:34.750 --> 02:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
commission is not going to do it so we
 
02:29:37.469 --> 02:29:37.479 align:start position:0%
have to build the Safeguard I would like
 
02:29:40.510 --> 02:29:40.520 align:start position:0%
to take the opposite view of saying we
 
02:29:43.469 --> 02:29:43.479 align:start position:0%
are coming together as legislators to
 
02:29:45.230 --> 02:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
say there is a commission we want you to
 
02:29:47.710 --> 02:29:47.720 align:start position:0%
to a hard take a hard look and this is a
 
02:29:50.550 --> 02:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
volunteer commission and and instead of
 
02:29:53.110 --> 02:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
just throwing everything at them and get
 
02:29:58.110 --> 02:29:58.120 align:start position:0%
rid of all these 57 boards uh 165 boards
 
02:30:02.510 --> 02:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
or repeal it or keep it let's say hey
 
02:30:05.389 --> 02:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
look at it on a general purpose and
 
02:30:08.230 --> 02:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
making it more manageable and
 
02:30:11.030 --> 02:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
expectation realistic expectation of the
 
02:30:13.429 --> 02:30:13.439 align:start position:0%
commission so so my response would be
 
02:30:14.950 --> 02:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
this is spread out over a number of
 
02:30:17.190 --> 02:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
years I mean what I did not want is to
 
02:30:18.790 --> 02:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
say oh look at all the boards and you
 
02:30:20.389 --> 02:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
got a year or two to do it I mean that
 
02:30:23.269 --> 02:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
that makes no that is unworkable and I I
 
02:30:25.349 --> 02:30:25.359 align:start position:0%
agree um so it's spread over quite a
 
02:30:27.630 --> 02:30:27.640 align:start position:0%
number of years and a piece at a
 
02:30:30.670 --> 02:30:30.680 align:start position:0%
time um so I my tell was that would help
 
02:30:35.230 --> 02:30:35.240 align:start position:0%
with that um as far as commissions doing
 
02:30:38.269 --> 02:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
things or not doing things I you know I
 
02:30:42.990 --> 02:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
I hope for the best and I um I think you
 
02:30:45.230 --> 02:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
know everybody intends to do the right
 
02:30:48.349 --> 02:30:48.359 align:start position:0%
thing but people have competing things
 
02:30:50.469 --> 02:30:50.479 align:start position:0%
for time and interest and all that and
 
02:30:52.070 --> 02:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately if you look at the history
 
02:30:54.950 --> 02:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
of commissions some have been great and
 
02:30:57.349 --> 02:30:57.359 align:start position:0%
some not so much they haven't done a lot
 
02:30:58.870 --> 02:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
and you can talk to Tom Dole and his
 
02:31:02.950 --> 02:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
committee has been reviewing them so um
 
02:31:04.750 --> 02:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
I you know it's like trust are going to
 
02:31:07.469 --> 02:31:07.479 align:start position:0%
do the right thing but try and add some
 
02:31:10.469 --> 02:31:10.479 align:start position:0%
pressure that's what I and and I would
 
02:31:12.710 --> 02:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
just add quickly one of my thoughts is
 
02:31:15.590 --> 02:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
why can't these tasks be given to Tom
 
02:31:17.830 --> 02:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
Dolan's committee they've already they
 
02:31:19.910 --> 02:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
have a very different charge their char
 
02:31:21.389 --> 02:31:21.399 align:start position:0%
charg is to look at the existing
 
02:31:23.550 --> 02:31:23.560 align:start position:0%
commissions and evaluate whether it's
 
02:31:25.910 --> 02:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
worthwhile in committees to keep them
 
02:31:28.269 --> 02:31:28.279 align:start position:0%
this is looking at something very
 
02:31:30.550 --> 02:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
different which is how we're handling
 
02:31:32.510 --> 02:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
regulation of professions in order to
 
02:31:34.469 --> 02:31:34.479 align:start position:0%
protect the public health and safety
 
02:31:36.190 --> 02:31:36.200 align:start position:0%
they're completely different in my yeah
 
02:31:38.550 --> 02:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
the commissions are very different that
 
02:31:39.510 --> 02:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
like the
 
02:31:42.950 --> 02:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
veterans no no they're not licensing
 
02:31:44.269 --> 02:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
they're also reviewing committies they
 
02:31:46.309 --> 02:31:46.319 align:start position:0%
committe committees and commissions yeah
 
02:31:49.630 --> 02:31:49.640 align:start position:0%
and not licensing boards commiss my my
 
02:31:51.150 --> 02:31:51.160 align:start position:0%
my understanding the differences
 
02:31:52.830 --> 02:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
distinction committees are all
 
02:31:54.630 --> 02:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
legislators commissions can have non-
 
02:31:58.469 --> 02:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
legislator members that's the thing I
 
02:32:01.030 --> 02:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
think that's in statute we look but yeah
 
02:32:02.990 --> 02:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
but I he the
 
02:32:06.269 --> 02:32:06.279 align:start position:0%
on Mr chair if you put that in place the
 
02:32:08.150 --> 02:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
one year what happens if by some chance
 
02:32:09.750 --> 02:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
just looking forward addressing her
 
02:32:11.670 --> 02:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
concerns after that one year they still
 
02:32:14.710 --> 02:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
do would it continue to it's a weaker
 
02:32:18.110 --> 02:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
thing I don't i' personally I'd prefer
 
02:32:19.910 --> 02:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
leaving the repeals in with a fixed date
 
02:32:21.389 --> 02:32:21.399 align:start position:0%
but I understand that generates a lot of
 
02:32:23.150 --> 02:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
concern and there's some legitimate
 
02:32:25.870 --> 02:32:25.880 align:start position:0%
issues there I get it so yes if the
 
02:32:28.870 --> 02:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
commission never met and and that
 
02:32:30.389 --> 02:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
basically the repeal dates would move
 
02:32:32.269 --> 02:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
out a year to time on all the boards
 
02:32:34.070 --> 02:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
until a committee like Tom Dolan said
 
02:32:37.070 --> 02:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
this thing isn't working kill it um Mr
 
02:32:39.110 --> 02:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
chair yeah I don't think you read maybe
 
02:32:41.710 --> 02:32:41.720 align:start position:0%
you did the following
 
02:32:45.469 --> 02:32:45.479 align:start position:0%
sentence actually sorry but for to this
 
02:32:50.429 --> 02:32:50.439 align:start position:0%
gentlem to this gentleman's point it's
 
02:32:52.230 --> 02:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
respect people's time and let them know
 
02:32:54.429 --> 02:32:54.439 align:start position:0%
it says no board may be repealed without
 
02:32:56.230 --> 02:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
the sunset commission delivering a
 
02:32:59.110 --> 02:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
report on it yes that's the following
 
02:33:00.870 --> 02:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
sentence which he didn't read right
 
02:33:02.790 --> 02:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
right and and what I would say is that
 
02:33:05.910 --> 02:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
first par paragraph implies the second
 
02:33:07.469 --> 02:33:07.479 align:start position:0%
but I added that line there just to make
 
02:33:10.630 --> 02:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
it absolutely clear what the situation
 
02:33:13.349 --> 02:33:13.359 align:start position:0%
was that's that's the deal on that so
 
02:33:17.349 --> 02:33:17.359 align:start position:0%
I'm going to um close the uh excuse me
 
02:33:21.990 --> 02:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chair when how do we get this
 
02:33:23.269 --> 02:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
information to people that are
 
02:33:25.790 --> 02:33:25.800 align:start position:0%
interested in it um I would say what I
 
02:33:28.790 --> 02:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
would like to do is not do that that
 
02:33:31.469 --> 02:33:31.479 align:start position:0%
that for this thing if you have
 
02:33:33.630 --> 02:33:33.640 align:start position:0%
suggestions we can re you know think
 
02:33:34.710 --> 02:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
about them bring them to the
 
02:33:35.990 --> 02:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting because what comes
 
02:33:37.510 --> 02:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
out of it may be very different than
 
02:33:39.870 --> 02:33:39.880 align:start position:0%
what I I wrote up okay I'm not claiming
 
02:33:41.349 --> 02:33:41.359 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to speak for the
 
02:33:42.750 --> 02:33:42.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or the whole committee
 
02:33:45.670 --> 02:33:45.680 align:start position:0%
that's the deal I agree with you before
 
02:33:49.030 --> 02:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
we as a subcommittee decide on something
 
02:33:51.269 --> 02:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's not prudent to hand out
 
02:33:53.990 --> 02:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
anything because that could go wild
 
02:33:55.750 --> 02:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
thank right because we may go a very
 
02:33:58.269 --> 02:33:58.279 align:start position:0%
different direction probably will and
 
02:33:59.429 --> 02:33:59.439 align:start position:0%
that would leave something out there
 
02:34:00.990 --> 02:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
that would assume that we want to do
 
02:34:03.510 --> 02:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
whatever we aren't
 
02:34:05.910 --> 02:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
doing thank you Mr chair all right I'm
 
02:34:07.830 --> 02:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
I'm uh closing the subcommittee work
 
02:34:10.070 --> 02:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill
 
02:34:13.389 --> 02:34:13.399 align:start position:0%
1676 thanks for everybody for being here
 
02:34:16.670 --> 02:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
um sorry that it maybe didn't get as
 
02:34:18.550 --> 02:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
much done as might have been hoped but
 
02:34:20.389 --> 02:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
it's a tough thing I mean I'm not that's
 
02:34:23.150 --> 02:34:23.160 align:start position:0%
not I'm not criticizing anybody giving
 
02:34:23.160 --> 02:34:23.910 align:start position:0%
not I'm not criticizing anybody giving
at

02:34:23.910 --> 02:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
at
 
02:34:27.830 --> 02:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
all because it's yeah thank you Mr chair
 
02:34:29.950 --> 02:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
for doing that yeah I looked at the list
