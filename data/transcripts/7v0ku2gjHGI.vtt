00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
to do is to build that back in and
 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.350 align:start position:0%
to do is to build that back in and
build<00:05:41.120><c> out</c><00:05:41.520><c> a</c><00:05:41.600><c> little</c><00:05:41.840><c> bit</c><00:05:42.000><c> further</c><00:05:43.039><c> down</c><00:05:43.280><c> on</c>

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
build out a little bit further down on
 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.550 align:start position:0%
build out a little bit further down on

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.990 align:start position:0%
the southern end of it
and<00:05:44.720><c> so</c><00:05:44.960><c> they'll</c><00:05:45.120><c> be</c><00:05:45.280><c> able</c><00:05:45.360><c> to</c><00:05:45.440><c> handle</c><00:05:45.759><c> much</c>

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 align:start position:0%

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.670 align:start position:0%
