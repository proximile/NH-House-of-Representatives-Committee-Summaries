all members are here the senate is here
 
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.190 align:start position:0%

and all the house members are here as

delineated in the notice for
 
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
we're here because there were some major
 
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 align:start position:0%
changes made by the senate
 
00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 align:start position:0%
their process there were some 25 million
 
00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of projects
 
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
that were taken out of the capital by
 
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
to be funded through arpa or
 
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
other federal funds it is my
 
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.190 align:start position:0%
other federal funds it is my
understanding

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
that all of these were funded at the
 
00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 align:start position:0%
fiscal meeting on june 8th
 
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
is that correct that's correct okay so
 
00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 align:start position:0%
we those are already taken care of so we
 
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
don't have to discuss
 
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
the future of them and
 
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
then you put a similar amount
 
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
less forty thousand dollars
 
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
back in with projects that the house had
 
00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:18.159 align:start position:0%
heard about
 
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh by and large as we were going through
 
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
but could not find the funding
 
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
there were a couple of things that
 
00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
um house members have had a question
 
00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:30.070 align:start position:0%
um house members have had a question
about

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
it was all a lot of the smaller projects
 
00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 align:start position:0%
from das
 
00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
and and how they were selected um
 
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
if anybody just kind of
 
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
brought strokes on we just went on the
 
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.589 align:start position:0%
brought strokes on we just went on the
priority

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
priority
 
00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
the testimony that eas has given us okay
 
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
because we had not heard that because we
 
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
didn't have anybody to
 
00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
to do that but there was a
 
00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
some concern about that and one that we
 
00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 align:start position:0%
did not hear about
 
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
well two that we did not hear about uh
 
00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
the bea
 
00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 align:start position:0%
the hhs uh
 
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
bureau of elderly and adult services for
 
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
four million dollars and and i know that
 
00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 align:start position:0%
they came in and briefed the senate
 
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
because i did
 
00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
see that um what
 
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
so i know it's a match for federal law
 
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
yeah so due to one match
 
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
um i can't remember exactly
 
00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 align:start position:0%
what i heard was it's a 30 year old
 
00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
ports and harbors uh marine terminal
 
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
that was a last-minute ad i believe
 
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
what yeah yeah so um one thing
 
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
there is if there is a grant proposal um
 
00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
a great possibility um to
 
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
do the work at the marine terminal that
 
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
needs to be done
 
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
and um we have to provide that match you
 
00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 align:start position:0%
can get i think up to 31 million dollars
 
00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:19.759 align:start position:0%
i've been down there to see that there's
 
00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 align:start position:0%
a couple of a couple of issues there one
 
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
they're working on a resurfacing of the
 
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
dock but the other is that when they did
 
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
the new bridge
 
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
because the new alignment bridge they
 
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.070 align:start position:0%
because the new alignment bridge they
lost

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
lost
 
00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
several hundred feet at the northern end
 
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
of the terminal and what this will have
 
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
to do is to build that back in and
 
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
build out a little bit further down on
 
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
the southern end of it
 
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
and so they'll be able to handle much
 
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.670 align:start position:0%
and so they'll be able to handle much
harder

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
harder
 
00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
and this fits in really well with the
 
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
turning basin project being authorized
 
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
and with any other future project and
 
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.990 align:start position:0%
and with any other future project and
the

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
returning basin is also a house bill 25
 
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
if i remember correctly and you'll see
 
00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 align:start position:0%
there's a note there too that says
 
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
that if this grant uh is not successful
 
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
then that money could be used for other
 
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
department of transportation
 
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
uh grand matches that are there as well
 
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
i think mr representative jack you have
 
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
a question uh thank you uh
 
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
i noticed that this is under the dot
 
00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
the market street normally you would put
 
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
it under pda
 
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
but there's a contingency that d.o.t can
 
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
use it i assume
 
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.750 align:start position:0%
use it i assume
that

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.390 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
any of the other house members have
 
00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
questions about the projects being added
 
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
i think we're in agreement with the
 
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
removal while the removals have already
 
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
been funded so
 
00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
there should not be a question about
 
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
those but about the uh
 
00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
the additions i do have one
 
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
and i i think i've shared with you um
 
00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
our concerns about some oversight on on
 
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
some of this
 
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
and the first one would be the uh the
 
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
rochester courthouse which i know the
 
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.070 align:start position:0%
rochester courthouse which i know the
governor

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
governor
 
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
had looked at but did not uh fund
 
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't the money to to go
 
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
forward with that
 
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
but right now the senate has added
 
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
design money for it but we don't know
 
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
where it's going to go
 
00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
we don't have a site for it and we would
 
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
like to put a footnote
 
00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
into the the uh
 
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
the bill that says you can't do the
 
00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
design until we know uh
 
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
where the uh the court will be
 
00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
actually built so it's sort of like
 
00:07:38.469 --> 00:07:38.479 align:start position:0%
building a house and have it all
 
00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759 align:start position:0%
designed and they go look for the lot
 
00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:44.479 align:start position:0%
so does the senate have a problem with
 
00:07:44.479 --> 00:07:44.790 align:start position:0%
so does the senate have a problem with
with

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
that no and then
 
00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:50.879 align:start position:0%
and i know the house is not um
 
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
and then we also had a footnote that we
 
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.670 align:start position:0%
and then we also had a footnote that we
were

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
talking about amongst the house at least
 
00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.270 align:start position:0%
talking about amongst the house at least
of

00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
saying that two projects um the
 
00:08:03.909 --> 00:08:03.919 align:start position:0%
rochester courthouse which we're going
 
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
to design
 
00:08:07.629 --> 00:08:07.639 align:start position:0%
and also the the seed money for the
 
00:08:09.749 --> 00:08:09.759 align:start position:0%
digitization of the supreme court
 
00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:10.869 align:start position:0%
digitization of the supreme court
records

00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:10.879 align:start position:0%
records
 
00:08:12.869 --> 00:08:12.879 align:start position:0%
that the intent is to fund those in
 
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
future bienniums once the
 
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
the initial work is done
 
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
does saying intent work
 
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
as far as the house and senate are
 
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
concerned i i've we've done it before
 
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:28.560 align:start position:0%

00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
and others that you know if things work
 
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
out and we have the money we'll do it
 
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
if not um it's still up to the next
 
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:37.919 align:start position:0%
legislature to
 
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
to decide whether to fund it any
 
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
problems with
 
00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399 align:start position:0%

00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:46.399 align:start position:0%

just want to see that they tell us where
 
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
they are
 
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:16.720 align:start position:0%

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
years out or four years out
 
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:20.320 align:start position:0%

haven't gotten to it that's all it is
 
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
but given past issues yes whether
 
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
