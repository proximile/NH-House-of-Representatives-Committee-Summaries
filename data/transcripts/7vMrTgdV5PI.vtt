so we will resume that executive session
 
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
on monday march 7th at 10 a.m and when
 
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
we finish that executive session we will
 
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
be done with house bills
 
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.830 align:start position:0%
be done with house bills

for
2022.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
2022.
 
00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879 align:start position:0%
we will then await crossover which
 
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 align:start position:0%
happens at the end of march and we will
 
00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:40.159 align:start position:0%
start hearing senate bills at that time
 
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
i have been told by the clerk that it
 
00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 align:start position:0%
may be possible for us to start hearing
 
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
senate bills even before crossover so
 
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping that we can make that happen
 
00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
so that we don't have a
 
00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
three plus week period where we sit
 
00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 align:start position:0%
now because we're coming back here on
 
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
monday march 7th for the resumed
 
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
executive session on hb 1459
 
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
and since some of us have to make a
 
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
fairly long trip to get here
 
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to arrange another activity
 
00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
for that day the
 
00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 align:start position:0%
eversource arborist
 
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 align:start position:0%
would like to come and give us a
 
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
presentation on what eversource does
 
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 align:start position:0%

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
transmission and distribution lines
 
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:31.830 align:start position:0%
transmission and distribution lines

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 align:start position:0%
we're right now discussing whether they
 
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 align:start position:0%

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.110 align:start position:0%

one side or the other of the executive
 
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 align:start position:0%

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
it won't be a tour to florida no
 
00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 align:start position:0%
unfortunately sorry about that
 
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
the possibilities are seabrook the
 
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
nuclear plant in seabrook there's some a
 
00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
couple of hydro power stations that we
 
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
might be able to do a tour of
 
00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:11.919 align:start position:0%
iso new england is a possibility so
 
00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
there are several different
 
00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:14.710 align:start position:0%
there are several different
possibilities

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
possibilities
 
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
so we have a schedule for today we've
 
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
got 10 bills on the agenda
 
00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
we are going to have to move some
 
00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:28.070 align:start position:0%
we are going to have to move some
however

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
the published agenda shows hb 1258 as
 
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
being the last bill of the day that's
 
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
actually now going to be the first bill
 
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
of the day
 
00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is because the
 
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
very busy and in order for them to have
 
00:07:44.869 --> 00:07:44.879 align:start position:0%
representatives here this morning who
 
00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
could answer questions
 
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
they requested that we move that bill to
 
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
first on the agenda so we're going to do
 
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
that and we'll start that
 
00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
executive session in just a moment
 
00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts just a
 
00:07:59.189 --> 00:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
parliamentary question can we do that
 
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
without it being posted
 
00:08:03.029 --> 00:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
24 hours yes
 
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
there's no time on any of these no time
 
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
we can do them whenever we want thank
 
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.550 align:start position:0%
we can do them whenever we want thank
you

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
the other bill that we're going to move
 
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:19.909 --> 00:08:19.919 align:start position:0%
limiting air emissions of pluto
 
00:08:19.919 --> 00:08:22.230 align:start position:0%
limiting air emissions of pluto
fluorochemicals

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
fluorochemicals
 
00:08:23.909 --> 00:08:23.919 align:start position:0%
and the reason we're moving that bill is
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
because representative boyd
 
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
wanted an amendment for that bill
 
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.790 align:start position:0%
wanted an amendment for that bill
but

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
we didn't file one in a timely fashion
 
00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
so that bill is act that amendment is
 
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
actually being drafted as we speak
 
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
it will be here at some point later in
 
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
the day but we're probably going to take
 
00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
up that bill
 
00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:47.360 align:start position:0%
right before
 
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.790 align:start position:0%
right before

representative harrington
 
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman
 
00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
this bill is a result of the
 
00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:33.519 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and this the changes on
 
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
here are what was to agreed with by
 
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
everybody that was on the subcommittee
 
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
most of them or a lot of them are
 
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
changes where one place that says public
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
utilities commission now it says the
 
00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839 align:start position:0%
department of energy and vice versa
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
there were a couple of other things that
 
00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
were agreed on that had to be changed
 
00:10:54.389 --> 00:10:54.399 align:start position:0%
and these are uh new changes so i i
 
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
recommend people go to page 2
 
00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.829 align:start position:0%
recommend people go to page 2
line

00:10:58.829 --> 00:10:58.839 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
22. and
 
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
that was something that was agreed on
 
00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
for the period of five years whatever
 
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
comes first that's about uh re
 
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
reviewing the rules um
 
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
and that was that was something people
 
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
decided they wanted to have in
 
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
that was one change and let me see if
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:21.839 --> 00:11:22.630 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:11:26.949 --> 00:11:26.959 align:start position:0%
bottom of page 4 line 36
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
this was a request by the puc
 
00:11:31.509 --> 00:11:31.519 align:start position:0%
and the transcripts or minutes of oral
 
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
arguments shall not constitute the final
 
00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
order the final order shall include but
 
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
not be limited to and we remove the
 
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
positions of each party on each issue
 
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
again this just says it doesn't have to
 
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
be put in and typically what the puc has
 
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
done over the years is they would
 
00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
summarize the positions of all the
 
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
parties put them in their order and then
 
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
they write the order basically after
 
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
that part all the positions of all the
 
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
parties are on the website and anybody
 
00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
can go look them up anytime they want to
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
so it's really redundant to put them in
 
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
here and in fact it's a summary of
 
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
somebody else's work so i'm not sure if
 
00:12:06.389 --> 00:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
it's actually that helpful but that was
 
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
a change they wanted to cut back on some
 
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
of that and there was another one
 
00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:13.519 align:start position:0%
where was this
 
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
okay this was one that was kind of a
 
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
major change on the bottom of page six
 
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
line 31
 
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:23.200 align:start position:0%
this was the idea of what happens if
 
00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
there was a disagreement with the how
 
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
the department of energy did the things
 
00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
and there was quite a discussion over
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
that well then the next uh appellate um
 
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh body would be the
 
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
supreme court which seemed to be really
 
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
out of reach for most people and so
 
00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839 align:start position:0%
forth so that's why we added this and it
 
00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
says if the party bringing the complaint
 
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
is unsatisfaction unsatisfied with the
 
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
disposition of the complaint and by the
 
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
department of energy they may then
 
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
petition the public utilities commission
 
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
to resolve the matter through and due to
 
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
proceedings so it gives a a method of
 
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
of doing something that's a lot easier
 
00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
than filing with the supreme court
 
00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.150 align:start position:0%
than filing with the supreme court
and

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.430 align:start position:0%
and
okay

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
i think most of these let me see those
 
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
were all other ones that were in there
 
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
there was was there one more over here
 
00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:11.839 align:start position:0%
because there are other changes but
 
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
these were changes that were already
 
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
discussed so i'm not going to go over
 
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
every every change but those i think
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
were all the major ones
 
00:13:23.509 --> 00:13:23.519 align:start position:0%
oh and there was in the one if you go
 
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
over to page 10
 
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
uh line 11
 
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
the employees of the commission and the
 
00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
department are not otherwise prohibited
 
00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
from participating in the activities of
 
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
the four motion aforementioned
 
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
organizations in which the other agency
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
has the lead role this gets a little
 
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
confusing because of the setup because
 
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
some of the organizations like naruto
 
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
are designed for public utilities
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
commissioners but they also address
 
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
regional and national issues with ferc
 
00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.189 align:start position:0%
regional and national issues with ferc
so

00:13:51.189 --> 00:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
the way our
 
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
thing would be set up that would be the
 
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
department of energy would be involved
 
00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
in those issues but you'd still have the
 
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
puc involved because it's nairu so on
 
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
those things they would work
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
collaboratively and we just
 
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
we just think they can work it out
 
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
that's one of those things we kind of
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
warn both groups that don't get into
 
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
silos on this but you got to work
 
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
together on this so
 
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
and that's the major changes other than
 
00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
the ones you know there's a bunch of
 
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
minor ones where we change the
 
00:14:19.829 --> 00:14:19.839 align:start position:0%
terminology and one last uh thing i
 
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention is that
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
this is probably not the end of this uh
 
00:14:26.069 --> 00:14:26.079 align:start position:0%
reorganization paperwork
 
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that you know griffin will be
 
00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:30.160 align:start position:0%
back here or david maybe six months or a
 
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
year from now whatever saying okay we
 
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
found five more things that need to be
 
00:14:35.189 --> 00:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
changed because it really doesn't work
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
the way it was written so i just want to
 
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
let people know this is not the end all
 
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
of everything this is just an
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
incremental step towards making the
 
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
process work better

representative harrington
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh the sub there was a subcommittee on
 
00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
this does this uh incorporate all of the
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
suggestions from the subcommittee yes it
 
00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.550 align:start position:0%
suggestions from the subcommittee yes it
does

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
well i'll accept one uh house bill 1285
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
which we passed yesterday was originally
 
00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
going in here but somehow okay i'm sorry
 
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
i forgot that yeah we because of some
 
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
confusion over how we were going to word
 
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
that 1285 which was going to go in here
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
was pulled out and it was passed
 
00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
separately so but you put the two
 
00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
together the effect is everything the
 
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittee asked for was would be
 
00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.069 align:start position:0%
subcommittee asked for was would be
accepted

00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
accepted
 
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
further discussion we have um
 
00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:30.399 align:start position:0%
attorney shulock from the department of
 
00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:32.959 align:start position:0%
energy here to answer questions if there
 
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
are any
 
00:15:35.829 --> 00:15:35.839 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
further discussion would be the floor is
 
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
open for further discussion so
 
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee is recognized thank
 
00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:42.959 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman yes i do have a question
 
00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
and i i'm i apologize to
 
00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
you may want to come up mr schumacher uh
 
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
if i had asked this before but i want
 
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
clarification on page two there's bolded
 
00:15:57.269 --> 00:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
language that starts on page i'm sorry
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
on line 22
 
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
or on 21
 
00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.069 align:start position:0%
or on 21
um

00:16:02.069 --> 00:16:02.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:05.749 --> 00:16:05.759 align:start position:0%
and it it basically uh refers to
 
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
to the extent the department acts
 
00:16:10.389 --> 00:16:10.399 align:start position:0%
pursuant to an existing rule order or
 
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
approval the department shall not be
 
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
subject to rsa 541
 
00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
a29 or rsa 541 a29a
 
00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
and i just want to understand i think we
 
00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
did cover that before but if you could
 
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
just explain to us what they're being
 
00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
exempted from
 
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
when they're acting on a rule
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
establishes timelines by which an agency
 
00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
has to act on a petition request or
 
00:16:38.399 --> 00:16:40.710 align:start position:0%
has to act on a petition request or
application

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:40.720 align:start position:0%
application
 
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
and those timelines are 30 days to
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
identify items that are missing from an
 
00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.069 align:start position:0%
identify items that are missing from an
application

00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:48.079 align:start position:0%
application
 
00:16:50.069 --> 00:16:50.079 align:start position:0%
to identify who's going to be working on
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
it etc
 
00:16:51.759 --> 00:16:52.870 align:start position:0%
it etc
um

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
and then 60 days to
 
00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:56.550 align:start position:0%
and then 60 days to
act

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
act
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
on on that application right
 
00:17:02.069 --> 00:17:02.079 align:start position:0%
or to open an adjudicative proceeding
 
00:17:02.079 --> 00:17:02.949 align:start position:0%
or to open an adjudicative proceeding
okay

00:17:02.949 --> 00:17:02.959 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:17:02.959 --> 00:17:07.110 align:start position:0%
okay
so

00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:07.829 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:07.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:11.039 align:start position:0%
then rsa 541 8
 
00:17:11.039 --> 00:17:12.470 align:start position:0%
then rsa 541 8
29a

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
29a
 
00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:14.959 align:start position:0%
says that if you fail to meet those
 
00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:16.959 align:start position:0%
deadlines then the application is
 
00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:18.799 align:start position:0%
automatically granted it's deemed
 
00:17:21.029 --> 00:17:21.039 align:start position:0%
granted sort of as a matter of law i
 
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
remember this now it's coming back to me
 
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
it's those provisions that the
 
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
department would be exempted from
 
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
okay additional discussion or any
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
questions for mr shulock while he is at
 
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
the table representative callie pitts
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
would a blanket
 
00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.150 align:start position:0%
would a blanket
exemption

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
in other words instead of having to go
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
and ask for an exemption or have an
 
00:17:50.789 --> 00:17:50.799 align:start position:0%
exemption granted or have it publicly
 
00:17:50.799 --> 00:17:52.390 align:start position:0%
exemption granted or have it publicly
granted

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
granted
 
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
would a blanket exemption just you can
 
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
do as you wish
 
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
there are limits um there are limits in
 
00:18:05.039 --> 00:18:06.070 align:start position:0%
there are limits um there are limits in
rules

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
that that would be applied to many of
 
00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
these things
 
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
some of them just take time i mean they
 
00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
are resolved in in due course but
 
00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
things like customer complaints
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
can are difficult to resolve in a 30-day
 
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
period because the result require
 
00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.070 align:start position:0%
period because the result require
negotiations

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
negotiations
 
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
you know between the utility and and the
 
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
um the customer
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up uh was b what takes precedence
 
00:18:35.669 --> 00:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
what's in statute
 
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
which would we are doing
 
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
or the rules
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
the statute and the rules um
 
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
do not conflict if this
 
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions for mr shulock
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
or discussion of the
 
00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
question of adopting
 
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
one more question from representative
 
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
mcgee thank you
 
00:19:06.789 --> 00:19:06.799 align:start position:0%
um and this question is
 
00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
at the top of page two there's some
 
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
language that's removed starting on line
 
00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:11.750 align:start position:0%
language that's removed starting on line
three

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
but the sentence uh that it that that
 
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
sentence that the section of the
 
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
sentence that's removed modifies is
 
00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
section seven
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
ensure that the department provides all
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
necessary support to the public
 
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
utilities commission the site evaluation
 
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
committee office of the consumer
 
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
advocate and any other entity that is
 
00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to the
 
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
department and then after the comment is
 
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
removed and it says provided that
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
other than for administrative functions
 
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
department employees shall not
 
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
communicate with the public utilities
 
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
commission and its staff in connection
 
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
with any issue in a matter pending
 
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
before the commission or the department
 
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
except upon notice and opportunity for
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
all parties to participate and i
 
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
tricky to administer but i also think
 
00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.270 align:start position:0%
tricky to administer but i also think
that

00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
that that language is very specific to
 
00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
the red line that we've discussed
 
00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
between the two
 
00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:06.710 align:start position:0%
between the two
agencies

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
so that that is what was referred to as
 
00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
the bright red line the problem was that
 
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
it in
 
00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:15.039 align:start position:0%
practice it was quite fuzzy
 
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
um and prohibited
 
00:20:19.029 --> 00:20:19.039 align:start position:0%
or seemed to prohibit
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
made difficult conversations between the
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
two agencies
 
00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
that made it difficult to achieve the
 
00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:26.799 align:start position:0%
efficiencies that i think that the
 
00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
statute was aimed at
 
00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:30.789 align:start position:0%
statute was aimed at
so

00:20:30.789 --> 00:20:30.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:30.799 --> 00:20:31.750 align:start position:0%
so
the

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
what we proposed was to sharpen that
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
bright red line a little bit
 
00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
by taking out the language that you see
 
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
there on page two
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
and substituting language that appears
 
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
on page one
 
00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
at lines 19 and 20.
 
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
we which says that in adjudicative
 
00:20:51.909 --> 00:20:51.919 align:start position:0%
proceedings as defined
 
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
by the administrative procedures act the
 
00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission and
 
00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
department shall be subject to
 
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
a provision of the
 
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
administrative procedures act that deals
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
with ex parte communications and that
 
00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
prohibits communications between
 
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
decision makers and advisors and anyone
 
00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh on the outside
 
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
so it would
 
00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:17.039 align:start position:0%
would prohibit department employees from
 
00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:18.799 align:start position:0%
having substantive discussions about
 
00:21:21.909 --> 00:21:21.919 align:start position:0%
ongoing adjudicative
 
00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
the substance of ongoing adjudicative
 
00:21:24.159 --> 00:21:25.270 align:start position:0%
the substance of ongoing adjudicative
matters

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
matters
 
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
at the commission with the puc right and
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
vice versa because the department will
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
thank you to follow up on representative
 
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:38.480 align:start position:0%

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
yes it prohibits ex partake uh
 
00:21:52.149 --> 00:21:52.159 align:start position:0%

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:59.909 --> 00:21:59.919 align:start position:0%
looking for clarification here thank you
 
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.110 align:start position:0%
mr chair
um

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:05.919 align:start position:0%
how is it possible for the department to
 
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:12.149 --> 00:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
we manage other programs federal
 
00:22:12.159 --> 00:22:13.190 align:start position:0%
we manage other programs federal
programs

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
um and occasionally complaints may be
 
00:22:17.029 --> 00:22:17.039 align:start position:0%
filed and those would need to be
 
00:22:17.039 --> 00:22:18.950 align:start position:0%
filed and those would need to be
adjudicated

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
adjudicated
 
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
and that the public utilities commission
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
has no jurisdiction over those
 
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
so they would be adjudicated in-house as
 
00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480 align:start position:0%

yes 22 nothing
 
00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
by a vote of 22 the nothing the
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
bill hb 1258 is adopted as amended
 
00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
i suspect this bill is
 
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
not the kind of bill that we want to put
 
00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
on the consent calendar because if
 
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
someone looks in the calendar and sees
 
00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:18.799 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
being what 10 11 pages long they may
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
have questions so we will not put this
 
00:27:27.029 --> 00:27:27.039 align:start position:0%
bill on the consent calendar even though
 
00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
it passes with a unanimous bipartisan
 
00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:31.510 align:start position:0%
it passes with a unanimous bipartisan
vote

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
and with that we will take a
 
00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
eight minute cookie break please be back
 
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
i have to officially close the exact
 
00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
session on 12 58. done the length of the
 
00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:51.919 align:start position:0%
amendment means it can't
 
00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
never happen but i would have objected
 
00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
to consent
 
00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
it deserves debate if somebody wants a
 
00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:57.990 align:start position:0%
it deserves debate if somebody wants a
debate

00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
debate
 
00:28:00.549 --> 00:28:00.559 align:start position:0%
which they can anyway just we always
 
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
have these
 
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
arguments on the floor why is this one
 
00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
okay it's 10 35 so let's get back to
 
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
work now that we've had our
 
00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
caloric needs satisfied i trust
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
so i would like to now open the public
 
00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.310 align:start position:0%
so i would like to now open the public
hearing

00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:00.320 align:start position:0%

00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:07.839 align:start position:0%
relative to natural gas transmission
 
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
pipeline safety
 
00:36:11.589 --> 00:36:11.599 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes representative
 
00:36:11.599 --> 00:36:12.790 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes representative
murder

00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:12.800 align:start position:0%

00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
yes mr chairman i move out to pass on
 
00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:17.829 align:start position:0%
yes mr chairman i move out to pass on

representative merner is recognized to
 
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%

yes thank you um
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
mr chairman basically the the bill
 
00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
requires local and land use boards
 
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh to notify the operator of the trans
 
00:36:49.109 --> 00:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
national gas transmission pipeline prior
 
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
to approving any project within a
 
00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
thank you so this bill is basically a
 
00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
safety measure
 
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
and it prevents someone from buying a
 
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
piece of property next to a
 
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
existing pipeline and there's only one
 
00:37:07.829 --> 00:37:07.839 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and that's up in the
 
00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
northern part of the state
 
00:37:11.109 --> 00:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
prevents someone from buying a piece of
 
00:37:13.829 --> 00:37:13.839 align:start position:0%
property and then putting in a swimming
 
00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
pool too close to a to the pipeline
 
00:37:19.349 --> 00:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
that's the purpose of this bill it's
 
00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
fairly simple and straightforward
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative pementel
 
00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh we did get an
 
00:37:29.109 --> 00:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
amendment on this bill are we going to
 
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
do the amendment
 
00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:31.990 align:start position:0%
do the amendment
uh

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:32.000 align:start position:0%

uh
0547h

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
i had forgotten that thank you for
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
the next question will be how many of us
 
00:38:02.829 --> 00:38:02.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
yeah right representative pimentel can
 
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
you refresh our memory as to the purpose
 
00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:11.599 align:start position:0%
and the subject of the amendment
 
00:38:11.599 --> 00:38:14.790 align:start position:0%
and the subject of the amendment
um

00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
yeah the amendment uh
 
00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
is inserting by section two of the bill
 
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
by replacing it with the following
 
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.400 align:start position:0%

00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
development that is located in whole or
 
00:38:31.829 --> 00:38:31.839 align:start position:0%
in part within one thousand feet of the
 
00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
center point of the
 
00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
of a gas transmission pipeline that was
 
00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
constructed or operated prior to the
 
00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
development the applicant shall notify
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
the operator of the natural gas pipeline
 
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
transmission pipeline of the planned
 
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
development no later than the time of
 
00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:52.800 align:start position:0%

or 180 days
 
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
to commencement of construction
 
00:39:02.069 --> 00:39:02.079 align:start position:0%
whichever is earlier
 
00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%

by section 2 of this of the bill by
 
00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
replacing it with the following so this
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
would be a new section 4.
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%

00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
thank you representative pementel as i
 
00:40:06.309 --> 00:40:06.319 align:start position:0%
recall that last section
 
00:40:08.309 --> 00:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
was designed to prevent
 
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
imposing on local municipalities a
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
requirement that they
 
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
invest in
 
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
some fairly expensive maps
 
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
whether there's a pipeline anywhere near
 
00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
their town or not which was a a good
 
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.030 align:start position:0%
their town or not which was a a good
amendment

00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
so i think we're going to want to adopt
 
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
and in order for us to do that i think
 
00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to have copies made
 
00:40:35.589 --> 00:40:35.599 align:start position:0%
so that everybody can see this amendment
 
00:40:35.599 --> 00:40:36.829 align:start position:0%
so that everybody can see this amendment
so

00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:36.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%

make a copy of this amendment
and

00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%

with that
 
00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
amendment and then we will ask a uh for
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
someone to make a motion to adopt the
 
00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:57.910 align:start position:0%
someone to make a motion to adopt the
amendment

00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:57.920 align:start position:0%

oh okay
 
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
so is there any general discussion
 
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
before we get the copies back from
 
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
kristen representative mick williams has
 
00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:19.829 align:start position:0%

applicant shall notify the operator of
 
00:41:29.589 --> 00:41:29.599 align:start position:0%
the natural gras gas transmission
 
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
pipeline how exactly does that work how
 
00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
does the applicant notify the natural
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
a good question
 
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
the natural gas pipeline transmission
 
00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:45.839 align:start position:0%
company would be or pipeline owner would
 
00:41:48.309 --> 00:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
be a company like tc energy in the case
 
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
of the only pipeline that runs through
 
00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:52.079 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:41:52.079 --> 00:41:53.030 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
and

00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that their offices
 
00:41:58.710 --> 00:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
are reachable through
 
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
normal channels i'm sure the
 
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
planning board or
 
00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
other municipal
 
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
office with within the town would have
 
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
the address of tc energy so
 
00:42:11.109 --> 00:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
one would assume that that's how the
 
00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
and then what is the enforcement if they
 
00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
fail to do so
 
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
fail to notify within the timeline 180
 
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
days so six months you've got a
 
00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
developer who buys a parcel they're
 
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
gonna put a house sorry developer buys a
 
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
parcel they're gonna put a house on it
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
they have
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
a six-month
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
deadline here to let tc energy know hey
 
00:42:37.349 --> 00:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
i'm going to put a house up on this
 
00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
parcel and they fail to do it so what
 
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
happens if they fail
 
00:42:43.589 --> 00:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
there's a chair
 
00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
representative thomas um i think during
 
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
public hearing i
 
00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
i'm i believe i asked that question to
 
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
the individual at the time
 
00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:53.910 align:start position:0%
the individual at the time
and

00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
basically the response and it may have
 
00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
been offline too so i apologize but i
 
00:42:59.589 --> 00:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
think the answer was
 
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
that if they don't notify
 
00:43:05.109 --> 00:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
that's fine but when they find out
 
00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:11.349 --> 00:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
delay the actual construction or say you
 
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
you can't put it here or in other ways
 
00:43:15.829 --> 00:43:15.839 align:start position:0%
to say that
 
00:43:17.589 --> 00:43:17.599 align:start position:0%
you you didn't notify us therefore
 
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
you're within the thousand foot foot
 
00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
mark and we are putting a stop to your
 
00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
construction so that's one of the
 
00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
repercussions of not notifying
 
00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
them at all now how they do it i i don't
 
00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:32.390 align:start position:0%
them at all now how they do it i i don't
know

00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
representative plett
 
00:43:36.069 --> 00:43:36.079 align:start position:0%
yes i will point out on page two of the
 
00:43:36.079 --> 00:43:37.670 align:start position:0%
yes i will point out on page two of the
bill

00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
line seven a building permit shall not
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
be issued and the building shall not be
 
00:43:43.109 --> 00:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
erected in a lot within the jurisdiction
 
00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
of a local land use board unless one of
 
00:43:47.349 --> 00:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
the following threat free criteria and
 
00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
met are met the developer receive
 
00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
written consent developers not receive
 
00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
written consent
 
00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
but has filed with such local and used
 
00:43:56.069 --> 00:43:56.079 align:start position:0%
board written correspondence uh
 
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
demonstrating discussions and outreach
 
00:43:59.430 --> 00:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
have occurred or the developers filed
 
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
and dated a written correspondent with
 
00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
such local unions for the land use board
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
that demonstrates attempts to contact so
 
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
it's covered they can't build and get a
 
00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
well represent
 
00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
representative murder yeah i was trying
 
00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
to get in earlier
 
00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
with the mapping system that's going to
 
00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
be provided to all land use boards up
 
00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
there with this pipeline
 
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
when they apply for the application
 
00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to notify the land
 
00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:28.079 align:start position:0%
use board will notify
 
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
the abutters because they have to about
 
00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
them anyways to approve the project and
 
00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
with that thousand foot offset it would
 
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
automatically kick in
 
00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:37.349 align:start position:0%
automatically kick in
okay

00:44:37.349 --> 00:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
representative mick williams does that
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
answer your questions
 
00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
yes it does thank you thank you great
 
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
thank you representative callie
 
00:44:47.829 --> 00:44:47.839 align:start position:0%
pitts did you have a question yeah i
 
00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
just like a clarification
 
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
there's only one pipeline in new
 
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
we don't distinguish what consists of a
 
00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:02.630 align:start position:0%
we don't distinguish what consists of a
pipeline

00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
pipeline
 
00:45:05.109 --> 00:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
i remember when the gas plant was built
 
00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
in derry
 
00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:07.839 align:start position:0%
there was a big
 
00:45:07.839 --> 00:45:09.190 align:start position:0%
there was a big
question

00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
about putting
 
00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
a quote-unquote
 
00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
pipeline which probably is not a
 
00:45:18.309 --> 00:45:18.319 align:start position:0%
pipeline is a distribution line or
 
00:45:18.319 --> 00:45:19.510 align:start position:0%
pipeline is a distribution line or
whatever

00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
up to that plant near a school so what
 
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
is the classification
 
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
or the definition of pipeline does it
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
have to have so much capacity does it
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
have to have
 
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
what does a pipeline have to have
 
00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
representative thomas can answer that
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you mr chair and again
 
00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
i asked that question at time of the
 
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
public hearing again maybe offline i'm
 
00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
not sure
 
00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
i think the distinction is that the
 
00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
pipeline that we're talking about in
 
00:45:51.589 --> 00:45:51.599 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:45:55.109 --> 00:45:55.119 align:start position:0%
is the only transmission pipeline
 
00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
in the state the other pipelines are
 
00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.430 align:start position:0%
in the state the other pipelines are
distribution

00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
distribution
 
00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
and the differentiation is that this is
 
00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
a transmission pipeline governed by ferc
 
00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
and i i believe that is the
 
00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
the actual distinction that's why it
 
00:46:13.589 --> 00:46:13.599 align:start position:0%
applies only this pipeline up up north
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
representative platt mr chair i would
 
00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
ask the mover and second until we'd
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
rather motion in second and make another
 
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
new motion and second directed towards
 
00:46:25.109 --> 00:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
the amendment rather than the bill
 
00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
representative murderer would you
 
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
withdraw your original motion and make
 
00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
an emotion to
 
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
adopt the amendment please yes withdraw
 
00:46:38.069 --> 00:46:38.079 align:start position:0%
and that and would you move to amend
 
00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:40.520 align:start position:0%
the bill with
 
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
2022-05478 yes i make a motion to amend
 
00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
representative wiki i second so it's
 
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
moved in seconded that we adopt
 
00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:54.510 align:start position:0%
moved in seconded that we adopt
amendment

00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:54.520 align:start position:0%

seeing none i'll ask the clerk to call
 
00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:10.160 align:start position:0%

amended by amendment 20 22 05 47 h any
 
00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
further discussion on this bill
 
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee thank you mr
 
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
chairman i only had one note here from
 
00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
our discussion on the bill and i
 
00:48:58.710 --> 00:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
probably should have brought it up with
 
00:49:00.069 --> 00:49:00.079 align:start position:0%
the amendment but
 
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
um on page two
 
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
section six it says a building permit
 
00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
shall not be issued
 
00:49:09.349 --> 00:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
and in our discussion we discussed
 
00:49:11.109 --> 00:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
changing it to may
 
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
not be issued from shell and i don't
 
00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
it's a knit but
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
that was what we discussed at the time
 
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
and um i don't know if it makes a big
 
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
difference but it seems like it might
 
00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
the senate can change representative
 
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
oxendine do you have a comment
 
00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for calling on me mr chair yes
 
00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
i certainly recall i've been looking
 
00:49:34.549 --> 00:49:34.559 align:start position:0%
at the amendment where's the may where's
 
00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
the may because i remember we had quite
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
a lengthy discussion
 
00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
at which we agreed uh on on the may and
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
i think that may be why most of you
 
00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
didn't have the amendment because we
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
were told we'd get a new one that would
 
00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
have the may
 
00:49:55.349 --> 00:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative liewicki
 
00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um as written this
 
00:50:02.549 --> 00:50:02.559 align:start position:0%
would effectively be a taking in my mind
 
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:08.549 --> 00:50:08.559 align:start position:0%
representative platt
 
00:50:11.109 --> 00:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
actually i and
 
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
shall i kind of like
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
uh is it because you do not get a permit
 
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
unless you notify or you are those other
 
00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:19.190 align:start position:0%
unless you notify or you are those other
conditions

00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:25.829 --> 00:50:25.839 align:start position:0%
so um just to be clear about the
 
00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
difference between shall and may
 
00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
keeping shall in means that we are
 
00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
giving the power to the existing
 
00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:33.910 align:start position:0%
giving the power to the existing
pipeline

00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
pipeline
 
00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
to issue or not issue a permit based on
 
00:50:38.309 --> 00:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
communications with that pipeline shall
 
00:50:40.309 --> 00:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
means the pipeline is basically doing a
 
00:50:42.309 --> 00:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
taking of an existing property that
 
00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
someone would like to develop
 
00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
the may leaves the authority with the
 
00:50:48.069 --> 00:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
existing authority having jurisdiction
 
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
which is often the municipal office of
 
00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:51.270 align:start position:0%
which is often the municipal office of
building

00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
often or whoever the town uses to
 
00:50:56.309 --> 00:50:56.319 align:start position:0%
outsource that so in effect you would
 
00:50:58.150 --> 00:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
actually be moving the authority from
 
00:51:00.069 --> 00:51:00.079 align:start position:0%
your local building jurisdiction to the
 
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
pipeline about whether or not you can
 
00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
build there and frankly i don't think
 
00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:08.549 --> 00:51:08.559 align:start position:0%
representative platt mr chair i would
 
00:51:11.109 --> 00:51:11.119 align:start position:0%
suggest an amendment be made
 
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
with ols quickly and we recess this till
 
00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
it's back
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
let's have a show of hands how many
 
00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
people think we should recess this
 
00:51:23.349 --> 00:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
executive session and obtain
 
00:51:25.829 --> 00:51:25.839 align:start position:0%
a new amendment that uses the word may
 
00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
instead of shall
 
00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:43.829 --> 00:51:43.839 align:start position:0%
okay we will recess this public hearing
 
00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
and obtain a
 
00:51:48.309 --> 00:51:48.319 align:start position:0%
i mean this uh executive session rather
 
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
and obtain a new amendment very
 
00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
important that includes the word
 
00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
may instead of shall
 
00:52:00.309 --> 00:52:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
the biggest busiest lady in the room
 
00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:10.950 align:start position:0%
the biggest busiest lady in the room
today

00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
so the public hearing on
 
00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:14.069 align:start position:0%
so the public hearing on
the

00:52:14.069 --> 00:52:14.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:17.109 --> 00:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
executive session on house bill 1491 is
 
00:52:17.119 --> 00:52:20.390 align:start position:0%
executive session on house bill 1491 is
recessed

00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
and if you'll bear with me for a moment
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
i just need to give kristen some
 
00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:26.230 align:start position:0%
i just need to give kristen some
instructions

00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
instructions
 
00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
so she can uh
 
00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
well she has her own copy so
 
00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
does she see where the maid belongs it's
 
00:52:43.829 --> 00:52:43.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
all right so to clarify the situation
 
00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
when we resume this executive session
 
00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
the first order of business will be to
 
00:53:30.079 --> 00:53:31.510 align:start position:0%
the first order of business will be to
reconsider

00:53:31.510 --> 00:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
reconsider
 
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
the vote on the amendment that we
 
00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:34.870 align:start position:0%
the vote on the amendment that we
adopted

00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
and we will all vote no
 
00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
vote yes on reconsideration
 
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
and then we'll we will vote no on the
 
00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:43.190 align:start position:0%
and then we'll we will vote no on the
amendment

00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:44.549 align:start position:0%
amendment
to

00:53:44.549 --> 00:53:44.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
get rid of the first amendment
 
00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
then we'll have a motion on a second
 
00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
amendment which we'll have back from ols
 
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
by then
 
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
and kristen the the time frame on that
 
00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:02.109 --> 00:54:02.119 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you
 
00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
representative you have a comment yes uh
 
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
since we are amending a different
 
00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
portion of the bill
 
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
can we
 
00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
we would i would think we would either
 
00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
have to include the previous amendment
 
00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
with the um in this new amendment um in
 
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
order to make it correct
 
00:54:23.349 --> 00:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
yes the new amendment will contain the
 
00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
two paragraphs of the old amendment plus
 
00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
a new paragraph that changes the word
 
00:54:30.069 --> 00:54:30.079 align:start position:0%
shell to may
 
00:54:30.079 --> 00:54:32.230 align:start position:0%
shell to may
okay

00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
representative pimentel
 
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
isn't the last amendment we
 
00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
pass the amendment that
 
00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
is used
 
00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
therefore we don't really have to
 
00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:48.799 align:start position:0%
uh un undo the other amendment
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
the new amendment would just
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
that is not correct because you can only
 
00:54:55.829 --> 00:54:55.839 align:start position:0%
report a bill out of committee with one
 
00:54:55.839 --> 00:54:57.190 align:start position:0%
report a bill out of committee with one
amendment

00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:54:59.030 --> 00:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
so we have to combine the two amendments
 
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
and so it wouldn't make the first
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
amendment moot then no okay thank you
 
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
that's why we have to reconsider it once
 
00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:06.390 align:start position:0%
that's why we have to reconsider it once
we

00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:12.789 --> 00:55:12.799 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:20.309 --> 00:55:20.319 align:start position:0%
i think we will deal next since we're
 
00:55:22.309 --> 00:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
coming up on the lunch hour
 
00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
we will deal next with house bill 1611.
 
00:55:28.870 --> 00:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to open an executive
 
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
session on house bill 1611
 
00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to recognize

00:55:53.119 --> 00:55:54.950 align:start position:0%
that we judge house bill 1611 to be
itl

00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
itl
 
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
is there any discussion
 
00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:58.390 align:start position:0%
is there any discussion
representative

00:55:58.390 --> 00:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:00.309 align:start position:0%
representative
occidum

00:56:00.309 --> 00:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
occidum
 
00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
representative harrington is yeah
 
00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
there's actually a couple of reasons
 
00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
first there's no compelling need for the
 
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
bill uh in the near future because there
 
00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
are no projects that would be affected
 
00:56:15.829 --> 00:56:15.839 align:start position:0%
by these changes that's in the
 
00:56:17.829 --> 00:56:17.839 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee queue
 
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
that's kind of slowed down quite a bit
 
00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
and again this these changes would not
 
00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
affect wind projects for example
 
00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
second thing is there's been some
 
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
discussion between the house and the
 
00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
senate on a bigger picture review of the
 
00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee and it would
 
00:56:35.349 --> 00:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
be make more sense to roll whatever of
 
00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
this bill we thought was a good idea
 
00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
into those discussions and address that
 
00:56:42.069 --> 00:56:42.079 align:start position:0%
at a later time in a more comprehensive
 
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh bill
 
00:56:48.069 --> 00:56:48.079 align:start position:0%
further discussion on the motion to itl
 
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
house bill 1611
 
00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
representative mann did you want to make
 
00:56:55.589 --> 00:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:57.109 --> 00:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
well seeing none i guess i'm going to
 
00:56:59.190 --> 00:56:59.200 align:start position:0%

00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%

01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
they're okay with either way we go on
 
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
may or shall
 
01:13:33.430 --> 01:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
but the bottom line is this
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
if you
 
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
if you
 
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:36.950 align:start position:0%
if you
uh

01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
if if you put main there and the t and
 
01:13:41.189 --> 01:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
giving the town the authority to whether
 
01:13:43.270 --> 01:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
or not they can overrule what the
 
01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
transmission pipeline says
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh their uh prerogative
 
01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:48.870 align:start position:0%
uh their uh prerogative
if

01:13:48.870 --> 01:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
the result is that you wind up do
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
building something closer than the
 
01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:54.640 align:start position:0%
thousand foot
 
01:13:56.950 --> 01:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
then that would change the
 
01:13:59.750 --> 01:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
classification of the pipeline or the
 
01:14:02.310 --> 01:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
project going to the pipeline at that
 
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
point the federal agency fisma which is
 
01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
sort of like the equivalent of ferc
 
01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
would get involved they're part of the
 
01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
department of transportation would get
 
01:14:14.310 --> 01:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
involved and they would basically say
 
01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
you've just changed the classification
 
01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
of this project therefore cease and
 
01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:18.550 align:start position:0%
of this project therefore cease and
desist

01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
desist
 
01:14:20.070 --> 01:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
we're not going to allow you to build
 
01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:20.870 align:start position:0%
we're not going to allow you to build
there

01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
and so the
 
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is that if you if you
 
01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
however you decided if you build within
 
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
that thousand foot you're changing the
 
01:14:32.310 --> 01:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
classification of that project and
 
01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
you'll get fisma come down and and
 
01:14:37.189 --> 01:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
basically say uh you've
 
01:14:39.510 --> 01:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
by our rules by federal rules you can't
 
01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
build that that project there so either
 
01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
way it would be it would behoove the
 
01:14:45.669 --> 01:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
town planners to just accept the
 
01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
transmissions um you know
 
01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:49.590 align:start position:0%
transmissions um you know
authorization

01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
authorization
 
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
to uh whether or not they could you know
 
01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
build or not
 
01:14:57.270 --> 01:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
so either way uh shall or may um
 
01:15:00.709 --> 01:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
it the end result is uh if you do then
 
01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
you might get fism down to to let you
 
01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
know what you could or couldn't do and
 
01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's about how it was explained
 
01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
to me it very rarely happens that way
 
01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
but you know it could
 
01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
so based on that explanation it would
 
01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
seem that
 
01:15:19.669 --> 01:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
to simplify the process here we don't
 
01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
need to reconsider the previous
 
01:15:24.229 --> 01:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
amendment and adopt this new amendment
 
01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
because this new amendment
 
01:15:30.229 --> 01:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
would have no effect in us in essence
 
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
so at this point we should just move
 
01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
forward with the amendment we already
 
01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:36.070 align:start position:0%
forward with the amendment we already
adopted

01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
01:15:38.550 --> 01:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
representative oxendine do you have uh a
 
01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:39.750 align:start position:0%
representative oxendine do you have uh a
comment

01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
comment
 
01:15:42.229 --> 01:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair yes i'm i'm surprised
 
01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
that when we had this discussion about
 
01:15:45.669 --> 01:15:45.679 align:start position:0%
may and we had the pipeline
 
01:15:47.669 --> 01:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
representative in the room
 
01:15:50.229 --> 01:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
that this matter was not brought up
 
01:15:50.239 --> 01:15:51.030 align:start position:0%
that this matter was not brought up
uh

01:15:51.030 --> 01:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:54.070 --> 01:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
and i i don't think that we should be
 
01:15:56.709 --> 01:15:56.719 align:start position:0%
voting on bills on
 
01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh hearsay evidence from a call that one
 
01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
member had with somebody offline i i
 
01:16:04.229 --> 01:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
don't i don't think that's a responsible
 
01:16:06.870 --> 01:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
way for us to go forward well with all
 
01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
due respect i do remember that that
 
01:16:10.630 --> 01:16:10.640 align:start position:0%
discussion was had during the public
 
01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
hearing you did explain that
 
01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
i don't think it was in regard to the
 
01:16:18.630 --> 01:16:18.640 align:start position:0%
to a discussion about shall versus may
 
01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
but it was with regard to how the whole
 
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
process works i do remember him talking
 
01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:24.950 align:start position:0%
process works i do remember him talking
about

01:16:24.950 --> 01:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:26.149 align:start position:0%
about
the

01:16:26.149 --> 01:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:16:29.189 --> 01:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
federal versus state jurisdiction in
 
01:16:31.669 --> 01:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
these matters and it was explained by
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
him during the course of his testimony
 
01:16:37.189 --> 01:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
in the public hearing follow-up follow
 
01:16:37.199 --> 01:16:38.070 align:start position:0%
in the public hearing follow-up follow
up

01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:16:40.550 --> 01:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
believe me i take extensive notes on
 
01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:42.400 align:start position:0%
these hearings and i would have taken
 
01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
cease and desist down and had it
 
01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:47.430 align:start position:0%
cease and desist down and had it
asterisked

01:16:47.430 --> 01:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
asterisked
 
01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
that that did not come up
 
01:16:51.990 --> 01:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
and the the other point
 
01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:52.790 align:start position:0%
and the the other point
oh

01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
i'm i i i'm yes that's what it was
 
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
if there is a difference between the
 
01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:06.470 align:start position:0%
if there is a difference between the
feds

01:17:06.470 --> 01:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
feds
 
01:17:08.229 --> 01:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
moving in and
 
01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
taking and us as a committee
 
01:17:13.830 --> 01:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
saying that we are going to authorize
 
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
to make a taking
 
01:17:20.229 --> 01:17:20.239 align:start position:0%
which um i believe was representative
 
01:17:21.910 --> 01:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
wiki's point
 
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
maybe i didn't understand it
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
use the microphone please representative
 
01:17:29.350 --> 01:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
yes the question my question was is this
 
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
a taking
 
01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:31.350 align:start position:0%
a taking
and

01:17:31.350 --> 01:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:17:35.430 --> 01:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
if it is then who provides compensation
 
01:17:38.229 --> 01:17:38.239 align:start position:0%
rep representative platt it is not a
 
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
taking and it's because of the language
 
01:17:42.630 --> 01:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
in the bill there's no way that this can
 
01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:43.350 align:start position:0%
in the bill there's no way that this can
be

01:17:43.350 --> 01:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:17:44.470 --> 01:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
this gives
 
01:17:47.910 --> 01:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
the pipeline veto power no way
 
01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:48.950 align:start position:0%
the pipeline veto power no way
because

01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:49.750 align:start position:0%
because
uh

01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:17:51.669 --> 01:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
in the bill as i read it
 
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
on page two
 
01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
a building permit shall not be issued
 
01:17:57.189 --> 01:17:57.199 align:start position:0%
that's true and a building shall not be
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
erected a lot within the jurisdiction or
 
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
local land use board unless one of the
 
01:18:03.669 --> 01:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
following three criteria are met
 
01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
the first one is the developers receive
 
01:18:07.110 --> 01:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
written consent from the natural gas
 
01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
pipeline operator has filed such consent
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
but if they don't get consent there's
 
01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
two other conditions and the the
 
01:18:15.910 --> 01:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
developers not receive written consent
 
01:18:18.149 --> 01:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
but has filed with such locally and
 
01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
land use board written correspondence
 
01:18:22.229 --> 01:18:22.239 align:start position:0%
from the pipeline are operated
 
01:18:23.669 --> 01:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
discussing that
 
01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
demonstrating the discussions and
 
01:18:27.030 --> 01:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
outreach have occurred and the third one
 
01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
is the developers file dated and written
 
01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
correspondence with such locally unused
 
01:18:32.630 --> 01:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
belinda's board that demonstrates
 
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
attempts to contact the natural gas
 
01:18:36.229 --> 01:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
pipeline operator and that no response
 
01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
has been received within 180 days of the
 
01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
filing so if a developer goes and tries
 
01:18:42.870 --> 01:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
to reach out to the pipeline opera they
 
01:18:45.669 --> 01:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
don't get a response within 180 days
 
01:18:47.189 --> 01:18:47.199 align:start position:0%
they're out of the picture so there's no
 
01:18:49.270 --> 01:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
way that there's a veto power by the
 
01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:51.830 align:start position:0%
way that there's a veto power by the
pipeline

01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative thomas
 
01:18:56.070 --> 01:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i i might note
 
01:18:59.189 --> 01:18:59.199 align:start position:0%
that in in my notes um
 
01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
again the uh
 
01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:02.870 align:start position:0%
again the uh
the

01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:02.880 align:start position:0%

this bill doesn't allow gas company to
 
01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
deny permit only to have a conversation
 
01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
so that was the intent of this entire
 
01:19:14.719 --> 01:19:17.910 align:start position:0%
so that was the intent of this entire
bill

01:19:17.910 --> 01:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:18.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:19:18.790 --> 01:19:18.800 align:start position:0%

01:19:24.229 --> 01:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative thomas for
 
01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
clarifying the intent from the pipeline
 
01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:28.149 align:start position:0%
clarifying the intent from the pipeline
company

01:19:28.149 --> 01:19:28.159 align:start position:0%
company
 
01:19:30.870 --> 01:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
um i i'm feeling like the language in
 
01:19:33.030 --> 01:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
section six is rather draconian if that
 
01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
truly is the pipe pipeline's intent was
 
01:19:37.510 --> 01:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
just to get notification so this whole
 
01:19:39.750 --> 01:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
first line of written consent
 
01:19:41.350 --> 01:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
sounds rather draconian if that's not
 
01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
their intention all along why does it
 
01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
say written consent
 
01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:45.430 align:start position:0%
say written consent
so

01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:46.870 --> 01:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
that part i don't think should even be
 
01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
in there if that's not the intention of
 
01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
the pipeline
 
01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
the attempt to contact i get i get that
 
01:19:55.030 --> 01:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
um i i get that you might send something
 
01:19:58.229 --> 01:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
return receipt requested to tci and say
 
01:19:59.669 --> 01:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
you know i need to get this postcard
 
01:20:01.189 --> 01:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
back so that i can move forward with my
 
01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
building permit application but it's
 
01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
creating an additional step for the the
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
local municipality to track
 
01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
okay we've got this developer who's
 
01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
doing their checklist to do a permit for
 
01:20:12.629 --> 01:20:12.639 align:start position:0%
a new building on a lot that they've
 
01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
purchased and add in one more line have
 
01:20:16.709 --> 01:20:16.719 align:start position:0%
they reached out to the pipeline because
 
01:20:18.629 --> 01:20:18.639 align:start position:0%
this property according to the maps and
 
01:20:20.070 --> 01:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
that's i think that's the key thing that
 
01:20:21.510 --> 01:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
this bill does is it forces the
 
01:20:23.830 --> 01:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities to put the maps online
 
01:20:25.590 --> 01:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
which makes it super easy for anyone
 
01:20:27.510 --> 01:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
who's buying a lot to see okay what are
 
01:20:29.189 --> 01:20:29.199 align:start position:0%
the local jurisdiction requirements i'm
 
01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
looking at the local building code and
 
01:20:31.830 --> 01:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
there are these maps that are applicable
 
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
and it says if you're in this zone you
 
01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
need to notify the pipeline that's
 
01:20:37.270 --> 01:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
really how it works so the crux of this
 
01:20:39.669 --> 01:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
is not really about written consent and
 
01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
i i take offense to adding that
 
01:20:44.070 --> 01:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
additional what i see as an honoris step
 
01:20:46.229 --> 01:20:46.239 align:start position:0%
for a developer to have to get written
 
01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
consent which is why i'm saying let's
 
01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
stick with the may
 
01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
rather than shall let's not be draconian
 
01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
let's not be forcing this let's simply
 
01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
make it very obvious that this is
 
01:20:57.750 --> 01:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
something you need to do
 
01:20:59.430 --> 01:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
it is something that is being added to
 
01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
the checklist
 
01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
but it is not a
 
01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
stop everything right now it is more of
 
01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
a this is how the process will now work
 
01:21:08.229 --> 01:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
and and i really don't think that we
 
01:21:10.149 --> 01:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
want to have municipalities who are
 
01:21:11.990 --> 01:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
saying you can't possibly have a
 
01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
building permit because we're being told
 
01:21:15.669 --> 01:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
by the state that we can't issue a
 
01:21:17.189 --> 01:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
building permit because there's this
 
01:21:19.030 --> 01:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
pipeline so you can't have a building
 
01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
permit i don't think that that's the way
 
01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
we want this to function it really seems
 
01:21:24.310 --> 01:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
to me like we're adding additional
 
01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
layers here when the reality is we're
 
01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
just smoothing the process out we're
 
01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
providing maps we're making it very
 
01:21:31.270 --> 01:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
obvious that this is the checklist so
 
01:21:33.110 --> 01:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
it's about the language and it's also
 
01:21:34.629 --> 01:21:34.639 align:start position:0%
this whole written consent thing just
 
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
really turns me off so shall vs may to
 
01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
me is a big point
 
01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:43.189 align:start position:0%
me is a big point
mr

01:21:43.189 --> 01:21:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:46.790 --> 01:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
thomas uh thank you mr chair yes i um
 
01:21:49.510 --> 01:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
on this particular issue on this bill i
 
01:21:52.390 --> 01:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
don't have a hard issue with shell or
 
01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:53.270 align:start position:0%
don't have a hard issue with shell or
may

01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
may
 
01:21:56.390 --> 01:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
um i think in this particular normally i
 
01:21:57.990 --> 01:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
do have an issue with shallows versus
 
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
maize but in this case whether it's a
 
01:22:01.830 --> 01:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
shallower or may
 
01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
if the town doesn't follow the
 
01:22:04.709 --> 01:22:04.719 align:start position:0%
recommendation i think they're going to
 
01:22:06.790 --> 01:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
get hit over the knuckles anyway so
 
01:22:09.990 --> 01:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
i'm perfectly willing to go with may um
 
01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
if if that
 
01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
is comforting to
 
01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
everybody here because i think that
 
01:22:17.430 --> 01:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
there's enough
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
federal uh involvement that could
 
01:22:21.910 --> 01:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
could absolutely protect the safety
 
01:22:24.070 --> 01:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
which is what we're primarily trying to
 
01:22:26.070 --> 01:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
do here
 
01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
right i have an operational issue here
 
01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:29.510 align:start position:0%
right i have an operational issue here
did

01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:22:32.629 --> 01:22:32.639 align:start position:0%
anybody receive a copy of an amendment
 
01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
for this bill
 
01:22:37.270 --> 01:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
okay i received two copies of an
 
01:22:38.709 --> 01:22:38.719 align:start position:0%
amendment but they're both for the same
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
bill which is not this bill
 
01:22:43.830 --> 01:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so we don't have an amendment
 
01:22:45.030 --> 01:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
yet so
 
01:22:46.470 --> 01:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki you have a
 
01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:47.590 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki you have a
comment

01:22:47.590 --> 01:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
comment
 
01:22:50.629 --> 01:22:50.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman yes i do um
 
01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
all of the property within uh that
 
01:22:54.390 --> 01:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
contains the transmission line at this
 
01:22:56.229 --> 01:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
point has an easement that says such and
 
01:22:58.149 --> 01:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
such number of feet from the center line
 
01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
of the pipeline i would assume that this
 
01:23:02.470 --> 01:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
is less than a thousand feet if we pass
 
01:23:04.390 --> 01:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
this bill we have effectively increased
 
01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
the size of that easement it becomes a
 
01:23:08.709 --> 01:23:08.719 align:start position:0%
loose easement over that thousand feet
 
01:23:10.790 --> 01:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
but it's still an easement which was not
 
01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
in the pre-existing contract with the
 
01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:14.470 align:start position:0%
in the pre-existing contract with the
landowners

01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
landowners
 
01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
and i also made the point in
 
01:23:18.790 --> 01:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee's right now i also
 
01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
made the point in the hearing that that
 
01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
thousand feet from the center line goes
 
01:23:24.629 --> 01:23:24.639 align:start position:0%
from the center line both ways so it's
 
01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
actually 2 000 feet so it's an awful lot
 
01:23:28.229 --> 01:23:28.239 align:start position:0%
of land that we're talking about that's
 
01:23:28.239 --> 01:23:29.350 align:start position:0%
of land that we're talking about that's
affected

01:23:29.350 --> 01:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
affected
 
01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:30.310 align:start position:0%
affected
but

01:23:30.310 --> 01:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
i don't think we have any solution for
 
01:23:33.910 --> 01:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
that but that's it's a lot of land
 
01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:34.950 align:start position:0%
that but that's it's a lot of land
correct

01:23:34.950 --> 01:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
all right well since we represented
 
01:23:39.430 --> 01:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
harrington is recognized
 
01:23:40.550 --> 01:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
you know i've been listening to this
 
01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
discussion there's a lot going on with
 
01:23:44.790 --> 01:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
going back and forth and i guess i step
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
back for a little bit and say
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
why is it so important that we get this
 
01:23:51.189 --> 01:23:51.199 align:start position:0%
passed down we have one pipeline in the
 
01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
state there's no known problems maybe
 
01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
it's an issue in other parts of the
 
01:23:56.709 --> 01:23:56.719 align:start position:0%
country where this pipeline is literally
 
01:23:58.870 --> 01:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
running all over the place i don't know
 
01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
if sounds to me with all this back and
 
01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
forth about whether it's a legitimate uh
 
01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
issue just raised about a taking you're
 
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
certainly extending the size of the
 
01:24:09.910 --> 01:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
easement substantially uh the may versus
 
01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
shall i think if it has a may it has no
 
01:24:14.629 --> 01:24:14.639 align:start position:0%
teeth because then the applicant just
 
01:24:17.270 --> 01:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to do anything so i this
 
01:24:18.950 --> 01:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
would be right for interim study as far
 
01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
as i can see we're passing something
 
01:24:21.830 --> 01:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
here we don't really know what we're
 
01:24:23.189 --> 01:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
passing on what the effect is going to
 
01:24:25.990 --> 01:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
be so that would be my recommendation
 
01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
representative murder
 
01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
yeah i represent this whole pipeline i
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
represent 12 towns in cohorts county and
 
01:24:36.310 --> 01:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
it's built on unbuildable land 90 of the
 
01:24:38.149 --> 01:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
land that we're talking about the 2000
 
01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
feet if you want to
 
01:24:42.470 --> 01:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
go you know on either side of it and
 
01:24:44.709 --> 01:24:44.719 align:start position:0%
it's not a problem i mean
 
01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
01:24:47.430 --> 01:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
i think putting this in statute and i
 
01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
think the most important part on this
 
01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
amendment which i can hand to you if you
 
01:24:52.229 --> 01:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
haven't seen it is section 4 of
 
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
requiring the mapping which you two have
 
01:24:56.470 --> 01:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
the most questions on that answers all
 
01:24:57.669 --> 01:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
of it uh
 
01:24:58.550 --> 01:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:25:01.030 --> 01:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
what's going going forward so
 
01:25:04.229 --> 01:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
we can debate this all day it's you know
 
01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
because like i say i represent that
 
01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
whole area and
 
01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
that's the amendment that we're talking
 
01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
about everyone says they don't have
 
01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
no we have one that's out to ols right
 
01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:16.390 align:start position:0%
no we have one that's out to ols right
now

01:25:16.390 --> 01:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:17.350 align:start position:0%
now
that's

01:25:17.350 --> 01:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:25:22.229 --> 01:25:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:22.239 --> 01:25:23.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:25:23.510 --> 01:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:25:24.550 --> 01:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:25:26.149 --> 01:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts you have a
 
01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
question i have a
 
01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
real question
 
01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:30.870 align:start position:0%
real question
if

01:25:30.870 --> 01:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:25:33.990 --> 01:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
if you buy a piece of land
 
01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
and there is a pipeline say 50 years
 
01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
from now people are unaware that there's
 
01:25:40.709 --> 01:25:40.719 align:start position:0%
a pipeline running under there is there
 
01:25:43.510 --> 01:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
something on the deed that says that
 
01:25:45.430 --> 01:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
this is so
 
01:25:49.030 --> 01:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
so if i buy a tractor land and
 
01:25:50.070 --> 01:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
it i
 
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
is there something on the deed to that
 
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
land that says
 
01:25:57.510 --> 01:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
that there is a pipeline under that land
 
01:26:00.070 --> 01:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
not above it but under it
 
01:26:02.070 --> 01:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
is there any anything that indicates
 
01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:03.350 align:start position:0%
is there any anything that indicates
that

01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:04.870 align:start position:0%
that
yes

01:26:04.870 --> 01:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:06.719 align:start position:0%
if you buy a piece of land
 
01:26:08.070 --> 01:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
and then you decide you want to put a
 
01:26:09.270 --> 01:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
house on it
 
01:26:10.629 --> 01:26:10.639 align:start position:0%
develop it
 
01:26:12.390 --> 01:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
the first thing the local planning board
 
01:26:15.110 --> 01:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
do will be to notify all abutters of
 
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
your intention
 
01:26:20.229 --> 01:26:20.239 align:start position:0%
if the pipeline owns property that abuts
 
01:26:22.709 --> 01:26:22.719 align:start position:0%
your property they will receive a notice
 
01:26:24.709 --> 01:26:24.719 align:start position:0%
that you intend to
 
01:26:26.870 --> 01:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
build on that property
 
01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
and they can take action to discover
 
01:26:31.189 --> 01:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
01:26:34.629 --> 01:26:34.639 align:start position:0%
your proposed development will impact
 
01:26:36.709 --> 01:26:36.719 align:start position:0%
the pipeline
 
01:26:36.719 --> 01:26:37.750 align:start position:0%
the pipeline
so

01:26:37.750 --> 01:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:39.189 align:start position:0%
so
yes

01:26:39.189 --> 01:26:39.199 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:26:40.709 --> 01:26:40.719 align:start position:0%
there will be
 
01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
if you buy a piece of land there will be
 
01:26:45.669 --> 01:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
information available to you about the
 
01:26:47.430 --> 01:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
existence of the pipeline and its
 
01:26:49.510 --> 01:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
location yeah
 
01:26:53.350 --> 01:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
may i i i just want to get it clear so i
 
01:26:55.189 --> 01:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
buy a piece of land which i never will
 
01:26:55.199 --> 01:26:56.070 align:start position:0%
buy a piece of land which i never will
do

01:26:56.070 --> 01:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:26:58.550 --> 01:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
and i'm gonna there's there's a pipeline
 
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
underneath it running underneath it
 
01:27:03.030 --> 01:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
buried pipeline
 
01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
on the deed
 
01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
before i buy that land
 
01:27:09.270 --> 01:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
is there something that indicates that
 
01:27:12.629 --> 01:27:12.639 align:start position:0%
there is a pipeline that runs
 
01:27:16.149 --> 01:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
under that property so that i'm aware
 
01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
of what's there and what's not that
 
01:27:21.270 --> 01:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
you know i that that's all i wanted to
 
01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
know because we have
 
01:27:24.870 --> 01:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
had instances where there have been
 
01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
lines sewer lines on properties
 
01:27:29.669 --> 01:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
that nobody knew about
 
01:27:31.590 --> 01:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
so i i just wanted to know does that
 
01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:33.030 align:start position:0%
so i i just wanted to know does that
happen

01:27:33.030 --> 01:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
no that's not the case with a
 
01:27:38.390 --> 01:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
transmission pipeline no you cannot buy
 
01:27:40.870 --> 01:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
land that is over a transmission
 
01:27:44.950 --> 01:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:46.870 --> 01:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
representative murder well it's like
 
01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
it's like railways uh existing power
 
01:27:51.030 --> 01:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
lines big everything has right-of-way
 
01:27:52.709 --> 01:27:52.719 align:start position:0%
this is where this is a transmission
 
01:27:55.030 --> 01:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
line it is a right-of-way so it cannot
 
01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
be done so that's the word you're
 
01:27:57.590 --> 01:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
01:27:57.600 --> 01:27:58.830 align:start position:0%
looking for
yeah

01:27:58.830 --> 01:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:28:00.629 --> 01:28:00.639 align:start position:0%
representative wiki thank you mr
 
01:28:03.510 --> 01:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
chairman any existing pipeline or
 
01:28:05.669 --> 01:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
electrical transmission line has
 
01:28:07.669 --> 01:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
easements across properties those
 
01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
easements are on the deed and they are
 
01:28:11.830 --> 01:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
registered with the registry of deeds so
 
01:28:14.550 --> 01:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
if you were to buy such a property it
 
01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
would be in the deed and it would be
 
01:28:19.350 --> 01:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
known it's not some it is well known and
 
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
well registered
 
01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
representative platt
 
01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
yes i
 
01:28:26.310 --> 01:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
don't know whether the
 
01:28:28.390 --> 01:28:28.400 align:start position:0%
actual easement or ownership by the
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
pipeline is a thousand feet each side
 
01:28:32.950 --> 01:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
it's probably a lot shorter than that
 
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
but and they cannot veto anything
 
01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
outside of their out of the outside of
 
01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
their easement or ownership but all
 
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
they're looking for is advise and
 
01:28:43.110 --> 01:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
consent can you do it this way rather
 
01:28:46.709 --> 01:28:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:48.470 --> 01:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
representative oxen did you have another
 
01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:49.750 align:start position:0%
representative oxen did you have another
comment

01:28:49.750 --> 01:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
comment
 
01:28:51.669 --> 01:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
i think it was answered thank you
 
01:28:51.679 --> 01:28:54.390 align:start position:0%
i think it was answered thank you
okay

01:28:54.390 --> 01:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:56.709 --> 01:28:56.719 align:start position:0%
representative thomas thank you mr chair
 
01:28:59.189 --> 01:28:59.199 align:start position:0%
i just want to go over again that this
 
01:29:00.390 --> 01:29:00.400 align:start position:0%
is a
 
01:29:02.629 --> 01:29:02.639 align:start position:0%
bill that is strictly to strengthen
 
01:29:06.149 --> 01:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
communications between the transmission
 
01:29:08.310 --> 01:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
company and the towns
 
01:29:10.310 --> 01:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't change any rules doesn't change
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
any existing rules but they want
 
01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
language in there to really strengthen
 
01:29:16.629 --> 01:29:16.639 align:start position:0%
the point that you must have a
 
01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
communication with us
 
01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:19.430 align:start position:0%
communication with us
because

01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:29:21.110 --> 01:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
it might be a case where they might say
 
01:29:22.470 --> 01:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
it's okay
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
uh within so many feet and there may be
 
01:29:26.229 --> 01:29:26.239 align:start position:0%
cases where they say
 
01:29:28.709 --> 01:29:28.719 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't because of classification
 
01:29:30.709 --> 01:29:30.719 align:start position:0%
changes so the
 
01:29:33.189 --> 01:29:33.199 align:start position:0%
overall intent of this bill was just to
 
01:29:35.830 --> 01:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
provide stronger safety measures and
 
01:29:37.590 --> 01:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
stronger communication
 
01:29:39.910 --> 01:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
and that's all that that's all the uh
 
01:29:42.070 --> 01:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
the originator was intended uh with this
 
01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:43.110 align:start position:0%
the originator was intended uh with this
bill

01:29:43.110 --> 01:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure how more i can say that
 
01:29:48.149 --> 01:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
but that's all it is it's not changing
 
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
any existing regulations rules it's only
 
01:29:55.110 --> 01:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
strengthening communications dialogue
 
01:29:56.550 --> 01:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
okay i'd like to get a sense of the
 
01:29:58.629 --> 01:29:58.639 align:start position:0%
committee on this bill
 
01:30:00.950 --> 01:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
we uh have an amendment that we could

02:33:04.389 --> 02:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
what this amendment does
 
02:33:07.110 --> 02:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
is it
 
02:33:07.120 --> 02:33:08.710 align:start position:0%
is it
codifies

02:33:08.710 --> 02:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
codifies
 
02:33:11.429 --> 02:33:11.439 align:start position:0%
the amendment we previously adopted
 
02:33:13.110 --> 02:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
and then adds
 
02:33:15.190 --> 02:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
amended language to section 4 that
 
02:33:17.349 --> 02:33:17.359 align:start position:0%
changes the word shall
 
02:33:18.630 --> 02:33:18.640 align:start position:0%
to may
 
02:33:22.469 --> 02:33:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:23.910 --> 02:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
and then it also
 
02:33:27.750 --> 02:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
changes the language to indicate that
 
02:33:29.510 --> 02:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
only one of the three
 
02:33:31.830 --> 02:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
subsequent conditions needs to be met
 
02:33:34.230 --> 02:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
not all of them as the previous language
 
02:33:34.240 --> 02:33:36.150 align:start position:0%
not all of them as the previous language
indicated

02:33:36.150 --> 02:33:36.160 align:start position:0%
indicated
 
02:33:38.150 --> 02:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
so as soon as we get that
 
02:33:41.670 --> 02:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
language we'll be able to move forward
 
02:33:43.990 --> 02:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
in the meantime what we
 
02:33:46.230 --> 02:33:46.240 align:start position:0%

1491. fn local is there any discussion
 
02:41:08.469 --> 02:41:08.479 align:start position:0%
yes mr chair
 
02:41:10.389 --> 02:41:10.399 align:start position:0%
representative thomas
 
02:41:13.349 --> 02:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
yes i'm a little bit confused
 
02:41:15.110 --> 02:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
i thought that we were
 
02:41:17.510 --> 02:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
going to just change the word child to
 
02:41:17.520 --> 02:41:18.630 align:start position:0%
going to just change the word child to
may

02:41:18.630 --> 02:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
may
 
02:41:21.349 --> 02:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
and in the original bill
 
02:41:24.950 --> 02:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
that would have read a building permit
 
02:41:27.349 --> 02:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
may not be issued but yet as i'm seeing
 
02:41:27.359 --> 02:41:28.389 align:start position:0%
may not be issued but yet as i'm seeing
here

02:41:28.389 --> 02:41:28.399 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:41:31.670 --> 02:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
the word not has been omitted so i'd
 
02:41:33.590 --> 02:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
like to have an explanation
 
02:41:36.309 --> 02:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
as to why the words not
 
02:41:38.870 --> 02:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
was omitted when we intent wishes to
 
02:41:43.190 --> 02:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:45.750 --> 02:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
well i can answer that that was a typo
 
02:41:47.670 --> 02:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
the drafting attorney made that error
 
02:41:49.510 --> 02:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
because we did not ask him to change
 
02:41:51.110 --> 02:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
make that change
 
02:41:54.070 --> 02:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
and so he must have
 
02:42:01.429 --> 02:42:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:03.349 --> 02:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
okay one at a time please representative
 
02:42:05.670 --> 02:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
not or do you have a question
 
02:42:07.429 --> 02:42:07.439 align:start position:0%
so are you saying that this new
 
02:42:09.990 --> 02:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
amendment is still not right
 
02:42:12.630 --> 02:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
apparently not mr chair
 
02:42:14.710 --> 02:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
representative platt i think it's fine
 
02:42:17.670 --> 02:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
it says a building permit may be issued
 
02:42:19.429 --> 02:42:19.439 align:start position:0%
uh so long as one of the following three
 
02:42:20.870 --> 02:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
criteria are met
 
02:42:22.870 --> 02:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise it's not issued and so it's
 
02:42:26.389 --> 02:42:26.399 align:start position:0%
it's so it it did not it has no effect
 
02:42:27.670 --> 02:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
oh you're right you're right it is
 
02:42:29.110 --> 02:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
correct you're right
 
02:42:30.710 --> 02:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
representative thomas do you see that
 
02:42:32.950 --> 02:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
now it is correct it says a building
 
02:42:35.190 --> 02:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
permit may be issued and a building may
 
02:42:37.429 --> 02:42:37.439 align:start position:0%
be erected
 
02:42:38.950 --> 02:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
provided that one of the following
 
02:42:41.110 --> 02:42:41.120 align:start position:0%
criteria is met
 
02:42:42.870 --> 02:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
i was just looking for an explanation
 
02:42:42.880 --> 02:42:43.750 align:start position:0%
i was just looking for an explanation
okay

02:42:43.750 --> 02:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:42:45.670 --> 02:42:45.680 align:start position:0%

02:42:49.429 --> 02:42:49.439 align:start position:0%
looks like we we got this okay okay any
 
02:42:51.030 --> 02:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
further discussion on this amendment
 
02:42:53.510 --> 02:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
does this satisfy everyone's objections
 
02:42:55.349 --> 02:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
to the original
 
02:42:55.359 --> 02:43:00.389 align:start position:0%
to the original
language

02:43:00.389 --> 02:43:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:01.590 --> 02:43:01.600 align:start position:0%

representative notter
 
02:50:38.870 --> 02:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's a very short little amendment
 
02:50:42.070 --> 02:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
it's about the pfas which is a very um
 
02:50:45.030 --> 02:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
important issue for my town in merrimack
 
02:50:47.830 --> 02:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
and surrounding towns and there's always
 
02:50:48.790 --> 02:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
a new
 
02:50:51.510 --> 02:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
pfas out there and that comes up so this
 
02:50:54.150 --> 02:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
just defines it
 
02:50:56.309 --> 02:50:56.319 align:start position:0%
which is good because it's uh pfas is a
 
02:50:58.230 --> 02:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
crucial topic and then many
 
02:51:01.190 --> 02:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
are in use commercially and are
 
02:51:03.110 --> 02:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
quietly being exempted from federal
 
02:51:06.550 --> 02:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
rulemaking so this amendment also gives
 
02:51:09.349 --> 02:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
the des tells them to keep studying it
 
02:51:10.389 --> 02:51:10.399 align:start position:0%
so that
 
02:51:12.469 --> 02:51:12.479 align:start position:0%
when they do identify
 
02:51:15.030 --> 02:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
more pfas they can suggest legislation
 
02:51:22.150 --> 02:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:22.160 --> 02:51:27.349 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:51:27.349 --> 02:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:28.870 --> 02:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh any further dis
 
02:51:30.309 --> 02:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
excuse me any further discussion
 
02:51:32.870 --> 02:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts
 
02:51:35.030 --> 02:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
my town is a town that in portsmouth
 
02:51:37.830 --> 02:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
we're also affected by pfas
 
02:51:37.840 --> 02:51:39.110 align:start position:0%
we're also affected by pfas
and

02:51:39.110 --> 02:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:51:39.120 --> 02:51:40.070 align:start position:0%
and
i

02:51:40.070 --> 02:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:51:42.870 --> 02:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
i'm confused by this amendment we are
 
02:51:42.880 --> 02:51:44.870 align:start position:0%
i'm confused by this amendment we are
still

02:51:44.870 --> 02:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
still
 
02:51:47.670 --> 02:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
02:51:50.790 --> 02:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
inhaled pfas
 
02:51:53.110 --> 02:51:53.120 align:start position:0%
portsmouth is attempting right now
 
02:51:55.510 --> 02:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
studies on
 
02:51:59.269 --> 02:51:59.279 align:start position:0%
inhaled pfas and that's going to cost a
 
02:52:00.790 --> 02:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of money
 
02:52:04.790 --> 02:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
and it is very difficult to determine
 
02:52:07.590 --> 02:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
also it is difficult to determine
 
02:52:11.269 --> 02:52:11.279 align:start position:0%
whether those toxins
 
02:52:14.870 --> 02:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
are the cause of a health problem
 
02:52:17.030 --> 02:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
and that's because
 
02:52:19.990 --> 02:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
there are many and pfas is all around it
 
02:52:24.230 --> 02:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:26.950 --> 02:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
my body most of what we have in the air
 
02:52:28.550 --> 02:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
has some sort of
 
02:52:31.750 --> 02:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
pfas in it whether we like it or not
 
02:52:33.349 --> 02:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
it's there
 
02:52:33.359 --> 02:52:34.389 align:start position:0%
it's there
so

02:52:34.389 --> 02:52:34.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:52:38.070 --> 02:52:38.080 align:start position:0%
i don't understand which studies the des
 
02:52:39.990 --> 02:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
is going to take
 
02:52:41.429 --> 02:52:41.439 align:start position:0%
and use are they going to look for a
 
02:52:44.469 --> 02:52:44.479 align:start position:0%
local study a study that's been done
 
02:52:47.030 --> 02:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
someplace else and
 
02:52:48.710 --> 02:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
are they going to report those studies
 
02:52:52.870 --> 02:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:54.790 --> 02:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
if the study exists the commissioner may
 
02:52:57.910 --> 02:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
modify the list of regular ad toxic
 
02:52:59.910 --> 02:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
but there's different studies say
 
02:53:01.429 --> 02:53:01.439 align:start position:0%
different things and we had that with
 
02:53:02.790 --> 02:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
the 5g
 
02:53:05.510 --> 02:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
different studies say different things
 
02:53:10.710 --> 02:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:15.750 --> 02:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:18.870 --> 02:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:20.150 --> 02:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:53:22.710 --> 02:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
and if i may follow up the studies that
 
02:53:24.550 --> 02:53:24.560 align:start position:0%
the portsmouth is
 
02:53:26.870 --> 02:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
attempting to do
 
02:53:28.550 --> 02:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
are going to cost quite a bit of money
 
02:53:29.429 --> 02:53:29.439 align:start position:0%
is the
 
02:53:35.990 --> 02:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:38.870 --> 02:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
is that it that's it okay any further
 
02:53:40.469 --> 02:53:40.479 align:start position:0%
comment i think uh
 
02:53:42.469 --> 02:53:42.479 align:start position:0%
the text of the bill representative
 
02:53:44.550 --> 02:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
harrington go ahead just a question so
 
02:53:46.230 --> 02:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
just makes this clear we're replacing
 
02:53:48.710 --> 02:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
everything there's no 45 pound
 
02:53:50.710 --> 02:53:50.720 align:start position:0%
annual limit it's just now going to be
 
02:53:53.269 --> 02:53:53.279 align:start position:0%
based on these studies that are spelled
 
02:53:55.110 --> 02:53:55.120 align:start position:0%
out in the new amendment is that correct
 
02:53:57.670 --> 02:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
that is correct yes thank you
 
02:54:00.230 --> 02:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh representative oxenom
 
02:54:02.309 --> 02:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
i i understood everything until the the
 
02:54:04.870 --> 02:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
last speaker said the studies it what it
 
02:54:10.230 --> 02:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
says here is if a study exists
 
02:54:14.309 --> 02:54:14.319 align:start position:0%
if if a study exists i
 
02:54:15.670 --> 02:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
i don't think i've ever seen a language
 
02:54:21.190 --> 02:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:22.550 --> 02:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
we usually
 
02:54:25.750 --> 02:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
require a study or we specify a study
 
02:54:28.309 --> 02:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
but well the language above that on line
 
02:54:29.990 --> 02:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
nine says that the commissioner shall
 
02:54:32.870 --> 02:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
conduct a review to determine
 
02:54:35.269 --> 02:54:35.279 align:start position:0%
whether their ex exists at least one
 
02:54:37.590 --> 02:54:37.600 align:start position:0%
study that has been accord conducted in
 
02:54:39.349 --> 02:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
accordance with generally accepted
 
02:54:42.309 --> 02:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
scientific principles etc etc etc
 
02:54:42.319 --> 02:54:43.190 align:start position:0%
scientific principles etc etc etc
so

02:54:43.190 --> 02:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:54:45.269 --> 02:54:45.279 align:start position:0%
basically what what this bill says is to
 
02:54:47.910 --> 02:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
the yes go out and find us some studies
 
02:54:49.590 --> 02:54:49.600 align:start position:0%
on pfas
 
02:54:49.600 --> 02:54:50.790 align:start position:0%
on pfas
and

02:54:50.790 --> 02:54:50.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:54:52.790 --> 02:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
when you find those studies
 
02:54:58.550 --> 02:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:00.550 --> 02:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
18 17
 
02:55:04.630 --> 02:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
it says that once you find the study
 
02:55:04.640 --> 02:55:05.510 align:start position:0%
it says that once you find the study
that

02:55:05.510 --> 02:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:55:07.429 --> 02:55:07.439 align:start position:0%
determines if there's any
 
02:55:09.030 --> 02:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
developmental health
 
02:55:11.429 --> 02:55:11.439 align:start position:0%
effects in humans as a result of
 
02:55:14.790 --> 02:55:14.800 align:start position:0%
inhalation exposure to such pfas
 
02:55:14.800 --> 02:55:17.030 align:start position:0%
inhalation exposure to such pfas
substances

02:55:17.030 --> 02:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
substances
 
02:55:18.790 --> 02:55:18.800 align:start position:0%
then the commissioner may modify the
 
02:55:21.030 --> 02:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
list of regulated toxic air pollutants
 
02:55:25.269 --> 02:55:25.279 align:start position:0%
by adding such pfas analyte to the list
 
02:55:27.750 --> 02:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
so that's what the bill does
 
02:55:29.190 --> 02:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
02:55:31.269 --> 02:55:31.279 align:start position:0%
representative occidum i guess my
 
02:55:33.670 --> 02:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up is again we're we're not
 
02:55:35.349 --> 02:55:35.359 align:start position:0%
specifically calling for a study so
 
02:55:38.389 --> 02:55:38.399 align:start position:0%
we're not granting funding to an agency
 
02:55:41.030 --> 02:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
to do a funding but we're saying hey you
 
02:55:43.110 --> 02:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
know if you find something i'm sorry
 
02:55:45.750 --> 02:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
it's just it's
 
02:55:47.110 --> 02:55:47.120 align:start position:0%
well i think i don't see there's any
 
02:55:48.469 --> 02:55:48.479 align:start position:0%
there there
 
02:55:51.110 --> 02:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
i think you're nitpicking here i think
 
02:55:52.790 --> 02:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
this gives clear
 
02:55:55.750 --> 02:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh guidance to the des that they need to
 
02:55:55.760 --> 02:55:56.790 align:start position:0%
uh guidance to the des that they need to
be

02:55:56.790 --> 02:55:56.800 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:55:59.269 --> 02:55:59.279 align:start position:0%
finding scientific studies and then
 
02:56:01.670 --> 02:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
acting upon those studies
 
02:56:04.790 --> 02:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts
 
02:56:07.190 --> 02:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
we have a group a commission that's now
 
02:56:11.349 --> 02:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
studying pfas and cancer clusters
 
02:56:14.070 --> 02:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
so how does this
 
02:56:17.030 --> 02:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
interface with what they're doing
 
02:56:20.309 --> 02:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
there's no positive proof yet
 
02:56:22.870 --> 02:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
that i'm aware of and i another a
 
02:56:24.309 --> 02:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
senator and i'm going to mention his
 
02:56:27.269 --> 02:56:27.279 align:start position:0%
name dr sherman is
 
02:56:28.870 --> 02:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
heading that committee and it's been
 
02:56:30.389 --> 02:56:30.399 align:start position:0%
ongoing since the problem with the
 
02:56:32.790 --> 02:56:32.800 align:start position:0%
coakley landfill
 
02:56:36.950 --> 02:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
and the contamination of water
 
02:56:36.960 --> 02:56:37.990 align:start position:0%
and the contamination of water
i

02:56:37.990 --> 02:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:56:39.110 --> 02:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
and i'm
 
02:56:41.670 --> 02:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
mac has the same thing with sanco bay
 
02:56:43.190 --> 02:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
but i'm wondering
 
02:56:46.070 --> 02:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
how does this
 
02:56:48.630 --> 02:56:48.640 align:start position:0%
interact with that commission because
 
02:56:50.469 --> 02:56:50.479 align:start position:0%
i believe that
 
02:56:52.309 --> 02:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
health and human services and des is
 
02:56:53.990 --> 02:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
also involved in that commission and
 
02:56:56.230 --> 02:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
certainly if they came up with a study
 
02:56:56.240 --> 02:56:58.550 align:start position:0%
certainly if they came up with a study
that's

02:56:58.550 --> 02:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:57:00.870 --> 02:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
concrete which unfortunately or
 
02:57:04.070 --> 02:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
fortunately nobody has yet
 
02:57:07.030 --> 02:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
they would be aware of it already
 
02:57:09.510 --> 02:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
so is this like a piece of feel good
 
02:57:09.520 --> 02:57:11.910 align:start position:0%
so is this like a piece of feel good
legislation

02:57:11.910 --> 02:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:57:15.110 --> 02:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
i guess it potentially could be
 
02:57:17.429 --> 02:57:17.439 align:start position:0%
you are correct that this
 
02:57:19.670 --> 02:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
legislation does not mention any study
 
02:57:21.670 --> 02:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
that's ongoing in portsmouth or any
 
02:57:23.429 --> 02:57:23.439 align:start position:0%
other community
 
02:57:25.670 --> 02:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
it specifically
 
02:57:28.309 --> 02:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
requests that the des commissioner
 
02:57:30.230 --> 02:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
conduct a review to determine whether
 
02:57:33.830 --> 02:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
there exists any other studies
 
02:57:37.190 --> 02:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
at least one of which would be
 
02:57:39.110 --> 02:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
acceptable for him to
 
02:57:42.150 --> 02:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:44.710 --> 02:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
change the approved list of of
 
02:57:47.349 --> 02:57:47.359 align:start position:0%
pfas chemicals i'm just going to follow
 
02:57:49.590 --> 02:57:49.600 align:start position:0%
up with that what those studies are
 
02:57:53.429 --> 02:57:53.439 align:start position:0%
is formed by the state of new hampshire
 
02:57:55.429 --> 02:57:55.439 align:start position:0%
not by the city of portsmouth the city
 
02:57:57.030 --> 02:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
of portsmouth is doing some independent
 
02:58:00.150 --> 02:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
stuff on specifically inhalation
 
02:58:00.160 --> 02:58:02.070 align:start position:0%
stuff on specifically inhalation
but

02:58:02.070 --> 02:58:02.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:58:05.190 --> 02:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
that's p5 study commission is formed by
 
02:58:06.389 --> 02:58:06.399 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:58:08.630 --> 02:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
so do i understand you to say then that
 
02:58:10.950 --> 02:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
this bill is not necessary because there
 
02:58:13.830 --> 02:58:13.840 align:start position:0%
are already state-sponsored studies that
 
02:58:16.630 --> 02:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
are undergo that are being undertaken
 
02:58:19.190 --> 02:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
yes sir and very serious studies this is
 
02:58:22.550 --> 02:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
not an issue to be glanced over
 
02:58:24.710 --> 02:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
but they are very serious studies that
 
02:58:27.269 --> 02:58:27.279 align:start position:0%
are going on and going on now
 
02:58:28.950 --> 02:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
so i guess my question would be then
 
02:58:31.030 --> 02:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
what harm would passing this legislation
 
02:58:31.040 --> 02:58:34.070 align:start position:0%
what harm would passing this legislation
do

02:58:34.070 --> 02:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:37.830 --> 02:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:40.710 --> 02:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
ah thank you mr chairman
 
02:58:44.870 --> 02:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
basically what this is doing is kind of
 
02:58:48.150 --> 02:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
maybe eliminate a game of whack-a-mole
 
02:58:50.469 --> 02:58:50.479 align:start position:0%
uh with pfas and that
 
02:58:53.830 --> 02:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
um it's allowing the commissioner
 
02:58:56.070 --> 02:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
to go ahead and
 
02:58:58.389 --> 02:58:58.399 align:start position:0%
establish or modify
 
02:59:00.950 --> 02:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
the the classification of these ambient
 
02:59:04.389 --> 02:59:04.399 align:start position:0%
air for such pfas analyte by adopting
 
02:59:06.150 --> 02:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
rules in accordance with the provisions
 
02:59:07.550 --> 02:59:07.560 align:start position:0%
of rsa
 
02:59:09.990 --> 02:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
541a he's not they're not going to have
 
02:59:10.000 --> 02:59:13.429 align:start position:0%
541a he's not they're not going to have
to

02:59:13.429 --> 02:59:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:13.439 --> 02:59:16.550 align:start position:0%
 
well

02:59:16.550 --> 02:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:19.670 --> 02:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
i i think it's uh
 
02:59:19.680 --> 02:59:20.469 align:start position:0%
i i think it's uh
it

02:59:20.469 --> 02:59:20.479 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:59:22.790 --> 02:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
it's allowing
 
02:59:24.630 --> 02:59:24.640 align:start position:0%
things to be done without having to go
 
02:59:28.389 --> 02:59:28.399 align:start position:0%
back to the legislature with
 
02:59:30.550 --> 02:59:30.560 align:start position:0%
something more specific
 
02:59:32.070 --> 02:59:32.080 align:start position:0%
other than a study
 
02:59:32.080 --> 02:59:34.469 align:start position:0%
other than a study
so

02:59:34.469 --> 02:59:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:36.790 --> 02:59:36.800 align:start position:0%
representative mann
 
02:59:39.910 --> 02:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i my assumption is
 
02:59:41.590 --> 02:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
that this
 
02:59:44.710 --> 02:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
says that if as a study gets finished it
 
02:59:46.469 --> 02:59:46.479 align:start position:0%
automatically will get
 
02:59:47.990 --> 02:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
the given
 
02:59:51.190 --> 02:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
uh analyte would be added to the list of
 
02:59:51.200 --> 02:59:52.469 align:start position:0%
uh analyte would be added to the list of
pollutants

02:59:52.469 --> 02:59:52.479 align:start position:0%
pollutants
 
02:59:56.469 --> 02:59:56.479 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of an automatic system
 
02:59:57.830 --> 02:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
you don't have to
 
02:59:59.750 --> 02:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
do a study and then decide whether it's
 
03:00:02.469 --> 03:00:02.479 align:start position:0%
going to be added any study
 
03:00:06.870 --> 03:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:06.880 --> 03:00:09.190 align:start position:0%
 
toxic

03:00:09.190 --> 03:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
toxic
 
03:00:12.550 --> 03:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
the evidence of the toxicity uh would
 
03:00:14.550 --> 03:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
automatically be added to the list that
 
03:00:17.429 --> 03:00:17.439 align:start position:0%
are uh are
 
03:00:19.830 --> 03:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
subject to the rules
 
03:00:21.349 --> 03:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
thank you in other words just an
 
03:00:21.359 --> 03:00:22.469 align:start position:0%
thank you in other words just an
automatic

03:00:22.469 --> 03:00:22.479 align:start position:0%
automatic
 
03:00:24.389 --> 03:00:24.399 align:start position:0%
as the studies get
 
03:00:26.150 --> 03:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
done they get added to the list of
 
03:00:26.160 --> 03:00:29.510 align:start position:0%
done they get added to the list of
forbidden

03:00:29.510 --> 03:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:29.520 --> 03:00:31.590 align:start position:0%
 
chemicals

03:00:31.590 --> 03:00:31.600 align:start position:0%
chemicals
 
03:00:33.510 --> 03:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you let's keep the side
 
03:00:35.510 --> 03:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
conversations to a minimum please the
 
03:00:36.950 --> 03:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
noise level is getting a little high in
 
03:00:38.790 --> 03:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
here representative
 
03:00:40.630 --> 03:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
sorry about that representative lewicki
 
03:00:42.710 --> 03:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
is recognized okay thank you mr chairman
 
03:00:45.030 --> 03:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
um as someone who has done far too much
 
03:00:47.190 --> 03:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
reading on pubmed and various other
 
03:00:49.429 --> 03:00:49.439 align:start position:0%
places there are a lot of researchers
 
03:00:51.190 --> 03:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
graduate students people doing research
 
03:00:52.710 --> 03:00:52.720 align:start position:0%
on a lot of different things in a lot of
 
03:00:55.030 --> 03:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
different places doing animal studies
 
03:00:59.349 --> 03:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
doing in vitro studies and if we can
 
03:01:02.550 --> 03:01:02.560 align:start position:0%
use their efforts to get to inform the
 
03:01:05.590 --> 03:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
department then we will save money
 
03:01:05.600 --> 03:01:06.469 align:start position:0%
department then we will save money
because

03:01:06.469 --> 03:01:06.479 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:01:08.230 --> 03:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
we can only do a limited number of
 
03:01:11.190 --> 03:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
studies in new hampshire and we don't
 
03:01:13.030 --> 03:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily even know what we should be
 
03:01:14.630 --> 03:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
looking for whereas if somebody can go
 
03:01:17.190 --> 03:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
through the literature it's possible to
 
03:01:20.389 --> 03:01:20.399 align:start position:0%
multiply our efforts at less cost
 
03:01:22.469 --> 03:01:22.479 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mcgee
 
03:01:24.710 --> 03:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman yeah um i just
 
03:01:26.950 --> 03:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention i think the des air
 
03:01:28.870 --> 03:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
quality person is here in the hearing
 
03:01:30.870 --> 03:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
and she actually probably could answer
 
03:01:32.389 --> 03:01:32.399 align:start position:0%
all the stuff that we're speculating
 
03:01:34.630 --> 03:01:34.640 align:start position:0%
about in terms of what they
 
03:01:36.630 --> 03:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
already know already do or what they
 
03:01:39.349 --> 03:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
have in terms of an understanding of
 
03:01:41.190 --> 03:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
like where we're at with
 
03:01:44.150 --> 03:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
um this particular issue so if there are
 
03:01:45.429 --> 03:01:45.439 align:start position:0%
questions it seems like people are
 
03:01:47.429 --> 03:01:47.439 align:start position:0%
speculating about how we could approach
 
03:01:50.070 --> 03:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
it but we our air quality person is here
 
03:01:52.389 --> 03:01:52.399 align:start position:0%
in the room so
 
03:01:52.399 --> 03:01:53.349 align:start position:0%
in the room so
um

03:01:53.349 --> 03:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:55.349 --> 03:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
what they know how they'd get it whether
 
03:01:56.630 --> 03:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
it would cost money i mean she could
 
03:01:59.990 --> 03:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
probably answer any of those questions
 
03:02:06.790 --> 03:02:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:08.469 --> 03:02:08.479 align:start position:0%
does anyone have a yeah you can have a
 
03:02:10.230 --> 03:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
cookie while you're there does anyone
 
03:02:12.950 --> 03:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
have a question for
 
03:02:15.110 --> 03:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
and i'm sorry i forgot your name
 
03:02:16.389 --> 03:02:16.399 align:start position:0%
miss beam
 
03:02:18.630 --> 03:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
um anybody have a question
 
03:02:20.309 --> 03:02:20.319 align:start position:0%
representative thomas
 
03:02:22.469 --> 03:02:22.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i guess the obvious
 
03:02:24.469 --> 03:02:24.479 align:start position:0%
question i would have is
 
03:02:27.429 --> 03:02:27.439 align:start position:0%
is any of what is in this amendment now
 
03:02:28.389 --> 03:02:28.399 align:start position:0%
is it
 
03:02:31.830 --> 03:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
already being done by by des as a matter
 
03:02:33.750 --> 03:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
of course
 
03:02:35.429 --> 03:02:35.439 align:start position:0%
so the language that we're discussing
 
03:02:38.710 --> 03:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
today is um an addition to our already
 
03:02:41.429 --> 03:02:41.439 align:start position:0%
existing statute for air toxics control
 
03:02:43.190 --> 03:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
and so we already have the ability to do
 
03:02:44.550 --> 03:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
rule making
 
03:02:44.560 --> 03:02:45.349 align:start position:0%
rule making
for

03:02:45.349 --> 03:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:02:47.349 --> 03:02:47.359 align:start position:0%
toxic emissions this just spells out
 
03:02:49.830 --> 03:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
that pfas is another toxic that we would
 
03:02:52.070 --> 03:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
want to evaluate studies that exist
 
03:02:54.309 --> 03:02:54.319 align:start position:0%
nationwide this is not something that we
 
03:02:56.389 --> 03:02:56.399 align:start position:0%
are conducting studies of it's simply
 
03:02:58.150 --> 03:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
evaluating as one of the representatives
 
03:02:59.750 --> 03:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned any other studies that are out
 
03:02:59.760 --> 03:03:00.469 align:start position:0%
mentioned any other studies that are out
there

03:03:00.469 --> 03:03:00.479 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:03:02.790 --> 03:03:02.800 align:start position:0%
and inhalation studies are
 
03:03:04.870 --> 03:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
not as prevalent as
 
03:03:06.870 --> 03:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
ingestion studies of drinking water
 
03:03:09.110 --> 03:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
that's a you know a much more studied
 
03:03:10.870 --> 03:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
area this is just opening the door to
 
03:03:13.590 --> 03:03:13.600 align:start position:0%
letting us evaluate what's out there and
 
03:03:15.750 --> 03:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
potentially in the future adding a pfas
 
03:03:17.429 --> 03:03:17.439 align:start position:0%
to the list of toxics
 
03:03:18.630 --> 03:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:03:21.590 --> 03:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
03:03:23.510 --> 03:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you chair vause i'm looking at the
 
03:03:25.590 --> 03:03:25.600 align:start position:0%
amendment and looks very similar to the
 
03:03:29.429 --> 03:03:29.439 align:start position:0%
uh clause 5 of section 125 1 4 which you
 
03:03:30.870 --> 03:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
probably know but i have to look it up
 
03:03:30.880 --> 03:03:31.670 align:start position:0%
probably know but i have to look it up
sorry

03:03:31.670 --> 03:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
03:03:33.510 --> 03:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
um but it seems like the only difference
 
03:03:34.790 --> 03:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
really seems that
 
03:03:36.950 --> 03:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
this is uh providing you with a mandate
 
03:03:39.349 --> 03:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
by january 1st 2023 and annually
 
03:03:42.550 --> 03:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
thereafter you will conduct a review
 
03:03:43.830 --> 03:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
and that doesn't necessarily exist in
 
03:03:45.349 --> 03:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
the legislation this is written now is
 
03:03:46.389 --> 03:03:46.399 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
03:03:48.389 --> 03:03:48.399 align:start position:0%
that's correct the legislation right now
 
03:03:50.950 --> 03:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
requires us to evaluate certain
 
03:03:53.349 --> 03:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
toxics that are on certain lists the
 
03:03:56.630 --> 03:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
acgih american society of chemical and
 
03:03:58.230 --> 03:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
industrial hygienists has a list of
 
03:04:00.309 --> 03:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
compounds and we do that this just
 
03:04:03.349 --> 03:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
explicitly points out pfas because
 
03:04:04.630 --> 03:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
the section right above that you're
 
03:04:06.870 --> 03:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
pointing out is is an open-ended if
 
03:04:08.550 --> 03:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
somebody brings a compound to us to
 
03:04:10.469 --> 03:04:10.479 align:start position:0%
evaluate this just explicitly makes it
 
03:04:11.670 --> 03:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for that answer that's
 
03:04:14.630 --> 03:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
good enough for me thank you
 
03:04:16.710 --> 03:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
representative knotter has a question
 
03:04:18.710 --> 03:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um did you get a
 
03:04:21.269 --> 03:04:21.279 align:start position:0%
chance to see the amendment
 
03:04:23.349 --> 03:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
yes i worked with a representative boyd
 
03:04:26.790 --> 03:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
on it okay and follow up
 
03:04:29.190 --> 03:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
so if you do find it acceptable then the
 
03:04:31.510 --> 03:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
department is is okay with it yes thank
 
03:04:31.520 --> 03:04:33.990 align:start position:0%
department is is okay with it yes thank
you

03:04:33.990 --> 03:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:35.990 --> 03:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
additional questions representative
 
03:04:37.750 --> 03:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
callie pitts
 
03:04:40.710 --> 03:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
are you participating in the uh
 
03:04:43.110 --> 03:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
commission that is formed by has been
 
03:04:46.230 --> 03:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
formed by the state to evaluate
 
03:04:48.550 --> 03:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
pfas and look to see if any of these
 
03:04:50.389 --> 03:04:50.399 align:start position:0%
things because it says
 
03:04:52.870 --> 03:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
in this amendment it says to determine
 
03:04:54.710 --> 03:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
whether there exists at least one study
 
03:04:56.469 --> 03:04:56.479 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah
 
03:04:59.429 --> 03:04:59.439 align:start position:0%
that any individual pfas is known to
 
03:05:02.070 --> 03:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
cause you know a problem or may
 
03:05:05.349 --> 03:05:05.359 align:start position:0%
reasonably be anticipated to applaud
 
03:05:07.030 --> 03:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
that has not none of that has been
 
03:05:07.040 --> 03:05:08.550 align:start position:0%
that has not none of that has been
substantiated

03:05:08.550 --> 03:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
substantiated
 
03:05:11.110 --> 03:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
but are you are you involved in the
 
03:05:14.469 --> 03:05:14.479 align:start position:0%
studies that are going on with pfas
 
03:05:19.349 --> 03:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:21.110 --> 03:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
well i have
 
03:05:22.309 --> 03:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
we have a representative on the
 
03:05:24.550 --> 03:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
commission related to pfas and health
 
03:05:27.110 --> 03:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
and environmental impacts um so whenever
 
03:05:28.710 --> 03:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
there's an error-related question i'm
 
03:05:31.030 --> 03:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
consulted if that's what you're asking
 
03:05:33.429 --> 03:05:33.439 align:start position:0%
i i'm not actually participating in
 
03:05:34.950 --> 03:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
inhalation studies at this point as one
 
03:05:36.150 --> 03:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
of the representative mentioned it's a
 
03:05:38.230 --> 03:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
scientific endeavor with you know
 
03:05:41.190 --> 03:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
rodents and and inhalation
 
03:05:43.510 --> 03:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
situation scientific studies they're not
 
03:05:44.870 --> 03:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily just
 
03:05:46.870 --> 03:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
evaluating i'm not familiar with what
 
03:05:49.269 --> 03:05:49.279 align:start position:0%
studies you're referring to
 
03:05:50.309 --> 03:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:05:52.630 --> 03:05:52.640 align:start position:0%
follow up there is a commission headed
 
03:05:54.150 --> 03:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
and i believe it's headed by senator
 
03:05:54.160 --> 03:05:55.190 align:start position:0%
and i believe it's headed by senator
sherman

03:05:55.190 --> 03:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
sherman
 
03:05:57.510 --> 03:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
and portsmouth right now on its own is
 
03:06:00.150 --> 03:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
doing an air quality study an air
 
03:06:04.070 --> 03:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
inhalation study as part of a pfas study
 
03:06:05.670 --> 03:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
but this
 
03:06:10.469 --> 03:06:10.479 align:start position:0%
implies that pfas is known to cause
 
03:06:10.479 --> 03:06:11.429 align:start position:0%
implies that pfas is known to cause
and

03:06:11.429 --> 03:06:11.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:06:14.870 --> 03:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
i don't believe and
 
03:06:16.630 --> 03:06:16.640 align:start position:0%
i know it's a serious thing and all
 
03:06:18.710 --> 03:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
chemicals are serious
 
03:06:21.590 --> 03:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
but i don't know if there is any
 
03:06:24.630 --> 03:06:24.640 align:start position:0%
concrete evidence out there
 
03:06:26.309 --> 03:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
that pfas
 
03:06:26.319 --> 03:06:27.750 align:start position:0%
that pfas
causes

03:06:27.750 --> 03:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
causes
 
03:06:30.870 --> 03:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
it pollutes water that's most certain
 
03:06:33.030 --> 03:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
there is a cancer cluster and my son
 
03:06:36.469 --> 03:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
lives right near that cancer cluster
 
03:06:38.710 --> 03:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
but and my grandson
 
03:06:40.950 --> 03:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
but i don't know that there's actually a
 
03:06:43.110 --> 03:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
cause and effect that's been established
 
03:06:43.120 --> 03:06:44.150 align:start position:0%
cause and effect that's been established
which

03:06:44.150 --> 03:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
which
 
03:06:46.710 --> 03:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
this seems to do then there's an or in
 
03:06:46.720 --> 03:06:47.750 align:start position:0%
this seems to do then there's an or in
there

03:06:47.750 --> 03:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:06:49.750 --> 03:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
but that first sentence says it does
 
03:06:49.760 --> 03:06:52.389 align:start position:0%
but that first sentence says it does
cause

03:06:52.389 --> 03:06:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:54.309 --> 03:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
so again this language mimics the rest
 
03:06:56.550 --> 03:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
of the statute now that says that we
 
03:06:58.150 --> 03:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
look at toxic compounds in the
 
03:07:00.150 --> 03:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
scientific studies and if they are found
 
03:07:01.670 --> 03:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
a cause
 
03:07:04.950 --> 03:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
right and so right now one of the pfas
 
03:07:07.750 --> 03:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
compounds the ammonia salt of pfoa
 
03:07:09.750 --> 03:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
is already on the air toxics list it was
 
03:07:11.830 --> 03:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
what required zenkovein to reformulate
 
03:07:14.870 --> 03:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
their compounds in 2006 so it's already
 
03:07:18.790 --> 03:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
based on a study from from osha really
 
03:07:21.190 --> 03:07:21.200 align:start position:0%
so on inhalation levels that are too
 
03:07:23.670 --> 03:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
high for people to breathe so
 
03:07:25.910 --> 03:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
there are work in the area of
 
03:07:25.920 --> 03:07:27.110 align:start position:0%
there are work in the area of
ventilation

03:07:27.110 --> 03:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
ventilation
 
03:07:27.120 --> 03:07:28.309 align:start position:0%
ventilation
dust

03:07:28.309 --> 03:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
dust
 
03:07:30.070 --> 03:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
but mostly it's it's through ingestion
 
03:07:31.510 --> 03:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
of water that the studies have been
 
03:07:35.110 --> 03:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:39.190 --> 03:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
further questions for des
 
03:07:40.790 --> 03:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
seeing none i thank you very much for
 
03:07:42.309 --> 03:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
being available to answer those
 
03:07:42.319 --> 03:07:44.389 align:start position:0%
being available to answer those
questions

03:07:44.389 --> 03:07:44.399 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:07:44.399 --> 03:07:46.150 align:start position:0%
questions
so

03:07:46.150 --> 03:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:07:47.910 --> 03:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on the
 
03:07:51.590 --> 03:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
adoption of this amendment
 
03:07:53.910 --> 03:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
representative pimentel
 
03:07:56.150 --> 03:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i just wanted to
 
03:07:56.160 --> 03:07:57.510 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i just wanted to
um

03:07:57.510 --> 03:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:59.190 --> 03:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
clarify something
 
03:08:01.750 --> 03:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't say that
 
03:08:05.349 --> 03:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
pfass is known to cause these things
 
03:08:07.510 --> 03:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
it's just saying the commissioner
 
03:08:07.520 --> 03:08:08.950 align:start position:0%
it's just saying the commissioner
um

03:08:08.950 --> 03:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:11.349 --> 03:08:11.359 align:start position:0%
has to review uh
 
03:08:13.830 --> 03:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
whether there exists
 
03:08:16.309 --> 03:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
a study
 
03:08:20.550 --> 03:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
that demonstrates that any individual
 
03:08:23.030 --> 03:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
pfas is known to cause they're just
 
03:08:25.110 --> 03:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
saying that the commissioner has to look
 
03:08:27.830 --> 03:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
to see if that exists not that it does
 
03:08:27.840 --> 03:08:31.750 align:start position:0%
to see if that exists not that it does
exist

03:08:31.750 --> 03:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:36.230 --> 03:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:38.550 --> 03:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none i asked the clerk to call
 
03:08:40.469 --> 03:08:40.479 align:start position:0%

recognize the bill that we're looking at
 
03:15:13.110 --> 03:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
because my understanding is that
 
03:15:15.590 --> 03:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
this is this would the only transfer
 
03:15:17.110 --> 03:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
that would happen here would be for
 
03:15:19.110 --> 03:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
people who are already
 
03:15:21.190 --> 03:15:21.200 align:start position:0%

uh
 
03:15:27.269 --> 03:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:29.269 --> 03:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
no that's that's a bill we uh
 
03:15:31.590 --> 03:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
adjudicated yes oh this is never mind
 
03:15:33.429 --> 03:15:33.439 align:start position:0%
then i'm gonna this is an expansion of
 
03:15:35.429 --> 03:15:35.439 align:start position:0%
net metering to five megawatts
 
03:15:37.670 --> 03:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
i can't a further discussion on this
 
03:15:37.680 --> 03:15:38.870 align:start position:0%
i can't a further discussion on this
bill

03:15:38.870 --> 03:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:15:41.110 --> 03:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
i'll remind the members that
 
03:15:43.510 --> 03:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
a version of this bill has been vetoed
 
03:15:45.030 --> 03:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
by the governor
 
03:15:47.110 --> 03:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
three times over the course of the last
 
03:15:50.309 --> 03:15:50.319 align:start position:0%
two years representative mick williams

desire for increased net metering in new

desire for increased net metering in new
hampshire

03:15:57.510 --> 03:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:15:59.590 --> 03:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
this has been identified
 
03:16:01.269 --> 03:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
at least amongst my constituents in
 
03:16:03.750 --> 03:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
concord as a priority we are currently
 
03:16:06.550 --> 03:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
moving to all renewable energy by uh
 
03:16:09.590 --> 03:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
2030 which as the time passes that's
 
03:16:12.389 --> 03:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
eight years from now it's coming quickly
 
03:16:14.309 --> 03:16:14.319 align:start position:0%
and so for my constituents this is a
 
03:16:16.870 --> 03:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
really big deal to allow individuals
 
03:16:19.110 --> 03:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
small businesses developers you name it
 
03:16:20.950 --> 03:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
to be able to increase from one to five
 
03:16:23.030 --> 03:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
megawatts in order to net meter their
 
03:16:25.750 --> 03:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
production so this is a big deal as i
 
03:16:27.510 --> 03:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
said and it's important to keep bringing
 
03:16:29.990 --> 03:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
it up and talking about it thank you
 
03:16:33.110 --> 03:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
representative pimentel
 
03:16:35.750 --> 03:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:16:38.630 --> 03:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
it was brought up that
 
03:16:40.469 --> 03:16:40.479 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:16:40.479 --> 03:16:42.550 align:start position:0%
this bill
was

03:16:42.550 --> 03:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:16:44.630 --> 03:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
looked upon
 
03:16:47.349 --> 03:16:47.359 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
03:16:49.190 --> 03:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
there is the viter study that is
 
03:16:51.670 --> 03:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
supposed to be out this spring and that
 
03:16:53.750 --> 03:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
we should wait until
 
03:16:55.190 --> 03:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
03:16:56.870 --> 03:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh study
 
03:17:00.550 --> 03:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
is done uh because we're basically
 
03:17:02.469 --> 03:17:02.479 align:start position:0%
uh we'd be able to look at this a little
 
03:17:04.870 --> 03:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
more holistically
 
03:17:07.670 --> 03:17:07.680 align:start position:0%

yes i'm just a guest here but i'm uh
 
03:17:33.910 --> 03:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
my district includes one of the
 
03:17:36.150 --> 03:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities that probably would be
 
03:17:38.630 --> 03:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
affected by this because we have a large
 
03:17:41.670 --> 03:17:41.680 align:start position:0%
solar array and we certainly um
 
03:17:43.830 --> 03:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
that was uh the people of the town of
 
03:17:46.469 --> 03:17:46.479 align:start position:0%
durham we were hoping to uh
 
03:17:48.309 --> 03:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
hoping not just to save the costs of
 
03:17:50.790 --> 03:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
burning fossil fuels to support the town
 
03:17:52.790 --> 03:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
but we were hoping to
 
03:17:55.670 --> 03:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
sell the energy to um to other entities
 
03:17:57.349 --> 03:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
and i don't really see what's socially
 
03:17:59.110 --> 03:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
regressive about that but maybe that's
 
03:18:01.269 --> 03:18:01.279 align:start position:0%
because i'm a capitalist and i'll also
 
03:18:01.279 --> 03:18:02.070 align:start position:0%
because i'm a capitalist and i'll also
add

03:18:02.070 --> 03:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
add
 
03:18:04.389 --> 03:18:04.399 align:start position:0%
recent world events have shown
 
03:18:04.399 --> 03:18:05.510 align:start position:0%
recent world events have shown
um

03:18:05.510 --> 03:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:07.910 --> 03:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
shown that uh it's dangerous to rely too
 
03:18:09.590 --> 03:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
much on fossil fuels since one of our
 
03:18:11.910 --> 03:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
major fossil fuel
 
03:18:14.309 --> 03:18:14.319 align:start position:0%
providers is now like being
 
03:18:15.750 --> 03:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
cut off from the rest of the world
 
03:18:18.229 --> 03:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
global economy for uh you know because
 
03:18:20.389 --> 03:18:20.399 align:start position:0%
they invaded another another sovereign
 
03:18:22.950 --> 03:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
nation so i think i think anything
 
03:18:26.389 --> 03:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
encourages social uh i think i think
 
03:18:28.229 --> 03:18:28.239 align:start position:0%
anything that encourages renewable
 
03:18:30.630 --> 03:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
energy such as solar is uh
 
03:18:32.950 --> 03:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
not not regressive and i would support
 
03:18:34.309 --> 03:18:34.319 align:start position:0%
it and and
 
03:18:35.830 --> 03:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
after the i'm just guessing this
 
03:18:37.269 --> 03:18:37.279 align:start position:0%
committee so i'm not as fair as they
 
03:18:38.150 --> 03:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
should be with all these different
 
03:18:40.389 --> 03:18:40.399 align:start position:0%
studies but i think certainly
 
03:18:41.910 --> 03:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
until next year we should leave the law
 
03:18:43.910 --> 03:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
the way it is and uh but we should
 
03:18:45.590 --> 03:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
expand the law the way it is and uh we
 
03:18:47.750 --> 03:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
should pass this bill so thanks
 
03:18:50.469 --> 03:18:50.479 align:start position:0%
thank you any further discussion of the
 
03:18:54.070 --> 03:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
motion to itl house bill 1596
 
03:18:56.389 --> 03:18:56.399 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
03:18:57.910 --> 03:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
thank you chair rose
 
03:18:59.590 --> 03:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
i support this bill very strongly
 
03:19:01.190 --> 03:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
because i
 
03:19:02.790 --> 03:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
unfortunately am shut out from being
 
03:19:05.030 --> 03:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
able to afford a um
 
03:19:07.349 --> 03:19:07.359 align:start position:0%
small solar system right now uh the
 
03:19:09.830 --> 03:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
payback period is too long on it
 
03:19:11.429 --> 03:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
and if we could increase that metering
 
03:19:12.469 --> 03:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
it would make
 
03:19:13.670 --> 03:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
03:19:15.510 --> 03:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
acquiring solar technology much more
 
03:19:17.990 --> 03:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
affordable for the average consumer and
 
03:19:19.590 --> 03:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
that would mean more green jobs for the
 
03:19:21.590 --> 03:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire and it would also
 
03:19:24.070 --> 03:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
mean more grid stability i really don't
 
03:19:25.830 --> 03:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
see a downside on this i understand the
 
03:19:27.830 --> 03:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
governor has vetoed it three times
 
03:19:29.830 --> 03:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
however i see this is a good bill and
 
03:19:29.840 --> 03:19:30.550 align:start position:0%
however i see this is a good bill and
i'm

03:19:30.550 --> 03:19:30.560 align:start position:0%

03:22:17.269 --> 03:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
discussion on this question yes
 
03:22:19.269 --> 03:22:19.279 align:start position:0%
yes mr chair i
 
03:22:21.349 --> 03:22:21.359 align:start position:0%
support this bill because
 
03:22:24.229 --> 03:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
right now uh people are being double
 
03:22:27.510 --> 03:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
paid for uh if they sell
 
03:22:29.110 --> 03:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
wrecks they're being double paid because
 
03:22:30.870 --> 03:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
they get the money from the rex and they
 
03:22:33.349 --> 03:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
also get it in in
 
03:22:35.030 --> 03:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh what they're paid by the utilities
 
03:22:36.870 --> 03:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
for default service so
 
03:22:39.190 --> 03:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
the the part of the default service that
 
03:22:39.200 --> 03:22:40.309 align:start position:0%
the the part of the default service that
includes

03:22:40.309 --> 03:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
includes
 
03:22:41.830 --> 03:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
03:22:44.309 --> 03:22:44.319 align:start position:0%
cost to consumers of the wrecks should
 
03:22:45.990 --> 03:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
not be included so they don't get double
 
03:22:46.000 --> 03:22:47.590 align:start position:0%
not be included so they don't get double
paid

03:22:47.590 --> 03:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
paid
 
03:22:51.110 --> 03:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
further discussion on this motion
 
03:22:53.030 --> 03:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee
 
03:22:54.630 --> 03:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:22:56.469 --> 03:22:56.479 align:start position:0%
yeah i actually went through the bill
 
03:22:57.750 --> 03:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
last night because i was doing the
 
03:23:00.070 --> 03:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
minority report and i think the point
 
03:23:02.150 --> 03:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
that i would make is that this this real
 
03:23:04.710 --> 03:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
really feels very much like rate setting
 
03:23:08.469 --> 03:23:08.479 align:start position:0%
uh from the house in a way that um
 
03:23:10.710 --> 03:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
it may make sense with some people's
 
03:23:12.550 --> 03:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
simple math but i don't think it
 
03:23:12.560 --> 03:23:13.670 align:start position:0%
simple math but i don't think it
reflects

03:23:13.670 --> 03:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
reflects
 
03:23:16.150 --> 03:23:16.160 align:start position:0%
uh the complexity of the rate setting
 
03:23:19.750 --> 03:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
that has been used to try and establish
 
03:23:21.910 --> 03:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
the rps credits the alternative
 
03:23:23.910 --> 03:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
compliance payments system benefits
 
03:23:26.309 --> 03:23:26.319 align:start position:0%
charge all of these are
 
03:23:29.349 --> 03:23:29.359 align:start position:0%
well considered and long reviewed and as
 
03:23:31.590 --> 03:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
we have alluded to a couple of times
 
03:23:34.469 --> 03:23:34.479 align:start position:0%
we have been told that there the der
 
03:23:37.269 --> 03:23:37.279 align:start position:0%
study through the puc for the value of
 
03:23:39.670 --> 03:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
distributed energy resources is due this
 
03:23:39.680 --> 03:23:41.030 align:start position:0%
distributed energy resources is due this
spring

03:23:41.030 --> 03:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
spring
 
03:23:42.150 --> 03:23:42.160 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:23:42.160 --> 03:23:43.429 align:start position:0%
and so
uh

03:23:43.429 --> 03:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:23:45.670 --> 03:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
taking a stab at trying to figure out
 
03:23:48.150 --> 03:23:48.160 align:start position:0%
what someone's opinion is of what this
 
03:23:49.429 --> 03:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
rate should be
 
03:23:52.469 --> 03:23:52.479 align:start position:0%
and just eliminating uh rates that have
 
03:23:54.389 --> 03:23:54.399 align:start position:0%
been considered when they were set i i
 
03:23:56.229 --> 03:23:56.239 align:start position:0%
just think it's very irresponsible for
 
03:23:58.150 --> 03:23:58.160 align:start position:0%
us to just
 
03:23:59.990 --> 03:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
i mean i don't know whose decision this
 
03:24:02.790 --> 03:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
is or who decided that this was the way
 
03:24:05.030 --> 03:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
to approach it but it isn't what has
 
03:24:06.630 --> 03:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
been considered by those people who've
 
03:24:09.110 --> 03:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
been responsible for rate setting in the
 
03:24:10.870 --> 03:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
03:24:13.429 --> 03:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
it's a departure from that process and i
 
03:24:16.150 --> 03:24:16.160 align:start position:0%
very much oppose it
 
03:24:17.750 --> 03:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you the
 
03:24:19.750 --> 03:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
the testimony of the honorable clifton
 
03:24:23.910 --> 03:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:26.229 --> 03:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
uncovered that the tariff that's been in
 
03:24:29.670 --> 03:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
place since 2017
 
03:24:31.910 --> 03:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
and he was an intervener in the docket
 
03:24:34.469 --> 03:24:34.479 align:start position:0%
that established that tariff
 
03:24:37.349 --> 03:24:37.359 align:start position:0%
created what he called a missing money
 
03:24:37.359 --> 03:24:39.429 align:start position:0%
created what he called a missing money
problem

03:24:39.429 --> 03:24:39.439 align:start position:0%
problem
 
03:24:41.190 --> 03:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
he further characterized the missing
 
03:24:43.269 --> 03:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
money problem
 
03:24:45.750 --> 03:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
this way it's he said the missing money
 
03:24:48.550 --> 03:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
has to be made up by other customers
 
03:24:52.309 --> 03:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
resulting in an undue cost shift or
 
03:24:52.319 --> 03:24:54.950 align:start position:0%
resulting in an undue cost shift or
subsidy

03:24:54.950 --> 03:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
subsidy
 
03:24:58.150 --> 03:24:58.160 align:start position:0%
so mr bilo actually created the
 
03:25:00.229 --> 03:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
language of this
 
03:25:00.239 --> 03:25:01.590 align:start position:0%
language of this
bill

03:25:01.590 --> 03:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:25:01.600 --> 03:25:03.269 align:start position:0%
bill
and

03:25:03.269 --> 03:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:25:05.830 --> 03:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
proposed it last
 
03:25:09.190 --> 03:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
spring when we were doing the
 
03:25:11.750 --> 03:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
committee of conference on house bill
 
03:25:11.760 --> 03:25:14.070 align:start position:0%
committee of conference on house bill
315

03:25:14.070 --> 03:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
315
 
03:25:14.080 --> 03:25:15.590 align:start position:0%
315
the

03:25:15.590 --> 03:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:25:17.830 --> 03:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
senate did not want to accept this
 
03:25:20.790 --> 03:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
language at that time
 
03:25:20.800 --> 03:25:21.510 align:start position:0%
language at that time
but

03:25:21.510 --> 03:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:25:24.870 --> 03:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner former commissioner belo
 
03:25:26.950 --> 03:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
made a strong case
 
03:25:26.960 --> 03:25:30.309 align:start position:0%
made a strong case
that

03:25:30.309 --> 03:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:32.309 --> 03:25:32.319 align:start position:0%
the missing money problem
 
03:25:35.510 --> 03:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
is an undue cost shift to
 
03:25:37.830 --> 03:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
non-net metering customers and the way
 
03:25:41.110 --> 03:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
to rectify that is by adopting the
 
03:25:43.429 --> 03:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
language of this
 
03:25:45.670 --> 03:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation
 
03:25:48.710 --> 03:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh representative oxenam has a comment
 
03:25:52.710 --> 03:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:55.030 --> 03:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
a number a number of issues there
 
03:25:55.040 --> 03:25:56.870 align:start position:0%
a number a number of issues there
when

03:25:56.870 --> 03:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
when
 
03:25:59.190 --> 03:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
assistant mayor below spoke to this
 
03:26:01.110 --> 03:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
committee at the public hearing
 
03:26:03.750 --> 03:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
he raised many points
 
03:26:05.670 --> 03:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
as as he often does
 
03:26:09.269 --> 03:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
and the the missing money of he quoted
 
03:26:11.670 --> 03:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
uh in the city of lebanon
 
03:26:13.830 --> 03:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
is something like sixty thousand dollars
 
03:26:16.550 --> 03:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of the renewable portfolio
 
03:26:18.870 --> 03:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
compliance costs which are included in
 
03:26:22.070 --> 03:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
which he felt should not be legitimately
 
03:26:24.469 --> 03:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
but also at the same time we're more
 
03:26:26.309 --> 03:26:26.319 align:start position:0%
than offset by a hundred and twenty
 
03:26:28.630 --> 03:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in the avoided
 
03:26:31.910 --> 03:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
transmission costs which are a positive
 
03:26:31.920 --> 03:26:32.950 align:start position:0%
transmission costs which are a positive
benefit

03:26:32.950 --> 03:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
03:26:35.269 --> 03:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
so that this this is why regulated
 
03:26:37.990 --> 03:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
regulation rate setting is complicated
 
03:26:40.469 --> 03:26:40.479 align:start position:0%
there are many things which offset each
 
03:26:41.990 --> 03:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
other there are many things which
 
03:26:44.150 --> 03:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
compound each other and that's why we
 
03:26:46.550 --> 03:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
hire professionals to do the work
 
03:26:48.150 --> 03:26:48.160 align:start position:0%
we've all agreed that we should wait for
 
03:26:52.229 --> 03:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
the vder study but i i will only add one
 
03:26:54.070 --> 03:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
more point here which is that when the
 
03:26:56.630 --> 03:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
utilities purchase energy they don't go
 
03:26:59.590 --> 03:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
out and buy at the locational marginal
 
03:27:02.389 --> 03:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
price they hire suppliers those
 
03:27:04.870 --> 03:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
suppliers put a lot of different costs
 
03:27:06.630 --> 03:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
which brings it up from the locational
 
03:27:08.389 --> 03:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
marginal price to what we call the
 
03:27:10.550 --> 03:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
default service price there are things
 
03:27:12.790 --> 03:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
in there like hedging there are things
 
03:27:15.190 --> 03:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
in there like the renewable portfolio
 
03:27:17.670 --> 03:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
compliance costs there's avoided
 
03:27:20.630 --> 03:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
transmission costs almost all of those
 
03:27:23.349 --> 03:27:23.359 align:start position:0%
costs between the locational marginal
 
03:27:25.670 --> 03:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
price and the default service price
 
03:27:27.590 --> 03:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
are avoided
 
03:27:27.600 --> 03:27:28.870 align:start position:0%
are avoided
by

03:27:28.870 --> 03:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
by
 
03:27:31.269 --> 03:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
customer generators because they put out
 
03:27:33.349 --> 03:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
energy which never gets to that meter
 
03:27:35.990 --> 03:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
where the wholesale where our the grid
 
03:27:36.000 --> 03:27:37.750 align:start position:0%
where the wholesale where our the grid
intersects

03:27:37.750 --> 03:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
intersects
 
03:27:40.070 --> 03:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
those cause it's load reduction it's
 
03:27:41.830 --> 03:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
it's unseen
 
03:27:45.429 --> 03:27:45.439 align:start position:0%
energy and therefore it reduces costs
 
03:27:47.429 --> 03:27:47.439 align:start position:0%
and that is the most significant reason
 
03:27:50.070 --> 03:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
why this bdr study has been
 
03:27:52.229 --> 03:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
so important and why we should wait to
 
03:27:54.389 --> 03:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
take any action on this
 
03:27:54.399 --> 03:27:55.429 align:start position:0%
take any action on this
um

03:27:55.429 --> 03:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:57.750 --> 03:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
of this bill thank you
 
03:28:00.630 --> 03:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
representative harrington
 
03:28:02.950 --> 03:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
yeah there's a lot of stuff going on
 
03:28:04.950 --> 03:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
here um
 
03:28:06.229 --> 03:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
let's just start with the simple part of
 
03:28:07.110 --> 03:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
this this is we're trying to
 
03:28:09.750 --> 03:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
overcomplicate this the people that get
 
03:28:12.309 --> 03:28:12.319 align:start position:0%
paid for net metering have a rate that
 
03:28:14.389 --> 03:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
we call default service and it was just
 
03:28:15.830 --> 03:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned by the previous speaker the
 
03:28:17.990 --> 03:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
default service is very complicated it
 
03:28:20.070 --> 03:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
involves the price of the energy
 
03:28:22.150 --> 03:28:22.160 align:start position:0%
but it also that the utility has to buy
 
03:28:24.790 --> 03:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
but it also involves having the utility
 
03:28:27.269 --> 03:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
have to set up a bidding process and a
 
03:28:30.229 --> 03:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
review process and put out bids select
 
03:28:32.790 --> 03:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
those bids take those bids to the puc
 
03:28:34.550 --> 03:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
all of those costs are put into default
 
03:28:36.550 --> 03:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
service rates then the supplier they
 
03:28:38.950 --> 03:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
select also has costs one of them is
 
03:28:40.150 --> 03:28:40.160 align:start position:0%
profits because they wouldn't be in the
 
03:28:42.070 --> 03:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
business if it wasn't for making profits
 
03:28:44.070 --> 03:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
you they mentioned hedging that's the
 
03:28:46.309 --> 03:28:46.319 align:start position:0%
risk factor that's probably one of the
 
03:28:47.830 --> 03:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
highest uh
 
03:28:49.510 --> 03:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
components of this i've talked to people
 
03:28:51.510 --> 03:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
who actually negotiate these contracts
 
03:28:53.670 --> 03:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
and they tell me somewhere in the range
 
03:28:55.670 --> 03:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
of 40 percent of the total cost of
 
03:28:58.309 --> 03:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
default service is the risk factor of
 
03:29:00.870 --> 03:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
that supplier being having to go on an
 
03:29:02.950 --> 03:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
hourly basis almost a minute to minute
 
03:29:05.830 --> 03:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
basis matching supply and demand so if
 
03:29:07.269 --> 03:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
they happen to be
 
03:29:09.349 --> 03:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
i'll just use next era for an example
 
03:29:11.510 --> 03:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
who's a supplier and one of the com
 
03:29:13.269 --> 03:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
places they tend to get power from is
 
03:29:15.510 --> 03:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
seabrook but seabird trips offline they
 
03:29:18.150 --> 03:29:18.160 align:start position:0%
can't call eversource or or liberty up
 
03:29:19.750 --> 03:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
and say sorry we're not going to have
 
03:29:21.190 --> 03:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
much power today because one of our
 
03:29:23.030 --> 03:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
suppliers tripped offline no no they
 
03:29:24.630 --> 03:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
have to go buy it someplace else and
 
03:29:27.269 --> 03:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
that's a huge risk premium all of that
 
03:29:29.590 --> 03:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
is built into the default service rate
 
03:29:30.950 --> 03:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
one of the other things that's built
 
03:29:32.469 --> 03:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
into it is the compliance with the
 
03:29:34.550 --> 03:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard the
 
03:29:37.030 --> 03:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
supplier of the electricity utility has
 
03:29:40.150 --> 03:29:40.160 align:start position:0%
to buy these these green wrecks or make
 
03:29:42.309 --> 03:29:42.319 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payments now the
 
03:29:44.550 --> 03:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
person doing net metering is also
 
03:29:46.309 --> 03:29:46.319 align:start position:0%
getting paid green racks so they're
 
03:29:48.950 --> 03:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
getting the green wrecks as as pieces of
 
03:29:50.950 --> 03:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
paper that they can then sell because
 
03:29:52.790 --> 03:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
the utilities are forced to buy it and
 
03:29:54.550 --> 03:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
they're also getting a higher default
 
03:29:56.630 --> 03:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
service rate because the cost of
 
03:29:58.710 --> 03:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
compliance is already included in there
 
03:30:00.950 --> 03:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
all this bill does is say no double
 
03:30:02.550 --> 03:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
payment we're not going to we're not
 
03:30:04.630 --> 03:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
going to allow you to to acquire green
 
03:30:07.110 --> 03:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
rex for every megawatt of electricity
 
03:30:09.110 --> 03:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
you produce and then pay you a rate
 
03:30:11.990 --> 03:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
based on the utilities compliance with
 
03:30:13.830 --> 03:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
green rex it just ends the double
 
03:30:17.590 --> 03:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:18.870 --> 03:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion
 
03:30:20.950 --> 03:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki is recognized um
 
03:30:22.389 --> 03:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i actually have a
 
03:30:25.190 --> 03:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
question relative to line eight
 
03:30:27.190 --> 03:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
where it says including prior period
 
03:30:29.110 --> 03:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
reconciliation shall be deducted from
 
03:30:30.710 --> 03:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
the monetary credit
 
03:30:33.030 --> 03:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering whether this is actually a
 
03:30:43.750 --> 03:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:45.269 --> 03:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
repeat the line that did you have a
 
03:30:48.309 --> 03:30:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:52.150 --> 03:30:52.160 align:start position:0%
uh line eight um it says including prior
 
03:30:54.309 --> 03:30:54.319 align:start position:0%
period reconciliation shall be deducted
 
03:30:56.469 --> 03:30:56.479 align:start position:0%
from the monetary credit for exports to
 
03:30:57.510 --> 03:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
the grid
 
03:31:00.150 --> 03:31:00.160 align:start position:0%
and i it is uncle i may be reading it
 
03:31:01.990 --> 03:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
wrong but i'm wondering whether this is
 
03:31:05.110 --> 03:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
a clawback or an exposed facto clause um
 
03:31:07.830 --> 03:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
and perhaps someone can clarify
 
03:31:09.349 --> 03:31:09.359 align:start position:0%
representative plat
 
03:31:11.830 --> 03:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
yes it's not a clawback what the prior
 
03:31:14.309 --> 03:31:14.319 align:start position:0%
period reconciliation is simply
 
03:31:16.710 --> 03:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
uh is that they put in a
 
03:31:18.950 --> 03:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
dollar amount to the puc
 
03:31:21.269 --> 03:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
for a six-month period
 
03:31:24.150 --> 03:31:24.160 align:start position:0%
and that it includes all that stuff that
 
03:31:25.510 --> 03:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
representative harrington just talked
 
03:31:25.520 --> 03:31:26.550 align:start position:0%
representative harrington just talked
about

03:31:26.550 --> 03:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:31:29.030 --> 03:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
then they go out and they build that for
 
03:31:30.630 --> 03:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
the six months
 
03:31:32.150 --> 03:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
trying to recover what they thought the
 
03:31:33.429 --> 03:31:33.439 align:start position:0%
cost was
 
03:31:36.550 --> 03:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
but if their estimate is a little wrong
 
03:31:38.389 --> 03:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
then the prior period reconciliation
 
03:31:40.309 --> 03:31:40.319 align:start position:0%
just say okay we were a little wrong in
 
03:31:42.150 --> 03:31:42.160 align:start position:0%
the last six months we were we
 
03:31:44.150 --> 03:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
overcharged by a hundred thousand for
 
03:31:46.150 --> 03:31:46.160 align:start position:0%
example we'll give that hundred thousand
 
03:31:47.990 --> 03:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
dollars a credit for our next estimate
 
03:31:49.269 --> 03:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
that's all
 
03:31:50.710 --> 03:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
or if it's undercharged by a hundred
 
03:31:52.229 --> 03:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
thousand they throw the hundred thousand
 
03:31:56.469 --> 03:31:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:58.950 --> 03:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
okay further discussion of this question
 
03:32:01.349 --> 03:32:01.359 align:start position:0%
representative pementel
 
03:32:03.910 --> 03:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i just think that
 
03:32:07.110 --> 03:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
this bill is only looking at one side of
 
03:32:08.469 --> 03:32:08.479 align:start position:0%
the ledger
 
03:32:09.670 --> 03:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
and that
 
03:32:12.070 --> 03:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
that is the reason we need to wait
 
03:32:14.630 --> 03:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
for the uh values
 
03:32:17.590 --> 03:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
distribution energy resources study to
 
03:32:19.750 --> 03:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
come out in the spring
 
03:32:22.630 --> 03:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
which is looking at both sides of the of
 
03:32:24.610 --> 03:32:24.620 align:start position:0%
the ledger and involving
 
03:32:24.620 --> 03:32:27.190 align:start position:0%
the ledger and involving
[Music]

03:32:27.190 --> 03:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:32:29.030 --> 03:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
both the
 
03:32:31.750 --> 03:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
suppliers and the
 
03:32:34.389 --> 03:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
and the producers
 
03:32:34.399 --> 03:32:35.750 align:start position:0%
and the producers
to

03:32:35.750 --> 03:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:32:37.670 --> 03:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
to get
 
03:32:39.110 --> 03:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
an equitable
 
03:32:39.120 --> 03:32:40.389 align:start position:0%
an equitable
price

03:32:40.389 --> 03:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
price
 
03:32:42.870 --> 03:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
for the energy they produce and i think
 
03:32:42.880 --> 03:32:44.389 align:start position:0%
for the energy they produce and i think
that

03:32:44.389 --> 03:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:32:46.630 --> 03:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh i just think it's premature to be
 
03:32:49.110 --> 03:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
doing this now and just like the
 
03:32:50.389 --> 03:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
previous bill
 
03:32:51.990 --> 03:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
we should wait for this study to be
 
03:32:52.000 --> 03:32:53.110 align:start position:0%
we should wait for this study to be
completed

03:32:53.110 --> 03:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
completed
 
03:32:53.120 --> 03:32:54.389 align:start position:0%
completed
and

03:32:54.389 --> 03:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:32:56.070 --> 03:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
get a more equitable
 
03:32:56.080 --> 03:32:57.269 align:start position:0%
get a more equitable
uh

03:32:57.269 --> 03:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:32:57.279 --> 03:32:58.550 align:start position:0%
uh
price

03:32:58.550 --> 03:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
price
 
03:32:58.560 --> 03:32:59.910 align:start position:0%
price
of

03:32:59.910 --> 03:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:33:03.190 --> 03:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
this distributed this
 
03:33:07.110 --> 03:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
electric energy being being produced
 
03:33:08.950 --> 03:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
thank you i hope everyone's not
 
03:33:11.269 --> 03:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
confusing this bill which tries to
 
03:33:13.670 --> 03:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
correct a mistake that was made when the
 
03:33:16.870 --> 03:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
tariff was set back in 2017
 
03:33:19.510 --> 03:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
and the bill we'll just be discussing
 
03:33:22.790 --> 03:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
later on this afternoon 1629
 
03:33:25.269 --> 03:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
which is a bill to change the definition
 
03:33:27.750 --> 03:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
of default service those
 
03:33:29.830 --> 03:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
two bills are different things they
 
03:33:31.110 --> 03:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
attempt to do
 
03:33:33.030 --> 03:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
different things
 
03:33:35.269 --> 03:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
although there is one component that
 
03:33:37.429 --> 03:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
they both do
 
03:33:39.030 --> 03:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
but the intense
 
03:33:41.269 --> 03:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
of each bill is different
 
03:33:43.349 --> 03:33:43.359 align:start position:0%
so i would urge you not to confuse the
 
03:33:43.359 --> 03:33:44.630 align:start position:0%
so i would urge you not to confuse the
two

03:33:44.630 --> 03:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
two
 
03:33:45.990 --> 03:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
representative representative horgans
 
03:33:48.150 --> 03:33:48.160 align:start position:0%
has his hand up oh thank you very much
 
03:33:50.630 --> 03:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
mr chair and i apologize i know i'm just
 
03:33:52.070 --> 03:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
a guest in this committee so a lot of
 
03:33:52.080 --> 03:33:53.110 align:start position:0%
a guest in this committee so a lot of
the

03:33:53.110 --> 03:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:33:55.030 --> 03:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
details i'm not up to speed on but i've
 
03:33:55.040 --> 03:33:55.990 align:start position:0%
details i'm not up to speed on but i've
got

03:33:55.990 --> 03:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
got
 
03:33:57.750 --> 03:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
this um
 
03:33:59.269 --> 03:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
same concerns i had with the previous
 
03:34:01.269 --> 03:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
bill first of all from a parochial level
 
03:34:03.990 --> 03:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh my town government is i'm pretty sure
 
03:34:05.670 --> 03:34:05.680 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
03:34:07.510 --> 03:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
producers of renewable energy we have a
 
03:34:08.870 --> 03:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
large solar
 
03:34:10.790 --> 03:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
installation owned by the town of durham
 
03:34:12.550 --> 03:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
so we appear to be one of the targets of
 
03:34:15.349 --> 03:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
this that they are trying to reduce
 
03:34:16.870 --> 03:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
the subsidies
 
03:34:18.469 --> 03:34:18.479 align:start position:0%
um they're trying to raise the cost of
 
03:34:20.389 --> 03:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
that renewable energy or at least you
 
03:34:22.070 --> 03:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
know lower the benefit we get from
 
03:34:24.309 --> 03:34:24.319 align:start position:0%
replacing fossil fuel usage and then
 
03:34:26.469 --> 03:34:26.479 align:start position:0%
also jumping to a global
 
03:34:28.469 --> 03:34:28.479 align:start position:0%
global thing the uh
 
03:34:29.510 --> 03:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
i think we're going to have to accept
 
03:34:31.110 --> 03:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
that the cost of fossil fuels is
 
03:34:32.469 --> 03:34:32.479 align:start position:0%
probably going to have to be higher than
 
03:34:34.229 --> 03:34:34.239 align:start position:0%
it was in the past for various reasons
 
03:34:36.469 --> 03:34:36.479 align:start position:0%
including the fact that we're having
 
03:34:37.830 --> 03:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
a war
 
03:34:40.389 --> 03:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
in a major fossil fuel producing area
 
03:34:41.590 --> 03:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:34:42.710 --> 03:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
we're bringing
 
03:34:44.389 --> 03:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
sanctions against russia and that's not
 
03:34:45.910 --> 03:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
under our control that's probably an
 
03:34:45.920 --> 03:34:46.710 align:start position:0%
under our control that's probably an
issue

03:34:46.710 --> 03:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
issue
 
03:34:48.309 --> 03:34:48.319 align:start position:0%
most of us do not want to talk about at
 
03:34:51.429 --> 03:34:51.439 align:start position:0%
all but that's uh that's
 
03:34:52.790 --> 03:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative yes what the
 
03:34:55.269 --> 03:34:55.279 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel economy is the fossil fuel
 
03:34:57.030 --> 03:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
economy i think is is going to have to
 
03:34:58.710 --> 03:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
change yes and it's probably going to
 
03:35:01.269 --> 03:35:01.279 align:start position:0%
cost more and renewables will cost less
 
03:35:03.590 --> 03:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:35:05.830 --> 03:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
i apologize for anybody's feelings but i
 
03:35:07.510 --> 03:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
that's what i believe and i think we're
 
03:35:09.110 --> 03:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
not here to discuss
 
03:35:11.590 --> 03:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
ukrainian russian politics of course not
 
03:35:12.710 --> 03:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
i understand
 
03:35:14.150 --> 03:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
net figuring
 
03:35:16.150 --> 03:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
and to correct your misunderstanding
 
03:35:19.030 --> 03:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
this bill does not
 
03:35:21.190 --> 03:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
deprive the citizens of durham in any
 
03:35:23.269 --> 03:35:23.279 align:start position:0%
way in fact
 
03:35:27.269 --> 03:35:27.279 align:start position:0%
as the honorable clifton below
 
03:35:29.990 --> 03:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
testified before this committee
 
03:35:30.000 --> 03:35:31.429 align:start position:0%
testified before this committee
it

03:35:31.429 --> 03:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:35:31.439 --> 03:35:32.870 align:start position:0%
it
removes

03:35:32.870 --> 03:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
removes
 
03:35:35.670 --> 03:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
an undue cost shift
 
03:35:38.309 --> 03:35:38.319 align:start position:0%
to non-net metering customers that's
 
03:35:39.590 --> 03:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
what this bill
 
03:35:43.349 --> 03:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
accomplishes representative oxenum
 
03:35:47.910 --> 03:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:50.309 --> 03:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
as i said earlier mr bilo said several
 
03:35:52.309 --> 03:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
things when he was here before the
 
03:35:52.319 --> 03:35:53.349 align:start position:0%
things when he was here before the
committee

03:35:53.349 --> 03:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:35:55.269 --> 03:35:55.279 align:start position:0%
and he said that this issue of the
 
03:35:57.269 --> 03:35:57.279 align:start position:0%
missing money the sixty thousand dollars
 
03:36:00.150 --> 03:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
that lebanon pays because britain
 
03:36:02.389 --> 03:36:02.399 align:start position:0%
of the compliance costs being factored
 
03:36:04.550 --> 03:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
into the default service rate
 
03:36:07.429 --> 03:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
was a minor issue but it was one that he
 
03:36:09.990 --> 03:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
felt legitimately should be addressed
 
03:36:12.469 --> 03:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
and he contrasted it in his remarks with
 
03:36:14.309 --> 03:36:14.319 align:start position:0%
a hundred and twenty thousand dollars
 
03:36:16.870 --> 03:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
twice that which works in the opposite
 
03:36:19.429 --> 03:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
direction which is money that is
 
03:36:19.439 --> 03:36:20.950 align:start position:0%
direction which is money that is
unfairly

03:36:20.950 --> 03:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
unfairly
 
03:36:24.469 --> 03:36:24.479 align:start position:0%
benefiting lebanon because of
 
03:36:25.990 --> 03:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
the the
 
03:36:28.309 --> 03:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
renewable generation so
 
03:36:29.830 --> 03:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
it it's very important if you're going
 
03:36:32.070 --> 03:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
to quote him that you quote him on both
 
03:36:34.550 --> 03:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
sides as he said
 
03:36:36.630 --> 03:36:36.640 align:start position:0%
net metering from the outset was rough
 
03:36:39.750 --> 03:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
justice it it was not a mathematical
 
03:36:42.229 --> 03:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
formula and it has been undergone
 
03:36:44.229 --> 03:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
changes over time
 
03:36:45.510 --> 03:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
but the
 
03:36:48.469 --> 03:36:48.479 align:start position:0%
idea that default service
 
03:36:51.269 --> 03:36:51.279 align:start position:0%
is is double counting is absolutely
 
03:36:51.279 --> 03:36:52.309 align:start position:0%
is is double counting is absolutely
wrong

03:36:52.309 --> 03:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
03:36:54.229 --> 03:36:54.239 align:start position:0%
the community power arrangements which
 
03:36:58.389 --> 03:36:58.399 align:start position:0%
are now being finalized across the state
 
03:37:00.870 --> 03:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
use the default service rate because it
 
03:37:04.229 --> 03:37:04.239 align:start position:0%
is a it is an accurate portrayal
 
03:37:07.190 --> 03:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
of the benefits to net meter they have
 
03:37:09.030 --> 03:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
no responsibility they're not utilities
 
03:37:10.710 --> 03:37:10.720 align:start position:0%
they're not required
 
03:37:12.710 --> 03:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
to have a net metering but they are
 
03:37:15.269 --> 03:37:15.279 align:start position:0%
voluntarily doing net metering because
 
03:37:18.469 --> 03:37:18.479 align:start position:0%
this is an appropriate sum and again
 
03:37:20.469 --> 03:37:20.479 align:start position:0%
that program was designed and this
 
03:37:22.790 --> 03:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
funding was designed by cliff below so
 
03:37:26.309 --> 03:37:26.319 align:start position:0%
we we must be very careful to to
 
03:37:29.670 --> 03:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
um include both the the counter and the
 
03:37:32.630 --> 03:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
po the positive and the negative because
 
03:37:32.640 --> 03:37:33.429 align:start position:0%
po the positive and the negative because
as

03:37:33.429 --> 03:37:33.439 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:37:35.190 --> 03:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
we've been told again and again rate
 
03:37:37.990 --> 03:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
making is complicated and so when you
 
03:37:40.710 --> 03:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
try to pull one thing out you can upset
 
03:37:42.950 --> 03:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
an arrangement where by which you you
 
03:37:46.309 --> 03:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
have things that are in rough balance
 
03:37:47.190 --> 03:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:37:48.950 --> 03:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
i would agree with you that we need to
 
03:37:51.590 --> 03:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
take take great care
 
03:37:54.070 --> 03:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
and i would also point out that
 
03:37:55.990 --> 03:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
it's likely you don't know this because
 
03:37:58.550 --> 03:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
you weren't there but during the lipa
 
03:38:01.030 --> 03:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
study commission hearings
 
03:38:03.030 --> 03:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
we were told that
 
03:38:07.030 --> 03:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:08.870 --> 03:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
data to support
 
03:38:08.880 --> 03:38:10.309 align:start position:0%
data to support
that

03:38:10.309 --> 03:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:38:12.790 --> 03:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
avoided transmission costs can be
 
03:38:12.800 --> 03:38:14.229 align:start position:0%
avoided transmission costs can be
monetized

03:38:14.229 --> 03:38:14.239 align:start position:0%
monetized
 
03:38:16.309 --> 03:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
the iso new england doesn't think they
 
03:38:18.630 --> 03:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
can be monetized the department of
 
03:38:20.229 --> 03:38:20.239 align:start position:0%
energy has doubts that they can be
 
03:38:20.239 --> 03:38:21.590 align:start position:0%
energy has doubts that they can be
monetized

03:38:21.590 --> 03:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
monetized
 
03:38:25.030 --> 03:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:28.309 --> 03:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
the honorable clifton bilo's testimony
 
03:38:31.269 --> 03:38:31.279 align:start position:0%
as attributing 120 000
 
03:38:34.550 --> 03:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh to the city as a cross subsidy
 
03:38:36.630 --> 03:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
because of avoided transmission charges
 
03:38:38.550 --> 03:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
may not be true because
 
03:38:41.110 --> 03:38:41.120 align:start position:0%
we don't know until the value of der
 
03:38:43.830 --> 03:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
study comes out whether or not avoided
 
03:38:45.750 --> 03:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
transmission charges
 
03:38:51.990 --> 03:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:54.550 --> 03:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
well i'll leave it at that but until
 
03:38:56.550 --> 03:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
that study comes out we don't even know
 
03:39:00.229 --> 03:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
that avoided transmission charges are
 
03:39:02.870 --> 03:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
monetizable if that's a word
 
03:39:06.870 --> 03:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
so i wouldn't go so far as to say that
 
03:39:09.189 --> 03:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
not making this change which will save
 
03:39:11.750 --> 03:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
60 000 in the case of the city of
 
03:39:14.469 --> 03:39:14.479 align:start position:0%
lebanon and much more across the entire
 
03:39:14.479 --> 03:39:15.429 align:start position:0%
lebanon and much more across the entire
state

03:39:15.429 --> 03:39:15.439 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:39:15.439 --> 03:39:16.389 align:start position:0%
state
for

03:39:16.389 --> 03:39:16.399 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:39:16.399 --> 03:39:18.150 align:start position:0%
for
ratepayers

03:39:18.150 --> 03:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
ratepayers
 
03:39:20.550 --> 03:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
due to undue cost shifting i wouldn't
 
03:39:22.790 --> 03:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
say that that's the negligible
 
03:39:24.550 --> 03:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
benefit that is a
 
03:39:26.950 --> 03:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
substantial benefit and we owe it to the
 
03:39:29.349 --> 03:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
customers the ratepayers in our state to
 
03:39:33.189 --> 03:39:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:36.309 --> 03:39:36.319 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee
 
03:39:38.870 --> 03:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
sorry lee did you want him
 
03:39:38.880 --> 03:39:40.630 align:start position:0%
sorry lee did you want him
um

03:39:40.630 --> 03:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:40.640 --> 03:39:41.670 align:start position:0%
um
okay

03:39:41.670 --> 03:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:39:41.680 --> 03:39:42.550 align:start position:0%
okay
so

03:39:42.550 --> 03:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:39:42.560 --> 03:39:44.550 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:39:44.550 --> 03:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:47.189 --> 03:39:47.199 align:start position:0%
i what i'm hearing i mean when i hear
 
03:39:49.750 --> 03:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
representative pimentel saying you know
 
03:39:51.429 --> 03:39:51.439 align:start position:0%
it's premature i think that that's where
 
03:39:53.189 --> 03:39:53.199 align:start position:0%
i fall on this as well
 
03:39:54.950 --> 03:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
my question would be why would we be
 
03:39:57.349 --> 03:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
doing this at this point because
 
03:39:57.359 --> 03:39:58.469 align:start position:0%
doing this at this point because
we're

03:39:58.469 --> 03:39:58.479 align:start position:0%
we're
 
03:39:59.990 --> 03:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
we're sort of rolling with the
 
03:40:02.389 --> 03:40:02.399 align:start position:0%
assumption that there's some cost
 
03:40:05.269 --> 03:40:05.279 align:start position:0%
shifting that's happening which we also
 
03:40:06.469 --> 03:40:06.479 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
03:40:09.110 --> 03:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
any proof of because the study hasn't
 
03:40:11.510 --> 03:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
been completed in terms of the value
 
03:40:15.110 --> 03:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
that's being provided by these producers
 
03:40:17.830 --> 03:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
and what this bill does is it reaches in
 
03:40:18.710 --> 03:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
and it
 
03:40:21.429 --> 03:40:21.439 align:start position:0%
reduces an existing
 
03:40:23.910 --> 03:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
credit that's available by the amount of
 
03:40:26.870 --> 03:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
the rps compliance so it's doing two
 
03:40:29.830 --> 03:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
things it's lowering what's in the rps
 
03:40:32.469 --> 03:40:32.479 align:start position:0%
funding for supporting projects around
 
03:40:35.670 --> 03:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
the state and it's also devaluing the
 
03:40:37.830 --> 03:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
current proposition that people who have
 
03:40:39.349 --> 03:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
these facilities
 
03:40:39.359 --> 03:40:40.630 align:start position:0%
these facilities
are

03:40:40.630 --> 03:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:40:42.950 --> 03:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
are receiving for the value of their
 
03:40:45.110 --> 03:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
product and all of that is being done by
 
03:40:47.110 --> 03:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
people who have no background in rate
 
03:40:49.030 --> 03:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
setting and that's that i mean my my
 
03:40:50.950 --> 03:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
exception is just that it's a bad bill
 
03:40:52.550 --> 03:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't make any sense for us to
 
03:40:53.830 --> 03:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
be doing this
 
03:40:57.110 --> 03:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
you seem to be confusing this bill with
 
03:40:59.910 --> 03:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
house bill 1629 all this bill does is
 
03:41:01.510 --> 03:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
correct a mistake that was made back in
 
03:41:04.229 --> 03:41:04.239 align:start position:0%
2017 that's according to
 
03:41:06.150 --> 03:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
clifton below zone test by removing the
 
03:41:08.229 --> 03:41:08.239 align:start position:0%
rps compliance payment
 
03:41:10.870 --> 03:41:10.880 align:start position:0%

03:41:24.309 --> 03:41:24.319 align:start position:0%

03:46:49.630 --> 03:46:49.640 align:start position:0%
moves that we submit hb
 
03:46:55.349 --> 03:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
1635 fn to interim study
 
03:46:57.830 --> 03:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
and i will start the discussion by
 
03:46:59.750 --> 03:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
mentioning that
 
03:47:01.510 --> 03:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing for this bill
 
03:47:03.349 --> 03:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
i asked representative mcgee who is its
 
03:47:05.990 --> 03:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor if she would be amenable
 
03:47:07.830 --> 03:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
to an amendment
 
03:47:09.830 --> 03:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
to implement one or more of the
 
03:47:11.590 --> 03:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
recommendations of the lipa study
 
03:47:13.030 --> 03:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
committee commission
 
03:47:15.349 --> 03:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
study commission report and she said she
 
03:47:17.670 --> 03:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
would be amenable to that
 
03:47:20.630 --> 03:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
so i contacted the department of energy
 
03:47:23.030 --> 03:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
to discuss with them
 
03:47:23.040 --> 03:47:24.710 align:start position:0%
to discuss with them
what

03:47:24.710 --> 03:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:47:26.950 --> 03:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
that amendment should look like
 
03:47:29.429 --> 03:47:29.439 align:start position:0%
and the department of energy told me
 
03:47:29.439 --> 03:47:30.469 align:start position:0%
and the department of energy told me
that

03:47:30.469 --> 03:47:30.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:47:33.189 --> 03:47:33.199 align:start position:0%
this question is going to be studied
 
03:47:36.150 --> 03:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
adequately in the vder study that is
 
03:47:38.070 --> 03:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
about to be released
 
03:47:40.469 --> 03:47:40.479 align:start position:0%
sometime this spring
 
03:47:41.990 --> 03:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
so as a result
 
03:47:44.469 --> 03:47:44.479 align:start position:0%
they advised me not to make an amendment
 
03:47:44.479 --> 03:47:45.670 align:start position:0%
they advised me not to make an amendment
to

03:47:45.670 --> 03:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:47:48.229 --> 03:47:48.239 align:start position:0%
open a new docket at the puc to
 
03:47:50.070 --> 03:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
do yet another study
 
03:47:52.309 --> 03:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
because they assured me that the vder
 
03:47:54.229 --> 03:47:54.239 align:start position:0%
study would probably provide the answers
 
03:47:55.990 --> 03:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
that we're looking for
 
03:47:59.269 --> 03:47:59.279 align:start position:0%
so as a result i suggested that interim
 
03:48:01.510 --> 03:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
study would be a good outcome for this
 
03:48:03.830 --> 03:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
bill so that's
 
03:48:06.309 --> 03:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
why we're at where we are now is there
 
03:48:08.309 --> 03:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
03:48:12.309 --> 03:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:12.319 --> 03:48:13.429 align:start position:0%
 
i

03:48:13.429 --> 03:48:13.439 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:48:15.110 --> 03:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
i agree with you that this bill should
 
03:48:17.349 --> 03:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
be put off but i'm wondering why interim
 
03:48:20.150 --> 03:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
study because interim study
 
03:48:23.030 --> 03:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
implies that we are going to bring
 
03:48:25.590 --> 03:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
this back in another form in the
 
03:48:28.630 --> 03:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
following year and really study it over
 
03:48:30.309 --> 03:48:30.319 align:start position:0%
the summer
 
03:48:33.189 --> 03:48:33.199 align:start position:0%
and if the study is being con
 
03:48:35.910 --> 03:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
you know completed now or in progress
 
03:48:35.920 --> 03:48:37.030 align:start position:0%
you know completed now or in progress
now

03:48:37.030 --> 03:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:48:38.870 --> 03:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
why would we study it
 
03:48:41.830 --> 03:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
again this summer i
 
03:48:44.950 --> 03:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
don't understand that
 
03:48:46.950 --> 03:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
well i'll refresh your memory that in
 
03:48:50.309 --> 03:48:50.319 align:start position:0%
the second year of a biennium
 
03:48:51.990 --> 03:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
03:48:54.830 --> 03:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
typically means that
 
03:48:59.590 --> 03:48:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:01.910 --> 03:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
either to recommend it for additional
 
03:49:03.990 --> 03:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
legislation or not recommend it for
 
03:49:04.000 --> 03:49:04.950 align:start position:0%
legislation or not recommend it for
additional

03:49:04.950 --> 03:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
additional
 
03:49:04.960 --> 03:49:06.469 align:start position:0%
additional
legislation

03:49:06.469 --> 03:49:06.479 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
03:49:09.670 --> 03:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
so if we wait for the vder study to come
 
03:49:09.680 --> 03:49:11.030 align:start position:0%
so if we wait for the vder study to come
out

03:49:11.030 --> 03:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:49:13.349 --> 03:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
we can then pass judgment on whether
 
03:49:15.590 --> 03:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
this bill should be
 
03:49:17.189 --> 03:49:17.199 align:start position:0%
should recommend
 
03:49:19.670 --> 03:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
future legislation or not
 
03:49:21.429 --> 03:49:21.439 align:start position:0%
so interim study seems like the
 
03:49:24.790 --> 03:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate way to go
 
03:49:27.189 --> 03:49:27.199 align:start position:0%
as a result of that i hope that answers
 
03:49:30.950 --> 03:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:36.469 --> 03:49:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:38.229 --> 03:49:38.239 align:start position:0%
while seeing none i'll ask the clerk to
 
03:49:39.990 --> 03:49:40.000 align:start position:0%

the end of the day for
 
04:05:08.150 --> 04:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
a bill which i i think is of salient
 
04:05:10.630 --> 04:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
importance to to all of us
 
04:05:12.309 --> 04:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
i'd just like to remind you of a few
 
04:05:14.309 --> 04:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
things from the public hearing i
 
04:05:16.550 --> 04:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
declared a conflict a possible conflict
 
04:05:18.710 --> 04:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
of interest at that time
 
04:05:20.389 --> 04:05:20.399 align:start position:0%
i have discussed this with the lawyers
 
04:05:22.870 --> 04:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
here at the state capitol and it is
 
04:05:24.790 --> 04:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
permitted for me to discuss the bill it
 
04:05:27.670 --> 04:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
is permitted for me to vote in committee
 
04:05:30.550 --> 04:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
on the bill but just as last year
 
04:05:32.630 --> 04:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
the i had declared a conflict of
 
04:05:34.150 --> 04:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
interest on the floor when a similar
 
04:05:36.710 --> 04:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
bill was going to be heard but was not
 
04:05:36.720 --> 04:05:38.229 align:start position:0%
bill was going to be heard but was not
heard

04:05:38.229 --> 04:05:38.239 align:start position:0%
heard
 
04:05:40.389 --> 04:05:40.399 align:start position:0%
i will not vote on the floor of the
 
04:05:42.950 --> 04:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
house on this bill
 
04:05:46.150 --> 04:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
okay so uh you have before you
 
04:05:46.160 --> 04:05:48.229 align:start position:0%
okay so uh you have before you
a

04:05:48.229 --> 04:05:48.239 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:05:48.239 --> 04:05:49.590 align:start position:0%
a
handout

04:05:49.590 --> 04:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
handout
 
04:05:51.349 --> 04:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
wreck sweeping and unconstitutional
 
04:05:51.359 --> 04:05:52.389 align:start position:0%
wreck sweeping and unconstitutional
taking

04:05:52.389 --> 04:05:52.399 align:start position:0%
taking
 
04:05:54.950 --> 04:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
and you have before you an amendment
 
04:05:56.870 --> 04:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
again i've handed out the amendment at
 
04:05:58.790 --> 04:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
the time of the public hearing the
 
04:06:00.950 --> 04:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
reason for the
 
04:06:03.110 --> 04:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
amendment which replaces the entirety of
 
04:06:04.630 --> 04:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
the original bill
 
04:06:06.630 --> 04:06:06.640 align:start position:0%
is that at the time of drafting back
 
04:06:09.269 --> 04:06:09.279 align:start position:0%
when we had our window for lsrs i was
 
04:06:11.110 --> 04:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
under the mistaken apprehensive
 
04:06:11.120 --> 04:06:12.389 align:start position:0%
under the mistaken apprehensive
apprehension

04:06:12.389 --> 04:06:12.399 align:start position:0%
apprehension
 
04:06:14.309 --> 04:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
that i could not bring back the original
 
04:06:16.870 --> 04:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
bill because it had been introduced in
 
04:06:18.710 --> 04:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
the prior session
 
04:06:20.229 --> 04:06:20.239 align:start position:0%
it was one of the bills that went off
 
04:06:22.229 --> 04:06:22.239 align:start position:0%
into the nether netherlands because we
 
04:06:23.990 --> 04:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
didn't get to it
 
04:06:25.830 --> 04:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
on the floor and because it wasn't acted
 
04:06:28.389 --> 04:06:28.399 align:start position:0%
on the floor actually it was possible to
 
04:06:31.189 --> 04:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
bring the original text before you so
 
04:06:33.189 --> 04:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
what you have here
 
04:06:35.510 --> 04:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
in the amendment is the bill that we
 
04:06:37.510 --> 04:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
would have considered on the floor of
 
04:06:40.469 --> 04:06:40.479 align:start position:0%
the house last spring
 
04:06:43.590 --> 04:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
and what what it does is it says that
 
04:06:43.600 --> 04:06:44.389 align:start position:0%
and what what it does is it says that
the

04:06:44.389 --> 04:06:44.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:06:46.429 --> 04:06:46.439 align:start position:0%
practice of wreck sweeping is
 
04:06:49.110 --> 04:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional it constitutes a taking
 
04:06:51.189 --> 04:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
of property and it should be removed
 
04:06:54.870 --> 04:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:57.830 --> 04:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
the original bill when we didn't think
 
04:06:59.750 --> 04:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
we could bring that forward
 
04:07:02.790 --> 04:07:02.800 align:start position:0%
was a an itemization of how you could
 
04:07:05.590 --> 04:07:05.600 align:start position:0%
notify consumers that they were being
 
04:07:07.830 --> 04:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
harmed and how they could protect
 
04:07:11.349 --> 04:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
themselves from the harm of the practice
 
04:07:13.110 --> 04:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
of rec sweeping
 
04:07:14.950 --> 04:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:07:17.030 --> 04:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
i will try to move through this quickly
 
04:07:19.429 --> 04:07:19.439 align:start position:0%
and i think i can we've covered some of
 
04:07:21.269 --> 04:07:21.279 align:start position:0%
this before
 
04:07:22.950 --> 04:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
for some of you it will be a little bit
 
04:07:22.960 --> 04:07:24.389 align:start position:0%
for some of you it will be a little bit
familiar

04:07:24.389 --> 04:07:24.399 align:start position:0%
familiar
 
04:07:25.990 --> 04:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
and i would appreciate it if people
 
04:07:27.510 --> 04:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
could just note down their questions and
 
04:07:29.510 --> 04:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
we gets them at the end i think that way
 
04:07:31.670 --> 04:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll all get through this um
 
04:07:33.510 --> 04:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully in in
 
04:07:34.870 --> 04:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
record time
 
04:07:37.189 --> 04:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
okay so there's a brief synopsis that
 
04:07:39.510 --> 04:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
lays out the the general
 
04:07:41.510 --> 04:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh landscape
 
04:07:44.309 --> 04:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
a uh list on page two of the key harms
 
04:07:46.710 --> 04:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
of rec sweeping first of all it denies
 
04:07:48.469 --> 04:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
the owners of renewable energy of the
 
04:07:51.349 --> 04:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
right to use i'm sorry it's called slide
 
04:07:51.359 --> 04:07:52.630 align:start position:0%
right to use i'm sorry it's called slide
three

04:07:52.630 --> 04:07:52.640 align:start position:0%
three
 
04:07:54.630 --> 04:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
i was not counting the cover page thank
 
04:07:56.550 --> 04:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
you very much for the correction
 
04:07:58.229 --> 04:07:58.239 align:start position:0%
denies the owners of renewable energy
 
04:08:00.469 --> 04:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
the right to use their own property it
 
04:08:02.469 --> 04:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
denies the right of renewable energy
 
04:08:05.189 --> 04:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
owners to exclude others from using
 
04:08:07.670 --> 04:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
their property it places citizens and
 
04:08:09.750 --> 04:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
businesses who generate renewable energy
 
04:08:13.269 --> 04:08:13.279 align:start position:0%
in jeopardy of criminal prosecution
 
04:08:15.349 --> 04:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
either a misdemeanor or a felony
 
04:08:18.469 --> 04:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
conviction for claiming to use their own
 
04:08:19.910 --> 04:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
renewable energy
 
04:08:21.990 --> 04:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
and it transfers millions of dollars of
 
04:08:23.830 --> 04:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
wealth from predominantly middle class
 
04:08:25.990 --> 04:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents and businesses
 
04:08:28.550 --> 04:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
to out-of-state multi-billion dollar
 
04:08:28.560 --> 04:08:30.070 align:start position:0%
to out-of-state multi-billion dollar
corporations

04:08:30.070 --> 04:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
corporations
 
04:08:32.309 --> 04:08:32.319 align:start position:0%
so a little glance back at the rps
 
04:08:34.790 --> 04:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
program state rps programs require
 
04:08:36.550 --> 04:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
electricity providers to acquire and
 
04:08:38.309 --> 04:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
supply renewable energy to their
 
04:08:38.319 --> 04:08:39.830 align:start position:0%
supply renewable energy to their
customers

04:08:39.830 --> 04:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
customers
 
04:08:41.990 --> 04:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
it is physically impossible to track
 
04:08:44.790 --> 04:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
particular electron flows on a shared
 
04:08:46.389 --> 04:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
electrical grid
 
04:08:48.309 --> 04:08:48.319 align:start position:0%
no one can determine who's using the
 
04:08:50.149 --> 04:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
physical electricity produced by any
 
04:08:52.070 --> 04:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
given generator whether it's renewable
 
04:08:54.469 --> 04:08:54.479 align:start position:0%
or otherwise so a mechanism had to be
 
04:08:56.950 --> 04:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
developed to track and trade renewable
 
04:08:59.990 --> 04:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
energy independently of the physical
 
04:09:00.000 --> 04:09:01.349 align:start position:0%
energy independently of the physical
electricity

04:09:01.349 --> 04:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
04:09:03.349 --> 04:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
so this brings us to renewable
 
04:09:03.359 --> 04:09:04.550 align:start position:0%
so this brings us to renewable
attributes

04:09:04.550 --> 04:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
attributes
 
04:09:06.229 --> 04:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
physical attributes of something we're
 
04:09:08.630 --> 04:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
familiar with renewable attributes what
 
04:09:10.070 --> 04:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
this means is
 
04:09:13.429 --> 04:09:13.439 align:start position:0%
what makes renewable energy renewable so
 
04:09:16.229 --> 04:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
it's renewableness they're sometimes
 
04:09:18.630 --> 04:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
also referred to in statute as
 
04:09:21.189 --> 04:09:21.199 align:start position:0%
environmental attributes
 
04:09:23.670 --> 04:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
so renewable attributes are created
 
04:09:26.550 --> 04:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
whenever renewable energy is generated
 
04:09:29.189 --> 04:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
they are created at the same moment as
 
04:09:30.790 --> 04:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
the electrons
 
04:09:33.510 --> 04:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
they are property specifically they are
 
04:09:35.590 --> 04:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
intangible property
 
04:09:38.149 --> 04:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
renewable energy certificates what we
 
04:09:41.110 --> 04:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
know of as wrecks are simply legal
 
04:09:44.550 --> 04:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
instruments designed to represent and
 
04:09:46.630 --> 04:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
convey ownership of those renewable
 
04:09:46.640 --> 04:09:47.750 align:start position:0%
convey ownership of those renewable
attributes

04:09:47.750 --> 04:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
attributes
 
04:09:49.830 --> 04:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
so the invention of rex enabled
 
04:09:52.550 --> 04:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
renewable attributes to be separated or
 
04:09:55.189 --> 04:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
unbundled from the original megawatt
 
04:09:58.870 --> 04:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
hours and to be reassigned or bundled
 
04:10:01.990 --> 04:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
with other megawatt hours
 
04:10:03.910 --> 04:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
so this invention
 
04:10:06.550 --> 04:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
and this reassignment led to a change in
 
04:10:09.269 --> 04:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
the legal definition of what constitutes
 
04:10:10.950 --> 04:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
renewable energy
 
04:10:13.590 --> 04:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
a megawatt hour of renewable energy is
 
04:10:18.070 --> 04:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
now defined as any megawatt hour that is
 
04:10:21.670 --> 04:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
bundled with a renewable attribute
 
04:10:23.750 --> 04:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
regardless of the kind of power plant
 
04:10:26.870 --> 04:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
that generated it so if a coal-fired
 
04:10:29.590 --> 04:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
power plant produces a megawatt hour of
 
04:10:32.229 --> 04:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
energy and they buy a wreck
 
04:10:34.630 --> 04:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
that is renewable energy
 
04:10:36.710 --> 04:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
and what you produced with your solar
 
04:10:39.910 --> 04:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
array at home if you sold that wreck
 
04:10:41.030 --> 04:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
is now
 
04:10:41.040 --> 04:10:41.910 align:start position:0%
is now
null

04:10:41.910 --> 04:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
null
 
04:10:41.920 --> 04:10:43.269 align:start position:0%
null
electricity

04:10:43.269 --> 04:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
04:10:44.790 --> 04:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
and if you claim it
 
04:10:47.510 --> 04:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
as renewable energy you are subject to
 
04:10:49.830 --> 04:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
felony or misdemeanor prosecution if
 
04:10:51.590 --> 04:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
it's done in a commercial arrangement
 
04:10:54.309 --> 04:10:54.319 align:start position:0%
such as selling your home or
 
04:10:56.870 --> 04:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
claiming that your own factory is run by
 
04:11:01.269 --> 04:11:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:02.790 --> 04:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
so when you lose your renewable
 
04:11:02.800 --> 04:11:04.309 align:start position:0%
so when you lose your renewable
attributes

04:11:04.309 --> 04:11:04.319 align:start position:0%
attributes
 
04:11:06.630 --> 04:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
you lose your renewable energy
 
04:11:08.630 --> 04:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
renewable attribute unbundling created
 
04:11:11.349 --> 04:11:11.359 align:start position:0%
the need for strict anti-double counting
 
04:11:13.189 --> 04:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
rules at both the state and federal
 
04:11:15.349 --> 04:11:15.359 align:start position:0%
levels you can't have your cake and eat
 
04:11:17.990 --> 04:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
it too if you sell your wrecks
 
04:11:20.630 --> 04:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
that you you've lost title you've lost
 
04:11:23.910 --> 04:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
ownership of your renewable energy
 
04:11:25.910 --> 04:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
under the rules a customer generator
 
04:11:28.790 --> 04:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
must retain exclusive rights to the
 
04:11:30.710 --> 04:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
renewable attributes they create in
 
04:11:33.110 --> 04:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
order to legally possess
 
04:11:35.429 --> 04:11:35.439 align:start position:0%
and claim to use the renewable energy
 
04:11:37.590 --> 04:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
they actually generate a customer
 
04:11:39.429 --> 04:11:39.439 align:start position:0%
generator who gives up their renewable
 
04:11:41.750 --> 04:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
attributes by selling wrecks
 
04:11:44.870 --> 04:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
transfers ownership of that property to
 
04:11:46.309 --> 04:11:46.319 align:start position:0%
the buyer
 
04:11:50.149 --> 04:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
and i read this particular not this one
 
04:11:52.309 --> 04:11:52.319 align:start position:0%
at the public hearing the ability of an
 
04:11:53.910 --> 04:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
organization to make claims of using
 
04:11:55.910 --> 04:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
green power is contingent upon its
 
04:11:57.750 --> 04:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
ownership of the renewable attributes
 
04:11:59.189 --> 04:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
associated with the electricity it
 
04:12:01.830 --> 04:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
consumes an organization must ensure it
 
04:12:04.950 --> 04:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
possesses exclusive and full rights to
 
04:12:07.349 --> 04:12:07.359 align:start position:0%
the wrecks or renewable attributes
 
04:12:09.269 --> 04:12:09.279 align:start position:0%
associated with its electricity
 
04:12:12.149 --> 04:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
consumption to make environmental claims
 
04:12:14.790 --> 04:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
this rule applies in all cases whether
 
04:12:16.870 --> 04:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
the organization owns the renewable
 
04:12:19.269 --> 04:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
system or is purchasing the green power
 
04:12:21.349 --> 04:12:21.359 align:start position:0%
from a third party and that comes from
 
04:12:23.429 --> 04:12:23.439 align:start position:0%
the us department of energy's guide to
 
04:12:25.670 --> 04:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
purchasing green power
 
04:12:27.510 --> 04:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
i read to you at the public hearing
 
04:12:29.830 --> 04:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
about the toy manufacturer i'll just
 
04:12:31.670 --> 04:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
read the bolded section
 
04:12:33.910 --> 04:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
even if the manufacturer uses the
 
04:12:36.149 --> 04:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
electricity generated by the solar
 
04:12:38.469 --> 04:12:38.479 align:start position:0%
panels on the factory it has by selling
 
04:12:39.590 --> 04:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
the wrecks
 
04:12:41.429 --> 04:12:41.439 align:start position:0%
transferred the right to characterize
 
04:12:43.670 --> 04:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
that electricity as renewable
 
04:12:45.910 --> 04:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
the manufacturer's claim is therefore
 
04:12:45.920 --> 04:12:47.510 align:start position:0%
the manufacturer's claim is therefore
deceptive

04:12:47.510 --> 04:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
deceptive
 
04:12:49.990 --> 04:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
and by ftc guidelines you could be
 
04:12:52.309 --> 04:12:52.319 align:start position:0%
charged ten thousand dollars a day
 
04:12:54.630 --> 04:12:54.640 align:start position:0%
for this violation
 
04:12:57.110 --> 04:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
ras exist even in the absence of wrecks
 
04:12:58.790 --> 04:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
this is where it gets a little bit
 
04:13:01.349 --> 04:13:01.359 align:start position:0%
tougher as federal and state courts have
 
04:13:03.750 --> 04:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
recognized ras are created whenever
 
04:13:06.469 --> 04:13:06.479 align:start position:0%
renewable energy is generated and they
 
04:13:09.110 --> 04:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
existed before wrecks were invented to
 
04:13:10.790 --> 04:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
represent them
 
04:13:12.309 --> 04:13:12.319 align:start position:0%
this is a quote from the connecticut
 
04:13:14.870 --> 04:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
supreme court the renewable attribute of
 
04:13:17.189 --> 04:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
the energy generated by renewable energy
 
04:13:20.309 --> 04:13:20.319 align:start position:0%
sources is an inherent attribute of the
 
04:13:22.950 --> 04:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
energy and therefore the creation and
 
04:13:26.070 --> 04:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
state recognition of rex did not result
 
04:13:28.870 --> 04:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
in an entirely new commodity but in the
 
04:13:32.389 --> 04:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
splitting of a pre-existing commodity
 
04:13:34.309 --> 04:13:34.319 align:start position:0%
new hampshire statutory law also
 
04:13:36.229 --> 04:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
recognizes that renewable attributes
 
04:13:39.429 --> 04:13:39.439 align:start position:0%
exist in the absence of wrecks guidance
 
04:13:41.030 --> 04:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
documents from the u.s department of
 
04:13:43.429 --> 04:13:43.439 align:start position:0%
energy and the epa expressly recognize
 
04:13:45.510 --> 04:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
that renewable attribute property
 
04:13:48.550 --> 04:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
interests exist regardless of whether
 
04:13:51.750 --> 04:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
wrecks are issued the pucs in multiple
 
04:13:54.469 --> 04:13:54.479 align:start position:0%
new england states recognize this fact
 
04:13:56.229 --> 04:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
and i'll just take you very briefly
 
04:13:57.670 --> 04:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
through a little bit of new hampshire's
 
04:13:59.830 --> 04:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
statutory law
 
04:14:02.630 --> 04:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
rsa 374 f 3 v
 
04:14:04.790 --> 04:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
f establishes that property interest and
 
04:14:07.269 --> 04:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
renewable attributes exist regardless of
 
04:14:09.910 --> 04:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
whether they are represented by rex
 
04:14:12.070 --> 04:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
it does so specifically providing for
 
04:14:14.229 --> 04:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
the voluntary buying and selling of

renewable energy source attributes

these are produced by generators that

04:14:47.429 --> 04:14:47.439 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether they are
 
04:14:51.189 --> 04:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
represented by rex or not
 
04:14:53.269 --> 04:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
04:14:55.429 --> 04:14:55.439 align:start position:0%
and the federal guidance here even if
 
04:14:57.030 --> 04:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy project is not
 
04:14:58.710 --> 04:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
formally registered with and issued
 
04:15:00.229 --> 04:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
wrecks from a regional tracking system
 
04:15:02.309 --> 04:15:02.319 align:start position:0%
the renewable project still generates
 
04:15:05.510 --> 04:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
the renew the environmental attributes
 
04:15:07.990 --> 04:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
these environmental attributes can be
 
04:15:10.229 --> 04:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
sold or transferred to other parties
 
04:15:13.110 --> 04:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
through contractual agreements so
 
04:15:15.349 --> 04:15:15.359 align:start position:0%
you can even buy and sell them
 
04:15:17.349 --> 04:15:17.359 align:start position:0%
without having the legal representation
 
04:15:19.750 --> 04:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
of a wreck they are property you can
 
04:15:21.910 --> 04:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
transfer them by contract
 
04:15:23.830 --> 04:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
if the generator is not registered with
 
04:15:25.349 --> 04:15:25.359 align:start position:0%
a wreck tracking system and therefore
 
04:15:27.189 --> 04:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
wrecks are not formally issued within a
 
04:15:29.110 --> 04:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
tracking system the generator
 
04:15:31.590 --> 04:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
nevertheless creates energy attributes
 
04:15:34.950 --> 04:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
with every megawatt hour generated
 
04:15:36.469 --> 04:15:36.479 align:start position:0%
now it was suggested at the public
 
04:15:38.389 --> 04:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
hearing that oh all you really need to
 
04:15:40.389 --> 04:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
do is register your wrecks if you were
 
04:15:42.469 --> 04:15:42.479 align:start position:0%
only to register your wrecks you would
 
04:15:44.309 --> 04:15:44.319 align:start position:0%
be protected
 
04:15:44.319 --> 04:15:46.870 align:start position:0%
be protected
well

04:15:46.870 --> 04:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:15:50.469 --> 04:15:50.479 align:start position:0%
i'll try to make this simple and clear
 
04:15:52.469 --> 04:15:52.479 align:start position:0%
rex represent and convey the property
 
04:15:52.479 --> 04:15:53.670 align:start position:0%
rex represent and convey the property
interest

04:15:53.670 --> 04:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
interest
 
04:15:55.349 --> 04:15:55.359 align:start position:0%
the renewable attribute property
 
04:15:57.670 --> 04:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
interest exists regardless of whether or
 
04:16:00.309 --> 04:16:00.319 align:start position:0%
not they are represented by rex so when
 
04:16:03.269 --> 04:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
customer generators register for
 
04:16:05.349 --> 04:16:05.359 align:start position:0%
and are issued wrecks they're not
 
04:16:07.590 --> 04:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
claiming any new property they're merely
 
04:16:10.630 --> 04:16:10.640 align:start position:0%
completing a process of registering
 
04:16:12.950 --> 04:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
something they already own
 
04:16:15.510 --> 04:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
in order to qualify it for sale in the
 
04:16:17.750 --> 04:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
rps compliance market
 
04:16:19.990 --> 04:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
now you can say well why not just
 
04:16:20.000 --> 04:16:21.110 align:start position:0%
now you can say well why not just
register

04:16:21.110 --> 04:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
register
 
04:16:24.469 --> 04:16:24.479 align:start position:0%
it's expensive it's time consuming it's
 
04:16:26.950 --> 04:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
an intrusion on your privacy and it's
 
04:16:29.670 --> 04:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
burdensome where in the world do we
 
04:16:32.630 --> 04:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
require anyone to do such a thing just
 
04:16:34.790 --> 04:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
to protect their property from being
 
04:16:37.750 --> 04:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
seized and used by others
 
04:16:37.760 --> 04:16:38.550 align:start position:0%
seized and used by others
so

04:16:38.550 --> 04:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:16:40.229 --> 04:16:40.239 align:start position:0%
registering to have your ras be
 
04:16:42.149 --> 04:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
represented by rex can cost about two
 
04:16:43.429 --> 04:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for the typical
 
04:16:45.030 --> 04:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
customer generator who's already
 
04:16:47.429 --> 04:16:47.439 align:start position:0%
interconnected before you can even
 
04:16:49.510 --> 04:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
submit an application for wreck
 
04:16:51.269 --> 04:16:51.279 align:start position:0%
registration you have to install a
 
04:16:53.349 --> 04:16:53.359 align:start position:0%
specialized production meter you have to
 
04:16:55.269 --> 04:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
hire an independent monitor and over
 
04:16:57.030 --> 04:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
time that can cost over a thousand
 
04:16:57.040 --> 04:16:58.070 align:start position:0%
time that can cost over a thousand
dollars

04:16:58.070 --> 04:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:17:00.070 --> 04:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
installing the production meter requires
 
04:17:01.830 --> 04:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
hiring an electrician to install a
 
04:17:03.510 --> 04:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
specialized electrical socket for the
 
04:17:05.429 --> 04:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
production meter that you are not even
 
04:17:07.189 --> 04:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
going to use
 
04:17:08.870 --> 04:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
then purchasing and having the actual
 
04:17:10.870 --> 04:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
meter installed for another six hundred
 
04:17:12.550 --> 04:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
dollars for something you're not even
 
04:17:14.149 --> 04:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
going to use
 
04:17:15.990 --> 04:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
customer generators can only submit an
 
04:17:18.149 --> 04:17:18.159 align:start position:0%
application for rec registration after
 
04:17:20.309 --> 04:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
they complete all of these steps the
 
04:17:22.389 --> 04:17:22.399 align:start position:0%
application requires voluminous amounts
 
04:17:24.309 --> 04:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
of personal and technical information
 
04:17:27.830 --> 04:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
plus six or more supplemental documents
 
04:17:32.630 --> 04:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:34.070 --> 04:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
no because some people aren't following
 
04:17:36.469 --> 04:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
up just let them know what page so they
 
04:17:43.389 --> 04:17:43.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:46.149 --> 04:17:46.159 align:start position:0%
rsa362f62a enables electricity providers
 
04:17:48.790 --> 04:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
to meet some of their rps obligations by
 
04:17:51.910 --> 04:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
using the renewable attributes of
 
04:17:55.030 --> 04:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
customer generators who did not undergo
 
04:17:57.269 --> 04:17:57.279 align:start position:0%
the time consuming and expensive process
 
04:17:59.830 --> 04:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
required for wreck registration we call
 
04:18:02.870 --> 04:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
this practice wreck sweeping it's really
 
04:18:05.429 --> 04:18:05.439 align:start position:0%
renewable attribute sweeping but
 
04:18:07.429 --> 04:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
it's known as rec sweeping
 
04:18:09.349 --> 04:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
more specifically the state seizes
 
04:18:10.950 --> 04:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
renewable attributes from customer
 
04:18:13.189 --> 04:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
generators and lets electricity
 
04:18:14.790 --> 04:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
providers claim
 
04:18:16.550 --> 04:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
wreck credits
 
04:18:19.030 --> 04:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
that represent a share of these seized
 
04:18:21.910 --> 04:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
or swept renewable attributes
 
04:18:23.830 --> 04:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
electricity providers can then use the
 
04:18:25.830 --> 04:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
rec credits that represent these swept
 
04:18:29.990 --> 04:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
renewable attributes for rps compliance
 
04:18:31.510 --> 04:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
what's the problem
 
04:18:34.229 --> 04:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
this constitutes a wholesale denial of
 
04:18:36.710 --> 04:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
customer generators right to exclude
 
04:18:39.269 --> 04:18:39.279 align:start position:0%
electricity providers from the use of
 
04:18:41.750 --> 04:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
their renewable attributes
 
04:18:43.510 --> 04:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
customer generators subject direct
 
04:18:45.670 --> 04:18:45.680 align:start position:0%
sweeping lack the exclusive rights to
 
04:18:48.229 --> 04:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
their renewable attributes which renders

them
 
04:18:51.189 --> 04:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
which renders their generation
 
04:18:54.229 --> 04:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
null electricity under federal guidance
 
04:18:56.309 --> 04:18:56.319 align:start position:0%
you can't have the electricity providers
 
04:18:59.269 --> 04:18:59.279 align:start position:0%
claim to use the renewable attributes
 
04:19:01.110 --> 04:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
and still retain the renewable
 
04:19:03.590 --> 04:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
attributes that would be double counting
 
04:19:06.630 --> 04:19:06.640 align:start position:0%

wreck sweeping is a taking

rec sweeping deprives customer
 
04:20:27.590 --> 04:20:27.600 align:start position:0%

to exclude electricity providers from
 
04:20:35.189 --> 04:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
using their renewable attributes such a
 
04:20:36.870 --> 04:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
material abridgement of both the right
 
04:20:39.110 --> 04:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
to use and exclude
 
04:20:42.630 --> 04:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
constitutes a taking and this quote is
 
04:20:45.189 --> 04:20:45.199 align:start position:0%

04:20:54.149 --> 04:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
this was handed down in 1981.
 
04:20:56.550 --> 04:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
the property owner's right of indefinite

modern parlance
 
04:21:03.349 --> 04:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily includes the right to
 
04:21:05.750 --> 04:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
exclude others from using the property
 
04:21:08.630 --> 04:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
whether it be in land or anything else
 
04:21:10.790 --> 04:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
from the very nature of these rights of
 
04:21:13.750 --> 04:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
user and of exclusion it is evident that
 
04:21:15.830 --> 04:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
they cannot be materially abridged
 
04:21:19.189 --> 04:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
without ipso facto taking the owner's

04:21:20.790 --> 04:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
property
 
04:21:23.670 --> 04:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
by taking i'm sorry moving on to
 
04:21:25.670 --> 04:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
slide 22 by taking the renewable
 
04:21:27.910 --> 04:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
attributes rec sweeping takes the
 
04:21:30.309 --> 04:21:30.319 align:start position:0%
renewable energy recall from the very
 
04:21:32.550 --> 04:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
beginning the definition of renewable
 
04:21:35.910 --> 04:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
energy is any energy that is bundled
 
04:21:38.309 --> 04:21:38.319 align:start position:0%
with the renewable attributes
 
04:21:40.389 --> 04:21:40.399 align:start position:0%
when you strip the renewable attributes
 
04:21:42.790 --> 04:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
from the customer generators electricity
 
04:21:46.070 --> 04:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
you render it null electricity
 
04:21:48.389 --> 04:21:48.399 align:start position:0%
rec sweeping thus deprives the affected
 
04:21:50.229 --> 04:21:50.239 align:start position:0%
customer generator of the renewable
 
04:21:53.990 --> 04:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
energy that they generate and own
 
04:21:55.830 --> 04:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
consumers have an additional interest in
 
04:21:57.429 --> 04:21:57.439 align:start position:0%
preventing their renewable attributes
 
04:22:00.149 --> 04:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
from being used for rps compliance
 
04:22:02.389 --> 04:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
many consumers choose to purchase or
 
04:22:04.070 --> 04:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
generate their own renewable energy
 
04:22:06.229 --> 04:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
because they want to increase overall
 
04:22:09.110 --> 04:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
renewable energy generation beyond the
 
04:22:11.590 --> 04:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
minimal levels set by the state's rps
 
04:22:11.600 --> 04:22:12.950 align:start position:0%
minimal levels set by the state's rps
statute

04:22:12.950 --> 04:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:22:15.269 --> 04:22:15.279 align:start position:0%
ensuring such additionality requires
 
04:22:17.510 --> 04:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
preventing electricity providers from
 
04:22:20.630 --> 04:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
using the ras that others generate and
 
04:22:20.640 --> 04:22:21.510 align:start position:0%
using the ras that others generate and
own

04:22:21.510 --> 04:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
own
 
04:22:24.070 --> 04:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
for their rps compliance
 
04:22:26.550 --> 04:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
many customer generators intentionally
 
04:22:29.670 --> 04:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
choose not to register for and sell recs
 
04:22:31.750 --> 04:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
in an effort to ensure that their
 
04:22:33.750 --> 04:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
renewable attributes are not in fact
 
04:22:37.189 --> 04:22:37.199 align:start position:0%
used for renewable portfolios compliance
 
04:22:38.950 --> 04:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
for this very reason
 
04:22:40.950 --> 04:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
both the federal and new hampshire law
 
04:22:43.269 --> 04:22:43.279 align:start position:0%
recognize that those who want to be
 
04:22:46.070 --> 04:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
voluntary renewable energy consumers
 
04:22:49.110 --> 04:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
have what is called a consumer interest
 
04:22:51.030 --> 04:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
beyond the property interest they have a
 
04:22:54.469 --> 04:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
consumer interest in doing so
 
04:22:57.030 --> 04:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
a couple quick quotes when consumers
 
04:22:58.550 --> 04:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
choose to purchase or produce green
 
04:23:00.469 --> 04:23:00.479 align:start position:0%
power above and beyond what is required
 
04:23:02.229 --> 04:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
or otherwise available they do so
 
04:23:03.750 --> 04:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
because they want to make a difference
 
04:23:05.189 --> 04:23:05.199 align:start position:0%
that goes beyond what would have
 
04:23:08.630 --> 04:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
otherwise occurred through a mandate or
 
04:23:10.630 --> 04:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
as part of business as usual that's from
 
04:23:12.389 --> 04:23:12.399 align:start position:0%
the doe's guide to purchasing green
 
04:23:12.399 --> 04:23:13.429 align:start position:0%
the doe's guide to purchasing green
power

04:23:13.429 --> 04:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
power
 
04:23:15.910 --> 04:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
consequently quote a long-standing
 
04:23:18.149 --> 04:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
consumer requirement of the voluntary
 
04:23:20.870 --> 04:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
market is that individual investments in
 
04:23:23.429 --> 04:23:23.439 align:start position:0%
and use of green power do not go towards
 
04:23:25.750 --> 04:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
supporting a mandate that would have
 
04:23:28.710 --> 04:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
otherwise occurred absent the voluntary
 
04:23:32.309 --> 04:23:32.319 align:start position:0%
consumers proactive use of green power
 
04:23:34.070 --> 04:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
so the point here is
 
04:23:36.389 --> 04:23:36.399 align:start position:0%
not only do renewable energy generators
 
04:23:39.189 --> 04:23:39.199 align:start position:0%
because customer generators want to use
 
04:23:41.590 --> 04:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
their own renewable energy they want to
 
04:23:44.790 --> 04:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
add to the total amount of renewable
 
04:23:47.830 --> 04:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:49.910 --> 04:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire law expressly recognizes
 
04:23:51.670 --> 04:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
this consumer interest
 
04:23:53.830 --> 04:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
a utility shall provide to its customers
 
04:23:55.910 --> 04:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
one or more renewable energy source
 
04:23:58.149 --> 04:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
options as approved by the commission
 
04:24:00.710 --> 04:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
which may include res default service
 
04:24:03.189 --> 04:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
provided by the utility or the provision
 
04:24:05.269 --> 04:24:05.279 align:start position:0%
of retail access to competitive sellers
 
04:24:07.429 --> 04:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
of res attributes
 
04:24:09.349 --> 04:24:09.359 align:start position:0%
for purposes of consumer protection and
 
04:24:11.189 --> 04:24:11.199 align:start position:0%
the maintenance of program integrity
 
04:24:12.790 --> 04:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
reasonable efforts should be made to
 
04:24:14.950 --> 04:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
assure that the renewable energy source
 
04:24:17.830 --> 04:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
component of an res option is not
 
04:24:22.070 --> 04:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
separately advertised claimed or sold as
 
04:24:24.309 --> 04:24:24.319 align:start position:0%
part of any other electricity service or
 
04:24:24.319 --> 04:24:25.670 align:start position:0%
part of any other electricity service or
transaction

04:24:25.670 --> 04:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
transaction
 
04:24:27.750 --> 04:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
including compliance with the renewable
 
04:24:30.870 --> 04:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard
 
04:24:34.550 --> 04:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:37.189 --> 04:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
it's been suggested that ref renewable
 
04:24:38.389 --> 04:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
energy fund
 
04:24:41.269 --> 04:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
rebates provide just compensation for
 
04:24:43.910 --> 04:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
wreck sweeping this is false
 
04:24:46.149 --> 04:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
there is no link between receiving a
 
04:24:47.910 --> 04:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
rebate and being subject to wreck
 
04:24:47.920 --> 04:24:48.950 align:start position:0%
rebate and being subject to wreck
sweeping

04:24:48.950 --> 04:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
sweeping
 
04:24:51.189 --> 04:24:51.199 align:start position:0%
many customer generators who received a
 
04:24:53.750 --> 04:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
b are not subject to wreck sweeping
 
04:24:56.229 --> 04:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
while many who did not receive a rebate
 
04:24:58.630 --> 04:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
are subject to wreck sweeping
 
04:25:01.269 --> 04:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
just to make this a little clearer
 
04:25:02.870 --> 04:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
approximately three thousand solar
 
04:25:04.950 --> 04:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
customer generators who did receive a
 
04:25:06.630 --> 04:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
rebate were not subject to wreck
 
04:25:09.750 --> 04:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
sweeping as of 2020 and approximately a
 
04:25:11.910 --> 04:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
thousand solar customer generators who
 
04:25:14.389 --> 04:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
did not receive a rebate were subject
 
04:25:17.189 --> 04:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
direct sweeping the rps statute provides
 
04:25:20.070 --> 04:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
that those who receive an raf rebate
 
04:25:22.790 --> 04:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
retain any wrecks they are issued and
 
04:25:26.550 --> 04:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
thus ownership of the ras they represent
 
04:25:28.229 --> 04:25:28.239 align:start position:0%
customer generators who received a
 
04:25:30.229 --> 04:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
rebate and then register and sell their
 
04:25:32.870 --> 04:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
ras as rex appropriately receive
 
04:25:35.030 --> 04:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
additional money for doing so
 
04:25:37.269 --> 04:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
but the customer generator who is swept
 
04:25:38.950 --> 04:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
receives nothing
 
04:25:41.910 --> 04:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
no compensation
 
04:25:43.590 --> 04:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
net metering does not provide just
 
04:25:46.149 --> 04:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
compensation for rec sweeping these are
 
04:25:49.189 --> 04:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
two separate programs net metering only
 
04:25:51.110 --> 04:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
compensates customer generators for
 
04:25:53.189 --> 04:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
their exported
 
04:25:56.309 --> 04:25:56.319 align:start position:0%
electricity the addition after they use
 
04:25:58.229 --> 04:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
what as much as they need of their own
 
04:25:58.239 --> 04:25:59.349 align:start position:0%
what as much as they need of their own
generation

04:25:59.349 --> 04:25:59.359 align:start position:0%
generation
 
04:26:01.590 --> 04:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
whereas rec sweeping strips the
 
04:26:03.910 --> 04:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
renewable attributes from all the
 
04:26:05.990 --> 04:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
electricity that customer generators
 
04:26:06.000 --> 04:26:07.349 align:start position:0%
electricity that customer generators
generate

04:26:07.349 --> 04:26:07.359 align:start position:0%
generate
 
04:26:09.189 --> 04:26:09.199 align:start position:0%
including what they consume behind the
 
04:26:09.199 --> 04:26:10.149 align:start position:0%
including what they consume behind the
meter

04:26:10.149 --> 04:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
meter
 
04:26:12.790 --> 04:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
this is because it's a
 
04:26:15.189 --> 04:26:15.199 align:start position:0%
a mathematical formula you take the size
 
04:26:16.469 --> 04:26:16.479 align:start position:0%
of the array
 
04:26:20.870 --> 04:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
you multiply it by the comp um
 
04:26:22.229 --> 04:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
the the factor
 
04:26:24.550 --> 04:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
helped me out michael the
 
04:26:26.870 --> 04:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
capacity factor the capacity factor
 
04:26:29.830 --> 04:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
thank you and so it's the size times the
 
04:26:31.510 --> 04:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
capacity factor times the number of
 
04:26:35.670 --> 04:26:35.680 align:start position:0%
hours in the year so it's everything
 
04:26:38.469 --> 04:26:38.479 align:start position:0%
that your system is capable of producing
 
04:26:40.389 --> 04:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
if it spent six months under a blanket
 
04:26:42.469 --> 04:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
of snow and didn't produce anything
 
04:26:45.110 --> 04:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
renewable attributes are attributed to
 
04:26:47.189 --> 04:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
electricity providers even in the
 
04:26:47.199 --> 04:26:49.110 align:start position:0%
electricity providers even in the
absence

04:26:49.110 --> 04:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
absence
 
04:26:52.710 --> 04:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
it's a remarkable system
 
04:26:54.550 --> 04:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
customer generators who are not subject
 
04:26:56.630 --> 04:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
direct sweeping can retain or sell their
 
04:26:58.309 --> 04:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
renewable attributes for additional
 
04:26:59.910 --> 04:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
money while those subject direct
 
04:27:02.309 --> 04:27:02.319 align:start position:0%
sweeping cannot
 
04:27:03.830 --> 04:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
and this may be one of the most
 
04:27:05.910 --> 04:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
important points of all roughly half of
 
04:27:08.149 --> 04:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
all the swept renewable attributes are
 
04:27:11.030 --> 04:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
not going to utilities they are have no
 
04:27:13.030 --> 04:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
effect on rate payers
 
04:27:15.030 --> 04:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
much less actually
 
04:27:17.349 --> 04:27:17.359 align:start position:0%
reducing what they pay
 
04:27:17.359 --> 04:27:18.309 align:start position:0%
reducing what they pay
because

04:27:18.309 --> 04:27:18.319 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:27:21.030 --> 04:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
roughly half 48 percent
 
04:27:22.870 --> 04:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
our electricity providers are big
 
04:27:24.389 --> 04:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
multinational corporations like
 
04:27:27.830 --> 04:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
constellation energy and direct energy
 
04:27:30.229 --> 04:27:30.239 align:start position:0%
so the state is seizing the property of
 
04:27:32.309 --> 04:27:32.319 align:start position:0%
new hampshire citizens and it is
 
04:27:35.590 --> 04:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
allocating that benefit to big out of
 
04:27:35.600 --> 04:27:36.630 align:start position:0%
allocating that benefit to big out of
state

04:27:36.630 --> 04:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:27:39.189 --> 04:27:39.199 align:start position:0%
multinational corporations who then can
 
04:27:40.870 --> 04:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
do whatever they want with the money
 
04:27:42.630 --> 04:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
they save because they don't have to pay
 
04:27:42.640 --> 04:27:44.550 align:start position:0%
they save because they don't have to pay
renewable

04:27:44.550 --> 04:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
renewable
 
04:27:46.550 --> 04:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
compliance payments they can give it to
 
04:27:50.550 --> 04:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
their shareholders they can reinvest it
 
04:27:52.710 --> 04:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
uh swept aris are not abandoned property
 
04:27:55.670 --> 04:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
we covered that at the public hearing
 
04:27:57.750 --> 04:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
allocation of swept areas to competitive
 
04:28:00.469 --> 04:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
suppliers i just covered that
 
04:28:02.550 --> 04:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
so we really are coming to the end
 
04:28:05.030 --> 04:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
pennies for the typical rate payer
 
04:28:07.510 --> 04:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
because 52 percent does go to the
 
04:28:07.520 --> 04:28:09.349 align:start position:0%
because 52 percent does go to the
utilities

04:28:09.349 --> 04:28:09.359 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
04:28:09.359 --> 04:28:10.630 align:start position:0%
utilities
pennies

04:28:10.630 --> 04:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
pennies
 
04:28:12.950 --> 04:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
and millions of dollars for corporations
 
04:28:15.590 --> 04:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
as the result of state action in seizing
 
04:28:17.830 --> 04:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
the property of new hampshire residents
 
04:28:17.840 --> 04:28:18.550 align:start position:0%
the property of new hampshire residents
and

04:28:18.550 --> 04:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:28:18.560 --> 04:28:19.910 align:start position:0%
and
businesses

04:28:19.910 --> 04:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
04:28:22.070 --> 04:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
rex sweeping possibly saves the typical
 
04:28:24.710 --> 04:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
residential utility rate payer about six
 
04:28:27.030 --> 04:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
cents in a typical month
 
04:28:28.870 --> 04:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
yet rec sweeping saved competitive
 
04:28:31.429 --> 04:28:31.439 align:start position:0%
suppliers many millions of dollars in
 
04:28:35.110 --> 04:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
the period of its existence since 2012.
 
04:28:36.630 --> 04:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
as i said constellation energy and
 
04:28:38.309 --> 04:28:38.319 align:start position:0%
direct energy are subsidiaries of
 
04:28:39.670 --> 04:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
out-of-state multi-billion dollar
 
04:28:41.990 --> 04:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
corporations so the most significant
 
04:28:44.469 --> 04:28:44.479 align:start position:0%
economic effect of rec sweeping has been
 
04:28:46.149 --> 04:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
to transfer millions of dollars of
 
04:28:47.830 --> 04:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
wealth from predominantly middle class
 
04:28:50.149 --> 04:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents to out-of-state
 
04:28:52.790 --> 04:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
multi-billion dollar corporations
 
04:28:55.590 --> 04:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
it is an unconstitutional policy that
 
04:28:58.469 --> 04:28:58.479 align:start position:0%
has enriched those corporations
 
04:29:01.429 --> 04:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
and at the expense of our residents that
 
04:29:04.309 --> 04:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
we are here to protect without
 
04:29:04.319 --> 04:29:05.670 align:start position:0%
we are here to protect without
compensation

04:29:05.670 --> 04:29:05.680 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
04:29:07.670 --> 04:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
and without notice
 
04:29:09.189 --> 04:29:09.199 align:start position:0%
wreck sweeping prohibits affected
 
04:29:11.429 --> 04:29:11.439 align:start position:0%
customer generators from using their own
 
04:29:13.990 --> 04:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
property for their own intended purposes
 
04:29:16.710 --> 04:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
whether that is to simply be able to
 
04:29:19.189 --> 04:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
generate and use renewable energy or if
 
04:29:21.750 --> 04:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
it is to create additional renewable
 
04:29:24.469 --> 04:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
energy in the state beyond the minimal
 
04:29:24.479 --> 04:29:26.070 align:start position:0%

04:29:26.070 --> 04:29:26.080 align:start position:0%

04:29:27.910 --> 04:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
rec sweeping bars
 
04:29:30.070 --> 04:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
residents and our businesses from

claiming to use the renewable energy
 
04:29:34.710 --> 04:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
they produce even if they use a hundred
 
04:29:36.630 --> 04:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
percent of the corresponding physical
 
04:29:38.550 --> 04:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
electricity themselves
 
04:29:41.269 --> 04:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
on pain of criminal prosecution
 
04:29:43.830 --> 04:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
please support overturning this
 
04:29:43.840 --> 04:29:45.830 align:start position:0%
please support overturning this
provision

04:29:45.830 --> 04:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
provision
 
04:29:51.030 --> 04:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:52.870 --> 04:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
thank you do we have questions for uh
 
04:29:54.710 --> 04:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
representative oxen and representative
 
04:29:57.030 --> 04:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
platt yes and i'll let you covered what
 
04:29:59.510 --> 04:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
did you cover that was not in your in
 
04:30:01.110 --> 04:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
the public hearing because i thought you
 
04:30:08.790 --> 04:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:11.429 --> 04:30:11.439 align:start position:0%
that in particular i was asked and the
 
04:30:13.510 --> 04:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
department of energy sent an email and
 
04:30:15.750 --> 04:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
said that they wanted specifics of the
 
04:30:15.760 --> 04:30:17.349 align:start position:0%
said that they wanted specifics of the
rsas

04:30:17.349 --> 04:30:17.359 align:start position:0%
rsas
 
04:30:17.359 --> 04:30:18.710 align:start position:0%
rsas
that

04:30:18.710 --> 04:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:30:21.349 --> 04:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
actually backed up what i was saying so
 
04:30:23.910 --> 04:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
the material that i have presented today
 
04:30:26.229 --> 04:30:26.239 align:start position:0%
is to demonstrate
 
04:30:30.149 --> 04:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
that in law and in guidance and in the
 
04:30:32.790 --> 04:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
conduct of pucs
 
04:30:36.149 --> 04:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
renewable attributes are treated as what
 
04:30:39.510 --> 04:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
they are legally they are property and
 
04:30:41.189 --> 04:30:41.199 align:start position:0%
if that property
 
04:30:42.790 --> 04:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
is taken
 
04:30:45.670 --> 04:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
without notice and without compensation
 
04:30:48.070 --> 04:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
that is a taking
 
04:30:48.080 --> 04:30:50.149 align:start position:0%
that is a taking
it's

04:30:50.149 --> 04:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:30:53.590 --> 04:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:01.590 --> 04:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:01.600 --> 04:31:04.630 align:start position:0%
 
11

04:31:04.630 --> 04:31:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:07.429 --> 04:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
and 14
 
04:31:07.439 --> 04:31:10.630 align:start position:0%
and 14
these

04:31:10.630 --> 04:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:10.640 --> 04:31:12.870 align:start position:0%
 
phrases

04:31:12.870 --> 04:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
phrases
 
04:31:16.469 --> 04:31:16.479 align:start position:0%
appear on on page or slide 11
 
04:31:19.269 --> 04:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
inherent attribute and then on slide
 
04:31:19.279 --> 04:31:20.469 align:start position:0%
inherent attribute and then on slide
14

04:31:20.469 --> 04:31:20.479 align:start position:0%
14
 
04:31:22.710 --> 04:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
environmental attribute
 
04:31:25.510 --> 04:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
and then below that energy attribute
 
04:31:27.510 --> 04:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
what are the differences between those
 
04:31:29.590 --> 04:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
attributes thank you very much for the
 
04:31:32.149 --> 04:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
question there's no difference and it's
 
04:31:35.510 --> 04:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
it's a a real problem uh that these
 
04:31:37.990 --> 04:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
different terms are used for the exact
 
04:31:39.349 --> 04:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
same thing
 
04:31:41.269 --> 04:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
and in some of the guidance they'll
 
04:31:43.510 --> 04:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
actually even use rex and renewable
 
04:31:46.550 --> 04:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
attributes as meaning the same thing
 
04:31:48.309 --> 04:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
which gives a false impression if you
 
04:31:51.030 --> 04:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
read the entire document it's clear that
 
04:31:53.750 --> 04:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
they distinguish between the two but
 
04:31:56.149 --> 04:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
every once in a while they'll use the
 
04:31:57.429 --> 04:31:57.439 align:start position:0%
wrong term
 
04:31:57.439 --> 04:31:59.269 align:start position:0%
wrong term
and

04:31:59.269 --> 04:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:31:59.279 --> 04:32:01.429 align:start position:0%
and
yeah

04:32:01.429 --> 04:32:01.439 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:32:03.590 --> 04:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you follow-up question
 
04:32:07.429 --> 04:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
on slide 20.
 
04:32:09.830 --> 04:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
the next to the last bullet says that a
 
04:32:13.349 --> 04:32:13.359 align:start position:0%
business entity that does so meaning
 
04:32:14.790 --> 04:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
wreck sweeping
 
04:32:17.590 --> 04:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
is guilty of a felony
 
04:32:19.830 --> 04:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
has the new hampshire attorney general
 
04:32:22.070 --> 04:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
arrested any of the
 
04:32:23.830 --> 04:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
state's utilities for committing these
 
04:32:23.840 --> 04:32:25.510 align:start position:0%
state's utilities for committing these
felonies

04:32:25.510 --> 04:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
felonies
 
04:32:28.630 --> 04:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
the felony would be the business owner
 
04:32:32.309 --> 04:32:32.319 align:start position:0%
who claims to use renewable energy
 
04:32:35.030 --> 04:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
and makes that claim in a commercial so
 
04:32:35.040 --> 04:32:36.389 align:start position:0%
and makes that claim in a commercial so
advertising

04:32:36.389 --> 04:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
advertising
 
04:32:39.269 --> 04:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
or in the sale of their premises
 
04:32:42.149 --> 04:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
that claim is a deceptive practice by
 
04:32:44.710 --> 04:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
the ftc and it has been incorporated
 
04:32:47.590 --> 04:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
into the statutes here in the state
 
04:32:51.030 --> 04:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
such that you are liable to this uh
 
04:32:52.870 --> 04:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
penalty of ten thousand dollars a day if
 
04:32:54.469 --> 04:32:54.479 align:start position:0%
you're a business
 
04:32:56.790 --> 04:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
and it's simply a misdemeanor if you are
 
04:32:56.800 --> 04:32:57.510 align:start position:0%
and it's simply a misdemeanor if you are
a

04:32:57.510 --> 04:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:32:59.910 --> 04:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
an individual or a household
 
04:33:02.389 --> 04:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
but to my knowledge it has not been
 
04:33:02.399 --> 04:33:03.830 align:start position:0%
but to my knowledge it has not been
utilized

04:33:03.830 --> 04:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
utilized
 
04:33:05.990 --> 04:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:33:08.390 --> 04:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
the the reason to point it out is not
 
04:33:11.269 --> 04:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
because i think it should be
 
04:33:14.390 --> 04:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
penalized but to demonstrate the fact
 
04:33:17.029 --> 04:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
that this is a
 
04:33:18.949 --> 04:33:18.959 align:start position:0%
practice which is
 
04:33:21.830 --> 04:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
putting our citizens and businesses in
 
04:33:21.840 --> 04:33:23.189 align:start position:0%
putting our citizens and businesses in
jeopardy

04:33:23.189 --> 04:33:23.199 align:start position:0%
jeopardy
 
04:33:26.789 --> 04:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
of violation of law
 
04:33:29.590 --> 04:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
so as a third follow-up are you saying
 
04:33:32.551 --> 04:33:32.561 align:start position:0%
that rec sweeping is not a criminal
 
04:33:32.561 --> 04:33:33.830 align:start position:0%
that rec sweeping is not a criminal
activity

04:33:33.830 --> 04:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
activity
 
04:33:35.910 --> 04:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
wreck sweeping itself is a pernicious
 
04:33:37.990 --> 04:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
practice but not criminal
 
04:33:40.709 --> 04:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further questions for
 
04:33:42.869 --> 04:33:42.879 align:start position:0%
representative oxen i'm representative
 
04:33:45.510 --> 04:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
mcgee thank you mr chairman
 
04:33:47.990 --> 04:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
this says that effective data that shall
 
04:33:50.230 --> 04:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
take effect upon its passage and i was
 
04:33:53.029 --> 04:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
just wondering if there is
 
04:33:55.349 --> 04:33:55.359 align:start position:0%
if this action is taken which changes a
 
04:33:57.510 --> 04:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
process that's currently
 
04:33:58.869 --> 04:33:58.879 align:start position:0%
the way things work
 
04:34:00.949 --> 04:34:00.959 align:start position:0%
whether there would be any
 
04:34:02.789 --> 04:34:02.799 align:start position:0%
administrative changes that would need
 
04:34:06.310 --> 04:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
to happen in order for that to be
 
04:34:10.949 --> 04:34:10.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:14.470 --> 04:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
i i'll ask representative harrington to
 
04:34:15.990 --> 04:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
i don't think we have
 
04:34:17.910 --> 04:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
would you have a doe person in in the
 
04:34:20.390 --> 04:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
room it's my understanding that the way
 
04:34:22.709 --> 04:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
rex sweeping's done is that it's at the
 
04:34:25.269 --> 04:34:25.279 align:start position:0%
end of a year that it's a retroactive
 
04:34:27.750 --> 04:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
look and then so so what this would do
 
04:34:31.990 --> 04:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
is say don't do this from now on uh so
 
04:34:34.949 --> 04:34:34.959 align:start position:0%
in our place june when when they make
 
04:34:38.310 --> 04:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
this reconciliation so that it would
 
04:34:40.629 --> 04:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
that that would be the effective time so
 
04:34:42.470 --> 04:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
they'd have time to get it
 
04:34:44.709 --> 04:34:44.719 align:start position:0%
you know and to stop doing something is
 
04:34:46.629 --> 04:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't really require much
 
04:34:48.150 --> 04:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
administrative change
 
04:34:50.949 --> 04:34:50.959 align:start position:0%
representative pimentel
 
04:34:53.510 --> 04:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh i guess this is
 
04:34:56.551 --> 04:34:56.561 align:start position:0%
a question about process i'm looking at
 
04:34:59.990 --> 04:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
slide 28 on
 
04:35:00.000 --> 04:35:00.709 align:start position:0%
slide 28 on
the

04:35:00.709 --> 04:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:35:03.029 --> 04:35:03.039 align:start position:0%
net metering does not provide just
 
04:35:03.039 --> 04:35:04.390 align:start position:0%
net metering does not provide just
compensation

04:35:04.390 --> 04:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
04:35:04.400 --> 04:35:07.029 align:start position:0%
compensation
and

04:35:07.029 --> 04:35:07.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:09.590 --> 04:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
it says that the
 
04:35:11.429 --> 04:35:11.439 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:35:13.990 --> 04:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
does the sweeping is that correct it's
 
04:35:16.949 --> 04:35:16.959 align:start position:0%
not the utilities
 
04:35:18.869 --> 04:35:18.879 align:start position:0%
and do they it used to be done by karen
 
04:35:20.709 --> 04:35:20.719 align:start position:0%
crampton at the puc
 
04:35:23.109 --> 04:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
um she's no longer with the state and
 
04:35:25.990 --> 04:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
the puc uh i would believe that has
 
04:35:27.429 --> 04:35:27.439 align:start position:0%
transferred this function to the
 
04:35:29.189 --> 04:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
04:35:31.750 --> 04:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
and a follow-up question does the state
 
04:35:34.629 --> 04:35:34.639 align:start position:0%
then sell these
 
04:35:37.269 --> 04:35:37.279 align:start position:0%
they just give them away they
 
04:35:40.230 --> 04:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
it in effect they credit so
 
04:35:41.670 --> 04:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
where where the utilities and the
 
04:35:44.390 --> 04:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
electricity providers have a compliance
 
04:35:47.349 --> 04:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
obligation if you they take the state
 
04:35:50.789 --> 04:35:50.799 align:start position:0%
says hey you can just we'll we will
 
04:35:53.269 --> 04:35:53.279 align:start position:0%
provide this to you we will seize this
 
04:35:55.910 --> 04:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
and give it to you as a credit
 
04:36:00.310 --> 04:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:02.390 --> 04:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
again it's an intangible property so
 
04:36:04.230 --> 04:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
it's not like anything physical has to
 
04:36:05.670 --> 04:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
happen there are no wrecks that are
 
04:36:07.429 --> 04:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
changing hands
 
04:36:09.670 --> 04:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
so this statute that governs this which
 
04:36:12.551 --> 04:36:12.561 align:start position:0%
is the statute that this
 
04:36:15.510 --> 04:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
amendment would repeal
 
04:36:16.869 --> 04:36:16.879 align:start position:0%
which is
 
04:36:19.189 --> 04:36:19.199 align:start position:0%

04:36:24.150 --> 04:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
says and i quote by february 28th of

04:36:48.551 --> 04:36:48.561 align:start position:0%
each provider may then

at the time of its annual report filing
 
04:36:52.230 --> 04:36:52.240 align:start position:0%

04:36:58.310 --> 04:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
claim a class 1 and a class 2
 
04:37:01.349 --> 04:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
certificate credit equal to the credit
 
04:37:03.349 --> 04:37:03.359 align:start position:0%

04:37:09.189 --> 04:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
to its induced customers for the prior
 
04:37:11.750 --> 04:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
calendar year so that's the mechanism by
 
04:37:11.760 --> 04:37:12.949 align:start position:0%
calendar year so that's the mechanism by
which

04:37:12.949 --> 04:37:12.959 align:start position:0%
which
 
04:37:16.070 --> 04:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
so-called wreck sweeping happens
 
04:37:17.830 --> 04:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
clear as mud
 
04:37:17.840 --> 04:37:20.150 align:start position:0%
clear as mud
and

04:37:20.150 --> 04:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:37:20.160 --> 04:37:21.269 align:start position:0%
and
so

04:37:21.269 --> 04:37:21.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:37:23.029 --> 04:37:23.039 align:start position:0%
it is the department of energy or the
 
04:37:23.039 --> 04:37:24.629 align:start position:0%
it is the department of energy or the
state

04:37:24.629 --> 04:37:24.639 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:37:27.189 --> 04:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
um used to be the poc of course but no
 
04:37:28.869 --> 04:37:28.879 align:start position:0%
it's department of energy
 
04:37:28.879 --> 04:37:30.629 align:start position:0%
it's department of energy
that

04:37:30.629 --> 04:37:30.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:37:34.869 --> 04:37:34.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:37.990 --> 04:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
those percentages and then it allows
 
04:37:40.949 --> 04:37:40.959 align:start position:0%
the providers the utilities
 
04:37:43.029 --> 04:37:43.039 align:start position:0%
either the competitive suppliers or the
 
04:37:46.789 --> 04:37:46.799 align:start position:0%
you the utilities
 
04:37:48.310 --> 04:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
when they make their
 
04:37:51.429 --> 04:37:51.439 align:start position:0%
wreck filings with the department
 
04:37:51.439 --> 04:37:52.551 align:start position:0%
wreck filings with the department
to

04:37:52.551 --> 04:37:52.561 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:37:56.789 --> 04:37:56.799 align:start position:0%
claim class one and class two
 
04:37:58.789 --> 04:37:58.799 align:start position:0%
or sweep if you will
 
04:38:00.470 --> 04:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
class one and class two certificates
 
04:38:03.349 --> 04:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
that are unused or unclaimed so
 
04:38:05.429 --> 04:38:05.439 align:start position:0%
it's um
 
04:38:07.109 --> 04:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
it doesn't allow the sweeping of class
 
04:38:09.510 --> 04:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
three or class four rex just class one
 
04:38:13.349 --> 04:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:16.789 --> 04:38:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:18.789 --> 04:38:18.799 align:start position:0%
yes i'm not i'm unclear in a couple
 
04:38:19.990 --> 04:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
things here
 
04:38:20.000 --> 04:38:21.910 align:start position:0%
things here
um

04:38:21.910 --> 04:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:23.990 --> 04:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
with insufficient racks
 
04:38:25.670 --> 04:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
it means any of these uh
 
04:38:27.670 --> 04:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
producers would
 
04:38:30.310 --> 04:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
have to pay the alternative compliance
 
04:38:30.320 --> 04:38:31.429 align:start position:0%
have to pay the alternative compliance
payment

04:38:31.429 --> 04:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
payment
 
04:38:34.150 --> 04:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:37.590 --> 04:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
if there were insufficient wrecks to buy
 
04:38:39.189 --> 04:38:39.199 align:start position:0%
then they would have to make our
 
04:38:41.590 --> 04:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payments yes if
 
04:38:43.429 --> 04:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
if they still had an unfulfilled
 
04:38:46.150 --> 04:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
compliance obligation but in in the most
 
04:38:48.629 --> 04:38:48.639 align:start position:0%
i think in the most recent year
 
04:38:51.990 --> 04:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
something over 75 percent of all the
 
04:38:54.070 --> 04:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
compliance payments were handled by
 
04:38:56.709 --> 04:38:56.719 align:start position:0%
wreck credits so so
 
04:38:59.269 --> 04:38:59.279 align:start position:0%
and if you don't have to buy it so the
 
04:39:03.109 --> 04:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
market doesn't have that demand
 
04:39:04.869 --> 04:39:04.879 align:start position:0%
there's not the the whole point of
 
04:39:06.789 --> 04:39:06.799 align:start position:0%
having the alternative compliance
 
04:39:08.789 --> 04:39:08.799 align:start position:0%
payment was to put a cap so that price
 
04:39:11.109 --> 04:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
couldn't rise too high well if you don't
 
04:39:13.349 --> 04:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
have demand the price doesn't rise high
 
04:39:15.349 --> 04:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
so nobody needs to make alternative
 
04:39:17.189 --> 04:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
compliance payments which means that the
 
04:39:19.269 --> 04:39:19.279 align:start position:0%
whole rps system which was supposedly
 
04:39:21.670 --> 04:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
going to fund the renewable energy fund
 
04:39:23.670 --> 04:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
through alternative compliance payments
 
04:39:25.750 --> 04:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any money going in
 
04:39:27.269 --> 04:39:27.279 align:start position:0%
that answers my question thank you so
 
04:39:27.279 --> 04:39:29.269 align:start position:0%
that answers my question thank you so
much

04:39:29.269 --> 04:39:29.279 align:start position:0%
much

04:39:35.039 --> 04:39:36.230 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman do you
have

04:39:36.230 --> 04:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:39:39.190 --> 04:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
the actual amount of
 
04:39:41.830 --> 04:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
money that we're talking about that
 
04:39:45.030 --> 04:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:46.708 --> 04:39:46.718 align:start position:0%
sweeping from
 
04:39:50.868 --> 04:39:50.878 align:start position:0%
producers and then giving away
 
04:39:53.270 --> 04:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
to um
 
04:39:55.590 --> 04:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
the uh utilities
 
04:39:58.310 --> 04:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
i i believe the estimate and it's it's
 
04:40:00.708 --> 04:40:00.718 align:start position:0%
an estimate we don't have you know the
 
04:40:03.350 --> 04:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
the information that would be internal
 
04:40:05.110 --> 04:40:05.120 align:start position:0%
to the to the state
 
04:40:05.120 --> 04:40:05.910 align:start position:0%
to the to the state
uh

04:40:05.910 --> 04:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:40:08.470 --> 04:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
on the order of 10 million dollars so it
 
04:40:11.510 --> 04:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
it in in the greater scheme of things no
 
04:40:13.430 --> 04:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
10 million dollars isn't an enormous
 
04:40:15.270 --> 04:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
amount of money but
 
04:40:16.628 --> 04:40:16.638 align:start position:0%
the principle
 
04:40:18.868 --> 04:40:18.878 align:start position:0%
that the state is seizing property and
 
04:40:20.948 --> 04:40:20.958 align:start position:0%
handing it over to corporations to meet
 
04:40:23.670 --> 04:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
their obligations thereby
 
04:40:26.470 --> 04:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
denying the proper functioning of the
 
04:40:30.230 --> 04:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
state's instituted market to create
 
04:40:33.430 --> 04:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
funds to incentivize renewable energy
 
04:40:36.310 --> 04:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
it's i'm sure it wasn't intended to work
 
04:40:39.510 --> 04:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
this way but the result is that this
 
04:40:41.670 --> 04:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
practice harms
 
04:40:45.670 --> 04:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
creates real harm for our constituents
 
04:40:50.310 --> 04:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:52.628 --> 04:40:52.638 align:start position:0%
question if the state creates the
 
04:40:56.230 --> 04:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:56.240 --> 04:40:57.270 align:start position:0%
 
then

04:40:57.270 --> 04:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:40:59.590 --> 04:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
if the state provides
 
04:41:04.948 --> 04:41:04.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:07.190 --> 04:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
does that really harm anybody
 
04:41:10.070 --> 04:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
yes and and under the um fallacious
 
04:41:12.070 --> 04:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
arguments which uh
 
04:41:14.868 --> 04:41:14.878 align:start position:0%
section at the back
 
04:41:14.878 --> 04:41:19.750 align:start position:0%
section at the back
um

04:41:19.750 --> 04:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:19.760 --> 04:41:20.708 align:start position:0%
 
actually

04:41:20.708 --> 04:41:20.718 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:41:22.150 --> 04:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
we probably didn't even put it here
 
04:41:23.590 --> 04:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
because the whole first section was
 
04:41:26.788 --> 04:41:26.798 align:start position:0%
about why it's property
 
04:41:29.270 --> 04:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
renewable attributes are created when
 
04:41:31.830 --> 04:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
you generate electricity every time you
 
04:41:34.470 --> 04:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
generate a megawatt hour of energy you
 
04:41:34.480 --> 04:41:35.670 align:start position:0%
generate a megawatt hour of energy you
create

04:41:35.670 --> 04:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
create
 
04:41:39.190 --> 04:41:39.200 align:start position:0%
one the the attributes of one megawatt
 
04:41:41.430 --> 04:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
hour this this was the whole
 
04:41:42.868 --> 04:41:42.878 align:start position:0%
i shouldn't i shouldn't try to talk off
 
04:41:44.310 --> 04:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
the top of my head it's the reason i
 
04:41:46.550 --> 04:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
have it written down so that i
 
04:41:49.030 --> 04:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
don't trip over my 26
 
04:41:49.040 --> 04:41:50.990 align:start position:0%
don't trip over my 26
page

04:41:50.990 --> 04:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
page
 
04:41:54.310 --> 04:41:54.320 align:start position:0%
26. um
 
04:41:55.910 --> 04:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
but that's where fallacious counter
 
04:41:59.430 --> 04:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
arguments came in yes um
 
04:41:59.440 --> 04:42:00.310 align:start position:0%
arguments came in yes um
okay

04:42:00.310 --> 04:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:42:01.910 --> 04:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
the point is
 
04:42:01.920 --> 04:42:02.948 align:start position:0%
the point is
that

04:42:02.948 --> 04:42:02.958 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:42:05.830 --> 04:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
up until the time that you had renewable
 
04:42:07.830 --> 04:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
okay here's here's the where you're
 
04:42:09.430 --> 04:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
having difficulty
 
04:42:12.070 --> 04:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
up until the creation of the renewable
 
04:42:14.708 --> 04:42:14.718 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard there wasn't an issue
 
04:42:16.948 --> 04:42:16.958 align:start position:0%
of bundling and unbundling and
 
04:42:19.190 --> 04:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
attributes being different from physical
 
04:42:20.788 --> 04:42:20.798 align:start position:0%
attributes you know physical attributes
 
04:42:21.910 --> 04:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
being different from renewable
 
04:42:24.868 --> 04:42:24.878 align:start position:0%
attributes it was just electricity
 
04:42:27.670 --> 04:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
but as soon as the state created this
 
04:42:29.670 --> 04:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
mechanism they had to have a way to
 
04:42:29.680 --> 04:42:30.868 align:start position:0%
mechanism they had to have a way to
track

04:42:30.868 --> 04:42:30.878 align:start position:0%
track
 
04:42:33.590 --> 04:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
the renewableness
 
04:42:35.190 --> 04:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
and the only way and this is the way
 
04:42:38.470 --> 04:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
that they designed that system
 
04:42:40.310 --> 04:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
it doesn't create the property interest
 
04:42:42.150 --> 04:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
the property interest is created and
 
04:42:45.750 --> 04:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
that is clear in supreme court decisions
 
04:42:48.788 --> 04:42:48.798 align:start position:0%
at apple court decisions and in state
 
04:42:51.110 --> 04:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
court decisions this has been litigated
 
04:42:53.270 --> 04:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
there is a property interest it is
 
04:42:55.670 --> 04:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
created at the moment of the generation
 
04:42:57.670 --> 04:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
of the electricity the renewable
 
04:43:00.788 --> 04:43:00.798 align:start position:0%
attribute is just as much part of that
 
04:43:00.798 --> 04:43:02.070 align:start position:0%
attribute is just as much part of that
generation

04:43:02.070 --> 04:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
generation
 
04:43:05.350 --> 04:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
as is the dancing electron
 
04:43:07.670 --> 04:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
and when states have been trying to
 
04:43:07.680 --> 04:43:09.350 align:start position:0%
and when states have been trying to
incentivize

04:43:09.350 --> 04:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
incentivize
 
04:43:11.910 --> 04:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
renewable energy to move us away from
 
04:43:14.390 --> 04:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels and towards a more diverse
 
04:43:17.190 --> 04:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
fuel portfolio this is a mechanism they
 
04:43:19.350 --> 04:43:19.360 align:start position:0%
designed that doesn't mean the state
 
04:43:21.350 --> 04:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
designs the property that doesn't mean
 
04:43:23.670 --> 04:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
the state created the property interest
 
04:43:25.670 --> 04:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
the property interest is created at the
 
04:43:30.948 --> 04:43:30.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:34.708 --> 04:43:34.718 align:start position:0%
okay further questions or comments
 
04:43:37.190 --> 04:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
uh representative berezni
 
04:43:39.030 --> 04:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:43:41.910 --> 04:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to understand whether
 
04:43:44.948 --> 04:43:44.958 align:start position:0%
a renewable attribute
 
04:43:46.470 --> 04:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
is property
 
04:43:49.190 --> 04:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
when it's below one megawatt
 
04:43:51.910 --> 04:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
on um on page 14
 
04:43:53.910 --> 04:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
it says at the bottom
 
04:43:56.628 --> 04:43:56.638 align:start position:0%
uh the gender the generator nevertheless
 
04:43:58.788 --> 04:43:58.798 align:start position:0%
creates energy attributes with every
 
04:44:01.670 --> 04:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
megawatt hour generated
 
04:44:04.628 --> 04:44:04.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:07.110 --> 04:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
on page 11
 
04:44:09.270 --> 04:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
in the quote it says
 
04:44:12.470 --> 04:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
renewable energy sources
 
04:44:14.868 --> 04:44:14.878 align:start position:0%
the creation and state recognition of
 
04:44:17.270 --> 04:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
rex did not result in an entirely new
 
04:44:19.510 --> 04:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
commodity but in the splitting of a
 
04:44:21.750 --> 04:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
pre-existing commodity
 
04:44:23.590 --> 04:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
to me that sounds like you have to have
 
04:44:23.600 --> 04:44:24.868 align:start position:0%
to me that sounds like you have to have
enough

04:44:24.868 --> 04:44:24.878 align:start position:0%
enough
 
04:44:27.270 --> 04:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
r.a to be able to split it and then that
 
04:44:30.230 --> 04:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
becomes the wreck so if you have less
 
04:44:34.150 --> 04:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
than a rec amount of ra then it doesn't
 
04:44:37.270 --> 04:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
no that the megawatt hour comes from the
 
04:44:40.390 --> 04:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
designation of that as the as the wreck
 
04:44:40.400 --> 04:44:41.350 align:start position:0%
designation of that as the as the wreck
so

04:44:41.350 --> 04:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:44:43.590 --> 04:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
the creation of the energy whether you
 
04:44:46.070 --> 04:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
create one kilowatt with your system or
 
04:44:48.948 --> 04:44:48.958 align:start position:0%
you create a million
 
04:44:48.958 --> 04:44:52.230 align:start position:0%
you create a million
kilowatts

04:44:52.230 --> 04:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:56.150 --> 04:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:58.788 --> 04:44:58.798 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter it it's any energy
 
04:45:01.670 --> 04:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
that you produce it's yours you and you
 
04:45:04.070 --> 04:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
bought the equipment you invested your
 
04:45:07.270 --> 04:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
money in it you gave it a place to work
 
04:45:09.670 --> 04:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
and it functions
 
04:45:12.788 --> 04:45:12.798 align:start position:0%
everything it produces is your property
 
04:45:14.150 --> 04:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
the physical attributes of the
 
04:45:16.470 --> 04:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
electricity is your property and the
 
04:45:19.430 --> 04:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
renewableness the renewable attribute is
 
04:45:21.270 --> 04:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
your property
 
04:45:23.510 --> 04:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
what what what the the whole
 
04:45:27.510 --> 04:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
rps and and wreck issue is a way of
 
04:45:27.520 --> 04:45:28.628 align:start position:0%
rps and and wreck issue is a way of
creating

04:45:28.628 --> 04:45:28.638 align:start position:0%
creating
 
04:45:30.390 --> 04:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
an artificial market
 
04:45:32.230 --> 04:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
to generate funds
 
04:45:35.430 --> 04:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
to incentivize renewable energy it had
 
04:45:37.430 --> 04:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
this pernicious
 
04:45:39.510 --> 04:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
and unrecognized
 
04:45:39.520 --> 04:45:41.190 align:start position:0%
and unrecognized
consequence

04:45:41.190 --> 04:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
consequence
 
04:45:44.150 --> 04:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
that it is a seizure of property
 
04:45:45.670 --> 04:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
you you
 
04:45:48.390 --> 04:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
it just it was not yeah i'm just
 
04:45:50.628 --> 04:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
repeating myself i was i wasn't done yet
 
04:45:53.350 --> 04:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
but okay on on page 13
 
04:45:54.470 --> 04:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
it says
 
04:45:56.070 --> 04:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
the middle bullet
 
04:45:58.230 --> 04:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
that renewable energy source attributes
 
04:46:00.310 --> 04:46:00.320 align:start position:0%
produced by generators that would quote
 
04:46:02.470 --> 04:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
qualify to receive renewable energy
 
04:46:07.030 --> 04:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
certificates so again that says that um
 
04:46:08.628 --> 04:46:08.638 align:start position:0%
in order for the
 
04:46:10.948 --> 04:46:10.958 align:start position:0%
ra to be valid it has to
 
04:46:10.958 --> 04:46:12.628 align:start position:0%
ra to be valid it has to
um

04:46:12.628 --> 04:46:12.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:14.948 --> 04:46:14.958 align:start position:0%
be something that would qualify to to be
 
04:46:18.150 --> 04:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
convertible into a a wreck no the the
 
04:46:18.160 --> 04:46:19.510 align:start position:0%
convertible into a a wreck no the the
generator

04:46:19.510 --> 04:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
generator
 
04:46:22.150 --> 04:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
has to qualify um and
 
04:46:25.670 --> 04:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
so if if your generator qualifies for
 
04:46:28.470 --> 04:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
for the production of rex you can't get
 
04:46:30.310 --> 04:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
a wreck unless you get to the megawatt
 
04:46:36.708 --> 04:46:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:39.030 --> 04:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
there is no minimal production level for
 
04:46:46.230 --> 04:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:49.190 --> 04:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee is recognized thank
 
04:46:51.750 --> 04:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman i think i just i think
 
04:46:52.948 --> 04:46:52.958 align:start position:0%
i'm here
 
04:46:54.868 --> 04:46:54.878 align:start position:0%
hearing what it is that representative
 
04:46:54.878 --> 04:46:56.470 align:start position:0%
hearing what it is that representative
brazhevny

04:46:56.470 --> 04:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
brazhevny
 
04:46:58.070 --> 04:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
is asking
 
04:46:59.190 --> 04:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
which is
 
04:47:01.270 --> 04:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
you're asking whether
 
04:47:01.280 --> 04:47:02.470 align:start position:0%
you're asking whether
the

04:47:02.470 --> 04:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:47:06.310 --> 04:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
the attribute exists below a megawatt
 
04:47:07.910 --> 04:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
hour and i think the reason the
 
04:47:10.550 --> 04:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
reference to the megawatt hour is in
 
04:47:12.948 --> 04:47:12.958 align:start position:0%
uh in these slides the way that it is is
 
04:47:14.628 --> 04:47:14.638 align:start position:0%
because that's the
 
04:47:16.390 --> 04:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
quantity of energy
 
04:47:18.150 --> 04:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
that is given a wreck
 
04:47:20.310 --> 04:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
and so when they're discussing racks
 
04:47:22.550 --> 04:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
they're discussing
 
04:47:26.150 --> 04:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:28.788 --> 04:47:28.798 align:start position:0%
but remember the wreck is only the legal
 
04:47:31.430 --> 04:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
representation of the attribute it's the
 
04:47:33.910 --> 04:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
attribute that matters
 
04:47:35.990 --> 04:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
right but if you if you don't have
 
04:47:36.000 --> 04:47:38.070 align:start position:0%
right but if you if you don't have
enough

04:47:38.070 --> 04:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
enough
 
04:47:40.310 --> 04:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
electricity to make up
 
04:47:42.310 --> 04:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
the attribute for the attribute to make
 
04:47:45.430 --> 04:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
up a wreck then do you still have
 
04:47:47.670 --> 04:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
a wreck
 
04:47:49.670 --> 04:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
or can it if it can't be converted into
 
04:47:51.910 --> 04:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
a wreck because this says that it has to
 
04:47:51.920 --> 04:47:53.430 align:start position:0%
a wreck because this says that it has to
be

04:47:53.430 --> 04:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:47:55.430 --> 04:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
that it has to a wreck is created by
 
04:47:55.440 --> 04:47:57.190 align:start position:0%
that it has to a wreck is created by
dividing

04:47:57.190 --> 04:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
dividing
 
04:47:59.750 --> 04:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
the amount of energy that's considered
 
04:47:59.760 --> 04:48:01.190 align:start position:0%
the amount of energy that's considered
renewable

04:48:01.190 --> 04:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
renewable
 
04:48:03.270 --> 04:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
attribute energy so if you don't have
 
04:48:05.190 --> 04:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
enough of that to be able to split it
 
04:48:05.200 --> 04:48:06.230 align:start position:0%
enough of that to be able to split it
into

04:48:06.230 --> 04:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
into
 
04:48:06.240 --> 04:48:07.110 align:start position:0%
into
rex

04:48:07.110 --> 04:48:07.120 align:start position:0%
rex
 
04:48:09.030 --> 04:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
then the question is is it still the
 
04:48:11.350 --> 04:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
same thing
 
04:48:13.190 --> 04:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
the simple answer is yes it is the same
 
04:48:15.270 --> 04:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
thing property is property whether you
 
04:48:16.708 --> 04:48:16.718 align:start position:0%
have a little bit of it or you have a
 
04:48:17.750 --> 04:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
lot of it
 
04:48:19.910 --> 04:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
the legal representation of it
 
04:48:22.470 --> 04:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
in a wreck using the denomination of a
 
04:48:24.550 --> 04:48:24.560 align:start position:0%
megawatt hour is immaterial to the
 
04:48:26.788 --> 04:48:26.798 align:start position:0%
question of whether it's property or not
 
04:48:28.310 --> 04:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
if you have so little of it that it's
 
04:48:28.320 --> 04:48:29.430 align:start position:0%
if you have so little of it that it's
not

04:48:29.430 --> 04:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:48:31.190 --> 04:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
it's not the size of the unit of
 
04:48:33.270 --> 04:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
measurement then do you still have maybe
 
04:48:34.948 --> 04:48:34.958 align:start position:0%
this would help i have a very small
 
04:48:38.230 --> 04:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
system it's a 6.7 kilowatt system
 
04:48:40.230 --> 04:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
over the course of a year it produces
 
04:48:41.910 --> 04:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
eight megawatts
 
04:48:44.310 --> 04:48:44.320 align:start position:0%
hours eight megawatt hours
 
04:48:47.510 --> 04:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
so i mean even a very very small system
 
04:48:49.750 --> 04:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
will produce multiples
 
04:48:51.670 --> 04:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
of megawatt hours
 
04:48:55.270 --> 04:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
it's just a handy measure i i i think
 
04:48:55.280 --> 04:48:56.868 align:start position:0%
it's just a handy measure i i i think
you're

04:48:56.868 --> 04:48:56.878 align:start position:0%
you're
 
04:48:58.550 --> 04:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
if i can help out mr chairman
 
04:49:00.230 --> 04:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
just a little think of it as senator
 
04:49:02.628 --> 04:49:02.638 align:start position:0%
harrington so you're buying gasoline
 
04:49:05.430 --> 04:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
it's 3.50 a gallon that's the that's the
 
04:49:08.150 --> 04:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
unit price of it so the megawatt hour is
 
04:49:09.830 --> 04:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
the unit price for a wreck if you have
 
04:49:11.910 --> 04:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
10 megawatt hours you get 10 wrecks i
 
04:49:13.430 --> 04:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
believe if you have even less than a
 
04:49:14.948 --> 04:49:14.958 align:start position:0%
megawatt hour you could get a half a
 
04:49:17.030 --> 04:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
wreck it would just be valued at that
 
04:49:18.628 --> 04:49:18.638 align:start position:0%
that's what you could sell but it's just
 
04:49:21.030 --> 04:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
the unit of purchase and sale is the
 
04:49:23.110 --> 04:49:23.120 align:start position:0%
megawatt hour just like a gallon is a
 
04:49:25.510 --> 04:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
unit and purchases sale of uh of
 
04:49:27.670 --> 04:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
gasoline you can have five thousand
 
04:49:29.750 --> 04:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
gallons or you can have two gallons
 
04:49:32.948 --> 04:49:32.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:35.430 --> 04:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
representative platt how do you contrast
 
04:49:38.150 --> 04:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
what uh we are saying is a taking
 
04:49:41.190 --> 04:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
with what the state does with the
 
04:49:42.868 --> 04:49:42.878 align:start position:0%
checking and savings accounts that
 
04:49:44.390 --> 04:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
haven't been active for quite a few
 
04:49:46.070 --> 04:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
years they take it as abandoned property
 
04:49:47.750 --> 04:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
and they confiscate it how do you
 
04:49:49.910 --> 04:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
discriminate how do you distribute
 
04:49:53.030 --> 04:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:55.430 --> 04:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
i skipped over the abandoned property
 
04:49:57.270 --> 04:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
slide because i didn't think it was that
 
04:49:58.470 --> 04:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
useful but
 
04:50:00.390 --> 04:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
you know we can go back to it it's slide
 
04:50:00.400 --> 04:50:01.830 align:start position:0%
you know we can go back to it it's slide
29

04:50:01.830 --> 04:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
29
 
04:50:03.590 --> 04:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
the mere fact that customer generators
 
04:50:05.830 --> 04:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
do not bother registering and qualifying
 
04:50:07.590 --> 04:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
their ras for sale into the new
 
04:50:10.230 --> 04:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire rps compliance market does not
 
04:50:12.628 --> 04:50:12.638 align:start position:0%
mean that they are unclaimed or
 
04:50:15.190 --> 04:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
abandoned or lost
 
04:50:17.510 --> 04:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
even if the swept heart renewable
 
04:50:20.150 --> 04:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
attributes were hypothetically unclaimed
 
04:50:22.470 --> 04:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
when the state seizes them they would
 
04:50:25.030 --> 04:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
still not constitute abandoned property
 
04:50:26.868 --> 04:50:26.878 align:start position:0%
under new hampshire law
 
04:50:28.310 --> 04:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire abandoned property
 
04:50:30.070 --> 04:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
statute provides that intangible
 
04:50:32.230 --> 04:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
property must lie unclaimed for five
 
04:50:34.788 --> 04:50:34.798 align:start position:0%
years before it becomes abandoned and
 
04:50:36.868 --> 04:50:36.878 align:start position:0%
subject to state custody
 
04:50:40.390 --> 04:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
wreck sweeping happens every year
 
04:50:42.708 --> 04:50:42.718 align:start position:0%
yet the state seizes ras no later than
 
04:50:45.190 --> 04:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
14 months after they are first created
 
04:50:48.310 --> 04:50:48.320 align:start position:0%
moreover rsa 471c20 requires the state
 
04:50:50.390 --> 04:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
to mail a written notice to an abandoned
 
04:50:52.708 --> 04:50:52.718 align:start position:0%
property owner's last known address
 
04:50:54.310 --> 04:50:54.320 align:start position:0%
informing the owner that it will take
 
04:50:56.628 --> 04:50:56.638 align:start position:0%
custody of the property unless the owner
 
04:50:59.030 --> 04:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
claims it before the state takes such
 
04:51:01.430 --> 04:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
custody attempting to provide such
 
04:51:03.510 --> 04:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
notice is also a constitutional
 
04:51:05.830 --> 04:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
requirement under the 14th amendment's
 
04:51:07.590 --> 04:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
due process clause
 
04:51:09.830 --> 04:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
yet here in new hampshire and nowhere
 
04:51:11.750 --> 04:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
else in the country
 
04:51:14.390 --> 04:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
we make no effort whatsoever to notify
 
04:51:16.310 --> 04:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
customer generators that are subject to
 
04:51:17.590 --> 04:51:17.600 align:start position:0%
wreck sweeping
 
04:51:19.510 --> 04:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
before seizing their renewable
 
04:51:19.520 --> 04:51:24.948 align:start position:0%
before seizing their renewable
attributes

04:51:24.948 --> 04:51:24.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:28.230 --> 04:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
who's next
 
04:51:30.708 --> 04:51:30.718 align:start position:0%
you obviously haven't recognized me uh
 
04:51:34.470 --> 04:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:34.480 --> 04:51:36.628 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:51:36.628 --> 04:51:36.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:38.230 --> 04:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
well yeah
 
04:51:39.910 --> 04:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
i have a
 
04:51:42.628 --> 04:51:42.638 align:start position:0%
question on what
 
04:51:44.788 --> 04:51:44.798 align:start position:0%
of this whole process
 
04:51:48.628 --> 04:51:48.638 align:start position:0%
would be the fiscal impact
 
04:51:48.638 --> 04:51:49.670 align:start position:0%
would be the fiscal impact
on

04:51:49.670 --> 04:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:51:49.680 --> 04:51:51.110 align:start position:0%
on
customers

04:51:51.110 --> 04:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
customers
 
04:51:53.270 --> 04:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
04:51:55.190 --> 04:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
and the
 
04:51:57.430 --> 04:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
second would be
 
04:52:00.550 --> 04:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
that i don't understand why
 
04:52:03.750 --> 04:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
i can sell a piece of property
 
04:52:07.030 --> 04:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
and maybe that's our flaw to somebody
 
04:52:10.628 --> 04:52:10.638 align:start position:0%
else sell my attributes sell my energy
 
04:52:13.510 --> 04:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
back to the
 
04:52:13.520 --> 04:52:15.350 align:start position:0%
back to the
company

04:52:15.350 --> 04:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
company
 
04:52:17.350 --> 04:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
and then get paid again for it
 
04:52:17.360 --> 04:52:18.230 align:start position:0%
and then get paid again for it
so

04:52:18.230 --> 04:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:52:20.550 --> 04:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
maybe that's something we have to tweak
 
04:52:23.750 --> 04:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
but what is the the
 
04:52:26.628 --> 04:52:26.638 align:start position:0%
impact on the customer now in one slide
 
04:52:29.430 --> 04:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
that was meant you mentioned billions
 
04:52:30.470 --> 04:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
and in
 
04:52:33.590 --> 04:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
a statement you said 10 million
 
04:52:35.430 --> 04:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
so what
 
04:52:37.750 --> 04:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
in this especially in this climate
 
04:52:40.150 --> 04:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
that we're in now not the physical
 
04:52:41.830 --> 04:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
climate but the
 
04:52:46.868 --> 04:52:46.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:49.350 --> 04:52:49.360 align:start position:0%
the atmosphere we're in now
 
04:52:51.510 --> 04:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
what would this do
 
04:52:53.750 --> 04:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
to the price of energy
 
04:52:56.390 --> 04:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
if the companies all of a sudden had to
 
04:52:58.150 --> 04:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
start paying
 
04:53:00.150 --> 04:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
compliance pains
 
04:53:01.910 --> 04:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
and state i
 
04:53:06.708 --> 04:53:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:08.868 --> 04:53:08.878 align:start position:0%
representative thomas is recognized
 
04:53:10.868 --> 04:53:10.878 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:53:12.628 --> 04:53:12.638 align:start position:0%
there is no direct answer to that
 
04:53:14.150 --> 04:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
question however
 
04:53:16.310 --> 04:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
i believe we did learn during the public
 
04:53:16.320 --> 04:53:17.430 align:start position:0%
i believe we did learn during the public
hearing

04:53:17.430 --> 04:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
04:53:17.440 --> 04:53:18.708 align:start position:0%
hearing
that

04:53:18.708 --> 04:53:18.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:53:21.350 --> 04:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
for one utility eversource
 
04:53:23.830 --> 04:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
they estimate that
 
04:53:25.270 --> 04:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
what they get
 
04:53:27.670 --> 04:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
in this rex briefing is the equivalent
 
04:53:29.270 --> 04:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
to approximately
 
04:53:31.910 --> 04:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
one and a half to two million dollars
 
04:53:37.030 --> 04:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:38.788 --> 04:53:38.798 align:start position:0%
if they didn't get it it would just be
 
04:53:41.990 --> 04:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
added into their rate paying
 
04:53:44.788 --> 04:53:44.798 align:start position:0%
projection which would increase
 
04:53:46.788 --> 04:53:46.798 align:start position:0%
the cost of electricity to
 
04:53:48.550 --> 04:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
everybody in the state granted it would
 
04:53:52.470 --> 04:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
be a small amount but in my opinion any
 
04:53:55.350 --> 04:53:55.360 align:start position:0%
anything we do now that increases
 
04:53:57.590 --> 04:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
the cost of electricity to our to our
 
04:54:00.310 --> 04:54:00.320 align:start position:0%
constituents is undesirable and wouldn't
 
04:54:02.310 --> 04:54:02.320 align:start position:0%
be acceptable to me but that's that's
 
04:54:03.990 --> 04:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
the only amount
 
04:54:07.990 --> 04:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
that i i heard during public hearing
 
04:54:10.310 --> 04:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
representative kelly pitts
 
04:54:10.320 --> 04:54:11.190 align:start position:0%
representative kelly pitts
i

04:54:11.190 --> 04:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:54:12.788 --> 04:54:12.798 align:start position:0%
just wanted to follow up
 
04:54:15.430 --> 04:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
so i'm a customer and i'm generating
 
04:54:15.440 --> 04:54:16.868 align:start position:0%
so i'm a customer and i'm generating
electricity

04:54:16.868 --> 04:54:16.878 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
04:54:19.110 --> 04:54:19.120 align:start position:0%
would i have to pay
 
04:54:19.120 --> 04:54:20.550 align:start position:0%
would i have to pay
extra

04:54:20.550 --> 04:54:20.560 align:start position:0%
extra
 
04:54:20.560 --> 04:54:21.510 align:start position:0%
extra
to

04:54:21.510 --> 04:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:54:23.750 --> 04:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
a company perhaps
 
04:54:25.910 --> 04:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
to quantify
 
04:54:25.920 --> 04:54:26.788 align:start position:0%
to quantify
what

04:54:26.788 --> 04:54:26.798 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:54:29.910 --> 04:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
my attribute is worth because somehow
 
04:54:31.910 --> 04:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's got to be measured
 
04:54:31.920 --> 04:54:33.030 align:start position:0%
that's got to be measured
so

04:54:33.030 --> 04:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:54:35.830 --> 04:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
would i have to pay them to quantify
 
04:54:35.840 --> 04:54:36.628 align:start position:0%
would i have to pay them to quantify
that

04:54:36.628 --> 04:54:36.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:54:41.190 --> 04:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:44.070 --> 04:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
representative oxidant
 
04:54:45.830 --> 04:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
a number of different questions out here
 
04:54:48.310 --> 04:54:48.320 align:start position:0%
um so i'll probably start start with
 
04:54:49.830 --> 04:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
what i can remember which is the most
 
04:54:50.948 --> 04:54:50.958 align:start position:0%
recent one
 
04:54:53.590 --> 04:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
uh i never said billions
 
04:54:55.670 --> 04:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
um i i did say
 
04:54:55.680 --> 04:54:57.030 align:start position:0%
um i i did say
millions

04:54:57.030 --> 04:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
millions
 
04:55:00.230 --> 04:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
and i also said six cent the the
 
04:55:03.590 --> 04:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
estimate is six cents on the ratepayers
 
04:55:05.510 --> 04:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
monthly bill
 
04:55:05.520 --> 04:55:06.470 align:start position:0%
monthly bill
again

04:55:06.470 --> 04:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:55:08.788 --> 04:55:08.798 align:start position:0%
you know we're talking about theft
 
04:55:10.868 --> 04:55:10.878 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a deceptive process
 
04:55:12.628 --> 04:55:12.638 align:start position:0%
we're talking about denying people their
 
04:55:15.030 --> 04:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
property rights i don't think anyone in
 
04:55:17.590 --> 04:55:17.600 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire would say oh
 
04:55:19.750 --> 04:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i want to save my sixth cents on my
 
04:55:22.948 --> 04:55:22.958 align:start position:0%
bill and let's let's steal people's
 
04:55:25.990 --> 04:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
property without due process i that's
 
04:55:28.310 --> 04:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
that's not something that we do
 
04:55:31.190 --> 04:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
eversource may be getting 1.5 to 2
 
04:55:33.430 --> 04:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
million but they are our big honcho they
 
04:55:35.510 --> 04:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
are the big utility in the state
 
04:55:35.520 --> 04:55:36.628 align:start position:0%
are the big utility in the state
probably

04:55:36.628 --> 04:55:36.638 align:start position:0%
probably
 
04:55:39.830 --> 04:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
all of the utilities are getting less
 
04:55:39.840 --> 04:55:40.868 align:start position:0%
all of the utilities are getting less
than

04:55:40.868 --> 04:55:40.878 align:start position:0%
than
 
04:55:44.230 --> 04:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
3.5 or 4 million altogether
 
04:55:44.240 --> 04:55:45.190 align:start position:0%
3.5 or 4 million altogether
the

04:55:45.190 --> 04:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:55:48.150 --> 04:55:48.160 align:start position:0%
double that with the the competitive
 
04:55:49.910 --> 04:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
suppliers those are the corporations
 
04:55:52.070 --> 04:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
that do absolutely nothing for you give
 
04:55:54.230 --> 04:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
you nothing back and they're simply
 
04:55:56.868 --> 04:55:56.878 align:start position:0%
saving money by not having to meet their
 
04:55:59.270 --> 04:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
compliance payments so the state has
 
04:56:02.230 --> 04:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
established a process it an obligation
 
04:56:04.948 --> 04:56:04.958 align:start position:0%
in order to raise funds in order to
 
04:56:07.430 --> 04:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
incentivize renewable energy this
 
04:56:07.440 --> 04:56:08.868 align:start position:0%
incentivize renewable energy this
process

04:56:08.868 --> 04:56:08.878 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:56:08.878 --> 04:56:10.470 align:start position:0%
process
is

04:56:10.470 --> 04:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:56:12.868 --> 04:56:12.878 align:start position:0%
cutting it off at the knees
 
04:56:15.030 --> 04:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
but but that's secondary the primary
 
04:56:16.750 --> 04:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
issue here is the one that it's
 
04:56:19.910 --> 04:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional it's a property taking
 
04:56:23.430 --> 04:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
and we are duty-bound when we become
 
04:56:27.190 --> 04:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
cognizant of such a pernicious practice
 
04:56:31.430 --> 04:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:35.990 --> 04:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:38.550 --> 04:56:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh representative mick williams
 
04:56:38.560 --> 04:56:39.830 align:start position:0%
uh representative mick williams
um

04:56:39.830 --> 04:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:41.750 --> 04:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
i just want to commend you lee for this
 
04:56:43.750 --> 04:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
in-depth presentation and the research
 
04:56:45.590 --> 04:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
um that the department of energy had
 
04:56:47.430 --> 04:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
requested referencing the specific
 
04:56:49.830 --> 04:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
statutes um i think it's really helpful
 
04:56:51.510 --> 04:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
to review the history and the statutes
 
04:56:53.350 --> 04:56:53.360 align:start position:0%
to understand how all of this came
 
04:56:57.270 --> 04:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
together and also looking at the legal
 
04:56:58.948 --> 04:56:58.958 align:start position:0%
analysis i think it's helpful to
 
04:57:01.510 --> 04:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
understand how this truly is property
 
04:57:04.310 --> 04:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
and it belongs to our constituents and
 
04:57:06.230 --> 04:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
we're doing the wrong thing right now
 
04:57:07.910 --> 04:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
and we're in a position to make it right
 
04:57:09.750 --> 04:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
so i want to commend you thank you i
 
04:57:11.590 --> 04:57:11.600 align:start position:0%
really feel like this is a big deal for
 
04:57:16.708 --> 04:57:16.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:18.948 --> 04:57:18.958 align:start position:0%
okay it looks like we've pretty much
 
04:57:21.590 --> 04:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
exhausted this subject
 
04:57:21.600 --> 04:57:22.390 align:start position:0%
exhausted this subject
so

04:57:22.390 --> 04:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:57:25.110 --> 04:57:25.120 align:start position:0%
i would like to close the work session
 
04:57:25.120 --> 04:57:26.470 align:start position:0%
i would like to close the work session
on

04:57:26.470 --> 04:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:57:29.830 --> 04:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
house bill 1645 fn
 
04:57:31.670 --> 04:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
and open a
 
04:57:34.390 --> 04:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
executive session on said bill
 
04:57:36.470 --> 04:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
and i recognize
 
04:57:38.948 --> 04:57:38.958 align:start position:0%
representative berezni
 
04:57:41.270 --> 04:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman i'd like to
 
04:57:45.510 --> 04:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
make a motion to itl 1645
 
04:57:45.520 --> 04:57:47.190 align:start position:0%
make a motion to itl 1645
recognize

04:57:47.190 --> 04:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
04:57:49.590 --> 04:57:49.600 align:start position:0%
representative bernardi
 
04:57:51.750 --> 04:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
i'll second that motion
 
04:57:54.230 --> 04:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
it's been moved and seconded that we itl
 
04:57:54.240 --> 04:57:55.150 align:start position:0%
it's been moved and seconded that we itl
hb

04:57:55.150 --> 04:57:55.160 align:start position:0%
hb
 
04:57:59.110 --> 04:57:59.120 align:start position:0%
1645 fn point of clarification
 
04:58:01.430 --> 04:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
yes point of clarification is this the
 
04:58:03.110 --> 04:58:03.120 align:start position:0%
amendment or the
 
04:58:05.590 --> 04:58:05.600 align:start position:0%
underlying bill
 
04:58:07.190 --> 04:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
we made the
 
04:58:11.750 --> 04:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:11.760 --> 04:58:12.868 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:58:12.868 --> 04:58:12.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:58:15.270 --> 04:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
we've had an extensive discussion do we
 
04:58:19.270 --> 04:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
need further discussion on this subject
 
04:58:21.430 --> 04:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
representative harrington
 
04:58:24.230 --> 04:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
yeah i just uh i wanted to address some
 
04:58:26.628 --> 04:58:26.638 align:start position:0%
of the issues that were brought up
 
04:58:29.670 --> 04:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
previously here uh first from just from
 
04:58:31.750 --> 04:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
a straight with practical matter
 
04:58:34.310 --> 04:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
we have about 13 and a half percent
 
04:58:36.708 --> 04:58:36.718 align:start position:0%
capacity factor has been attributed to
 
04:58:39.350 --> 04:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
these solar panels uh that aren't needed
 
04:58:41.350 --> 04:58:41.360 align:start position:0%
that's based on the iso new england
 
04:58:41.360 --> 04:58:42.470 align:start position:0%
that's based on the iso new england
average

04:58:42.470 --> 04:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
average
 
04:58:44.390 --> 04:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
the problem with it is right now that's
 
04:58:46.230 --> 04:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
just an average spread out over a whole
 
04:58:49.190 --> 04:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
group of people and that is
 
04:58:52.470 --> 04:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
swept up by the utilities or the uh
 
04:58:55.110 --> 04:58:55.120 align:start position:0%
people that are selling the power
 
04:58:57.110 --> 04:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
but if we would go
 
04:58:59.590 --> 04:58:59.600 align:start position:0%
stop that practice as is proposed and
 
04:59:01.590 --> 04:59:01.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to go back to giving it to
 
04:59:03.670 --> 04:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
individual people how do you decide who
 
04:59:07.830 --> 04:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:11.110 --> 04:59:11.120 align:start position:0%
doug could have a um system where his is
 
04:59:12.788 --> 04:59:12.798 align:start position:0%
up and running and it's the exact same
 
04:59:14.948 --> 04:59:14.958 align:start position:0%
size as mine and he's out there every
 
04:59:17.350 --> 04:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
day it just gets dusty he's wiping it
 
04:59:19.670 --> 04:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
down if it gets snow he's what he's
 
04:59:21.350 --> 04:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
cleaning off the snow every day he's
 
04:59:23.270 --> 04:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
working on it me mine works sometimes
 
04:59:25.990 --> 04:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes it doesn't my inverter broke
 
04:59:27.430 --> 04:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
i'll get around to fixing it when i get
 
04:59:29.750 --> 04:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
back from vacation so since we both have
 
04:59:31.670 --> 04:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
the same size system how do you decide
 
04:59:33.270 --> 04:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
who's going to get these
 
04:59:34.948 --> 04:59:34.958 align:start position:0%
uh that's that's one problem just from a
 
04:59:37.350 --> 04:59:37.360 align:start position:0%
practical matter on it
 
04:59:40.708 --> 04:59:40.718 align:start position:0%
so the the more basic one though on this
 
04:59:43.910 --> 04:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
is that this concept that somehow
 
04:59:47.190 --> 04:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
there's intrinsic value to rex
 
04:59:49.350 --> 04:59:49.360 align:start position:0%
rex have no intrinsic value other than
 
04:59:51.830 --> 04:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
that was granted to it by the renewable
 
04:59:54.470 --> 04:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard
 
04:59:56.550 --> 04:59:56.560 align:start position:0%
that's not right excuse me
 
04:59:58.470 --> 04:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
city will be in order please
 
05:00:00.310 --> 05:00:00.320 align:start position:0%
this member has a right to ha to speak
 
05:00:02.470 --> 05:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
his his peace there's no value to them
 
05:00:04.390 --> 05:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
whatsoever this concept that somehow
 
05:00:06.788 --> 05:00:06.798 align:start position:0%
there was always renewable value to
 
05:00:09.750 --> 05:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
energy implies that you know 50 years
 
05:00:11.750 --> 05:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
ago when we were producing electricity
 
05:00:14.310 --> 05:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
if you had a solar panel it was somehow
 
05:00:17.110 --> 05:00:17.120 align:start position:0%
had renewable energy value it didn't
 
05:00:18.868 --> 05:00:18.878 align:start position:0%
there's no renewable energy value other
 
05:00:21.350 --> 05:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
than what's granted by the state
 
05:00:23.270 --> 05:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
and the state has said we will give you
 
05:00:25.110 --> 05:00:25.120 align:start position:0%
these pieces of paper which are
 
05:00:25.120 --> 05:00:26.628 align:start position:0%
these pieces of paper which are
basically

05:00:26.628 --> 05:00:26.638 align:start position:0%
basically
 
05:00:28.628 --> 05:00:28.638 align:start position:0%
government fiat they have no intrinsic
 
05:00:30.550 --> 05:00:30.560 align:start position:0%
value other than that the state says
 
05:00:32.948 --> 05:00:32.958 align:start position:0%
we're going to force people to buy these
 
05:00:34.550 --> 05:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
in order to sell electricity in new
 
05:00:36.628 --> 05:00:36.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire now to me without going i'm
 
05:00:38.150 --> 05:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
not going to talk on here for too long
 
05:00:39.830 --> 05:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
but let me just put it from a couple of
 
05:00:41.590 --> 05:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
other things if you look at it
 
05:00:42.868 --> 05:00:42.878 align:start position:0%
if we were to turn around to the
 
05:00:45.750 --> 05:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard and say
 
05:00:47.270 --> 05:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to change the law we're
 
05:00:49.350 --> 05:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
going to go from i don't know let's say
 
05:00:52.230 --> 05:00:52.240 align:start position:0%
something is at 20 percent required uh
 
05:00:54.788 --> 05:00:54.798 align:start position:0%
renewable for every electric supplier
 
05:00:56.788 --> 05:00:56.798 align:start position:0%
we're going to drop that to 10 percent
 
05:00:58.868 --> 05:00:58.878 align:start position:0%
according to the theory we just heard
 
05:01:01.190 --> 05:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
that would be an unconstitutional taking
 
05:01:03.270 --> 05:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
because we would make those wrecks worth
 
05:01:05.830 --> 05:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
about half of what they are worth now
 
05:01:07.270 --> 05:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
because you'd still be producing the
 
05:01:09.750 --> 05:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
exact same type of electricity the exact
 
05:01:11.350 --> 05:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
same amount but when you went out to
 
05:01:13.110 --> 05:01:13.120 align:start position:0%
sell your wrecks you wouldn't get
 
05:01:15.590 --> 05:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
anywhere near the price because people
 
05:01:17.430 --> 05:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to buy as many so that
 
05:01:19.350 --> 05:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
would lower the price in the exact same
 
05:01:22.150 --> 05:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
way so if we took that theoretically
 
05:01:24.230 --> 05:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
kept going and put it to zero
 
05:01:26.150 --> 05:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
the same thing if this is like saying
 
05:01:28.868 --> 05:01:28.878 align:start position:0%
that once the rps law is passed the
 
05:01:30.470 --> 05:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire doesn't have the
 
05:01:32.788 --> 05:01:32.798 align:start position:0%
power to get rid of it and we obviously
 
05:01:34.628 --> 05:01:34.638 align:start position:0%
could repeal this law and there would be
 
05:01:36.470 --> 05:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
no wrecks at all so you can produce all
 
05:01:38.788 --> 05:01:38.798 align:start position:0%
the renewable power you want and it's
 
05:01:40.708 --> 05:01:40.718 align:start position:0%
only going to produce electricity and
 
05:01:41.990 --> 05:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
all you're going to sell it for is
 
05:01:44.150 --> 05:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
electricity this is government created
 
05:01:46.708 --> 05:01:46.718 align:start position:0%
value the person creates the generator
 
05:01:48.708 --> 05:01:48.718 align:start position:0%
creates electricity which is actually a
 
05:01:50.948 --> 05:01:50.958 align:start position:0%
commodity that's willing to be sold so i
 
05:01:52.150 --> 05:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
think that's one thing you need to look
 
05:01:55.190 --> 05:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
at the other thing the concept of these
 
05:01:58.470 --> 05:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
big mean corporations from out of state
 
05:02:00.948 --> 05:02:00.958 align:start position:0%
sweeping all this money and getting fat
 
05:02:03.590 --> 05:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
off of it is just not realistic because
 
05:02:05.750 --> 05:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
if they weren't using the money
 
05:02:07.910 --> 05:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
to lower their rates the same way that
 
05:02:09.510 --> 05:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
the utilities use it to lower their
 
05:02:11.590 --> 05:02:11.600 align:start position:0%
rates then everyone would have default
 
05:02:13.990 --> 05:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
service because there's no longer any
 
05:02:16.708 --> 05:02:16.718 align:start position:0%
own generation so all of these companies
 
05:02:18.628 --> 05:02:18.638 align:start position:0%
all the utilities bid into the same
 
05:02:21.910 --> 05:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
market with the same conditions and if
 
05:02:23.750 --> 05:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
eversource is taking which they have to
 
05:02:26.230 --> 05:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
by law they take their when they get
 
05:02:27.990 --> 05:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
swept they have to say i have to take
 
05:02:29.750 --> 05:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
this off the rates and the other
 
05:02:31.670 --> 05:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
utilities have to do the same thing if
 
05:02:33.270 --> 05:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
some of these big mean corporations
 
05:02:35.030 --> 05:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
don't do the same thing they would have
 
05:02:37.270 --> 05:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
to offer higher prices and people
 
05:02:38.868 --> 05:02:38.878 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be buying so that's another
 
05:02:40.550 --> 05:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
fiction that's being put out there but
 
05:02:42.470 --> 05:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
the real key thing is here just think
 
05:02:44.628 --> 05:02:44.638 align:start position:0%
about the before there was a renewable
 
05:02:46.788 --> 05:02:46.798 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard the wrecks weren't
 
05:02:48.310 --> 05:02:48.320 align:start position:0%
worth anything because there were no
 
05:02:50.550 --> 05:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
wrecks there was solar power there was
 
05:02:52.230 --> 05:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
wind power there was all sorts of other
 
05:02:54.390 --> 05:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
power but the only reason there's value
 
05:02:56.310 --> 05:02:56.320 align:start position:0%
to iraq is because a law was created
 
05:02:58.628 --> 05:02:58.638 align:start position:0%
that says there is and we can certainly
 
05:03:01.350 --> 05:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
change that law to increase or decrease
 
05:03:03.350 --> 05:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
the value of those wrecks including
 
05:03:05.270 --> 05:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
making them worth totally nothing but
 
05:03:07.190 --> 05:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
get rid of the renewable portfolio
 
05:03:07.200 --> 05:03:09.990 align:start position:0%
get rid of the renewable portfolio
standard

05:03:09.990 --> 05:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:13.030 --> 05:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative oxenam
 
05:03:14.550 --> 05:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:03:16.470 --> 05:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
the connecticut supreme court has held
 
05:03:18.788 --> 05:03:18.798 align:start position:0%
that quote the renewable attribute of
 
05:03:21.350 --> 05:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
the energy not the wreck not the legal
 
05:03:24.070 --> 05:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
representation not the certificate the
 
05:03:26.310 --> 05:03:26.320 align:start position:0%
renewable attribute of the energy
 
05:03:29.350 --> 05:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
generated by renewable energy sources
 
05:03:32.708 --> 05:03:32.718 align:start position:0%
is an inherent attribute of the energy
 
05:03:35.110 --> 05:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
and therefore the creation and state
 
05:03:37.830 --> 05:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
recognition of the certificates
 
05:03:37.840 --> 05:03:39.110 align:start position:0%
recognition of the certificates
rex

05:03:39.110 --> 05:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
rex
 
05:03:41.350 --> 05:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
did not result in an entirely new
 
05:03:42.948 --> 05:03:42.958 align:start position:0%
commodity but in the splitting of a
 
05:03:44.948 --> 05:03:44.958 align:start position:0%
pre-existing commodity
 
05:03:48.550 --> 05:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
the supreme court of the united states
 
05:03:49.990 --> 05:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
i would appreciate it representative
 
05:03:51.430 --> 05:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
harrington if you would give me the
 
05:03:53.270 --> 05:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
respect due to
 
05:03:54.708 --> 05:03:54.718 align:start position:0%
i've already heard your argument i don't
 
05:03:56.948 --> 05:03:56.958 align:start position:0%
need to hear it again
 
05:03:59.110 --> 05:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
had i mentioned previously the decision
 
05:04:00.868 --> 05:04:00.878 align:start position:0%
by the united states supreme court in
 
05:04:05.110 --> 05:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:09.590 --> 05:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:12.310 --> 05:04:12.320 align:start position:0%
and and the point there was exactly this
 
05:04:15.030 --> 05:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
it was the sale of electricity
 
05:04:17.590 --> 05:04:17.600 align:start position:0%
which occurred at a point in time where
 
05:04:20.868 --> 05:04:20.878 align:start position:0%
the contract had been made before the
 
05:04:24.070 --> 05:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
creation of the rps before the creation
 
05:04:26.470 --> 05:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
of the legal fiction of these
 
05:04:26.480 --> 05:04:28.550 align:start position:0%
of the legal fiction of these
certificates

05:04:28.550 --> 05:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
certificates
 
05:04:30.230 --> 05:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
and the question was what does it mean
 
05:04:33.830 --> 05:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
now that we have a state-created rps
 
05:04:35.910 --> 05:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
and the supreme court said
 
05:04:38.788 --> 05:04:38.798 align:start position:0%
the renewable attributes of that energy
 
05:04:40.230 --> 05:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
were there
 
05:04:43.670 --> 05:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
all the time whenever it was generated
 
05:04:45.750 --> 05:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
the wreck does not create the property
 
05:04:52.310 --> 05:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:52.320 --> 05:04:54.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:04:54.230 --> 05:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:04:55.830 --> 05:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
to follow up on that discussion a
 
05:04:58.390 --> 05:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
renewable attribute
 
05:05:01.350 --> 05:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
seems to be the the attribute seems to
 
05:05:04.230 --> 05:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
be that the electricity is generated by
 
05:05:07.990 --> 05:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
a renewable source that is the attribute
 
05:05:11.750 --> 05:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
so if that is true then electricity
 
05:05:14.310 --> 05:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
generated by a non-renewable
 
05:05:15.990 --> 05:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
source would have a
 
05:05:18.708 --> 05:05:18.718 align:start position:0%
non-renewable attribute
 
05:05:21.270 --> 05:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
is that correct what makes a
 
05:05:24.070 --> 05:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
renewable attribute worth any more than
 
05:05:26.708 --> 05:05:26.718 align:start position:0%
a non-renewable attribute
 
05:05:29.430 --> 05:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
it just seems to be a semantic
 
05:05:31.190 --> 05:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh construction
 
05:05:33.030 --> 05:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
something like a castle in the air that
 
05:05:34.788 --> 05:05:34.798 align:start position:0%
has no real meaning
 
05:05:36.390 --> 05:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
no real value
 
05:05:36.400 --> 05:05:37.190 align:start position:0%
no real value
and

05:05:37.190 --> 05:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:05:38.628 --> 05:05:38.638 align:start position:0%
no real
 
05:05:41.190 --> 05:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
definition if you can be subjected to a
 
05:05:44.070 --> 05:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
10 000 a day penalty for violating the
 
05:05:44.080 --> 05:05:45.270 align:start position:0%
10 000 a day penalty for violating the
ftc

05:05:45.270 --> 05:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
ftc
 
05:05:47.750 --> 05:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
there's something real of value here
 
05:05:47.760 --> 05:05:50.150 align:start position:0%
there's something real of value here
this

05:05:50.150 --> 05:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:52.550 --> 05:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
um i'm sorry because you asked me three
 
05:05:54.310 --> 05:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
questions in in the course of your
 
05:05:56.310 --> 05:05:56.320 align:start position:0%
remarks and i'm having difficulty
 
05:05:58.150 --> 05:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
separating them out
 
05:06:00.390 --> 05:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh the the point
 
05:06:02.868 --> 05:06:02.878 align:start position:0%
again is that the
 
05:06:02.878 --> 05:06:04.470 align:start position:0%
again is that the
you

05:06:04.470 --> 05:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:06:04.480 --> 05:06:06.150 align:start position:0%
you
originally

05:06:06.150 --> 05:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
originally
 
05:06:08.868 --> 05:06:08.878 align:start position:0%
when when you somebody like me bought a
 
05:06:12.310 --> 05:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
pv and generated electricity i could say
 
05:06:13.670 --> 05:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
hey look
 
05:06:18.390 --> 05:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:18.400 --> 05:06:20.310 align:start position:0%
 
once

05:06:20.310 --> 05:06:20.320 align:start position:0%
once
 
05:06:23.190 --> 05:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
once you created this rps and this this
 
05:06:26.390 --> 05:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
legal certificate which represents the
 
05:06:28.868 --> 05:06:28.878 align:start position:0%
renewableness that is no longer
 
05:06:30.948 --> 05:06:30.958 align:start position:0%
renewable energy that the fact this is
 
05:06:32.868 --> 05:06:32.878 align:start position:0%
was what you were asking me that it was
 
05:06:34.948 --> 05:06:34.958 align:start position:0%
tied to the equipment
 
05:06:36.868 --> 05:06:36.878 align:start position:0%
that generated the electricity that's
 
05:06:39.510 --> 05:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
what made it renewable
 
05:06:43.670 --> 05:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
by law renewable attributes now
 
05:06:43.680 --> 05:06:44.510 align:start position:0%
by law renewable attributes now
are

05:06:44.510 --> 05:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:06:48.390 --> 05:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
unbundled they are separated
 
05:06:51.190 --> 05:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
and that is the property interest that
 
05:06:53.910 --> 05:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
is at issue here it's not it is a real
 
05:06:56.948 --> 05:06:56.958 align:start position:0%
interest it has monetary value
 
05:07:00.150 --> 05:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
and it has real world value
 
05:07:03.030 --> 05:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
no nobody discusses non-renewable
 
05:07:06.628 --> 05:07:06.638 align:start position:0%
attributes because there is no
 
05:07:08.230 --> 05:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
value to them
 
05:07:11.510 --> 05:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
but it's a great value to a coal-powered
 
05:07:15.190 --> 05:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
plant to be able to buy a wreck and say
 
05:07:17.590 --> 05:07:17.600 align:start position:0%
oh we're supplying green energy we're
 
05:07:20.310 --> 05:07:20.320 align:start position:0%
meeting our renewable compliance
 
05:07:23.670 --> 05:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
program because we purchased this wreck
 
05:07:25.590 --> 05:07:25.600 align:start position:0%
which means we own
 
05:07:27.510 --> 05:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
the renewable attributes which were
 
05:07:30.070 --> 05:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
stripped from the actual generator that
 
05:07:33.030 --> 05:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
produced the energy i no longer have for
 
05:07:36.550 --> 05:07:36.560 align:start position:0%
10 years i you know i invested money in
 
05:07:38.070 --> 05:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
a renewable
 
05:07:40.310 --> 05:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
array with the notion not of making
 
05:07:44.708 --> 05:07:44.718 align:start position:0%
money at it i won't make money at it
 
05:07:46.628 --> 05:07:46.638 align:start position:0%
i did it because i wanted to be
 
05:07:48.788 --> 05:07:48.798 align:start position:0%
producing renewable energy and i wanted
 
05:07:51.110 --> 05:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
to add to the total renewable energy in
 
05:07:54.948 --> 05:07:54.958 align:start position:0%
the state and that property interest
 
05:07:56.070 --> 05:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
has been
 
05:07:59.510 --> 05:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
stolen from me and from anybody else
 
05:07:59.520 --> 05:08:00.310 align:start position:0%
stolen from me and from anybody else
who

05:08:00.310 --> 05:08:00.320 align:start position:0%
who
 
05:08:03.510 --> 05:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
completely unbeknownst to them
 
05:08:07.510 --> 05:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
has swept their renewable attributes
 
05:08:09.590 --> 05:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
in some cases sold them
 
05:08:09.600 --> 05:08:10.470 align:start position:0%
in some cases sold them
okay

05:08:10.470 --> 05:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:08:12.708 --> 05:08:12.718 align:start position:0%
i shouldn't i
 
05:08:15.430 --> 05:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
let me take back that last four or five
 
05:08:17.590 --> 05:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
words because that goes into a whole
 
05:08:19.750 --> 05:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
different area that
 
05:08:21.430 --> 05:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
and i i
 
05:08:25.030 --> 05:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:28.470 --> 05:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
intangible property as i discussed with
 
05:08:28.480 --> 05:08:29.510 align:start position:0%
intangible property as i discussed with
a

05:08:29.510 --> 05:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:08:32.310 --> 05:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
colleagues is is a difficult thing to
 
05:08:34.550 --> 05:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
wrap your mind around it's like when you
 
05:08:36.708 --> 05:08:36.718 align:start position:0%
create an invention
 
05:08:38.788 --> 05:08:38.798 align:start position:0%
and get a patent for it
 
05:08:40.390 --> 05:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
the invention and the patent are
 
05:08:41.990 --> 05:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
separate things the patent merely
 
05:08:44.550 --> 05:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
represents what you created your
 
05:08:46.230 --> 05:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
intellectual effort
 
05:08:49.430 --> 05:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
when you know intangible property is is
 
05:08:51.030 --> 05:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
is hard to wrap your mind around but
 
05:08:52.310 --> 05:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
it's real
 
05:08:54.788 --> 05:08:54.798 align:start position:0%
and there are real world consequences
 
05:08:57.670 --> 05:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
you can be held to a felony conviction
 
05:09:00.230 --> 05:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
you can be ch held liable for ten
 
05:09:02.390 --> 05:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a day for deceptive
 
05:09:05.750 --> 05:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
fraudulent practices if you represent
 
05:09:08.150 --> 05:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
the manufactured product that your
 
05:09:10.628 --> 05:09:10.638 align:start position:0%
factory produces with the renewable
 
05:09:13.110 --> 05:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
generator that you invested in
 
05:09:15.830 --> 05:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
because somebody unbeknownst to you has
 
05:09:18.070 --> 05:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
swept the attributes and handed them
 
05:09:20.708 --> 05:09:20.718 align:start position:0%
over to somebody else
 
05:09:24.150 --> 05:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
otherwise it'd be double counting
 
05:09:26.628 --> 05:09:26.638 align:start position:0%
you you only there's only so much
 
05:09:26.638 --> 05:09:28.948 align:start position:0%
you you only there's only so much
property

05:09:28.948 --> 05:09:28.958 align:start position:0%
property
 
05:09:31.750 --> 05:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
so are you saying that a kilowatt hour
 
05:09:33.830 --> 05:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
of electricity that you generate with
 
05:09:35.830 --> 05:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
your solar panels
 
05:09:38.070 --> 05:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
is inherently more valuable than the
 
05:09:40.150 --> 05:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour i generate with my
 
05:09:42.230 --> 05:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
electric generator
 
05:09:44.948 --> 05:09:44.958 align:start position:0%
because there is a renewable compliance
 
05:09:48.230 --> 05:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
wreck market there is a a financial
 
05:09:50.868 --> 05:09:50.878 align:start position:0%
value there but there is also
 
05:09:50.878 --> 05:09:52.470 align:start position:0%
value there but there is also
an

05:09:52.470 --> 05:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
an
 
05:09:55.350 --> 05:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
intangible psychological
 
05:09:57.590 --> 05:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
when i studied economics it was called a
 
05:09:57.600 --> 05:09:58.390 align:start position:0%
when i studied economics it was called a
um

05:09:58.390 --> 05:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:01.030 --> 05:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
psychic quasi rent
 
05:10:04.070 --> 05:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
so yes psychic quasi rents my wife tells
 
05:10:06.150 --> 05:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
me that that kilowatt hour of
 
05:10:07.830 --> 05:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
electricity that we generate with our
 
05:10:11.830 --> 05:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:13.270 --> 05:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
when the washing machine won't work
 
05:10:16.310 --> 05:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
because there's no electricity so
 
05:10:18.070 --> 05:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
i would argue that
 
05:10:21.190 --> 05:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
either kilowatt hour is inherently
 
05:10:24.390 --> 05:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
worth the same amount and that seems to
 
05:10:27.190 --> 05:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
be the crux of the issue here
 
05:10:28.470 --> 05:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
remember the
 
05:10:28.480 --> 05:10:29.830 align:start position:0%
remember the
value

05:10:29.830 --> 05:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
value
 
05:10:32.150 --> 05:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
that's attributed to a wreck
 
05:10:32.160 --> 05:10:32.948 align:start position:0%
that's attributed to a wreck
is

05:10:32.948 --> 05:10:32.958 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:10:36.390 --> 05:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
as representative harrington pointed out
 
05:10:39.750 --> 05:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
a value that's created by government
 
05:10:41.910 --> 05:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
it's an obligation that's created by
 
05:10:43.590 --> 05:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
government but intrinsically that
 
05:10:45.750 --> 05:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour
 
05:10:48.628 --> 05:10:48.638 align:start position:0%
when it's generated with a generator or
 
05:10:50.868 --> 05:10:50.878 align:start position:0%
a solar panel
 
05:10:53.110 --> 05:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
the electricity is essentially worth the
 
05:10:55.990 --> 05:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
same because it'll do the same thing
 
05:10:57.910 --> 05:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
which is work that's what we use
 
05:11:00.550 --> 05:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
electricity to do we use electricity to
 
05:11:03.590 --> 05:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
power machines to do work
 
05:11:03.600 --> 05:11:04.948 align:start position:0%
power machines to do work
and

05:11:04.948 --> 05:11:04.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:11:04.958 --> 05:11:06.230 align:start position:0%
and
this

05:11:06.230 --> 05:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:11:08.628 --> 05:11:08.638 align:start position:0%
renewable attribute
 
05:11:11.590 --> 05:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
seems to be a
 
05:11:14.868 --> 05:11:14.878 align:start position:0%
semantic construction that has no real
 
05:11:19.990 --> 05:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:22.150 --> 05:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee thank you mr
 
05:11:22.160 --> 05:11:23.110 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee thank you mr
chairman

05:11:23.110 --> 05:11:23.120 align:start position:0%

my my my um we're going around the world
 
05:11:25.600 --> 05:11:26.550 align:start position:0%
my my my um we're going around the world
here

05:11:26.550 --> 05:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:11:28.708 --> 05:11:28.718 align:start position:0%
i'd just like to bring it back if i
 
05:11:29.830 --> 05:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
could to
 
05:11:32.440 --> 05:11:32.450 align:start position:0%
i think the intent of the bill
 
05:11:32.450 --> 05:11:34.470 align:start position:0%
i think the intent of the bill
[Music]

05:11:34.470 --> 05:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:11:34.480 --> 05:11:35.430 align:start position:0%
[Music]
okay

05:11:35.430 --> 05:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:11:37.350 --> 05:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
i wanted to clarify something that i
 
05:11:39.830 --> 05:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
heard uh when representative harrington
 
05:11:42.310 --> 05:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
spoke earlier he made several points but
 
05:11:44.470 --> 05:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
he started out with saying you know if
 
05:11:46.550 --> 05:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
if these wrecks don't get swept and get
 
05:11:48.708 --> 05:11:48.718 align:start position:0%
used the way they're being used
 
05:11:48.718 --> 05:11:50.550 align:start position:0%
used the way they're being used
currently

05:11:50.550 --> 05:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
currently
 
05:11:52.470 --> 05:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
and they have to go back to people but i
 
05:11:54.708 --> 05:11:54.718 align:start position:0%
clean my you know i don't clean my array
 
05:11:56.230 --> 05:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
and this guy cleans his right how do you
 
05:11:58.150 --> 05:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
figure it out he made it sound all so
 
05:11:58.160 --> 05:11:59.430 align:start position:0%
figure it out he made it sound all so
confusing

05:11:59.430 --> 05:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
confusing
 
05:12:01.750 --> 05:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
all the bill is saying is you don't get
 
05:12:05.190 --> 05:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
to take my property it doesn't say
 
05:12:07.270 --> 05:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
what happens after that it doesn't say
 
05:12:09.190 --> 05:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
anybody has to collect it and do the
 
05:12:11.830 --> 05:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
math and redistribute it none of that
 
05:12:14.868 --> 05:12:14.878 align:start position:0%
happens you just keep your own property
 
05:12:16.628 --> 05:12:16.638 align:start position:0%
you do with what you want
 
05:12:19.030 --> 05:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
you do what you want with it right so
 
05:12:20.948 --> 05:12:20.958 align:start position:0%
there is no there is no redistribution
 
05:12:23.830 --> 05:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
there is no state involvement it repeals
 
05:12:26.310 --> 05:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
the idea of taking it from a person
 
05:12:28.550 --> 05:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
who's generating it and using their
 
05:12:31.590 --> 05:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
asset for something else and then
 
05:12:33.750 --> 05:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
the other thing that i think should be
 
05:12:35.670 --> 05:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
just stated about the attribute we have
 
05:12:37.430 --> 05:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
differences of opinion on this committee
 
05:12:39.110 --> 05:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
as to whether the science is correct and
 
05:12:40.628 --> 05:12:40.638 align:start position:0%
the environmental
 
05:12:42.550 --> 05:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
impacts of what's going on with our
 
05:12:45.350 --> 05:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:47.190 --> 05:12:47.200 align:start position:0%
should be valued or there should be
 
05:12:49.670 --> 05:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
incentives for us to try and clean up
 
05:12:53.270 --> 05:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
the way we power our society
 
05:12:55.270 --> 05:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
that's what the attribute is valued it
 
05:12:57.350 --> 05:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
for that's what the rps is for that's
 
05:12:58.948 --> 05:12:58.958 align:start position:0%
why states all over the country and
 
05:13:01.030 --> 05:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
countries all over the world are trying
 
05:13:02.708 --> 05:13:02.718 align:start position:0%
to figure out ways
 
05:13:02.718 --> 05:13:04.150 align:start position:0%
to figure out ways
to

05:13:04.150 --> 05:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:13:07.510 --> 05:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
create price points that support
 
05:13:10.948 --> 05:13:10.958 align:start position:0%
an energy market that values
 
05:13:12.948 --> 05:13:12.958 align:start position:0%
uh energy that is better for the
 
05:13:15.590 --> 05:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
environment that's all
 
05:13:17.430 --> 05:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
all right i'm going to suggest that we
 
05:13:17.440 --> 05:13:18.230 align:start position:0%
all right i'm going to suggest that we
uh

05:13:18.230 --> 05:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:13:20.470 --> 05:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
call the question here mr representative
 
05:13:22.310 --> 05:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
harrington yeah i just like to respond
 
05:13:24.150 --> 05:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
very quickly because of what she did
 
05:13:25.670 --> 05:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
question something i said and maybe she
 
05:13:27.350 --> 05:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
misunderstood me
 
05:13:29.110 --> 05:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
it sounds like what you're saying is the
 
05:13:30.628 --> 05:13:30.638 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill
 
05:13:33.910 --> 05:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
is to simply not allow the utilities or
 
05:13:35.590 --> 05:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
the electric suppliers to sweep the
 
05:13:37.830 --> 05:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
wrecks but that nobody else would get
 
05:13:40.868 --> 05:13:40.878 align:start position:0%
them so as far as the the uh net
 
05:13:42.708 --> 05:13:42.718 align:start position:0%
generated net meter generators that
 
05:13:44.868 --> 05:13:44.878 align:start position:0%
don't have the more expensive metering
 
05:13:46.390 --> 05:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
equipment they would be in the exact
 
05:13:47.990 --> 05:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
same situation they are now they're not
 
05:13:49.430 --> 05:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
going to get another dime because
 
05:13:51.110 --> 05:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
they're not going to get any wrecks the
 
05:13:53.190 --> 05:13:53.200 align:start position:0%
wrecks are just not going to go to the
 
05:13:55.670 --> 05:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
utilities and go to the electric
 
05:13:57.830 --> 05:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
suppliers so of course that'll have to
 
05:13:59.590 --> 05:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
result in higher rates
 
05:14:01.750 --> 05:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
my thought was i thought what they was
 
05:14:04.230 --> 05:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
being proposed was that somehow the
 
05:14:05.910 --> 05:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
wreck would not be swept but they would
 
05:14:07.830 --> 05:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
be returned to the people who generate
 
05:14:10.470 --> 05:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
the power and my question is if you
 
05:14:12.708 --> 05:14:12.718 align:start position:0%
don't know how much somebody generates
 
05:14:14.470 --> 05:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
how do you distribute the power up to
 
05:14:16.948 --> 05:14:16.958 align:start position:0%
all the individual solar solar producers
 
05:14:19.110 --> 05:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
that was what i was referring to right
 
05:14:21.270 --> 05:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
and i said you wouldn't have to so you
 
05:14:23.030 --> 05:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
would you wouldn't just simply they
 
05:14:24.948 --> 05:14:24.958 align:start position:0%
wouldn't get anything then
 
05:14:26.470 --> 05:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
they'd be no better off than they are
 
05:14:28.550 --> 05:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
now they simply would be but their
 
05:14:30.070 --> 05:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
property wouldn't be taken by somebody
 
05:14:31.190 --> 05:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
else they wouldn't have any problems
 
05:14:33.510 --> 05:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
without their knowledge
 
05:14:37.190 --> 05:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
okay so let's not have a debate without
 
05:14:40.150 --> 05:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
raising one's hand okay so
 
05:14:40.160 --> 05:14:41.510 align:start position:0%
raising one's hand okay so
uh

05:14:41.510 --> 05:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:14:43.590 --> 05:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
we've gone around and around on this
 
05:14:45.670 --> 05:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
question i think it's time to call the
 
05:14:45.680 --> 05:14:46.788 align:start position:0%
question i think it's time to call the
question

05:14:46.788 --> 05:14:46.798 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:14:49.030 --> 05:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:14:50.868 --> 05:14:50.878 align:start position:0%
have a vote on this bill so that we can
 
05:14:52.948 --> 05:14:52.958 align:start position:0%
move on it's now almost quarter past
 
05:14:54.788 --> 05:14:54.798 align:start position:0%
three and we still have another bill to
 
05:14:56.788 --> 05:14:56.798 align:start position:0%
address we have been discussing the
 
05:14:59.750 --> 05:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
amendment and not the bill which we are
 
05:15:00.830 --> 05:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
to vote
 
05:15:04.230 --> 05:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
on the motion on the floor is itl on
 
05:15:07.270 --> 05:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
house bill 1645 there is no motion on
 
05:15:11.270 --> 05:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:13.430 --> 05:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
mr clerk would you call the role on the
 
05:15:17.270 --> 05:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
question of itl on hb 1645
 
05:15:20.788 --> 05:15:20.798 align:start position:0%
i i have a parliamentary question what
 
05:15:23.990 --> 05:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
is your i've been sitting on it all day
 
05:15:27.110 --> 05:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
if a bill is itl
 
05:15:29.510 --> 05:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
then it is not open to amendment is that
 
05:15:29.520 --> 05:15:30.390 align:start position:0%
then it is not open to amendment is that
correct

05:15:30.390 --> 05:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:15:32.470 --> 05:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
because you have nothing to amend that
 
05:15:36.550 --> 05:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
is correct so this would also kill the
 
05:15:39.350 --> 05:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
amendment correct correct this action
 
05:15:40.708 --> 05:15:40.718 align:start position:0%
correct thank you
 
05:15:42.310 --> 05:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
it would preclude the amendment it
 
05:15:45.590 --> 05:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't kill it which is precluded yes
 
05:15:47.110 --> 05:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
all right so mr clerk please call the
 
05:15:52.230 --> 05:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
roll on the question of itl on hb 1645.
 
05:15:58.150 --> 05:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:59.830 --> 05:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
there's a maximum of five that i think
 
05:16:01.270 --> 05:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
is allowed

to work with yes the difficulty is
 
05:16:57.030 --> 05:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
cutting it down
 
05:17:02.788 --> 05:17:02.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:12.868 --> 05:17:12.878 align:start position:0%

discussion representative harrington
 
05:17:52.948 --> 05:17:52.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman this is sort of a
 
05:17:54.708 --> 05:17:54.718 align:start position:0%
follow-up to the bill we looked at
 
05:17:56.708 --> 05:17:56.718 align:start position:0%
before it goes a little bit one step
 
05:17:58.628 --> 05:17:58.638 align:start position:0%
further in trying to adjust the false
 
05:18:01.030 --> 05:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
service rate i'm not going to try to be
 
05:18:03.350 --> 05:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
too long and overboring but default
 
05:18:05.830 --> 05:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
service rate has a lot of complications
 
05:18:08.628 --> 05:18:08.638 align:start position:0%
into it and it's as fast as i can do it
 
05:18:10.708 --> 05:18:10.718 align:start position:0%
i will do it basically the utility sets
 
05:18:12.868 --> 05:18:12.878 align:start position:0%
out and says we have a load profile
 
05:18:14.470 --> 05:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
we're gonna we're gonna have we need a
 
05:18:16.948 --> 05:18:16.958 align:start position:0%
supplier for a certain percentage of our
 
05:18:19.190 --> 05:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
power for a certain percentage of time
 
05:18:21.430 --> 05:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
they put up that large profile out it
 
05:18:23.430 --> 05:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
goes to a bunch of suppliers the
 
05:18:25.670 --> 05:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
suppliers review that they have to of
 
05:18:27.910 --> 05:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
course negotiate with actual generators
 
05:18:30.628 --> 05:18:30.638 align:start position:0%
or maybe even an interim supplier and
 
05:18:31.990 --> 05:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
they come up with a proposal where
 
05:18:33.430 --> 05:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
they're going to get so much power from
 
05:18:35.430 --> 05:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
this uh plant and so much power from
 
05:18:37.510 --> 05:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
that plant they have to have reserves
 
05:18:39.830 --> 05:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
and capacity backups because as i
 
05:18:42.070 --> 05:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier about 40 of the total
 
05:18:44.150 --> 05:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
cost of default service is the
 
05:18:46.230 --> 05:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
contingency to make sure you can always
 
05:18:49.670 --> 05:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
match uh the supply with the demand
 
05:18:52.470 --> 05:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
so then these you those companies come
 
05:18:54.310 --> 05:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
up with a proposal they submit it to the
 
05:18:56.628 --> 05:18:56.638 align:start position:0%
utility the utility then turns around
 
05:18:59.030 --> 05:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
and has to review these and decide which
 
05:19:02.390 --> 05:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
one to pick it picks one now based built
 
05:19:04.628 --> 05:19:04.638 align:start position:0%
into that price there's going to be the
 
05:19:07.510 --> 05:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
cost associated with the supplier for
 
05:19:10.150 --> 05:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
not only acquiring the power but the big
 
05:19:11.910 --> 05:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
thing is that risk factor which i say
 
05:19:13.590 --> 05:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
could be up to 40 percent for making
 
05:19:15.670 --> 05:19:15.680 align:start position:0%
sure he can always match they also have
 
05:19:17.830 --> 05:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
their just administrative costs as well
 
05:19:18.948 --> 05:19:18.958 align:start position:0%
as of course they're trying to make a
 
05:19:20.550 --> 05:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
profit or they wouldn't be doing this
 
05:19:22.390 --> 05:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
all of that is built into the price that
 
05:19:25.190 --> 05:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
they submit to the to the utility then
 
05:19:27.110 --> 05:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
the utility has to take that review
 
05:19:29.190 --> 05:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
those pick one out obviously there's
 
05:19:31.270 --> 05:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
cost involved it's always a pass-through
 
05:19:33.110 --> 05:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
for the utility there's no profits on
 
05:19:34.628 --> 05:19:34.638 align:start position:0%
this side on this
 
05:19:36.628 --> 05:19:36.638 align:start position:0%
and then they have to take it to the puc
 
05:19:38.868 --> 05:19:38.878 align:start position:0%
and get the contract approved and then
 
05:19:40.550 --> 05:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
in the process of that built into that
 
05:19:43.430 --> 05:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
contract of course is the monitoring by
 
05:19:46.230 --> 05:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
both the utility and the supplier 24 7
 
05:19:48.948 --> 05:19:48.958 align:start position:0%
to always make sure you have enough uh
 
05:19:51.590 --> 05:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
supply to match demand that's all in
 
05:19:53.830 --> 05:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
default service as well as such things
 
05:19:56.470 --> 05:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
as we talked about earlier the renewable
 
05:19:58.788 --> 05:19:58.798 align:start position:0%
portfolios uh standard requirements
 
05:20:00.628 --> 05:20:00.638 align:start position:0%
where the utility has to pay that as
 
05:20:03.110 --> 05:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
well there's also um
 
05:20:05.830 --> 05:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
the forward capacity market which each
 
05:20:08.628 --> 05:20:08.638 align:start position:0%
supplier is charged a certain fee for
 
05:20:10.550 --> 05:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
and that has to be all collected through
 
05:20:13.110 --> 05:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
default service so there's a very large
 
05:20:14.708 --> 05:20:14.718 align:start position:0%
amount of costs
 
05:20:17.430 --> 05:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
more than 50 percent of default service
 
05:20:19.350 --> 05:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
is not a cost
 
05:20:20.948 --> 05:20:20.958 align:start position:0%
that the
 
05:20:23.350 --> 05:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
net metering supplier ever sees they
 
05:20:25.430 --> 05:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
just don't see this because they're not
 
05:20:26.708 --> 05:20:26.718 align:start position:0%
involved in all this contract
 
05:20:29.510 --> 05:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
negotiation they have no obligation to
 
05:20:32.070 --> 05:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
provide any electricity at any time
 
05:20:33.590 --> 05:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
which you have to understand is probably
 
05:20:36.628 --> 05:20:36.638 align:start position:0%
the biggest single factor the utility is
 
05:20:39.350 --> 05:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
out there saying we have to be there 24
 
05:20:42.150 --> 05:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
7 all the time to supply whatever the
 
05:20:43.350 --> 05:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
load is
 
05:20:45.910 --> 05:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
where if you're a net metering customer
 
05:20:48.070 --> 05:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
you can turn on or turn off whenever you
 
05:20:50.150 --> 05:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
want there's no repercussions there's no
 
05:20:53.110 --> 05:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
penalties any other type of generator
 
05:20:55.030 --> 05:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
you you bit into the market if you don't
 
05:20:57.030 --> 05:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
make your uh you don't supply that
 
05:20:58.708 --> 05:20:58.718 align:start position:0%
amount of power you're gonna have to buy
 
05:21:00.628 --> 05:21:00.638 align:start position:0%
it from somebody else but there's no
 
05:21:03.270 --> 05:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
risk involved no risk factor whatsoever
 
05:21:05.830 --> 05:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
with the net metering customers so they
 
05:21:07.590 --> 05:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
don't see any of these charges and
 
05:21:09.350 --> 05:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
there's really no reason to pay them for
 
05:21:11.670 --> 05:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
them uh and as far as the renewable
 
05:21:13.510 --> 05:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard we already discussed
 
05:21:15.430 --> 05:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
that that was a double payment issue so
 
05:21:17.990 --> 05:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
i'll just leave it go with that
 
05:21:18.948 --> 05:21:18.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:21:20.868 --> 05:21:20.878 align:start position:0%
further discussion on
 
05:21:24.788 --> 05:21:24.798 align:start position:0%
house bill 1629 representative mcgee
 
05:21:26.390 --> 05:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
05:21:28.070 --> 05:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
yep this is the bill that i started to
 
05:21:30.310 --> 05:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
go off on about a little while ago
 
05:21:32.470 --> 05:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
because i i actually think that this
 
05:21:35.270 --> 05:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
this bill um is the bill that i was
 
05:21:37.270 --> 05:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
thinking of when i was saying that we
 
05:21:37.280 --> 05:21:37.990 align:start position:0%
thinking of when i was saying that we
are

05:21:37.990 --> 05:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:21:40.390 --> 05:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh rate setting from the house which we
 
05:21:42.548 --> 05:21:42.558 align:start position:0%
really have no expertise on there are
 
05:21:43.990 --> 05:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
lots of things you can throw out there
 
05:21:45.510 --> 05:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
and you can look at them
 
05:21:47.910 --> 05:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
from multiple perspectives you can say
 
05:21:49.830 --> 05:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
they're you know they don't have any of
 
05:21:51.350 --> 05:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
these costs well they have other costs
 
05:21:53.190 --> 05:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
you're not counting you know
 
05:21:55.430 --> 05:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's a completely arbitrary
 
05:21:59.350 --> 05:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
approach at trying to lower the value of
 
05:22:01.110 --> 05:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh net metering
 
05:22:03.830 --> 05:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
but i made a note when we had the
 
05:22:03.840 --> 05:22:05.190 align:start position:0%
but i made a note when we had the
hearing

05:22:05.190 --> 05:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
05:22:07.590 --> 05:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
that default service providers go out to
 
05:22:09.990 --> 05:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
bid for service and that
 
05:22:12.948 --> 05:22:12.958 align:start position:0%
passing this bill could lead to a failed
 
05:22:15.350 --> 05:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
default service auctions that's that was
 
05:22:17.670 --> 05:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
testimony that we had
 
05:22:21.030 --> 05:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
this is a huge departure again this is
 
05:22:23.430 --> 05:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
this is rate setting and
 
05:22:25.270 --> 05:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
we have talked again and again about the
 
05:22:27.430 --> 05:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
fact that the value of distributed
 
05:22:29.430 --> 05:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
energy resources is not something we
 
05:22:31.750 --> 05:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
have in hand and so for us to make this
 
05:22:31.760 --> 05:22:33.190 align:start position:0%
have in hand and so for us to make this
determination

05:22:33.190 --> 05:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
determination
 
05:22:35.270 --> 05:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
and decide that we're gonna we're gonna
 
05:22:37.430 --> 05:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
lower the value of this without knowing
 
05:22:39.270 --> 05:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
what the value is because we have a
 
05:22:40.948 --> 05:22:40.958 align:start position:0%
study that is ready to come in the
 
05:22:40.958 --> 05:22:42.070 align:start position:0%
study that is ready to come in the
spring

05:22:42.070 --> 05:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
spring
 
05:22:45.590 --> 05:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
is very irresponsible it's it's not
 
05:22:48.070 --> 05:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make sense for uh
 
05:22:50.070 --> 05:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
for a policy-making body
 
05:22:52.070 --> 05:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
to arbitrarily
 
05:22:55.350 --> 05:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
set rates for an entire segment of you
 
05:22:57.430 --> 05:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
know the energy sector
 
05:22:59.270 --> 05:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
without the knowledge of whether we're
 
05:23:01.350 --> 05:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
doing the right thing we can we can all
 
05:23:02.868 --> 05:23:02.878 align:start position:0%
argue back and forth i'm doing it right
 
05:23:05.510 --> 05:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
you're doing it right but we don't know
 
05:23:08.470 --> 05:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
and that much i do know
 
05:23:10.948 --> 05:23:10.958 align:start position:0%
so i i would ask that we not vote ought
 
05:23:13.190 --> 05:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
to pass on this because it's it's just a
 
05:23:15.190 --> 05:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
bad bill
 
05:23:17.590 --> 05:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
representative platt yes this former
 
05:23:19.190 --> 05:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
rate center for public service new
 
05:23:20.390 --> 05:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire has a question for
 
05:23:23.430 --> 05:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
representative harrington all the margin
 
05:23:25.510 --> 05:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
that's built into default service other
 
05:23:27.510 --> 05:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
than the cost of wholesale electricity
 
05:23:29.430 --> 05:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
such as risk
 
05:23:31.030 --> 05:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
mitigation because they don't know what
 
05:23:33.430 --> 05:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
they're getting at any time
 
05:23:35.110 --> 05:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
all the compliance
 
05:23:37.190 --> 05:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
for rps and all that stuff is
 
05:23:39.830 --> 05:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
unavoidable in any
 
05:23:41.350 --> 05:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
i don't see any way it can possibly be
 
05:23:43.110 --> 05:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
avoidable by putting in the default
 
05:23:45.190 --> 05:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
service but again those are costs and
 
05:23:46.708 --> 05:23:46.718 align:start position:0%
the key thing here those are costs that
 
05:23:50.390 --> 05:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
are not seen by the uh net metering if
 
05:23:51.830 --> 05:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
people want to talk about that net
 
05:23:53.830 --> 05:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
metering has some other intrinsic value
 
05:23:55.990 --> 05:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
we should pay them for that's fine let's
 
05:23:57.830 --> 05:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
figure out what that is and we can set a
 
05:24:00.070 --> 05:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
value on it but let's not pay them for
 
05:24:01.910 --> 05:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
cost that they never see and that's what
 
05:24:03.510 --> 05:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
we're doing right now they don't
 
05:24:05.830 --> 05:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
negotiate contracts they don't have any
 
05:24:08.310 --> 05:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
risk premium which is huge because they
 
05:24:10.390 --> 05:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
have no risk they can run when they want
 
05:24:11.670 --> 05:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
if they don't want to run they don't
 
05:24:13.670 --> 05:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
have to without any penalties they don't
 
05:24:15.430 --> 05:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
see any of these costs why should we pay
 
05:24:18.470 --> 05:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:20.470 --> 05:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
thank you i would remind the members
 
05:24:20.480 --> 05:24:21.670 align:start position:0%
thank you i would remind the members
that

05:24:21.670 --> 05:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:24:23.750 --> 05:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
this is not rate setting we're talking
 
05:24:26.150 --> 05:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
about public policy here the legislature
 
05:24:28.548 --> 05:24:28.558 align:start position:0%
decides public policy
 
05:24:31.110 --> 05:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
net metering is essentially a
 
05:24:31.120 --> 05:24:33.190 align:start position:0%
net metering is essentially a
incentive

05:24:33.190 --> 05:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
incentive
 
05:24:34.788 --> 05:24:34.798 align:start position:0%
with a subsidy
 
05:24:38.708 --> 05:24:38.718 align:start position:0%
to try to encourage more solar energy
 
05:24:42.628 --> 05:24:42.638 align:start position:0%
that was a public policy choice
 
05:24:45.190 --> 05:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
and the legislature gets to decide how
 
05:24:47.830 --> 05:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
much of its money it wants how much of
 
05:24:50.788 --> 05:24:50.798 align:start position:0%
the public's money should be invested
 
05:24:53.830 --> 05:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
in that public policy
 
05:24:55.190 --> 05:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:24:56.390 --> 05:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
is saying
 
05:24:57.990 --> 05:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
that we think
 
05:24:59.830 --> 05:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
that the amount of money that's invested
 
05:25:00.868 --> 05:25:00.878 align:start position:0%
into this
 
05:25:04.150 --> 05:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
public policy this net metering policy
 
05:25:05.590 --> 05:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
should be
 
05:25:05.600 --> 05:25:07.070 align:start position:0%
should be
what's

05:25:07.070 --> 05:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
what's
 
05:25:09.270 --> 05:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
intrinsically the value of the
 
05:25:09.280 --> 05:25:10.868 align:start position:0%
intrinsically the value of the
electricity

05:25:10.868 --> 05:25:10.878 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
05:25:15.590 --> 05:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
not what's intrinsically the value of a
 
05:25:17.750 --> 05:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
utility company's
 
05:25:20.868 --> 05:25:20.878 align:start position:0%
rfp for default service which includes a
 
05:25:22.948 --> 05:25:22.958 align:start position:0%
lot of things
 
05:25:22.958 --> 05:25:24.150 align:start position:0%
lot of things
beyond

05:25:24.150 --> 05:25:24.160 align:start position:0%
beyond
 
05:25:27.910 --> 05:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
simply the electricity
 
05:25:32.150 --> 05:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
now if the puc was conducting
 
05:25:36.070 --> 05:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:36.080 --> 05:25:40.150 align:start position:0%
 
adjudicative

05:25:40.150 --> 05:25:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:43.110 --> 05:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
session on net metering
 
05:25:45.430 --> 05:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
it likely would determine that avoided
 
05:25:45.440 --> 05:25:46.390 align:start position:0%
it likely would determine that avoided
cost

05:25:46.390 --> 05:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
cost
 
05:25:50.628 --> 05:25:50.638 align:start position:0%
is the appropriate value of net metering
 
05:25:50.638 --> 05:25:52.070 align:start position:0%
is the appropriate value of net metering
and

05:25:52.070 --> 05:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:25:54.390 --> 05:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
there have been
 
05:25:57.510 --> 05:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
several lawsuits that have argued for
 
05:25:59.910 --> 05:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
that that have not gone forward because
 
05:26:02.868 --> 05:26:02.878 align:start position:0%
of jurisdictional issues but
 
05:26:05.830 --> 05:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
there has been indication in a lot of
 
05:26:07.430 --> 05:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
legal journals
 
05:26:07.440 --> 05:26:09.510 align:start position:0%
legal journals
that

05:26:09.510 --> 05:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:26:12.470 --> 05:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
barring those jurisdictional problems
 
05:26:14.708 --> 05:26:14.718 align:start position:0%
it's likely that net metering costs
 
05:26:17.910 --> 05:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
would be set at avoided cost
 
05:26:20.070 --> 05:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
perpa for example which was one of the
 
05:26:22.708 --> 05:26:22.718 align:start position:0%
first renewable energy laws passed in
 
05:26:25.350 --> 05:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
this country uses avoided costs as the
 
05:26:25.360 --> 05:26:27.110 align:start position:0%
this country uses avoided costs as the
appropriate

05:26:27.110 --> 05:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
05:26:30.150 --> 05:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
rate if you will for incentivizing
 
05:26:32.070 --> 05:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
renewable energy
 
05:26:33.830 --> 05:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
so i think it's perfectly appropriate
 
05:26:35.190 --> 05:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
for us to
 
05:26:38.310 --> 05:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
set in new hampshire state law
 
05:26:41.590 --> 05:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
that the appropriate compensation for
 
05:26:44.788 --> 05:26:44.798 align:start position:0%
this public policy should be the value
 
05:26:46.390 --> 05:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
of the electricity
 
05:26:48.788 --> 05:26:48.798 align:start position:0%
that is produced and returned to the
 
05:26:48.798 --> 05:26:50.548 align:start position:0%
that is produced and returned to the
grid

05:26:50.548 --> 05:26:50.558 align:start position:0%
grid
 
05:26:52.628 --> 05:26:52.638 align:start position:0%
representative platt i would say we're
 
05:26:54.628 --> 05:26:54.638 align:start position:0%
overpaying even at the voted cost
 
05:26:56.310 --> 05:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't have the attributes
 
05:26:59.030 --> 05:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
of of the people supplying the energy
 
05:27:01.030 --> 05:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
from the from the from uh through isil
 
05:27:02.708 --> 05:27:02.718 align:start position:0%
new england because it could be there
 
05:27:04.390 --> 05:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
could not be there
 
05:27:07.430 --> 05:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
and the the generators are putting it in
 
05:27:08.868 --> 05:27:08.878 align:start position:0%
the market have to guarantee that
 
05:27:11.910 --> 05:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
they're there or they pay otherwise
 
05:27:11.920 --> 05:27:12.868 align:start position:0%
they're there or they pay otherwise
correct

05:27:12.868 --> 05:27:12.878 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:27:14.708 --> 05:27:14.718 align:start position:0%
uh representative mann did you have a
 
05:27:16.070 --> 05:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
comment oh
 
05:27:17.990 --> 05:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
i wanted to agree with the latter
 
05:27:19.910 --> 05:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
comment oh okay
 
05:27:22.150 --> 05:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee yeah thank you mr
 
05:27:22.160 --> 05:27:23.190 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee yeah thank you mr
chairman

05:27:23.190 --> 05:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:27:25.590 --> 05:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
um i agree with you that the legislature
 
05:27:28.948 --> 05:27:28.958 align:start position:0%
has the responsibility and the right to
 
05:27:31.590 --> 05:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh determine what what we're paying what
 
05:27:33.910 --> 05:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
we're uh what we're allotting in terms
 
05:27:36.470 --> 05:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
of incentives and all that
 
05:27:38.548 --> 05:27:38.558 align:start position:0%
i think when we had testimony what we
 
05:27:40.150 --> 05:27:40.160 align:start position:0%
heard was that
 
05:27:40.160 --> 05:27:41.350 align:start position:0%
heard was that
uh

05:27:41.350 --> 05:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:27:41.360 --> 05:27:42.788 align:start position:0%
uh
when

05:27:42.788 --> 05:27:42.798 align:start position:0%
when
 
05:27:45.270 --> 05:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
when deregulation first went in
 
05:27:47.030 --> 05:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
and they looked at how to set these
 
05:27:49.430 --> 05:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
rates they determined that the default
 
05:27:51.990 --> 05:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
service rate would be about right
 
05:27:54.070 --> 05:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
because there were other costs not the
 
05:27:55.510 --> 05:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
same costs as
 
05:27:57.990 --> 05:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
as the utilities or the default service
 
05:27:59.910 --> 05:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
providers but there would be other costs
 
05:28:01.990 --> 05:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
and so they they they did the rough
 
05:28:05.350 --> 05:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
justice thing again right they used this
 
05:28:06.470 --> 05:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
and we
 
05:28:08.390 --> 05:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
did we discussed in that hearing the
 
05:28:10.470 --> 05:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
fact that we were waiting for the value
 
05:28:12.548 --> 05:28:12.558 align:start position:0%
of distributed energy
 
05:28:16.628 --> 05:28:16.638 align:start position:0%
uh study the vd the vder study in order
 
05:28:19.190 --> 05:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
to decide where we go from here is it
 
05:28:21.750 --> 05:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
more valuable than we think is it less
 
05:28:23.990 --> 05:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
valuable than we think and what we're
 
05:28:25.910 --> 05:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
doing with this bill is we're
 
05:28:28.548 --> 05:28:28.558 align:start position:0%
circumventing having the information to
 
05:28:30.628 --> 05:28:30.638 align:start position:0%
make an informed decision and we're
 
05:28:30.638 --> 05:28:31.670 align:start position:0%
make an informed decision and we're
saying

05:28:31.670 --> 05:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
saying
 
05:28:34.868 --> 05:28:34.878 align:start position:0%
ideologically we believe x and so that's
 
05:28:36.310 --> 05:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
what we're gonna do
 
05:28:39.190 --> 05:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
and i just think it's it what it is is
 
05:28:41.430 --> 05:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
disruptive to the market and to people
 
05:28:43.190 --> 05:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
who are trying to invest in cleaner
 
05:28:45.430 --> 05:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
energy solutions and so it's like the
 
05:28:47.430 --> 05:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
state saying basically we're not
 
05:28:48.868 --> 05:28:48.878 align:start position:0%
interested in helping the environment
 
05:28:50.230 --> 05:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
we've decided to go in a different
 
05:28:53.030 --> 05:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
direction and i i just really strongly
 
05:28:55.270 --> 05:28:55.280 align:start position:0%
agree with that as an opinion
 
05:28:57.030 --> 05:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
and i i don't think that that's what
 
05:28:58.390 --> 05:28:58.400 align:start position:0%
we're here for
 
05:29:02.708 --> 05:29:02.718 align:start position:0%
um it seems arbitrary to just pick this
 
05:29:04.788 --> 05:29:04.798 align:start position:0%
and say we're sticking with this when we
 
05:29:06.628 --> 05:29:06.638 align:start position:0%
have no idea how it's going to play
 
05:29:09.670 --> 05:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
itself out in the market
 
05:29:10.948 --> 05:29:10.958 align:start position:0%
but it certainly will act as a
 
05:29:13.430 --> 05:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
disincentive and so it it feels like
 
05:29:16.390 --> 05:29:16.400 align:start position:0%
that's what the objective is here
 
05:29:16.400 --> 05:29:17.510 align:start position:0%
that's what the objective is here
actually

05:29:17.510 --> 05:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
actually
 
05:29:20.470 --> 05:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
it's not ideological it's logical if a
 
05:29:23.030 --> 05:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
commodity on the market is worth worth
 
05:29:24.628 --> 05:29:24.638 align:start position:0%
let's say a nickel
 
05:29:26.868 --> 05:29:26.878 align:start position:0%
then why would you pay someone a nickel
 
05:29:29.030 --> 05:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
plus another nickel for that same
 
05:29:31.910 --> 05:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
commodity that's what this
 
05:29:35.510 --> 05:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
the net service net default service
 
05:29:37.430 --> 05:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
essentially does it says we'll give you
 
05:29:39.190 --> 05:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
a nickel for the electricity and we'll
 
05:29:40.868 --> 05:29:40.878 align:start position:0%
pay another nickel
 
05:29:42.830 --> 05:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
but that's not
 
05:29:42.840 --> 05:29:44.788 align:start position:0%
but that's not
logical

05:29:44.788 --> 05:29:44.798 align:start position:0%
logical
 
05:29:45.990 --> 05:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
well it doesn't it doesn't
 
05:29:46.000 --> 05:29:48.230 align:start position:0%
well it doesn't it doesn't
representative

05:29:48.230 --> 05:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:29:50.390 --> 05:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
logic doesn't always apply in the
 
05:29:52.470 --> 05:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
legislature and i've learned that over
 
05:29:54.070 --> 05:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
25 years
 
05:29:55.990 --> 05:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
i was here when we did the direct
 
05:29:58.070 --> 05:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
deregulation and we set the default
 
05:29:58.080 --> 05:29:59.110 align:start position:0%
deregulation and we set the default
rates

05:29:59.110 --> 05:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
rates
 
05:30:02.230 --> 05:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
we didn't do that in 20 minutes we
 
05:30:05.590 --> 05:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
didn't do that in one hearing and oh
 
05:30:08.948 --> 05:30:08.958 align:start position:0%
let's just arbitrarily fix it we did
 
05:30:11.430 --> 05:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
that over weeks and months
 
05:30:13.350 --> 05:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
and very carefully
 
05:30:13.360 --> 05:30:14.150 align:start position:0%
and very carefully
and

05:30:14.150 --> 05:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:30:17.590 --> 05:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
my belief in this is that
 
05:30:17.600 --> 05:30:18.628 align:start position:0%
my belief in this is that
this

05:30:18.628 --> 05:30:18.638 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:30:21.430 --> 05:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
is not the time
 
05:30:24.788 --> 05:30:24.798 align:start position:0%
to change something it may be it may
 
05:30:28.390 --> 05:30:28.400 align:start position:0%
need to be tweaked i agree it was many
 
05:30:30.390 --> 05:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
years ago that we did this
 
05:30:32.788 --> 05:30:32.798 align:start position:0%
but this is not the time
 
05:30:36.310 --> 05:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
we need to incentivize
 
05:30:39.590 --> 05:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
more of this energy and we know that
 
05:30:42.390 --> 05:30:42.400 align:start position:0%
i think every one of us knows that that
 
05:30:44.708 --> 05:30:44.718 align:start position:0%
we need to get off
 
05:30:47.750 --> 05:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
of gradually get off of fossil fuels to
 
05:30:50.390 --> 05:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
a bigger extent than we are now
 
05:30:52.628 --> 05:30:52.638 align:start position:0%
and to fix this
 
05:30:56.070 --> 05:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
again arbitrarily to save
 
05:30:58.788 --> 05:30:58.798 align:start position:0%
our customers in general
 
05:31:00.788 --> 05:31:00.798 align:start position:0%
a few pennies
 
05:31:02.708 --> 05:31:02.718 align:start position:0%
on their electric bill
 
05:31:05.590 --> 05:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
is not the right move right now if we
 
05:31:08.150 --> 05:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
were going to save millions
 
05:31:10.070 --> 05:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
by cutting this and we were going to say
 
05:31:11.750 --> 05:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
your bill is going to be cut by twenty
 
05:31:14.070 --> 05:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
dollars a month because we think it's
 
05:31:16.788 --> 05:31:16.798 align:start position:0%
gonna go up by thirty dollars a month
 
05:31:19.190 --> 05:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
then i'd say let's do it but i don't
 
05:31:21.670 --> 05:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
think that's the case and i think this
 
05:31:24.788 --> 05:31:24.798 align:start position:0%
is a disincentive so i really believe
 
05:31:27.430 --> 05:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
that this bill instead of
 
05:31:30.470 --> 05:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
going forward needs to be looked at more
 
05:31:32.628 --> 05:31:32.638 align:start position:0%
carefully and by people have more
 
05:31:32.638 --> 05:31:33.990 align:start position:0%
carefully and by people have more
expertise

05:31:33.990 --> 05:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
expertise
 
05:31:35.750 --> 05:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
than me
 
05:31:38.070 --> 05:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
or i'm gonna say generally than i
 
05:31:40.070 --> 05:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
believe is around this table because our
 
05:31:42.708 --> 05:31:42.718 align:start position:0%
expertise was from before
 
05:31:45.590 --> 05:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
this is now so i think we really need to
 
05:31:47.750 --> 05:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
delve into this subject and delve into
 
05:31:50.310 --> 05:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
it carefully
 
05:31:52.230 --> 05:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
that's my two cents
 
05:31:54.150 --> 05:31:54.160 align:start position:0%
representative platt
 
05:31:56.788 --> 05:31:56.798 align:start position:0%
i appreciate representative callie
 
05:31:59.110 --> 05:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
pitt's position with respect to what she
 
05:31:59.120 --> 05:32:00.070 align:start position:0%
pitt's position with respect to what she
thinks

05:32:00.070 --> 05:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
thinks
 
05:32:01.830 --> 05:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
might be valuable but what she
 
05:32:04.310 --> 05:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
attributes that to me that's not
 
05:32:07.110 --> 05:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily true i think the renewable
 
05:32:09.190 --> 05:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
energy quite frankly is is no more
 
05:32:10.948 --> 05:32:10.958 align:start position:0%
valuable than any other energy and i
 
05:32:12.470 --> 05:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
think the climate change stuff is a
 
05:32:15.190 --> 05:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:21.350 --> 05:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:23.350 --> 05:32:23.360 align:start position:0%
it's scientifically unprovable i don't
 
05:32:25.430 --> 05:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
believe i didn't say one word was
 
05:32:27.750 --> 05:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
commenting about the language not not
 
05:32:30.470 --> 05:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
the contention uh which is an opinion
 
05:32:32.310 --> 05:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
you hold and you're you're entitled to
 
05:32:34.708 --> 05:32:34.718 align:start position:0%
that but please refrain from using
 
05:32:36.628 --> 05:32:36.638 align:start position:0%
language that could be offensive
 
05:32:38.310 --> 05:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
representative kelly pittsburgh i did
 
05:32:40.628 --> 05:32:40.638 align:start position:0%
not say one word about climate change
 
05:32:44.390 --> 05:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
what i'm thinking about is right now our
 
05:32:47.510 --> 05:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
supply of electricity and our
 
05:32:50.470 --> 05:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
supply of fossil fuels we know that's in
 
05:32:52.708 --> 05:32:52.718 align:start position:0%
jeopardy every day
 
05:32:54.708 --> 05:32:54.718 align:start position:0%
so that's what i said i didn't say one
 
05:32:56.948 --> 05:32:56.958 align:start position:0%
word about climate change pro or con you
 
05:32:58.788 --> 05:32:58.798 align:start position:0%
can read into that
 
05:33:01.030 --> 05:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
and i know that what i'm going on is
 
05:33:03.510 --> 05:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
from the past and we need to get into
 
05:33:04.628 --> 05:33:04.638 align:start position:0%
the now
 
05:33:07.110 --> 05:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
and i think we again need to look at
 
05:33:09.430 --> 05:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
expertise to do that because the clock
 
05:33:10.868 --> 05:33:10.878 align:start position:0%
is running out
 
05:33:12.628 --> 05:33:12.638 align:start position:0%
that's no excuse to do things
 
05:33:14.708 --> 05:33:14.718 align:start position:0%
willy-nilly or
 
05:33:18.868 --> 05:33:18.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:21.670 --> 05:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
one of the questions that
 
05:33:24.070 --> 05:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
confronts our committee quite frequently
 
05:33:27.510 --> 05:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
and will confront it again
 
05:33:29.590 --> 05:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
once we start receiving bills from the
 
05:33:32.548 --> 05:33:32.558 align:start position:0%
senate during this session
 
05:33:36.470 --> 05:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
is the expansion of net metering
 
05:33:39.270 --> 05:33:39.280 align:start position:0%
and one of the reasons i believe that
 
05:33:41.590 --> 05:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
there is a reluctance to expand neck
 
05:33:43.670 --> 05:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
metering is because of the potential
 
05:33:47.270 --> 05:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
high cost of such expansion
 
05:33:49.030 --> 05:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
a bill like this one
 
05:33:50.628 --> 05:33:50.638 align:start position:0%
which would set
 
05:33:54.230 --> 05:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:56.708 --> 05:33:56.718 align:start position:0%
net metered electricity to the same
 
05:33:58.150 --> 05:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
value as
 
05:34:00.788 --> 05:34:00.798 align:start position:0%
electricity generated in other
 
05:34:03.270 --> 05:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
with by other sources
 
05:34:06.150 --> 05:34:06.160 align:start position:0%
is that it would allow the expansion of
 
05:34:09.750 --> 05:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
net metering without a worry about a
 
05:34:12.390 --> 05:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
rapid expansion in costs
 
05:34:14.230 --> 05:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
so that's another reason to support this
 
05:34:16.628 --> 05:34:16.638 align:start position:0%
bill is if you want
 
05:34:18.310 --> 05:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
for example the university of new
 
05:34:20.708 --> 05:34:20.718 align:start position:0%
hampshire to be included in the
 
05:34:23.030 --> 05:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
municipal group host net metering
 
05:34:25.990 --> 05:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
program that we passed last year in hb
 
05:34:26.000 --> 05:34:27.590 align:start position:0%
program that we passed last year in hb
315

05:34:27.590 --> 05:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
315
 
05:34:29.510 --> 05:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
then you need to set
 
05:34:33.270 --> 05:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
the rate for net metering at a rate that
 
05:34:36.868 --> 05:34:36.878 align:start position:0%
won't greatly expand costs otherwise
 
05:34:38.708 --> 05:34:38.718 align:start position:0%
that may never happen that expansion of
 
05:34:41.190 --> 05:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
net reading may never happen
 
05:34:44.390 --> 05:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
so that's another consideration
 
05:34:46.070 --> 05:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
i think we've talked this uh through
 
05:34:48.310 --> 05:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
pretty thoroughly except representative
 
05:34:50.150 --> 05:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
oxenoum has another thought thank you
 
05:34:51.270 --> 05:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
very much
 
05:34:53.350 --> 05:34:53.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i i haven't spoken
 
05:34:55.830 --> 05:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
on this issue
 
05:34:57.990 --> 05:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow utilities to
 
05:35:01.030 --> 05:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
grossly overcharge customer generators
 
05:35:04.830 --> 05:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:04.840 --> 05:35:06.548 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:35:06.548 --> 05:35:06.558 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:35:07.910 --> 05:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
the value
 
05:35:07.920 --> 05:35:09.350 align:start position:0%
the value
of

05:35:09.350 --> 05:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:35:12.708 --> 05:35:12.718 align:start position:0%
distributed local generation is that it
 
05:35:14.548 --> 05:35:14.558 align:start position:0%
reduces load
 
05:35:18.310 --> 05:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
the big charge on what we pay for energy
 
05:35:21.670 --> 05:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
is at the coincident peak
 
05:35:23.750 --> 05:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
this is load reduction
 
05:35:26.868 --> 05:35:26.878 align:start position:0%
it we don't take power from the grid
 
05:35:29.750 --> 05:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
because we're producing it locally
 
05:35:32.868 --> 05:35:32.878 align:start position:0%
the last entry into the market sets the
 
05:35:35.190 --> 05:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
price for all the entrants in the market
 
05:35:37.670 --> 05:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
so the highest cost you cut out the
 
05:35:40.708 --> 05:35:40.718 align:start position:0%
highest cost producer you substantially
 
05:35:42.230 --> 05:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
reduce costs
 
05:35:45.670 --> 05:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:47.030 --> 05:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
there are others
 
05:35:50.948 --> 05:35:50.958 align:start position:0%
um and i know everybody wants me to to
 
05:35:54.390 --> 05:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
just but i i'll leave it at that
 
05:35:57.830 --> 05:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
load reduction is an enormous value
 
05:35:59.110 --> 05:35:59.120 align:start position:0%
and the money
 
05:36:01.350 --> 05:36:01.360 align:start position:0%
that the reason that you are over
 
05:36:03.510 --> 05:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
charging for default service is that
 
05:36:06.390 --> 05:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
these things transmission charges there
 
05:36:08.470 --> 05:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
are no transmission charges for customer
 
05:36:10.230 --> 05:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
generators so
 
05:36:12.948 --> 05:36:12.958 align:start position:0%
it's the these your your
 
05:36:15.750 --> 05:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
the the utility charges in the default
 
05:36:17.430 --> 05:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
service rate for things that customer
 
05:36:19.510 --> 05:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
generators don't
 
05:36:21.670 --> 05:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
get from them they're paying for a
 
05:36:24.230 --> 05:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
service they don't get
 
05:36:27.510 --> 05:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
and they are not being paid for value
 
05:36:29.270 --> 05:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
they provide
 
05:36:32.948 --> 05:36:32.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:35.830 --> 05:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
peak demand changes all the time and
 
05:36:37.990 --> 05:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
it's incredibly hard to predict when it
 
05:36:39.590 --> 05:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
will happen
 
05:36:39.600 --> 05:36:40.788 align:start position:0%
will happen
so

05:36:40.788 --> 05:36:40.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:36:43.670 --> 05:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
to say that intermittent generation can
 
05:36:46.070 --> 05:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
somehow reduce peak demand
 
05:36:46.080 --> 05:36:46.948 align:start position:0%
somehow reduce peak demand
is

05:36:46.948 --> 05:36:46.958 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:36:49.270 --> 05:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
a falsehood because you can't predict
 
05:36:53.270 --> 05:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:55.350 --> 05:36:55.360 align:start position:0%
that is not a falsehood and i can get
 
05:36:57.750 --> 05:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
you the textual information that
 
05:37:00.230 --> 05:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
demonstrates its validity it's a logical
 
05:37:02.070 --> 05:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
falsehood there may be text out there
 
05:37:04.470 --> 05:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
that asserts that it's not a falsehood
 
05:37:06.230 --> 05:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
but it's a logical falsehood for the
 
05:37:07.750 --> 05:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
following reason if you'll let me
 
05:37:07.760 --> 05:37:09.510 align:start position:0%
following reason if you'll let me
explain

05:37:09.510 --> 05:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
explain
 
05:37:11.110 --> 05:37:11.120 align:start position:0%
if it's intermittent if it's not
 
05:37:13.110 --> 05:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
happening all the time
 
05:37:15.350 --> 05:37:15.360 align:start position:0%
then how can it catch the peak when the
 
05:37:17.430 --> 05:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
peak happens because the peak you can't
 
05:37:18.868 --> 05:37:18.878 align:start position:0%
predict when that's going to happen
 
05:37:21.110 --> 05:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
green power in vermont did this last
 
05:37:23.030 --> 05:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
year and please don't interrupt please
 
05:37:26.310 --> 05:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
let me finish
 
05:37:27.830 --> 05:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
if you can't predict when the peak is
 
05:37:29.590 --> 05:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
going to happen
 
05:37:31.910 --> 05:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
and you're not operating
 
05:37:34.708 --> 05:37:34.718 align:start position:0%
24 7 then your chances of catching the
 
05:37:34.718 --> 05:37:35.590 align:start position:0%
24 7 then your chances of catching the
peak

05:37:35.590 --> 05:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
peak
 
05:37:35.600 --> 05:37:37.110 align:start position:0%
peak
are

05:37:37.110 --> 05:37:37.120 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:37:39.190 --> 05:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
less slim
 
05:37:41.750 --> 05:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
less certainly
 
05:37:41.760 --> 05:37:43.110 align:start position:0%
less certainly
therefore

05:37:43.110 --> 05:37:43.120 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
05:37:46.788 --> 05:37:46.798 align:start position:0%
you can't really say that that
 
05:37:49.110 --> 05:37:49.120 align:start position:0%
is load reduction because it may not be
 
05:37:51.030 --> 05:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
operating at the time that the peak
 
05:37:53.670 --> 05:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
occurs and so it's not reducing
 
05:37:55.270 --> 05:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
the peak at all
 
05:37:57.510 --> 05:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
and so intermittent load reduction is
 
05:37:59.830 --> 05:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
really not load reduction
 
05:38:02.230 --> 05:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
and i think the vder study will show
 
05:38:02.240 --> 05:38:04.070 align:start position:0%
and i think the vder study will show
that

05:38:04.070 --> 05:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:38:05.430 --> 05:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
05:38:06.788 --> 05:38:06.798 align:start position:0%
representative harrington quickly
 
05:38:08.470 --> 05:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
comment on that just one thing we can
 
05:38:11.110 --> 05:38:11.120 align:start position:0%
talk about load reduction in peak we can
 
05:38:13.910 --> 05:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
make some pretty
 
05:38:15.270 --> 05:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
substantial statements about load
 
05:38:17.430 --> 05:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
reduction we know for example load the
 
05:38:19.510 --> 05:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
load peak in new england or new
 
05:38:19.520 --> 05:38:20.628 align:start position:0%
load peak in new england or new
hampshire

05:38:20.628 --> 05:38:20.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:38:23.750 --> 05:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
is in november december january in most
 
05:38:26.310 --> 05:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
likely february going to be sometime
 
05:38:28.310 --> 05:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
after five o'clock when people come home
 
05:38:30.230 --> 05:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
and they're all cranking up their lights
 
05:38:32.470 --> 05:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
and stoves and everything else and we
 
05:38:34.150 --> 05:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
can also be assured that at some time
 
05:38:36.070 --> 05:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
after five o'clock we're getting almost
 
05:38:38.150 --> 05:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
nothing out of solar panels in fact
 
05:38:40.788 --> 05:38:40.798 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's absolutely zero so i i
 
05:38:42.070 --> 05:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
don't want to interrupt but we're going
 
05:38:43.830 --> 05:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
to be losing one of our subs who has
 
05:38:45.750 --> 05:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
another meeting to go off to so i was
 
05:38:47.750 --> 05:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
wondering if we could call the vote i'm
 
05:38:47.760 --> 05:38:48.788 align:start position:0%
wondering if we could call the vote i'm
sorry

05:38:48.788 --> 05:38:48.798 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
05:38:48.798 --> 05:38:49.670 align:start position:0%

okay with that we're going to close the
 
05:40:18.830 --> 05:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
executive session on house bill
 
05:40:21.670 --> 05:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
1629 i have some information from you
 
05:40:24.070 --> 05:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
some late breaking information
 
05:40:26.708 --> 05:40:26.718 align:start position:0%
on monday march 7th we're going to
 
05:40:29.030 --> 05:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
resume the public hearing
 
05:40:33.350 --> 05:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:35.670 --> 05:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
and i have just been informed a few
 
05:40:37.030 --> 05:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
minutes ago
 
05:40:39.750 --> 05:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
that the arborist from eversource will
 
05:40:42.150 --> 05:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
be here at 11 a.m to give us a
 
05:40:44.868 --> 05:40:44.878 align:start position:0%
presentation on how
 
05:40:47.590 --> 05:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
eversource does vegetation management in
 
05:40:49.670 --> 05:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
the state so that could be a very
 
05:40:49.680 --> 05:40:50.948 align:start position:0%
the state so that could be a very
interesting

05:40:50.948 --> 05:40:50.958 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
05:40:53.190 --> 05:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
presentation i'm told he's a very
 
05:40:55.590 --> 05:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
compelling speaker and he gives this
 
05:40:55.600 --> 05:40:57.670 align:start position:0%
compelling speaker and he gives this
presentation

05:40:57.670 --> 05:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
05:40:59.350 --> 05:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
around the state i guess
 
05:41:01.750 --> 05:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
and so it's likely to be
 
05:41:03.830 --> 05:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
a very good presentation so we'll have
 
05:41:03.840 --> 05:41:04.788 align:start position:0%
a very good presentation so we'll have
our

05:41:04.788 --> 05:41:04.798 align:start position:0%
our
 
05:41:06.470 --> 05:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
continuation of the public hearing on
 
05:41:09.590 --> 05:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
1459 starting at 10.
 
05:41:13.270 --> 05:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
we will complete that at 9 45.
 
05:41:17.510 --> 05:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
we will execute at 9 45.
 
05:41:20.548 --> 05:41:20.558 align:start position:0%
10 45 brother 10 45.
 
05:41:20.558 --> 05:41:21.590 align:start position:0%
10 45 brother 10 45.
and

05:41:21.590 --> 05:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:41:23.830 --> 05:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
then we will have the presentation at 11
 
05:41:23.840 --> 05:41:25.110 align:start position:0%
then we will have the presentation at 11
o'clock

05:41:25.110 --> 05:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
05:41:28.708 --> 05:41:28.718 align:start position:0%
so that is our schedule for next week
 
05:41:30.708 --> 05:41:30.718 align:start position:0%
and so we will send you see you on
 
05:41:32.548 --> 05:41:32.558 align:start position:0%
monday the 7th and i'll remind you all
 
05:41:35.190 --> 05:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
that we have a house session on thursday
 
05:41:37.190 --> 05:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
the 10th
 
05:41:38.948 --> 05:41:38.958 align:start position:0%
and with that i thank you all for your
 
05:41:40.868 --> 05:41:40.878 align:start position:0%
hard work today we had some really good
 
05:41:42.708 --> 05:41:42.718 align:start position:0%
stimulating discussions
 
05:41:45.430 --> 05:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
and uh enjoyed it immensely i hope you
 
05:41:52.548 --> 05:41:52.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:54.390 --> 05:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
for the three bills that i'm doing but
 
05:41:56.150 --> 05:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
i'm going to be rewriting
 
05:41:58.548 --> 05:41:58.558 align:start position:0%
the second one at least successing 29 so
 
05:42:00.788 --> 05:42:00.798 align:start position:0%
i'll set they're all in one page
 
05:42:02.470 --> 05:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
i've kept them short so i'll just
 
05:42:17.590 --> 05:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:17.600 --> 05:42:41.590 align:start position:0%
 
oh

05:42:41.590 --> 05:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:41.600 --> 05:42:55.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:42:55.030 --> 05:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:55.040 --> 05:43:07.510 align:start position:0%
 
terrible

05:43:07.510 --> 05:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:09.830 --> 05:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
next thursday it's nine next wednesday
 
05:43:11.110 --> 05:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
wednesday i mean right it's before the
 
05:43:13.110 --> 05:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
house the day before at nine i think
 
05:43:13.120 --> 05:43:13.830 align:start position:0%
house the day before at nine i think
it's

05:43:13.830 --> 05:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:43:15.430 --> 05:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
nine or ten i know they'll probably put
 
05:43:39.430 --> 05:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:45.990 --> 05:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:46.000 --> 05:44:49.910 align:start position:0%
 
is

05:44:49.910 --> 05:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:49.920 --> 05:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
you
