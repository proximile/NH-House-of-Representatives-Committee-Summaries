00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:02.360 align:start position:0%
in RSA we had an incorrect definition of
 
00:00:04.829 --> 00:00:04.839 align:start position:0%
brook trout the definition was brook
 
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:07.320 align:start position:0%
trout meant and it listed all these
 
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
other non-native trout species like
 
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
brown trout and rainbow trout um at that
 
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
time the department promised that they
 
00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:18.279 align:start position:0%
would um deal with the issue of wild
 
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
trout management plan not being updated
 
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 align:start position:0%
not being added to be come up with a
 
00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 align:start position:0%
comprehensive plan and uh and so as an
 
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
agreement we decided to Simply strike
 
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
the incorrect definition out of our say
 
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
and I had a personal promise from the
 
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 align:start position:0%
Department that this would be handled
 
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
within a year it's been two years and as
 
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
I um in meetings told them that this
 
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
would that the effect of this not being
 
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
dealt with would in fact be um
 
00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 align:start position:0%
legislating I did meet with the
 
00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 align:start position:0%
department and they were very reasonable
 
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 align:start position:0%
I understand there's been a bunch of
 
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 align:start position:0%
Staffing changes that may have led to a
 
00:00:54.029 --> 00:00:54.039 align:start position:0%
delay that they have in fact just
 
00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
recently done some good updates um but
 
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
this will codify and make make sure that
 
00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 align:start position:0%
the wild trout management plan as an
 
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
idea stays one of the UH
 
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the department
 
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
without um micromanaging what those
 
00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 align:start position:0%
criteria will be that should be left to
 
00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:15.310 align:start position:0%
criteria will be that should be left to
the

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
biologists so uh in those meetings with
 
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 align:start position:0%
Department the department indicated that
 
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
they were fine with the language um for
 
00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 align:start position:0%
the most part uh the fiscal note came
 
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
back as quite High because they were
 
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
worried about the work
 
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 align:start position:0%
um Native they said that even though we
 
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
all know that in courts it's the Miriam
 
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
Webster's Third Edition that um that the
 
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 align:start position:0%
definitions go to and that definition of
 
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
native has nothing to do with DNA but
 
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 align:start position:0%
biologically they were worried about
 
00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 align:start position:0%
having to to genetically test and so I
 
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
agreed to strike those words from the
 
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 align:start position:0%
language and if you will look at this
 
00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:54.719 align:start position:0%
packet this is the updated fiscal
 
00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 align:start position:0%
analysis based on the amendment that I
 
00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 align:start position:0%
provided um at the request of the
 
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 align:start position:0%
department which strikes the word native
 
00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
the fiscal updated fiscal analysis says
 
00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 align:start position:0%
the department anticipates no fiscal
 
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 align:start position:0%
department uh at that time the division
 
00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 align:start position:0%
testified to the commission that they
 
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
were fine with this as long as the
 
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
amendment was in place and the
 
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 align:start position:0%
commission uh tentatively said that they
 
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
would be supportive however later the
 
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
commission decided to oppose it
 
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
primarily on the basis that the wording
 
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
um says Department shall instead of
 
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
executive director shall and that is a
 
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
amendment also I have learned that trout
 
00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 align:start position:0%
unlimited has taken objection to the on
 
00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 align:start position:0%
line nine that the department May set
 
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 align:start position:0%
forth additional restrictions in
 
00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
addition to the restrictions I set here
 
00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
again I'm only codifying part the main
 
00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 align:start position:0%
part the heart of wild trout management
 
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 align:start position:0%
M plan I'm not codifying anything else
 
00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 align:start position:0%
but the idea that department say may set
 
00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879 align:start position:0%
forth additional restrictions they're
 
00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
already doing that they already
 
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
administer the wild trout management
 
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
plan I'm not enabling them for anything
 
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 align:start position:0%
they don't already currently do and in
 
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 align:start position:0%
fact that was one of the commission's
 
00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 align:start position:0%
arguments is that they already have the
 
00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
power and want to um not be dictated to
 
00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 align:start position:0%
as no Department ever wants to be
 
00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
dictated to but unfortunately it is our
 
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility so because trout
 
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 align:start position:0%
unlimited has said or is claiming I
 
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
believe that uh the May set forth
 
00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 align:start position:0%
additional restrictions implies an
 
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 align:start position:0%
increased uh empowerment of the
 
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
department I have added as the last page
 
00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:46.159 align:start position:0%
of that Amendment an identical Amendment
 
00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:48.159 align:start position:0%
to the one that got the zero fiscal
 
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 align:start position:0%
impact but with the inclusion of one
 
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
word which is fishing the department May
 
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 align:start position:0%
set forth additional fishing
 
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
restrictions which as we all know the
 
00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 align:start position:0%
department is already enabled to so I am
 
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 align:start position:0%
uh a little little bit interested to
 
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 align:start position:0%
know if uh if trout unlimited
 
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
understands that the department is
 
00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
already enable to do that uh finally I
 
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 align:start position:0%
did pass out this this is a picture in
 
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
our committee office it's right over the
 
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
chair's desk in our committee office and
 
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
this kind of this was put out this
 
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 align:start position:0%
poster was put out by the fish and game
 
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 align:start position:0%
department as you can see at the bottom
 
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
it says the cold waterer fish of New
 
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and this is kind of gets to
 
00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:26.759 align:start position:0%
the point of the problem actually
 
00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 align:start position:0%
because in this entire poster the only
 
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
two fish that are actually endemic to
 
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and still extent as in not
 
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
exted from New Hampshire we didn't make
 
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 align:start position:0%
them extinct in New Hampshire and are in
 
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
fresh water are the brook trout and the
 
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 align:start position:0%
lake trout the rainbow and the brown are
 
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
stocked the landlock salmon are stocked
 
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
um and the Atlantic salmon are
 
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.830 align:start position:0%
um and the Atlantic salmon are
extrap

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
extrap
 
00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 align:start position:0%
so the fact that we say that the fish of
 
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is all these fish that are
 
00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
not of New Hampshire because we've
 
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 align:start position:0%
stocked so many and in impacted our
 
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
natural ecosystem and have outcompeted
 
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
our natural and Native species is the
 
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 align:start position:0%
problem and so that's why I commend the
 
00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:10.759 align:start position:0%
department for the creation of wild
 
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
trout management I just want to make
 
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 align:start position:0%
sure that they do um their due diligence
 
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
in potentially expanding it and um and
 
00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 align:start position:0%
not getting rid of it as some of the
 
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
people who are impacted by this are
 
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 align:start position:0%
afraid that they will and with that I'm
 
00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
happy to take
 
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative do we
 
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
have any questions representative kofalt
 
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
my question pertains to the prohibition
 
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
against uh fishing through the ice from
 
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
the ice um or from any object supported
 
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
by the ice um and I don't have line
 
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 align:start position:0%
numbers on the the one I'm looking at so
 
00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:54.919 align:start position:0%
I apologize it's section 2E y um would
 
00:05:57.749 --> 00:05:57.759 align:start position:0%
this Pro would this
 
00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 align:start position:0%
provision um affect ly prohibit ice
 
00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.039 align:start position:0%
fishing in any location where it is
 
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
currently Allowed no this is so this
 
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
language including what you just read is
 
00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
directly lifted from the current wild
 
00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 align:start position:0%
trout management plan so the department
 
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
has currently prohibited ice fishing
 
00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919 align:start position:0%
with that exact language in the 16
 
00:06:24.749 --> 00:06:24.759 align:start position:0%
Waters that are in that program so this
 
00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
does not require that the department add
 
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 align:start position:0%
to that list there is an encouragement
 
00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:31.160 align:start position:0%
that they go over and that the executive
 
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
director will produce a report at the
 
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
end of every rules um change period
 
00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 align:start position:0%
every 10 years saying why they did or
 
00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:42.039 align:start position:0%
did not add Waters what they considered
 
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:43.720 align:start position:0%
but it does not require that any water
 
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
be added to that program or that any
 
00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:49.479 align:start position:0%
other restrictions and certainly they
 
00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
are already enabled to do restrictions
 
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
anyway so it's not enabling them to do
 
00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:54.199 align:start position:0%
anything they don't already have the
 
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 align:start position:0%
do any other questions
 
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.670 align:start position:0%
do any other questions
representative

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:04.840 align:start position:0%
Darby thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you talked a lot I
 
00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:09.759 align:start position:0%
think about sections one and two but
 
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
section three is is the review of the um
 
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
the wild management trout or the the
 
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
trout Waters themselves what's the
 
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
what's your goal there my goal is so the
 
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
the complaint of the people who are
 
00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:25.759 align:start position:0%
concerned about our native fish species
 
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire the complaint has been
 
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
that the wild trout management plan
 
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
appears to have fallen by the wayside
 
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
with the Department no Waters have been
 
00:07:35.469 --> 00:07:35.479 align:start position:0%
added information has gotten more scarce
 
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
and so the point of the third paragraph
 
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
which does nothing except for require a
 
00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:40.919 align:start position:0%
report and many many reports are
 
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:42.680 align:start position:0%
required of the director usually on an
 
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
annual basis this is one every 10 years
 
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
so to be consistent with the rules
 
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
change process um is to say look you at
 
00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:53.919 align:start position:0%
least have to list out the waters that
 
00:07:56.029 --> 00:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
you're considering and say why you're
 
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
why you've added or not added or removed
 
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
give us the the rationale behind it and
 
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
that would only happen once every 10
 
00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:04.360 align:start position:0%
years but there's no requirement for
 
00:08:06.029 --> 00:08:06.039 align:start position:0%
them to actually do anything other than
 
00:08:07.309 --> 00:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
report that they actually are
 
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
considering it so that it doesn't fall
 
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:15.149 --> 00:08:15.159 align:start position:0%
wayside thank you any further
 
00:08:18.029 --> 00:08:18.039 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I apologize I have
 
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
to go across the hall but I'll be back
 
00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.070 align:start position:0%
to go across the hall but I'll be back

I'll hold people to three minutes but
 
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
excessive good morning Mr chair and
 
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee for

the record my name is representative
 
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
Susan portelli I represent District 19
 
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:52.959 align:start position:0%
in Rockingham Hampton Falls and
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
Kenington I support this bill I am here
 
00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:00.200 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of several of of my
 
00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:03.320 align:start position:0%
constituents my constituents are Avid
 
00:09:04.829 --> 00:09:04.839 align:start position:0%
hunters and
 
00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
fishermen they enjoy trout fishing and
 
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
they want to be able to teach their kids
 
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
and their grandkids the joy of what it
 
00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
means to be out on a beautiful day
 
00:09:18.509 --> 00:09:18.519 align:start position:0%
hunting and fishing he wants to teach
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
his grandchildren and works with other
 
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
fathers in a similar position to make
 
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
sure that they teach their kids they
 
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
pass down this very important tradition
 
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
to their kids the objective is to get
 
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
the kids off the phones and off the
 
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:39.160 align:start position:0%
devices and into nature and really
 
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
understanding how beautiful our state is
 
00:09:45.949 --> 00:09:45.959 align:start position:0%
and what a joy it is to enjoy nature and
 
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
respect nature and not be on the phone
 
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
this has proven to be such a wonderful
 
00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
program for these kids because they
 
00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
really get to experience something
 
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
that's real and not
 
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
virtual however if there are no fish to
 
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
catch the kids get bored very easily and
 
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
of course they want to go home and play
 
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
with their games so I support this
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
Common Sense build to be able to manage
 
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:21.640 align:start position:0%
our wonderful resource and make sure
 
00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:23.240 align:start position:0%
that there
 
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
are trout and these native species
 
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:29.560 align:start position:0%
available for many years to come I
 
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
believe this bill aside from the
 
00:10:35.629 --> 00:10:35.639 align:start position:0%
administration of it will be able to
 
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:38.200 align:start position:0%
provide these beautiful trout in many
 
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
different Waters in New Hampshire so
 
00:10:45.069 --> 00:10:45.079 align:start position:0%
that kids and grandkids can be able to
 
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
enjoy the beautiful sport of fishing and
 
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
get out in nature and in make sure that
 
00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
they're taking part
 
00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:57.959 align:start position:0%
in teaching their friends and their kids
 
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
to be able to Jo enjoy this sport
 
00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:03.560 align:start position:0%
forever and to be able to support what
 
00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
we believe in here in New Hampshire how
 
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
much we value our natural resources so
 
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
that's why I support this bill and I
 
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:15.240 align:start position:0%
encourage everyone to think about the
 
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
future and making sure that we have
 
00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
these beautiful fish to be able to catch
 
00:11:24.509 --> 00:11:24.519 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you are there any
 
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony today the chair
 
00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:39.240 align:start position:0%
CSF and three to five minutes probably
 
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
less thank you thank you Mr chair
 
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee thank
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
you for your time this
 
00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
morning uh for the record my name is
 
00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
Fred bird I am the assistant manager of
 
00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:49.519 align:start position:0%
the nor eastern states for the
 
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
Congressional Sportsman's Foundation CSF
 
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:54.440 align:start position:0%
uh speaking to you guys today that we uh
 
00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
at CSF are opposing this bill uh we
 
00:11:59.790 --> 00:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
believe the legislation is unnecessary
 
00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:01.240 align:start position:0%
as the department already has the
 
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
authority to manage for wild trout New
 
00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has 16 trout Waters currently
 
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
designated as wild trout only uh where
 
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
we do not stock so in essence uh the
 
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
department already has and does
 
00:12:15.949 --> 00:12:15.959 align:start position:0%
illustrate a wild management wild trout
 
00:12:18.629 --> 00:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
Management program should existing wild
 
00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:20.959 align:start position:0%
trout Waters demonstrate that reducing
 
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
or eliminating non-native or non-endemic
 
00:12:25.069 --> 00:12:25.079 align:start position:0%
Trout Stockings increase the abundance
 
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
or health of brook trout populations
 
00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:29.000 align:start position:0%
again the department already has
 
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
authority to expand the number of waters
 
00:12:34.509 --> 00:12:34.519 align:start position:0%
to include stockings when justified by
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
science U we also have concerns as
 
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
previously uh noted about the ice
 
00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:45.160 align:start position:0%
fishing issue uh it's inferred that the
 
00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:47.320 align:start position:0%
direction of the bill requires less
 
00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:49.720 align:start position:0%
non-native endemic trout stalking over
 
00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:51.839 align:start position:0%
time as well as specifically eliminating
 
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
ice fishing where Native brook trout are
 
00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
found it is not science-based and will
 
00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily limit Angling opport
 
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
unties in the state the language on line
 
00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
15 Section e is kind of ambiguous and
 
00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
could be more dialed in uh so someone
 
00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
reading updated fishing game digest
 
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
would know that you can still ice fish
 
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:15.560 align:start position:0%
in certain Waters of the state um and
 
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
lastly I I will remark that in the
 
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
turkey Woods gobbles equal hunting
 
00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:25.480 align:start position:0%
satisfaction in the fishing Waters fish
 
00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:27.800 align:start position:0%
caught equal satisfaction and I can
 
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:29.560 align:start position:0%
remember back to being a 12-year-old boy
 
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
going down to the exitor river fishing
 
00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
for stocked rainbow trout and my
 
00:13:36.629 --> 00:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
satisfaction was was there was happy and
 
00:13:38.829 --> 00:13:38.839 align:start position:0%
it created an angler in me created an
 
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
angler in my friends uh that we weren't
 
00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
on video games and we were out there in
 
00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
the Wilds of New Hampshire enjoying the
 
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:47.480 align:start position:0%
natural and and introduce resources so
 
00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
there's a a huge value there and would
 
00:13:51.189 --> 00:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
like to see it continue so thank you all
 
00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:55.160 align:start position:0%
for your time thank you do we have any
 
00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
00:13:59.470 --> 00:13:59.480 align:start position:0%
testimony today
 
00:14:01.949 --> 00:14:01.959 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes Nick Martin from
 
00:14:04.189 --> 00:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
Lichfield representing
 
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:10.829 --> 00:14:10.839 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you thank
 
00:14:14.189 --> 00:14:14.199 align:start position:0%
you I appreciate the time here today and
 
00:14:15.829 --> 00:14:15.839 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the time to talk about this
 
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
bill um first I just wanted to actually
 
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
um make sure you bring the mic close yes
 
00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I certainly don't want to
 
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
speak for representative Reed and I
 
00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
definitely don't want to speak for TR
 
00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:26.680 align:start position:0%
unlimited but I think she may have
 
00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
misspoken her original uh introduction
 
00:14:31.949 --> 00:14:31.959 align:start position:0%
here um my impression was that tread
 
00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
unlimited is was not concerned about the
 
00:14:36.749 --> 00:14:36.759 align:start position:0%
section that she had mentioned they may
 
00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
have other concerns it was actually New
 
00:14:39.749 --> 00:14:39.759 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Timberland Owners Association
 
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
that was concerned about the language
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
regarding uh additional restrictions and
 
00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
so the amendment to add fishing would in
 
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
my belief resolve the concerns around a
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
potential land owner and Timberland
 
00:14:54.749 --> 00:14:54.759 align:start position:0%
harvesting rules um that the department
 
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
May uh doesn't currently have the
 
00:14:59.310 --> 00:14:59.320 align:start position:0%
authority to set so um so uh I'm a
 
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
lifelong angler and like many people
 
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
brook trout were the species that really
 
00:15:04.749 --> 00:15:04.759 align:start position:0%
hooked me and captured my attention so
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
I'm here today as an example of why the
 
00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
well trout Management program in New
 
00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has been successful and I hope
 
00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:12.920 align:start position:0%
to explain why I think we need to do
 
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
more with it um you know many years ago
 
00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
I stumbled on a web page that explained
 
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
and introduced New Hampshire's wild
 
00:15:20.189 --> 00:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
trout Management program and the next
 
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
weekend I drove to one of those Waters
 
00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
and it rekindled My Love For Those wild
 
00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:26.680 align:start position:0%
places and fish um there are a lot of
 
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
reasons why I find searching for wild
 
00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
trout to be more satisfying than fishing
 
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:33.720 align:start position:0%
for stocked fish um and I've talked with
 
00:15:35.629 --> 00:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
literally hundreds of fellow Anglers
 
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
over the years um going to shows and
 
00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
exhibitions um and everyone has their
 
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
own reasons for me it's Nostalgia
 
00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
wrapped in uh Adventure stepped inside
 
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:48.680 align:start position:0%
of a puzzle about how to catch those
 
00:15:51.389 --> 00:15:51.399 align:start position:0%
fish that are native to the water
 
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
um as I said other people have their own
 
00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
reasons uh but I can say from my
 
00:15:58.030 --> 00:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
experience that talking with many people
 
00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
interest in wild trout is growing here
 
00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
in the State uh I've heard that our wild
 
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
trout Management program in New
 
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could be in trouble and it's
 
00:16:07.069 --> 00:16:07.079 align:start position:0%
true that no Waters have been added to
 
00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
protect under this program since 2006
 
00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
and while I've seen progress from New
 
00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fishing game in regard to
 
00:16:15.309 --> 00:16:15.319 align:start position:0%
rethinking the stocking of Hatchery fish
 
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
over wild trout in some Waters I also
 
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
seen what I consider to be an outsize
 
00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
focus on an investment in stocking uh
 
00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
with recent financial investments in
 
00:16:26.829 --> 00:16:26.839 align:start position:0%
Hatchery infrastructure totaling into
 
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
hundreds of millions of dollars while
 
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
spending on habitat restoration for
 
00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:32.440 align:start position:0%
Wildfish remains in my opinion an
 
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
insignificant fraction of that number um
 
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
the intention of this bill in my mind is
 
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
to codify into law and make more durable
 
00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:42.079 align:start position:0%
the protections under the current
 
00:16:43.949 --> 00:16:43.959 align:start position:0%
program the fact of the matter is that
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
the protections these Waters have today
 
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
is subject to the discretion of the
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
department and could be changed by whim
 
00:16:53.309 --> 00:16:53.319 align:start position:0%
uh by current or future leadership I
 
00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:55.240 align:start position:0%
think these Waters deserve more durable
 
00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:56.959 align:start position:0%
protection for their future and this
 
00:16:59.189 --> 00:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
bill also codifies while management as a
 
00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
real program rather than just a set of
 
00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
fishing regulations uh depending on how
 
00:17:06.429 --> 00:17:06.439 align:start position:0%
you look at this new program um it might
 
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
be a call to protect a delicate resource
 
00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
for the future or it could be a way to
 
00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:12.839 align:start position:0%
Champion and promote an untapped
 
00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
resource an untapped interest in Wild
 
00:17:17.789 --> 00:17:17.799 align:start position:0%
Fisheries that dare I say might even
 
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
increase new license sales by showing
 
00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:21.400 align:start position:0%
more Anglers how unique New Hampshire's
 
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
Fisheries really are I think it should
 
00:17:25.789 --> 00:17:25.799 align:start position:0%
be both of these things the bill
 
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
provides a lot of latitude to fishing
 
00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
game it gives the department authority
 
00:17:30.909 --> 00:17:30.919 align:start position:0%
to choose Waters it wants to include
 
00:17:32.909 --> 00:17:32.919 align:start position:0%
immedately sets a floor level for the
 
00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
fishing regulations applied to those
 
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
Waters and it's my hope that the
 
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
formalization of this program an
 
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
accompanying report will help raise
 
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
awareness and support for New
 
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's wild trout populations the
 
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
most important aspects of this bill in
 
00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
my opinion are the prohibition on
 
00:17:48.909 --> 00:17:48.919 align:start position:0%
Stocking Waters and the use of
 
00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
artificial lures and flies which
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
therefore prohibits live
 
00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
bait wild brook trout fac many threats
 
00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
but the introduction of non-native fish
 
00:17:59.750 --> 00:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
through stocking or the of Li baate that
 
00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:01.400 align:start position:0%
compete with those trout for food and
 
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
habitat are two of the most harmful
 
00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:05.240 align:start position:0%
threats but they're also the easiest to
 
00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
solve for I've heard some concern that
 
00:18:09.789 --> 00:18:09.799 align:start position:0%
calling out and naming these Waters
 
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
specifically could actually harm the
 
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
fish rather than protecting them by
 
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
increasing the angular pressure on those
 
00:18:17.909 --> 00:18:17.919 align:start position:0%
Waters um I think it's a legitimate
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
concern though I would point out that
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
the waters listed today are already
 
00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:22.760 align:start position:0%
listed on the department's website
 
00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
that's where I found them originally
 
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
when I um when I went searching for them
 
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
um but that's also why this bill
 
00:18:31.549 --> 00:18:31.559 align:start position:0%
contains the other restrictive and
 
00:18:33.909 --> 00:18:33.919 align:start position:0%
protective fishing regulations Catch and
 
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
Release eliminates the concern around
 
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
over har harvesting of these Wildfish
 
00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
and the single barbless hooks reduces
 
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
inadvertent uh Catch and Release
 
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:45.400 align:start position:0%
mortality um as Anglers we Face a funny
 
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
Dilemma on the one hand we know that as
 
00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
a group we are responsible for the B
 
00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:53.000 align:start position:0%
vast majority of money raised to help
 
00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
protect and preserve our Fisheries so we
 
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
need to ensure people continue to
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
appreciate these fish in the way that we
 
00:18:57.919 --> 00:18:58.990 align:start position:0%
appreciate these fish in the way that we
do

00:18:58.990 --> 00:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:01.960 align:start position:0%
and recruit more angr on the other hand
 
00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:03.919 align:start position:0%
we bemoan the times we arrive at our
 
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
favorite fishing spot and find someone
 
00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:07.799 align:start position:0%
else already there in today's connected
 
00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
world of blogs YouTube and social media
 
00:19:12.029 --> 00:19:12.039 align:start position:0%
I don't think we can keep the names of
 
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
these wild trout water secret forever so
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
rather than fight a losing battle to
 
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
keep these secrets I feel we need to
 
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
proactively protect them we should enact
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
regulations that would help sustain
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
these Fisheries for when not if the word
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
gets out and the fishing regulations in
 
00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:28.600 align:start position:0%
this bill I think provide the those
 
00:19:31.149 --> 00:19:31.159 align:start position:0%
protections I'd also argue that if these
 
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
concerns are true that publicizing the
 
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
names of waters containing wild trout
 
00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
would significantly increase pressure
 
00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
that it would prove that there's demand
 
00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
for more wild trout fishing
 
00:19:42.909 --> 00:19:42.919 align:start position:0%
opportunities than exist or that people
 
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
are aware of today we shouldn't be
 
00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
afraid of activating more interest in
 
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
Wild Fisheries because I believe this
 
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
interest will ultimately lead to a more
 
00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
active and coordinated efforts for more
 
00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
people to protect these Waters and
 
00:19:57.789 --> 00:19:57.799 align:start position:0%
that's exactly the reason I'm here today
 
00:20:00.149 --> 00:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
Wild Management in New Hampshire spurred
 
00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:01.960 align:start position:0%
my interest in these Wildfish and I'm
 
00:20:04.669 --> 00:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
here to help enact those protections on
 
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
additional Waters with the hope that
 
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
it'll activate more interest and
 
00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:10.760 align:start position:0%
positive action from others be happy to
 
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
take any
 
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative Smith you recognized for
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
a question thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question you
 
00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:21.400 align:start position:0%
made a statement that no Waters have
 
00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:24.440 align:start position:0%
been added since 2006 are you aware of
 
00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
any reason scientific or not as to why
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
Waters have not been added
 
00:20:31.149 --> 00:20:31.159 align:start position:0%
uh I am not aware that um that would be
 
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
a good question for the Department
 
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
representative um there are many Waters
 
00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
in this state that are could be eligible
 
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
for protection um many Waters contain uh
 
00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
wild populations of Brook tro um many
 
00:20:47.029 --> 00:20:47.039 align:start position:0%
contain Waters at the level the density
 
00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
level meaning the population of fish um
 
00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:55.789 --> 00:20:55.799 align:start position:0%
program any other questions
 
00:20:57.149 --> 00:20:57.159 align:start position:0%
representative Darby you're recognized
 
00:20:59.430 --> 00:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you Mr chair thank
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so I'll tell
 
00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:03.880 align:start position:0%
you that um fishing for wild Brook Trail
 
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
in northeastern Vermont was one of the
 
00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919 align:start position:0%
memories that I hold very dear
 
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
personally um one of the uh earlier um
 
00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:13.960 align:start position:0%
speakers representative mentioned um the
 
00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
reason she supported the bill was for um
 
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
promoting you know um getting kids
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
involved in fishing um this bill
 
00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
requires uh limits um the use to
 
00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
artificial lures um I'm wondering so
 
00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:31.960 align:start position:0%
when I was a kid um I used worms um I
 
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
think you you mentioned that I if I
 
00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
understood correctly that the goal of
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
that was to avoid introducing a species
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
which I assume what you mean is um
 
00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:45.640 align:start position:0%
through minnows um and I'm wondering
 
00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
what your perspective as a fisherman
 
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
from an early age is on the kids using
 
00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
artificial lures for trout yeah
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
excellent question um I so my first
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
fishing EXP experience was worms and a
 
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
bobber I think that was true many people
 
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:06.200 align:start position:0%
um I personally um my my primary concern
 
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:08.440 align:start position:0%
again is the use of fish as bait as
 
00:22:10.269 --> 00:22:10.279 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting because those Fish can
 
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
be introduced to Waters where they don't
 
00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
belong and out compete native uh species
 
00:22:18.909 --> 00:22:18.919 align:start position:0%
and um personally I don't have a strong
 
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
prohibition on uh on using worms as bait
 
00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
I think it's a perfectly reasonable
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
thing especially for kids to use um I
 
00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:29.919 align:start position:0%
feel this case though that these Waters
 
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
some of these Waters uh are sensitive
 
00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
enough and what I mean by that is the
 
00:22:36.909 --> 00:22:36.919 align:start position:0%
size of the water and the population of
 
00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
the fish uh to Warrant more strict
 
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
protections based on um How likely they
 
00:22:44.669 --> 00:22:44.679 align:start position:0%
are to receive pressure and the impact
 
00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
of that pressure so um I would suggest
 
00:22:49.789 --> 00:22:49.799 align:start position:0%
that these specific regulations uh
 
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
aren't a good fit for every water in
 
00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:53.720 align:start position:0%
this state and uh I would also suggest
 
00:22:56.789 --> 00:22:56.799 align:start position:0%
that um I'm not here to Advocate against
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
stocking in all cas cases I feel like
 
00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:01.480 align:start position:0%
stocked fish are a great introduction
 
00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:07.240 align:start position:0%
for uh for younger Anglers um and so um
 
00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
I think these protections though are
 
00:23:13.269 --> 00:23:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799 align:start position:0%
Waters any further questions seeing none
 
00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:19.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
today the chair recognizes Steve angers
 
00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
from Center
 
00:23:28.149 --> 00:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
Conway uh representing North Country and
 
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
Anglers fast for 5 minutes we're running
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
slightly late so the shorter the better
 
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you thank you Mr
 
00:23:44.789 --> 00:23:44.799 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee um the
 
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
North Country
 
00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:49.960 align:start position:0%
angler is the second longest continually
 
00:23:52.269 --> 00:23:52.279 align:start position:0%
operating Fly Shop in New
 
00:23:56.269 --> 00:23:56.279 align:start position:0%
England and it started in 1969 and
 
00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
obviously uh that business business
 
00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:01.400 align:start position:0%
would not have lasted for 55 years if
 
00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire didn't have a ro robust uh
 
00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:09.400 align:start position:0%
trout fishery um but in addition to uh
 
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
to uh being the fifth owner and
 
00:24:14.549 --> 00:24:14.559 align:start position:0%
protector of the North Country angler
 
00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
franchise um I feel it's my
 
00:24:20.669 --> 00:24:20.679 align:start position:0%
responsibility to also represent my
 
00:24:23.269 --> 00:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
constituents you know there's thousands
 
00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:26.200 align:start position:0%
of Anglers that come see me every year
 
00:24:28.149 --> 00:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
and of course every Angler has an
 
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
opinion about the
 
00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
fishing and I will tell you that in the
 
00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
last seven years that I've owned the
 
00:24:35.269 --> 00:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
North Country
 
00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:38.200 align:start position:0%
angler customers are actually excited
 
00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
about coming to New Hampshire to
 
00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
fish and um I think that comes from the
 
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
new team that's at fishing game I have
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
all the respect in the world for
 
00:24:54.549 --> 00:24:54.559 align:start position:0%
executive director Mason you know he's
 
00:24:59.630 --> 00:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
taken on some of the some of the um
 
00:25:03.149 --> 00:25:03.159 align:start position:0%
stuck in stuck in the past ideas
 
00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
including um you know naming a chief of
 
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
Inland Fisheries whose whole background
 
00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:12.440 align:start position:0%
is cold waterer fish in brook trout and
 
00:25:15.909 --> 00:25:15.919 align:start position:0%
I happen to have met um Chief Timmons on
 
00:25:17.549 --> 00:25:17.559 align:start position:0%
a trout stream in
 
00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:21.320 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts 25 years ago so I know the
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
chief very well and I know that that
 
00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
wild trout and brook trout are Hur
 
00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
number one priority and I feel really
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
super great about that as well um but in
 
00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:37.960 align:start position:0%
addition to being a fly shop owner um
 
00:25:40.669 --> 00:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
I'm a member of trout unlimited I am the
 
00:25:43.269 --> 00:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
chair of the New Hampshire State Council
 
00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
uh trout management
 
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
committee and uh I also feel that though
 
00:25:52.669 --> 00:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
being in those two positions it was
 
00:25:55.389 --> 00:25:55.399 align:start position:0%
important for me to participate at the
 
00:25:55.399 --> 00:25:56.470 align:start position:0%
important for me to participate at the
commission

00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:25:59.110 --> 00:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
level and and uh the Commissioners will
 
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
tell you I think sometimes they get sick
 
00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
of seeing me but I make 11 out of 12
 
00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
meetings commission meetings no matter
 
00:26:09.669 --> 00:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
where they are I even go down to
 
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
Seabrook once in May and get my chance
 
00:26:15.389 --> 00:26:15.399 align:start position:0%
to uh go to Browns and have my fried
 
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
clam plate but um you know wherever the
 
00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
meeting is I'm there because I feel like
 
00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
I have to represent my Anglers and my
 
00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:28.120 align:start position:0%
passion for wild brook trout
 
00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
um just to quickly segue representative
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
Smith your question about why no Waters
 
00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:37.720 align:start position:0%
were have been added um previous
 
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
administration did not believe in Wild
 
00:26:42.909 --> 00:26:42.919 align:start position:0%
brook trout and in fact spun the myth
 
00:26:44.789 --> 00:26:44.799 align:start position:0%
that there were no wild brook trout in
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and that every water had
 
00:26:48.909 --> 00:26:48.919 align:start position:0%
to be stocked but of course through our
 
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
work with trout unlimited you know we
 
00:26:54.149 --> 00:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
and and working with Diane when she was
 
00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
cold water Fisheries biologist we were
 
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
able to bust uh bust that myth so um and
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
I think probably one of the one of the
 
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
things that uh that uh really makes me
 
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
proud to be a granite stator um is that
 
00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:13.559 align:start position:0%
the governor chose me to be the
 
00:27:15.149 --> 00:27:15.159 align:start position:0%
conservation group through trout
 
00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:17.480 align:start position:0%
unlimited and the North Country angler
 
00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
through business to be on his Fish
 
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
Hatchery advisory committee and I will
 
00:27:25.149 --> 00:27:25.159 align:start position:0%
tell you if you if you have not seen
 
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
that report I'd be more than happy to
 
00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:29.960 align:start position:0%
get you a copy but I will tell you that
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
embedded in that report to the governor
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
are discussions and protections for our
 
00:27:39.269 --> 00:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
wild brook trout so protecting wild
 
00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:42.440 align:start position:0%
brook trout 20 years ago when the
 
00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
current program was put into place was
 
00:27:46.909 --> 00:27:46.919 align:start position:0%
necessary because people didn't want to
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
believe in Wild Brook chout but I will
 
00:27:52.669 --> 00:27:52.679 align:start position:0%
tell you that um at least a third of the
 
00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:54.799 align:start position:0%
customers that come through my
 
00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
door want to know where to find a wild
 
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
Brook out and we are blessed with the
 
00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
White Mountain National Forest and we
 
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
are blessed with the great North Woods
 
00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
that we do have those waters for wild
 
00:28:11.909 --> 00:28:11.919 align:start position:0%
brook trout and uh we work very D
 
00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
diligently I also think sometimes uh
 
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
Chief Timmons gets sick of seeing my
 
00:28:19.669 --> 00:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
face once a month as well but uh I will
 
00:28:21.789 --> 00:28:21.799 align:start position:0%
tell this committee right now that there
 
00:28:25.149 --> 00:28:25.159 align:start position:0%
is plenty of work being done to protect
 
00:28:27.509 --> 00:28:27.519 align:start position:0%
and Foster wild Brook show not only to
 
00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
protect the resource but because it's
 
00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
what Anglers are coming to New Hampshire
 
00:28:34.029 --> 00:28:34.039 align:start position:0%
and buying a license and want to fish
 
00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
for so um I guess just in conclusion uh
 
00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
the other reason that I'm against this
 
00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:44.440 align:start position:0%
bill is that there are already uh
 
00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
methods in
 
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
place that if you feel like a stream
 
00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:52.360 align:start position:0%
needs to be added to Wild trout program
 
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
or needs wild trout protection there is
 
00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
already a system in place of filing a
 
00:29:00.909 --> 00:29:00.919 align:start position:0%
petition with the executive director to
 
00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
ask him to consider changing regulations
 
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
protective regulations for a trout
 
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
stream or a trout pond and I will tell
 
00:29:11.669 --> 00:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
you in the seven years that I've been
 
00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:14.360 align:start position:0%
going to commission meetings I have not
 
00:29:18.029 --> 00:29:18.039 align:start position:0%
seen one petition come in front of the
 
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
of the director or the commission to put
 
00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:24.559 align:start position:0%
those protections on water so um with
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
that I'd be more than willing to uh
 
00:29:27.909 --> 00:29:27.919 align:start position:0%
answer any question questions that you
 
00:29:30.909 --> 00:29:30.919 align:start position:0%
may have thank you much I repres I
 
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
recognize representative
 
00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:35.720 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
for your testimony
 
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
um I too have seen fishing game what
 
00:29:42.269 --> 00:29:42.279 align:start position:0%
they're doing in the North country and
 
00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
you know limit limiting some of the
 
00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:47.320 align:start position:0%
stalking in those trout streams that are
 
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
designated and they are doing a fabulous
 
00:29:52.789 --> 00:29:52.799 align:start position:0%
job in getting that done my question
 
00:29:52.799 --> 00:29:55.029 align:start position:0%
job in getting that done my question
goes

00:29:55.029 --> 00:29:55.039 align:start position:0%
goes
 
00:29:58.149 --> 00:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
to the process and how what happens and
 
00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
I just F do do you believe
 
00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
that some of the folks are not coming
 
00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.710 align:start position:0%
that some of the folks are not coming
forward

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:07.720 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:10.919 align:start position:0%
for adding Waters because and you as
 
00:30:12.789 --> 00:30:12.799 align:start position:0%
well as me being from doing fishing up
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
in the North Country all have our secret
 
00:30:16.509 --> 00:30:16.519 align:start position:0%
spots that that's probably one of the
 
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
reasons why new streams are not being
 
00:30:22.149 --> 00:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
added well I what I will say is again as
 
00:30:24.549 --> 00:30:24.559 align:start position:0%
the owner of the North Country angler is
 
00:30:26.509 --> 00:30:26.519 align:start position:0%
part of the Mystique of the wild brook
 
00:30:29.149 --> 00:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
trout is finding
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
them they don't want a list they want to
 
00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:37.240 align:start position:0%
they will I I sell hundreds of White
 
00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
Mountain National Forest Maps every year
 
00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
and it's called Thin Blue lining and
 
00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
Anglers buy that map and they look at a
 
00:30:48.029 --> 00:30:48.039 align:start position:0%
Thin Blue Line and they find a trail and
 
00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
they walk up into the forest and they
 
00:30:53.669 --> 00:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
fish these places part of the lore of
 
00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
the wild brook trout is finding a spot
 
00:30:58.950 --> 00:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
for yourself me
 
00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
personally um my motto is remote Pond
 
00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:04.840 align:start position:0%
Madness I have a float tube that goes in
 
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
the back of my truck on the fourth
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
Saturday in April and never leaves it
 
00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
till October 15th and I hike into remote
 
00:31:15.909 --> 00:31:15.919 align:start position:0%
ponds if it's not at least a mile in
 
00:31:20.789 --> 00:31:20.799 align:start position:0%
it's not worth my time and I see no one
 
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
I have it to myself so personally
 
00:31:26.269 --> 00:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
speaking I don't want to see a list of
 
00:31:28.509 --> 00:31:28.519 align:start position:0%
all my wild TR pawns put on the internet
 
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
because I won't have it to myself any
 
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
longer followup and one more quick
 
00:31:36.509 --> 00:31:36.519 align:start position:0%
follow up I
 
00:31:39.389 --> 00:31:39.399 align:start position:0%
know maybe three years ago where we had
 
00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
a severe
 
00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
drought there were a number of streams
 
00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:44.870 align:start position:0%
drought there were a number of streams
small

00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
small
 
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
streams no trout to be found because of
 
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
how severe that drought was
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
um did you just comment on that as
 
00:31:57.509 --> 00:31:57.519 align:start position:0%
to comes to um ecological system me the
 
00:31:59.190 --> 00:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
the number one problem we have with wild
 
00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
Brook shout right now is climate
 
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
change and um you know you know the
 
00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
floods that we've had this season
 
00:32:09.909 --> 00:32:09.919 align:start position:0%
unfortunately those floods occurred
 
00:32:12.149 --> 00:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
right when the right when the eggs were
 
00:32:13.549 --> 00:32:13.559 align:start position:0%
hatching in the
 
00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
Reds and so I will and perhaps the chief
 
00:32:19.789 --> 00:32:19.799 align:start position:0%
will speak to this but I do not have a
 
00:32:21.909 --> 00:32:21.919 align:start position:0%
really good feeling that uh that we're
 
00:32:24.909 --> 00:32:24.919 align:start position:0%
going to have a good recruitment year um
 
00:32:27.909 --> 00:32:27.919 align:start position:0%
for trout this year but that's that's a
 
00:32:30.269 --> 00:32:30.279 align:start position:0%
climate change thing you would be very
 
00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
hard pressed to show me a water where
 
00:32:35.149 --> 00:32:35.159 align:start position:0%
the trout fishing has gone down because
 
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
of angler pressure I mean Anglers just
 
00:32:40.669 --> 00:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
don't even kill fish anymore
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
so thank you any further questions
 
00:32:46.149 --> 00:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey um I don't have a
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
list of the speakers so I might be
 
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
asking the wrong person this question
 
00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
but I go to the fishing Game Commission
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
meetings as well so we've yes we've seen
 
00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
each other there and I remember one uh
 
00:32:59.629 --> 00:32:59.639 align:start position:0%
meeting and she smil smiling where um a
 
00:33:03.629 --> 00:33:03.639 align:start position:0%
very detailed plan about um taking care
 
00:33:07.789 --> 00:33:07.799 align:start position:0%
of our uh fishery or the fish in our um
 
00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
lakes and so forth was given at a fish
 
00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
and game meeting um it it went on for
 
00:33:16.909 --> 00:33:16.919 align:start position:0%
longer than I wanted it to
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
but it was it was very detailed so U my
 
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
question is um and maybe she can answer
 
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
it better than you if we attend those
 
00:33:28.269 --> 00:33:28.279 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game meetings will we continue
 
00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:31.240 align:start position:0%
to get those kinds of detailed reports
 
00:33:33.789 --> 00:33:33.799 align:start position:0%
at the Fish and Game Commission meetings
 
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
uh well it's again you know you will get
 
00:33:38.549 --> 00:33:38.559 align:start position:0%
the actual detail from the chief but um
 
00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
my experience has been that at least
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
once every six months one of the guest
 
00:33:45.389 --> 00:33:45.399 align:start position:0%
speakers has something to do with
 
00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
Fisheries thank
 
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
Brown uh thank you Mr chair thanks for
 
00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh maybe I'm doing
 
00:33:56.269 --> 00:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
too much writing and not enough
 
00:33:56.279 --> 00:33:57.950 align:start position:0%
too much writing and not enough
listening

00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
listening
 
00:34:00.029 --> 00:34:00.039 align:start position:0%
I caught that you said another reason
 
00:34:01.269 --> 00:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
I'm against this because there are
 
00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:03.240 align:start position:0%
already methods in place but I didn't
 
00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:04.360 align:start position:0%
catch in the
 
00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
beginning in your statements that you
 
00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:09.919 align:start position:0%
were against it for another reason and
 
00:34:12.669 --> 00:34:12.679 align:start position:0%
did I miss that oh the other reason was
 
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
was publicizing the places where the
 
00:34:17.869 --> 00:34:17.879 align:start position:0%
Wildfish are got it thank you
 
00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:19.919 align:start position:0%
yeah any further questions
 
00:34:19.919 --> 00:34:21.349 align:start position:0%
yeah any further questions
representative

00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
Ford thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:34:26.349 --> 00:34:26.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question and good to see you
 
00:34:30.349 --> 00:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
here at this committee meeting um my
 
00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
first well my question is if the program
 
00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:37.720 align:start position:0%
works and people are talking about trout
 
00:34:40.349 --> 00:34:40.359 align:start position:0%
why not codify what works right we have
 
00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:42.919 align:start position:0%
all these things that in government that
 
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
don't work and we have them in law but
 
00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:47.320 align:start position:0%
this does work why not codify it so that
 
00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:49.399 align:start position:0%
we continue to have this growth in our
 
00:34:51.629 --> 00:34:51.639 align:start position:0%
trout population in the Anglers being
 
00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:54.200 align:start position:0%
able to fish in waters with more native
 
00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
species of trout here in New Hampshire
 
00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
why not codify so that we know we can
 
00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
have this in 10 years 20 years 50 years
 
00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:02.680 align:start position:0%
instead of the hope that people will
 
00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:05.839 align:start position:0%
continue to um want to do it out of the
 
00:35:07.829 --> 00:35:07.839 align:start position:0%
goodness of their heart and the love of
 
00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
fish rather we know it works let's copy
 
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
it uh I mean this this is my personal
 
00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:17.720 align:start position:0%
opinion I'm I mean we're in the Live
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
Free or Die State the less the fewer
 
00:35:22.349 --> 00:35:22.359 align:start position:0%
laws where they're not needed the better
 
00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:24.280 align:start position:0%
that that's just my
 
00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
opinion thank you followup yes I app I
 
00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate that okay sure um um I as you
 
00:35:33.069 --> 00:35:33.079 align:start position:0%
can see I don't have my computer over I
 
00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
usually do when when we're in in
 
00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:37.480 align:start position:0%
hearings just to check up on information
 
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
and you said um about the publishing and
 
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:42.280 align:start position:0%
other other um testimonies also
 
00:35:44.589 --> 00:35:44.599 align:start position:0%
mentioned about publishing and I'm just
 
00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:48.040 align:start position:0%
wondering um the the program the trout
 
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
program already published the the spot
 
00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering as a as a millennial I
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
could find everything on the internet
 
00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:57.400 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't I be a able to find these
 
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
secret Waters published for um blogs on
 
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
um author Pages angr United Pages things
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
like that of secret Waters to fish these
 
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
trout um why are we concerned that our
 
00:36:11.349 --> 00:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
department of fishing game are
 
00:36:13.589 --> 00:36:13.599 align:start position:0%
publishing these spots when Anglers are
 
00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:16.280 align:start position:0%
already doing so even the the ones at
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
your remote alone spot probably
 
00:36:20.309 --> 00:36:20.319 align:start position:0%
somewhere out there on the internet of
 
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
the best place to go fishing why are we
 
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
concerned about publishing when it comes
 
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
to our actual Department of fishing game
 
00:36:28.349 --> 00:36:28.359 align:start position:0%
well that's true and that that's that's
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
something that we're going to have to
 
00:36:32.109 --> 00:36:32.119 align:start position:0%
battle going forward is going to be the
 
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
ease of
 
00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:35.960 align:start position:0%
information but um I will tell you that
 
00:36:40.109 --> 00:36:40.119 align:start position:0%
I have had discussions with the chief on
 
00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
perhaps as part of her future Wildlife
 
00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
Management you know trout management
 
00:36:47.829 --> 00:36:47.839 align:start position:0%
plan that uh some of these places are
 
00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:49.720 align:start position:0%
going to need more restrictive limits if
 
00:36:51.349 --> 00:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
we're going to move forward in that in
 
00:36:51.359 --> 00:36:52.550 align:start position:0%
we're going to move forward in that in
that

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
manner but again that that's something
 
00:36:57.150 --> 00:36:57.160 align:start position:0%
that can be worked out through through
 
00:36:58.910 --> 00:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
the executive director through the chief
 
00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
and through the commission it doesn't
 
00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
need my opinion it does not need to be
 
00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:05.480 align:start position:0%
worked out through the legislature thank
 
00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:07.880 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:12.200 align:start position:0%
testimony today thank you so
 
00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
much I now recognize the last speaker of
 
00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
the of this bill uh Diane Timmons
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
game thank you chair thank you committee
 
00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to start with a little
 
00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:31.400 align:start position:0%
history and I'm going to try to do this
 
00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:34.520 align:start position:0%
all in five minutes I promise so um I
 
00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:37.480 align:start position:0%
think it's really important to note that
 
00:37:40.349 --> 00:37:40.359 align:start position:0%
um sorry let me start with um on behalf
 
00:37:43.069 --> 00:37:43.079 align:start position:0%
of the commission we oppose this bill uh
 
00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:46.280 align:start position:0%
we oppose it for several reasons one of
 
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
which the rules are already in place and
 
00:37:53.349 --> 00:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
this would lock those specific rules
 
00:37:56.829 --> 00:37:56.839 align:start position:0%
into an RSA that admittedly through
 
00:37:59.550 --> 00:37:59.560 align:start position:0%
research we've determined that some of
 
00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:01.839 align:start position:0%
these rules we want to change as part of
 
00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:05.560 align:start position:0%
the wild trout Management program and um
 
00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
secondly because we would like to keep
 
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
that ability to have adaptive management
 
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
and make those changes as research
 
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
changes as we Garner information from
 
00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
various locations the other thing to
 
00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:23.560 align:start position:0%
mention is that RSA locks a multitude of
 
00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
waters into one standard and there are
 
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
the reason part of the reason some of
 
00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
this has been idle is because we're
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
determining that not all Waters meet the
 
00:38:39.309 --> 00:38:39.319 align:start position:0%
criteria that we currently have in place
 
00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:41.240 align:start position:0%
and so we're in the process of working
 
00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
through that and then simultaneously um
 
00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
also identifying that it is an anger not
 
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
an angler thing which of course rules
 
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
and rsas pertain to it's actually a
 
00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
habitat thing we have limit Li mited
 
00:38:58.710 --> 00:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
conditions in our habitat in New
 
00:39:02.829 --> 00:39:02.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um that locks us into
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
small fish small bugs and Anglers on
 
00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
behalf of several responsive management
 
00:39:13.069 --> 00:39:13.079 align:start position:0%
surveys Anglers are have a preference
 
00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:16.040 align:start position:0%
for catchable siiz fish and they're not
 
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
looking to Target those 3-in wild fish
 
00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
that we have throughout New Hampshire
 
00:39:23.069 --> 00:39:23.079 align:start position:0%
they're hoping to get something bigger
 
00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
and so that is part of our
 
00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility and so with that I just
 
00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
want to give a little bit of history and
 
00:39:31.589 --> 00:39:31.599 align:start position:0%
the history is so over fishing has been
 
00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
a problem in this state for well over a
 
00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
hundred years we've had issues um where
 
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:51.880 align:start position:0%
bass perch you name it we brought it in
 
00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:54.200 align:start position:0%
we brought in Pacific salmon which is
 
00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
totally ridiculous but we did it and it
 
00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
was to provide an opportunity to Anglers
 
00:40:02.069 --> 00:40:02.079 align:start position:0%
because angling in the state of New
 
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a huge recreational um
 
00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
activity and so for example 3.5 million
 
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
days in 2022 were spent by Anglers
 
00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
fishing so it is a huge aspect it
 
00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
provides $1.4 billion dollar to our
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
economy angling is not going away but in
 
00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
an effort to maintain angling because of
 
00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
our poor water water quality we have
 
00:40:31.349 --> 00:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
resorted to stocking and um and also
 
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
obviously over fishing because our water
 
00:40:37.069 --> 00:40:37.079 align:start position:0%
quality is poor our populations are um
 
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
do struggle in some cases and so angling
 
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
um through stalking is an opportunity
 
00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:47.800 align:start position:0%
that allows it to continue so um part of
 
00:40:50.349 --> 00:40:50.359 align:start position:0%
the issue so we brought in those other
 
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
species we're doing stalking as part of
 
00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:55.960 align:start position:0%
the current management strategy we've
 
00:40:58.910 --> 00:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
been using technology using radio
 
00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
telemetry looking at populations that we
 
00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
know of large wild Brook shout in the
 
00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:06.760 align:start position:0%
dead Diamond you know looking at those
 
00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
populations looking at their behavior
 
00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:11.720 align:start position:0%
their actions and then looking at the
 
00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
challenges that they suffer and so one
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
of the big things is connectivity we
 
00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
found that in areas where fish can move
 
00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
they do those populations tend to be
 
00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
larger and also the um areas that are
 
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:27.400 align:start position:0%
gated tend to have larger so we know
 
00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:30.440 align:start position:0%
that capture is a part of it um and we
 
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
know that habitat's a part of it so most
 
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
of our locations do not have big areas
 
00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:39.160 align:start position:0%
without culs without dams without um
 
00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
roads and so we're looking at um stream
 
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
Crossings we're looking at habitat
 
00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:48.680 align:start position:0%
renovation habitat um restoration and
 
00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
we're looking at um documenting where
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
these wild populations exist um as far
 
00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
as someone had noted regarding you know
 
00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:00.280 align:start position:0%
where these places are uh last year I
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
created a map that it's a map of our
 
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
stocking you can basically look at that
 
00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:07.720 align:start position:0%
map and know where we stock fish in the
 
00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire you'll note that
 
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
there's areas that have transitioned I
 
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
have removed all of the um smaller
 
00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
streams because we know that those areas
 
00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:20.440 align:start position:0%
do have populations of wild brck trout
 
00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
we also know that they don't get a ton
 
00:42:24.829 --> 00:42:24.839 align:start position:0%
of pressure and so there was really no
 
00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:26.680 align:start position:0%
point in putting brck trout where they
 
00:42:28.349 --> 00:42:28.359 align:start position:0%
or other trout where they weren't going
 
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
to be utilized by Anglers we move those
 
00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
down to the more popular spots let the
 
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
wild fish do their thing up in the
 
00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
Headwater areas and basically um again
 
00:42:41.309 --> 00:42:41.319 align:start position:0%
these are smaller fish they're smaller
 
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
populations they're not huge um but you
 
00:42:46.829 --> 00:42:46.839 align:start position:0%
can look at that map and you can
 
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
identify every place in the state that
 
00:42:51.549 --> 00:42:51.559 align:start position:0%
most likely has wild brick outout
 
00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:53.480 align:start position:0%
because they are areas that I don't
 
00:42:55.829 --> 00:42:55.839 align:start position:0%
stalk and so um the White Mountains
 
00:42:58.870 --> 00:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
there's tons of locations so part of the
 
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
other point I wanted to make is that
 
00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:03.800 align:start position:0%
part of this program the wild trout
 
00:43:06.549 --> 00:43:06.559 align:start position:0%
program had objectives by us we were
 
00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
looking at providing an
 
00:43:11.309 --> 00:43:11.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity for Anglers that were
 
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
seeking wild trout while maintaining
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
that population so we didn't want to
 
00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:20.440 align:start position:0%
provide locations that only had small
 
00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
fish so just because something's not
 
00:43:25.309 --> 00:43:25.319 align:start position:0%
listed here doesn't mean we're doing a
 
00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
ton of sampling in the background and so
 
00:43:33.069 --> 00:43:33.079 align:start position:0%
we have located over 4,000 sites that
 
00:43:36.109 --> 00:43:36.119 align:start position:0%
we've electrofished in New Hampshire and
 
00:43:38.589 --> 00:43:38.599 align:start position:0%
um if anybody's interested it is public
 
00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:41.240 align:start position:0%
information I can give you that map but
 
00:43:43.829 --> 00:43:43.839 align:start position:0%
um a lot of these locations the average
 
00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:47.240 align:start position:0%
size is 3.5 in so that's why I say
 
00:43:49.549 --> 00:43:49.559 align:start position:0%
they're really small and so part of the
 
00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
goal of this program was to identify
 
00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
locations that provided a a larger than
 
00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
average size opportunity or a larger
 
00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:03.160 align:start position:0%
quantity of fish to be able to fish over
 
00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
and so although something hasn't been
 
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
listed um of course there have been um
 
00:44:10.589 --> 00:44:10.599 align:start position:0%
transitions in staff that is correct I
 
00:44:12.549 --> 00:44:12.559 align:start position:0%
was one of them I'm the one that talked
 
00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
to representative Reed and made that
 
00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
promise and then I came here to conquer
 
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
it so my apologies to that um and the
 
00:44:23.069 --> 00:44:23.079 align:start position:0%
program was idle and just recently my
 
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
new hire just went back to Pennsylvania
 
00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
but um again because this is important I
 
00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
know it's important um we've
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
subcontracted with him to continue
 
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
working on the trout management plan so
 
00:44:37.589 --> 00:44:37.599 align:start position:0%
that we can actually move this forward
 
00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:41.000 align:start position:0%
and um start indicating where we are
 
00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:43.160 align:start position:0%
with the wild trout work that we've been
 
00:44:45.790 --> 00:44:45.800 align:start position:0%
doing in the background so um just
 
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure I note that
 
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
obviously the solution here um we don't
 
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
want to keep the the commission does not
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
want to keep these rules TOS in an RSA
 
00:45:00.109 --> 00:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that we are doing
 
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
science all the time and we we need that
 
00:45:05.109 --> 00:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
flexibility to make sure that we're
 
00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:07.160 align:start position:0%
managing things appropriately to meet
 
00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:09.880 align:start position:0%
the goals so with that I'll take any
 
00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:11.240 align:start position:0%
questions thank you are there any
 
00:45:14.829 --> 00:45:14.839 align:start position:0%
questions representative Harvey um first
 
00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman I need to apologize to
 
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
you I think the my last question I
 
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
forgot to address you and thank you and
 
00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:23.640 align:start position:0%
that was not a slight on my part I just
 
00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
get involved in the conversation and
 
00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:29.480 align:start position:0%
move on enthusiasm is a great thing so I
 
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
do apologize for that so thank you Mr
 
00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:45:37.349 --> 00:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
question so um I was just wondering if
 
00:45:40.549 --> 00:45:40.559 align:start position:0%
you um what you're if there I hear all
 
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
of these things that you're doing to
 
00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
develop your um plan for trout
 
00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:47.480 align:start position:0%
management and they all sound wonderful
 
00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:50.920 align:start position:0%
do you base your plan on um other states
 
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
at all or is it just um New Hampshire
 
00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
yeah no so so new um so first of all New
 
00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:00.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has never had a wild trout Pro
 
00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:04.280 align:start position:0%
I mean excuse me a trout management plan
 
00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:07.160 align:start position:0%
which of course would include stocking
 
00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
as well as wild trout management so we
 
00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:13.000 align:start position:0%
have never had a plan so it's a new plan
 
00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
so we are absolutely using other states
 
00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
looking at those the unfortunate part of
 
00:46:21.549 --> 00:46:21.559 align:start position:0%
US versus them so just to give you an
 
00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:25.480 align:start position:0%
idea um both Maine and Vermont have much
 
00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
better water quality so our trout
 
00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:31.000 align:start position:0%
management criteria the initial program
 
00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:33.839 align:start position:0%
or the current program is 15 kg per
 
00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
hectare other states aren't even looking
 
00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
at Wild trout programs that are less
 
00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:42.520 align:start position:0%
than 50 so our Waters of this and I
 
00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
misspoke I apologize we've actually done
 
00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:48.680 align:start position:0%
over 9,000 sites of those we have 4,000
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
that are showing um or a little over
 
00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
4,000 that are showing brck trout
 
00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
presence so we definitely have areas
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
where we're not finding brook trout a
 
00:46:58.950 --> 00:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
lot of those are warm warmer locations
 
00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
Beaver ponds you know that um surface
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
water influence but um so yeah we are
 
00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
definitely using other states looking at
 
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
their criteria and then we've developed
 
00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:12.280 align:start position:0%
um our own criteria based that's why
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
we're doing all of this sampling in the
 
00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:17.480 align:start position:0%
in the woods and in the setbacks and in
 
00:47:19.390 --> 00:47:19.400 align:start position:0%
areas where we know wild brook trout and
 
00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
no influen by stocking have occurred so
 
00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
that we can actually document what's
 
00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
happening in our own locations but
 
00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
definitely size for size so um I can
 
00:47:32.109 --> 00:47:32.119 align:start position:0%
tell you for example in the dead Diamond
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
Watershed because I did a lot of work up
 
00:47:37.069 --> 00:47:37.079 align:start position:0%
there in the dead Diamond wated same
 
00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
length a 17-inch brook trout yep believe
 
00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:43.079 align:start position:0%
it or not we have them um a 17-in brook
 
00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:47.240 align:start position:0%
trout was a pound less than its neighbor
 
00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
right in the malloway the dead Diamond
 
00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
flows into the malloway they share
 
00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
locations on hot ears those fish that
 
00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:55.400 align:start position:0%
live in Maine were a pound heavier for
 
00:47:57.790 --> 00:47:57.800 align:start position:0%
the same same length fish so very
 
00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
different water quality which impacts
 
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
everything thank you any further
 
00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:05.800 align:start position:0%
questions representative Darby thank you
 
00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
question sure um excluding you know
 
00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
section two which is line 8 which is
 
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
where the requirements are for um for
 
00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:17.750 align:start position:0%
where the requirements are for um for
fishing

00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
fishing
 
00:48:20.589 --> 00:48:20.599 align:start position:0%
requirements um we heard that past
 
00:48:22.829 --> 00:48:22.839 align:start position:0%
administrations haven't maybe
 
00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
appreciated the um the wild cold fishery
 
00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
as much what would the um what would the
 
00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
commission recommend in terms of making
 
00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
sure that future administrations don't
 
00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:38.680 align:start position:0%
um don't ignore this important fishery
 
00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
this the wild fishery in the
 
00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
future I think that um part of our part
 
00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
of our future focus is just the
 
00:48:50.109 --> 00:48:50.119 align:start position:0%
transparency so having where we're
 
00:48:52.789 --> 00:48:52.799 align:start position:0%
stocking locations having that data
 
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
where we're identifying wild brook trout
 
00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
popul ation you know all of this
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
technology is is new and it's definitely
 
00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
something that we're embracing in both
 
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
the wildlife Division and the Fisheries
 
00:49:08.190 --> 00:49:08.200 align:start position:0%
division so I think that inevitably
 
00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
because there's going to be so much
 
00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
better um data Outreach and that type of
 
00:49:16.349 --> 00:49:16.359 align:start position:0%
stuff I think it will inevitably fall
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
into place to what you're saying so I'm
 
00:49:21.630 --> 00:49:21.640 align:start position:0%
I'm I guess maybe a part of me doesn't
 
00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:24.200 align:start position:0%
really know how to answer that but um
 
00:49:26.309 --> 00:49:26.319 align:start position:0%
that that would be what I'd say that we
 
00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
we are all on board in trying to make
 
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
sure that we're doing stuff responsibly
 
00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:35.720 align:start position:0%
answering to our goals and our um
 
00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:38.200 align:start position:0%
objectives and then also making sure
 
00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
that folks know what's happening behind
 
00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:47.549 --> 00:49:47.559 align:start position:0%
welcome representative Brown uh thank
 
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
question clarify for me I think I might
 
00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
know the answer I'm sorry oh sorry um
 
00:49:57.069 --> 00:49:57.079 align:start position:0%
when you say poor water quality you're
 
00:49:59.190 --> 00:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
not you're not talking about either Dees
 
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
or EPA water quality standards no can
 
00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
you clarify what that means along with
 
00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:06.440 align:start position:0%
the 15 kilograms per hectare that you
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
happened to mention short time ago sure
 
00:50:12.270 --> 00:50:12.280 align:start position:0%
so um the water quality that I'm talking
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
about is welcome to the Granite State so
 
00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
unlike our neighbors we have no calcium
 
00:50:21.069 --> 00:50:21.079 align:start position:0%
so calcium is really important for
 
00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:23.720 align:start position:0%
exoskeletons on in macroinvertebrates
 
00:50:25.829 --> 00:50:25.839 align:start position:0%
it's part of their development so
 
00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.079 align:start position:0%
literally this simple because we have
 
00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
smaller bugs we have smaller fish and so
 
00:50:34.589 --> 00:50:34.599 align:start position:0%
um until they switch over to a pacious
 
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
diet which is that they're eating other
 
00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
fish that's really when they start their
 
00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:40.760 align:start position:0%
growth and unfortunately in some of
 
00:50:42.549 --> 00:50:42.559 align:start position:0%
these smaller locations we just don't
 
00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
have that but if we um you'll note that
 
00:50:48.789 --> 00:50:48.799 align:start position:0%
a lot of places in um Southern North the
 
00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
southern east turn side of the United
 
00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
States they do a lot of lming like in um
 
00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
Virginia and whatnot they do a lot of
 
00:50:59.430 --> 00:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
limestone addition because of their acid
 
00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
and they're doing that to add that
 
00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:04.040 align:start position:0%
calcium to change the alkalinities and
 
00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:07.400 align:start position:0%
to buffer their water systems and we we
 
00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
just don't have that it's very expensive
 
00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:12.200 align:start position:0%
it's not something that we could ever do
 
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately because we have brick
 
00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
outout everywhere
 
00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:18.520 align:start position:0%
literally thank you're
 
00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:20.720 align:start position:0%
welcome any other
 
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:23.640 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
Khan thank you Mr chair
 
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question sure um
 
00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
in your handout you know you mentioned
 
00:51:34.990 --> 00:51:35.000 align:start position:0%
that on January 16 the commission had
 
00:51:38.309 --> 00:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
extensive discussion regarding this bill
 
00:51:40.270 --> 00:51:40.280 align:start position:0%
and I'm pretty sure that they also
 
00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
discussed that how if this if this uh
 
00:51:47.549 --> 00:51:47.559 align:start position:0%
management policy need to be changed or
 
00:51:49.549 --> 00:51:49.559 align:start position:0%
modified or anything
 
00:51:53.789 --> 00:51:53.799 align:start position:0%
right yeah did uh follow up Mr
 
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
chairman uh did they come up with any
 
00:51:59.349 --> 00:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
modification or anything that needed or
 
00:52:01.549 --> 00:52:01.559 align:start position:0%
they they didn't feel that it is needed
 
00:52:04.069 --> 00:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
at this time no they didn't come up with
 
00:52:06.430 --> 00:52:06.440 align:start position:0%
any policies at this time because it
 
00:52:08.829 --> 00:52:08.839 align:start position:0%
they know that the Inland Fisheries
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
division is working on that currently
 
00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:15.880 align:start position:0%
and So the plan is to present our
 
00:52:18.789 --> 00:52:18.799 align:start position:0%
findings and um the management plan
 
00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
draft at that time and then discussion
 
00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:24.359 align:start position:0%
will be had follow up Mr chairman follow
 
00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
up so um in previous um testimony we
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
heard that in for many years there was
 
00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
not one petition to the commission to
 
00:52:36.349 --> 00:52:36.359 align:start position:0%
change or modify this
 
00:52:36.359 --> 00:52:38.789 align:start position:0%
change or modify this
program

00:52:38.789 --> 00:52:38.799 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:52:42.549 --> 00:52:42.559 align:start position:0%
um and also you mentioned that uh the
 
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
the commission needs some flexibility to
 
00:52:50.109 --> 00:52:50.119 align:start position:0%
have not to tie their hand in this uh
 
00:52:53.109 --> 00:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
program so you don't we don't need
 
00:52:53.119 --> 00:52:54.230 align:start position:0%
program so you don't we don't need
another

00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:56.190 align:start position:0%
another
RSA

00:52:56.190 --> 00:52:56.200 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
00:53:01.630 --> 00:53:01.640 align:start position:0%
yes thank you y any other
 
00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:05.960 align:start position:0%
questions Ford thank you Mr chair thank
 
00:53:08.589 --> 00:53:08.599 align:start position:0%
you sure Chief timens I never know if
 
00:53:11.470 --> 00:53:11.480 align:start position:0%
it's director or chief great not
 
00:53:16.549 --> 00:53:16.559 align:start position:0%
director not yet um I I'm just wondering
 
00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:19.960 align:start position:0%
um because from my understanding I I I'm
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
one of those people I have to explain
 
00:53:23.230 --> 00:53:23.240 align:start position:0%
what I'm thinking so get my question
 
00:53:25.549 --> 00:53:25.559 align:start position:0%
correctly sure this bills BAS basically
 
00:53:28.390 --> 00:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
saying we want to have this program be
 
00:53:31.069 --> 00:53:31.079 align:start position:0%
codified and here are the here are the
 
00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
restrictions that must go on Waters if
 
00:53:35.069 --> 00:53:35.079 align:start position:0%
they're in this program and then the
 
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
last piece which I think um is important
 
00:53:41.710 --> 00:53:41.720 align:start position:0%
is the reporting every 10 years of um of
 
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
this program about the program and why
 
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
we're choosing the waters and I'm just
 
00:53:49.870 --> 00:53:49.880 align:start position:0%
wondering what part of one is that your
 
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
understanding of this bill that we it's
 
00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
going to get codified we have some
 
00:53:56.349 --> 00:53:56.359 align:start position:0%
restrictions and that there's a report
 
00:53:59.230 --> 00:53:59.240 align:start position:0%
yeah and that there's a list that um you
 
00:54:01.870 --> 00:54:01.880 align:start position:0%
know that a list of areas that we've
 
00:54:03.549 --> 00:54:03.559 align:start position:0%
looked at and then determine whether or
 
00:54:06.150 --> 00:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
not they fit
 
00:54:10.069 --> 00:54:10.079 align:start position:0%
correct thank you um so okay so I
 
00:54:12.829 --> 00:54:12.839 align:start position:0%
understand that so what part of what
 
00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
part of this bill um outside of the
 
00:54:17.710 --> 00:54:17.720 align:start position:0%
rules change because you didn't mention
 
00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
that and I was like oh wait we want them
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
to change the rules because that's why
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
we get stuck in these things but part of
 
00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
the restrictions um or part of the
 
00:54:26.789 --> 00:54:26.799 align:start position:0%
section two is that you have the ability
 
00:54:29.549 --> 00:54:29.559 align:start position:0%
to change rules based on what you find
 
00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
in the science over the 9,000 waterways
 
00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:33.880 align:start position:0%
and things like that so I'm wondering
 
00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
what um what exactly of those three
 
00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
sections make it codify it this the
 
00:54:41.710 --> 00:54:41.720 align:start position:0%
rules and the reporting does the
 
00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
commission you the department oppose
 
00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
based on this because it seems pretty
 
00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
simple again if it's working why not
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
codify it so that we can continue doing
 
00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%
it so I'm just wondering what part of it
 
00:54:55.190 --> 00:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
U the department specifically is is
 
00:54:57.630 --> 00:54:57.640 align:start position:0%
opposing to codifying this the program
 
00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
that is working correct why why why
 
00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:03.880 align:start position:0%
oppose it so working is a relative term
 
00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
um of those Waters that are currently on
 
00:55:08.069 --> 00:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
the list I can tell you that some of
 
00:55:10.549 --> 00:55:10.559 align:start position:0%
those will be removed so we're already
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
working on that because basically um
 
00:55:17.309 --> 00:55:17.319 align:start position:0%
there's been no change in um some have
 
00:55:18.910 --> 00:55:18.920 align:start position:0%
declined I shouldn't say no change
 
00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
there's been no change in angling
 
00:55:23.829 --> 00:55:23.839 align:start position:0%
pressure um and the water bodies are
 
00:55:26.230 --> 00:55:26.240 align:start position:0%
declining and so what we're find well
 
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
the population is declined in some
 
00:55:30.910 --> 00:55:30.920 align:start position:0%
locations and what we found is that it's
 
00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
really um rules of for Anglers and these
 
00:55:37.589 --> 00:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
areas um right now some of them that are
 
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
on here do not get utilized and the
 
00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
population is going down which is making
 
00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
us realize that it's a habitat thing I'm
 
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
going to have years with drought I'm
 
00:55:50.109 --> 00:55:50.119 align:start position:0%
going to have years with floods and um
 
00:55:52.750 --> 00:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
the population is driven by the natural
 
00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:55.240 align:start position:0%
conditions in the environment and so so
 
00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
in some of these locations it actually
 
00:55:59.950 --> 00:55:59.960 align:start position:0%
would make sense to have Harvest because
 
00:56:02.470 --> 00:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
these fish only can fit in that habitat
 
00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
that they have their carrying capacity
 
00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
is met in some locations and so you get
 
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
a decline in population and so um we
 
00:56:12.349 --> 00:56:12.359 align:start position:0%
definitely want to have the flexibility
 
00:56:15.029 --> 00:56:15.039 align:start position:0%
for that but as far as like the list and
 
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
all of that we're doing it now and so
 
00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's it just hasn't been presented
 
00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:22.559 align:start position:0%
because of various things changes in
 
00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
staff I didn't have anybody to continue
 
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
the program um we just hired the person
 
00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:31.160 align:start position:0%
uh Colby uh just a year ago and he's
 
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
been he has made some great progress
 
00:56:35.549 --> 00:56:35.559 align:start position:0%
instituted an angler survey because that
 
00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
was one of the other things we were
 
00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
missing is what is who's actually going
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
you know we have some stuff from
 
00:56:44.349 --> 00:56:44.359 align:start position:0%
conservation officers and and our work
 
00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
outside and feedback from the public but
 
00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
we definitely don't have like a
 
00:56:52.029 --> 00:56:52.039 align:start position:0%
scientific survey so he created that and
 
00:56:54.029 --> 00:56:54.039 align:start position:0%
then unfortunately just went back to
 
00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania so um again working with
 
00:56:59.349 --> 00:56:59.359 align:start position:0%
him to get this going but that's the
 
00:57:02.069 --> 00:57:02.079 align:start position:0%
real Crux is that we're already doing it
 
00:57:04.309 --> 00:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
the plan is already to move forward and
 
00:57:07.549 --> 00:57:07.559 align:start position:0%
it was one of those things where um I
 
00:57:12.109 --> 00:57:12.119 align:start position:0%
guess my personal passion um you know um
 
00:57:14.670 --> 00:57:14.680 align:start position:0%
is that wild trout are very important
 
00:57:17.470 --> 00:57:17.480 align:start position:0%
and I do think that they are a part of
 
00:57:19.390 --> 00:57:19.400 align:start position:0%
our New Hampshire history and I think
 
00:57:21.789 --> 00:57:21.799 align:start position:0%
that they should remain and so um my
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
personal opinion and my my personal goal
 
00:57:27.069 --> 00:57:27.079 align:start position:0%
for my myself and my division is that we
 
00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:29.720 align:start position:0%
will continue to do this and continue to
 
00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
manage it appropriately and so that is
 
00:57:33.789 --> 00:57:33.799 align:start position:0%
the whole purpose of the wild trout
 
00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
management plan so that we can actually
 
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
move forward in a direction that works
 
00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
and in a direction that can be um
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
repeated through
 
00:57:45.710 --> 00:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
welcome representative
 
00:57:50.349 --> 00:57:50.359 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you Mr chair I'm going to
 
00:57:52.789 --> 00:57:52.799 align:start position:0%
follow up on representative Ford really
 
00:57:55.710 --> 00:57:55.720 align:start position:0%
clarifying nicely in my mind something I
 
00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
thought I had
 
00:58:00.270 --> 00:58:00.280 align:start position:0%
heard I I thought I heard some say that
 
00:58:02.109 --> 00:58:02.119 align:start position:0%
this would force fishing game to create
 
00:58:04.029 --> 00:58:04.039 align:start position:0%
a list that wouldn't be changeable as
 
00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
the scientific information changed but
 
00:58:08.789 --> 00:58:08.799 align:start position:0%
that's not what I just heard you say so
 
00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
the the in sorry in statute there won't
 
00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:13.880 align:start position:0%
be a list it's still going to be in in
 
00:58:16.069 --> 00:58:16.079 align:start position:0%
fish and game it's not going to the list
 
00:58:18.029 --> 00:58:18.039 align:start position:0%
of waters is not going to be listed in
 
00:58:19.309 --> 00:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
statute it's
 
00:58:22.349 --> 00:58:22.359 align:start position:0%
not and so you will have the ability to
 
00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
change that policy-wise
 
00:58:27.150 --> 00:58:27.160 align:start position:0%
within the department based on
 
00:58:30.029 --> 00:58:30.039 align:start position:0%
scientific data is that accurate correct
 
00:58:32.270 --> 00:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
the problem with this is that these
 
00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
rules that are listed in this bill are
 
00:58:37.109 --> 00:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
some rules that we want to change as
 
00:58:38.670 --> 00:58:38.680 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
00:58:41.710 --> 00:58:41.720 align:start position:0%
program so the list going under these
 
00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
rules these rules are not necessarily
 
00:58:47.670 --> 00:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
what we want to have as part of the
 
00:58:51.789 --> 00:58:51.799 align:start position:0%
program and this RSA makes them part of
 
00:58:51.799 --> 00:58:53.710 align:start position:0%
program and this RSA makes them part of
that

00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:55.349 align:start position:0%
that
program

00:58:55.349 --> 00:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
okay I think I got that and rules are
 
00:58:59.549 --> 00:58:59.559 align:start position:0%
slow and complicated to
 
00:59:02.990 --> 00:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
update in RSA absolutely right right
 
00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
yep any other questions sorry law and R
 
00:59:10.510 --> 00:59:10.520 align:start position:0%
and I'll just have one quick question as
 
00:59:12.309 --> 00:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
well because representative Brown and
 
00:59:14.349 --> 00:59:14.359 align:start position:0%
myself both serve on Edna and deal with
 
00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of the rule making process going
 
00:59:20.789 --> 00:59:20.799 align:start position:0%
through um and listening to your
 
00:59:23.230 --> 00:59:23.240 align:start position:0%
testimony and knowing
 
00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:27.720 align:start position:0%
that all of this is based on
 
00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:29.950 align:start position:0%
that all of this is based on
science-based

00:59:29.950 --> 00:59:29.960 align:start position:0%
science-based
 
00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:31.789 align:start position:0%
science-based
information

00:59:31.789 --> 00:59:31.799 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
um from what I'm hearing in your
 
00:59:36.670 --> 00:59:36.680 align:start position:0%
testimony it's much easier to work with
 
00:59:38.549 --> 00:59:38.559 align:start position:0%
what you're doing and the program you're
 
00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
doing with the definitions in rule
 
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
making because as we're seeing here the
 
00:59:45.789 --> 00:59:45.799 align:start position:0%
legislative process takes a long time to
 
00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
change and when you want to change
 
00:59:50.349 --> 00:59:50.359 align:start position:0%
something for a certain body of water
 
00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
that may fall under this criteria that
 
00:59:55.950 --> 00:59:55.960 align:start position:0%
either becomes over at and you need a
 
00:59:58.430 --> 00:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
different method of taking
 
01:00:01.589 --> 01:00:01.599 align:start position:0%
fish it would be much more difficult to
 
01:00:04.109 --> 01:00:04.119 align:start position:0%
do than having that set in rules similar
 
01:00:05.950 --> 01:00:05.960 align:start position:0%
to the science-based technology we use
 
01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
for hunting seasons and the take it that
 
01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
we do there
 
01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
correct correct and and I think
 
01:00:15.549 --> 01:00:15.559 align:start position:0%
something to add too is you know as we
 
01:00:18.270 --> 01:00:18.280 align:start position:0%
go through these things are changing and
 
01:00:20.109 --> 01:00:20.119 align:start position:0%
you know the flooding and the drought
 
01:00:21.950 --> 01:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
are very important so you may have an
 
01:00:24.670 --> 01:00:24.680 align:start position:0%
area that does get wiped out because
 
01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
it's you know these are natural systems
 
01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
we're talking about managing for Anglers
 
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
and so it absolutely could be wiped out
 
01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
and then you have it listed as a wild
 
01:00:36.349 --> 01:00:36.359 align:start position:0%
trout water and it's under these
 
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
criteria but there's no fish left so
 
01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
having that ability to make those
 
01:00:44.190 --> 01:00:44.200 align:start position:0%
changes as needed under rule versus law
 
01:00:47.549 --> 01:00:47.559 align:start position:0%
is important thank you any other
 
01:00:50.670 --> 01:00:50.680 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none is there anyone
 
01:00:53.109 --> 01:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
else wishing to
 
01:00:55.589 --> 01:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
testify I'll close close the public
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:10.270 align:start position:0%
 
1417

01:01:10.270 --> 01:01:10.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:12.680 align:start position:0%
1029 I'll open the public hearing on
 
01:01:15.069 --> 01:01:15.079 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1029 and the chair calls
 
01:01:15.079 --> 01:01:23.430 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1029 and the chair calls
representative

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:26.630 align:start position:0%
 
Hill

01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:30.670 --> 01:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:33.150 --> 01:01:33.160 align:start position:0%
chairman I know you're a little bit
 
01:01:36.190 --> 01:01:36.200 align:start position:0%
behind so I'll be brief for the record I
 
01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
am uh representative Greg Hill I uh
 
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
cover the wonderful little small town of
 
01:01:45.390 --> 01:01:45.400 align:start position:0%
Northfield New Hampshire um just about
 
01:01:48.109 --> 01:01:48.119 align:start position:0%
20 miles north of here I'm here to
 
01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
1079 what he said
 
01:02:00.269 --> 01:02:00.279 align:start position:0%
1029 um to me it's a simple little bill
 
01:02:03.430 --> 01:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
um just popped out of the legislation
 
01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
from last year and and I just want to
 
01:02:10.190 --> 01:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
see if the committee will um help
 
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
clarify the the existing legislation um
 
01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
it's to draw a distinction between
 
01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
commercial Landing licenses and
 
01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
recreational uh Landing licenses it
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
seemed to us that uh the pur of the of
 
01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
the RSA that it affects is to um is to
 
01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
allow um lobsters and crab that come in
 
01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire to be sold um and
 
01:02:43.029 --> 01:02:43.039 align:start position:0%
that's not the intention of um of any of
 
01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
the um recreational people um and so
 
01:02:49.269 --> 01:02:49.279 align:start position:0%
that's all it's to do is to is to draw
 
01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
that delineation between recreational
 
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:52.750 align:start position:0%
that delineation between recreational
and

01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
Commercial um I'm happy to answer any
 
01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:58.549 align:start position:0%
Commercial um I'm happy to answer any
questions

01:02:58.549 --> 01:02:58.559 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:03:01.349 --> 01:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
questions representative Derby thank you
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
01:03:04.829 --> 01:03:04.839 align:start position:0%
question thank you if I understand uh
 
01:03:08.029 --> 01:03:08.039 align:start position:0%
this bill um the idea is you don't have
 
01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
a um a New Hampshire um you're catching
 
01:03:13.150 --> 01:03:13.160 align:start position:0%
lobsters outside the state and then
 
01:03:14.789 --> 01:03:14.799 align:start position:0%
you're Landing in the state but you're
 
01:03:17.269 --> 01:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
not going to sell them is do I
 
01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
understand that correctly um 90% of that
 
01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
yes um there is there is no license
 
01:03:26.230 --> 01:03:26.240 align:start position:0%
required for uh federal waters U Beyond
 
01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:27.029 align:start position:0%
required for uh federal waters U Beyond
3

01:03:27.029 --> 01:03:27.039 align:start position:0%
3
 
01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
miles um and yet there are people that
 
01:03:35.069 --> 01:03:35.079 align:start position:0%
dive there Andor out of state um in
 
01:03:37.109 --> 01:03:37.119 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and hold the Massachusetts
 
01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
license um but they may be renting the
 
01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
fellow that that brought this to my
 
01:03:45.190 --> 01:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
attention um had rented a home in New
 
01:03:48.549 --> 01:03:48.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um but was diving in in
 
01:03:50.470 --> 01:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and couldn't bring his
 
01:03:52.990 --> 01:03:53.000 align:start position:0%
boat here um he said the only other
 
01:03:57.510 --> 01:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
thing I could do legally is just um dive
 
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts leave his boat in
 
01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and then drive to his um
 
01:04:07.589 --> 01:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
his house in New Hampshire so it this is
 
01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
just just a clarification thing we
 
01:04:12.510 --> 01:04:12.520 align:start position:0%
looked at the RSA um we asked the
 
01:04:14.510 --> 01:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
question actually through the researcher
 
01:04:16.789 --> 01:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
for fishing game and and that was the
 
01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
answer the that the way it's drawn um
 
01:04:23.269 --> 01:04:23.279 align:start position:0%
the recreational person seems to need
 
01:04:25.109 --> 01:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
that Landing license and it didn't seem
 
01:04:31.549 --> 01:04:31.559 align:start position:0%
like that was um clear and that's what
 
01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
is followup thank you Mr chair um I I
 
01:04:41.549 --> 01:04:41.559 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure I understood
 
01:04:42.750 --> 01:04:42.760 align:start position:0%
because I think you started that
 
01:04:45.029 --> 01:04:45.039 align:start position:0%
response with primarily are there other
 
01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
cases besides the recreational out ofate
 
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
you know uh Lobster angler that you're
 
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
considering aside from um out of state
 
01:04:56.510 --> 01:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
but also Federal is what I was referring
 
01:04:58.829 --> 01:04:58.839 align:start position:0%
to thank
 
01:05:02.109 --> 01:05:02.119 align:start position:0%
you any further question representative
 
01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
KH thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:07.480 align:start position:0%
representative taking my question uh I'm
 
01:05:11.589 --> 01:05:11.599 align:start position:0%
reading from a handout it says why would
 
01:05:14.269 --> 01:05:14.279 align:start position:0%
we need legislation to benefit
 
01:05:17.029 --> 01:05:17.039 align:start position:0%
non-residents of New Hampshire when New
 
01:05:18.549 --> 01:05:18.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident would not be
 
01:05:21.870 --> 01:05:21.880 align:start position:0%
providing the same benefit in these um
 
01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:31.150 --> 01:05:31.160 align:start position:0%
is is that a question what yes um I'm
 
01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:33.839 align:start position:0%
sorry I can't I couldn't follow what you
 
01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
were saying could you repeat that New
 
01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents goes to those States
 
01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
like Massachusetts and Maine they don't
 
01:05:43.269 --> 01:05:43.279 align:start position:0%
have those kind of you know benefit that
 
01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
they can get in those States so in new
 
01:05:50.430 --> 01:05:50.440 align:start position:0%
you're saying in New Hampshire um person
 
01:05:52.430 --> 01:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
a commercial person or a recreational
 
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
person recreational person so so New
 
01:05:56.549 --> 01:05:56.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire my understanding is a New
 
01:05:58.870 --> 01:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire recreational person would have
 
01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
to have a license in Massachusetts you
 
01:06:02.670 --> 01:06:02.680 align:start position:0%
couldn't do it in
 
01:06:05.910 --> 01:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
Maine so a New Hampshire person would go
 
01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
to Massachusetts and use their diving um
 
01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
license that they can procure in
 
01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:14.589 align:start position:0%
license that they can procure in
in

01:06:14.589 --> 01:06:14.599 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:06:18.190 --> 01:06:18.200 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um and and then right now
 
01:06:19.870 --> 01:06:19.880 align:start position:0%
they could just land them in
 
01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts if if legally and drive
 
01:06:26.029 --> 01:06:26.039 align:start position:0%
them here or they could come back by
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
their own boat um to New Hampshire and
 
01:06:31.390 --> 01:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
not if they were using them purely for
 
01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
their own use not
 
01:06:36.069 --> 01:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
commercially um they would be able if
 
01:06:37.589 --> 01:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
this bill were to pass they would be
 
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
able to land them
 
01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
here do I I I'm hoping I answered the
 
01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:50.480 align:start position:0%

operator this this house bill
 
01:08:30.430 --> 01:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
1029 it the only beneficiaries of this
 
01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
bill would be Maine and New Hampshire a
 
01:08:36.349 --> 01:08:36.359 align:start position:0%
Maine and Massachusetts residents who
 
01:08:40.709 --> 01:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
launch out of any New Hampshire Port who
 
01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
um recreationally fish in their
 
01:08:45.550 --> 01:08:45.560 align:start position:0%
respective States and they'd be able to
 
01:08:47.829 --> 01:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
come back to New Hampshire and land
 
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
their catch without any kind of uh
 
01:08:53.789 --> 01:08:53.799 align:start position:0%
Landing permit whereas a new hampsh
 
01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident who may launch out of
 
01:09:00.349 --> 01:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
a main port or a Massachusetts port and
 
01:09:02.829 --> 01:09:02.839 align:start position:0%
recreationally fish in New Hampshire
 
01:09:05.309 --> 01:09:05.319 align:start position:0%
would not be able to return to those
 
01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
states where they launch out of without
 
01:09:11.309 --> 01:09:11.319 align:start position:0%
having a landing permit to uh land their
 
01:09:14.669 --> 01:09:14.679 align:start position:0%
lobsters it doesn't seem logical to me
 
01:09:16.510 --> 01:09:16.520 align:start position:0%
why we would give a pass to
 
01:09:19.669 --> 01:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts or main residents in uh
 
01:09:21.709 --> 01:09:21.719 align:start position:0%
having to obtain a landing permit when a
 
01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh resident would not be
 
01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
offered the same
 
01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
benefit um I I think the The Landing
 
01:09:32.229 --> 01:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
permits are essential in helping
 
01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement collect data on what's being
 
01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
landed where it's being landed and how
 
01:09:39.149 --> 01:09:39.159 align:start position:0%
much is being landed and I think it's an
 
01:09:41.669 --> 01:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
important enforcement tool and I don't
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
believe this this um Bill 20
 
01:09:49.070 --> 01:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
1029 is is benefiting anyone in the
 
01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and I would urge
 
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
the committee to oppose this this uh
 
01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:56.149 align:start position:0%
the committee to oppose this this uh
this

01:09:56.149 --> 01:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you uh before I take
 
01:10:00.430 --> 01:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
questions I'm going to ask one of my own
 
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
what about the New Hampshire resident
 
01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
who goes to fish in international waters
 
01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
where it is legal for him to fish and
 
01:10:11.070 --> 01:10:11.080 align:start position:0%
then comes back to New Hampshire uh if
 
01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
he's recreationally
 
01:10:15.390 --> 01:10:15.400 align:start position:0%
fishing why he would he would benefit
 
01:10:17.669 --> 01:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
from not having to pay a landing I don't
 
01:10:19.669 --> 01:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
believe I don't believe you can
 
01:10:22.149 --> 01:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
recreationally Lobster in federal waters
 
01:10:23.709 --> 01:10:23.719 align:start position:0%
you would need a federal Lobster permit
 
01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
no you don't in in federal lobsters
 
01:10:27.550 --> 01:10:27.560 align:start position:0%
you're allowed to hand dive for lobsters
 
01:10:29.189 --> 01:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
in federal waters which would be the
 
01:10:31.709 --> 01:10:31.719 align:start position:0%
opposite side of the aisle Sholes just
 
01:10:33.470 --> 01:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
the fact that the committee researched
 
01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
and found out the last time a lobster
 
01:10:37.189 --> 01:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
bill came before us it's it's a known
 
01:10:40.390 --> 01:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
fact federal government allows uh hand
 
01:10:44.430 --> 01:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
fishing of lobsters um and so I just
 
01:10:46.630 --> 01:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask that question and I will
 
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
open this up to other questions now
 
01:10:50.189 --> 01:10:50.199 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you Mr
 
01:10:51.550 --> 01:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
question what is the cost of a landing
 
01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
license and what it how difficult is it
 
01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
to obtain the landing The Landing permit
 
01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:01.400 align:start position:0%
is uh for a non-resident I believe it's
 
01:11:03.709 --> 01:11:03.719 align:start position:0%
$500 and I don't believe it's difficult
 
01:11:07.229 --> 01:11:07.239 align:start position:0%
to obtain it all just fill out an
 
01:11:10.669 --> 01:11:10.679 align:start position:0%
application follow up followup sorry I
 
01:11:12.870 --> 01:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
was writing it down what are the limits
 
01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
on lobster and crab for personal
 
01:11:18.350 --> 01:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
catch the limit would be you're limited
 
01:11:20.149 --> 01:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
to the number of traps you can fish
 
01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
recreationally but I don't believe
 
01:11:26.229 --> 01:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
you're limited to what those traps can
 
01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
catch one more followup followup again
 
01:11:30.030 --> 01:11:30.040 align:start position:0%
and this is my last
 
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
one you seem concerned that this is
 
01:11:34.149 --> 01:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
going to benefit non-residents if there
 
01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
was a committee Amendment drafted that
 
01:11:38.669 --> 01:11:38.679 align:start position:0%
this change would apply to New Hampshire
 
01:11:41.189 --> 01:11:41.199 align:start position:0%
residents only would you support that
 
01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
well New Hampshire residents who
 
01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
recreationally fish when they obtain
 
01:11:47.629 --> 01:11:47.639 align:start position:0%
their recreational license that allows
 
01:11:51.149 --> 01:11:51.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:54.629 --> 01:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
lobsters thank you
 
01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
representative Darby thank you Mr chair
 
01:12:00.270 --> 01:12:00.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um but
 
01:12:02.270 --> 01:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
if they have a recreational license
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
following um following other
 
01:12:05.750 --> 01:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative's question if they have a
 
01:12:07.950 --> 01:12:07.960 align:start position:0%
recreational license out of state so
 
01:12:09.709 --> 01:12:09.719 align:start position:0%
it's not a New Hampshire recreational
 
01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
license then they would still as I
 
01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
understand it require a landing permit
 
01:12:17.629 --> 01:12:17.639 align:start position:0%
so if you get a recreational license in
 
01:12:20.950 --> 01:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
Maine or Massachusetts so I think that
 
01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
the question the amendment question
 
01:12:25.629 --> 01:12:25.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:26.920 align:start position:0%
I believe you'd have to have a landing
 
01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
permit to bring those lobsters back into
 
01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:32.629 align:start position:0%
permit to bring those lobsters back into
the

01:12:32.629 --> 01:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
state thank you any further
 
01:12:38.910 --> 01:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative Brown thank you
 
01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so following up on all those
 
01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
questions if you're recreationally
 
01:12:47.149 --> 01:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
fishing as a New Hampshire resident in
 
01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
federal waters you don't need a New
 
01:12:51.709 --> 01:12:51.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Recreation
 
01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
license no no you wouldn't okay
 
01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
therefore to land your fish as in your
 
01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
whatever you bring in you would need a
 
01:13:03.870 --> 01:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
landing a landing license at this point
 
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
even though you got those in federal
 
01:13:08.110 --> 01:13:08.120 align:start position:0%
waters without a recreational license
 
01:13:11.189 --> 01:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
correct all right and I think that's
 
01:13:12.750 --> 01:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
fine thank
 
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
you any further questions seeing none
 
01:13:18.110 --> 01:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony
 
01:13:21.790 --> 01:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:27.310 --> 01:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:42.629 --> 01:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
minutes good morning thank you Mr
 
01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
chairman committee members um this
 
01:13:47.629 --> 01:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
particular Bill
 
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
1029 I've read it I don't know how many
 
01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
times um I've asked actually you know
 
01:13:56.750 --> 01:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
and and Mr tatone and I have have
 
01:13:59.390 --> 01:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
discussed it I think there's ambiguity
 
01:14:00.669 --> 01:14:00.679 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:14:04.189 --> 01:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
bill um from what I read and it's in the
 
01:14:04.199 --> 01:14:05.629 align:start position:0%
bill um from what I read and it's in the
last

01:14:05.629 --> 01:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
last
 
01:14:08.669 --> 01:14:08.679 align:start position:0%
section A person who was not Landing for
 
01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
the purpose of sale of the lobster or
 
01:14:13.669 --> 01:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
crab shall be exempt from the
 
01:14:15.149 --> 01:14:15.159 align:start position:0%
requirements of the
 
01:14:19.110 --> 01:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
section so I conclude that this includes
 
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:14:24.110 --> 01:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
residents um and I haven't got the
 
01:14:26.750 --> 01:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
clarity from the meaning of that
 
01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
statement to understand the bill fully
 
01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
and I think you should be concerned with
 
01:14:34.950 --> 01:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
that I think there is a classification
 
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
of licenses within the state of New
 
01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:40.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's a four tier system you
 
01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
have a recreational
 
01:14:44.830 --> 01:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
license which is no
 
01:14:48.669 --> 01:14:48.679 align:start position:0%
sale of the lobsters you have a 100 trap
 
01:14:52.229 --> 01:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
commercial license which includes sale
 
01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
you have a 600 trap commercial license
 
01:14:59.030 --> 01:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:02.550 --> 01:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
license the no sale recreational license
 
01:15:05.870 --> 01:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:10.229 --> 01:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
300 if this does not include if this
 
01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
provision abates them from a of a
 
01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
license requirement then the department
 
01:15:19.629 --> 01:15:19.639 align:start position:0%
loses the revenue of that of that
 
01:15:19.639 --> 01:15:21.830 align:start position:0%
loses the revenue of that of that
recreational

01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
recreational
 
01:15:23.830 --> 01:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
license um
 
01:15:26.709 --> 01:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
so that that needs Clarity and I think
 
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
without that Clarity you can't proceed
 
01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
with considering the
 
01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.629 align:start position:0%
with considering the
bill

01:15:34.629 --> 01:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
um whether it's to your knowledge or
 
01:15:41.830 --> 01:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
not the Atlantic State's Marine fishery
 
01:15:44.550 --> 01:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
controls the management of the American
 
01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
Lobster in the
 
01:15:51.390 --> 01:15:51.400 align:start position:0%
Northeast um there has recently been a
 
01:15:55.110 --> 01:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
determination that the resource has
 
01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
fallen below a particular Tri trigger
 
01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:00.149 align:start position:0%
fallen below a particular Tri trigger
for

01:16:00.149 --> 01:16:00.159 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:16:03.070 --> 01:16:03.080 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and subsequently there are
 
01:16:04.830 --> 01:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
more restrictive measures going in
 
01:16:07.270 --> 01:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
there's gauge increase
 
01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
measures uh two of them to be exact
 
01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
there's gear requirements that are going
 
01:16:16.950 --> 01:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
to be oncoming so there is some
 
01:16:21.149 --> 01:16:21.159 align:start position:0%
threat to recruitment of into the
 
01:16:24.229 --> 01:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
fishery and this is the first this that
 
01:16:27.229 --> 01:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
has taken place in years and it's got
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
It's got the concern of the
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
industry um nobody likes more
 
01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
regulations but apparent but but this is
 
01:16:36.189 --> 01:16:36.199 align:start position:0%
going to take place it's already
 
01:16:38.629 --> 01:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
scheduled to take place the first year
 
01:16:42.990 --> 01:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
of the gauge increase um will begin uh
 
01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:48.629 --> 01:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
2025 I think with
 
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
that um you have to take that in
 
01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:54.669 align:start position:0%
that um you have to take that in
consideration

01:16:54.669 --> 01:16:54.679 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
01:16:56.590 --> 01:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
because what
 
01:17:00.709 --> 01:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
drives the management measures is
 
01:17:04.910 --> 01:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
data data that indicates poor
 
01:17:07.709 --> 01:17:07.719 align:start position:0%
recruitment data that indicates over
 
01:17:12.709 --> 01:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
fishing data that there's a variety of
 
01:17:15.669 --> 01:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
purposes when this exemption for a
 
01:17:18.430 --> 01:17:18.440 align:start position:0%
license goes into
 
01:17:20.950 --> 01:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
place the only thing that the individual
 
01:17:22.590 --> 01:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
has to say to when eff ficient game
 
01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:24.350 align:start position:0%
has to say to when eff ficient game
officer

01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
officer
 
01:17:26.669 --> 01:17:26.679 align:start position:0%
is I'm not going to sell
 
01:17:29.149 --> 01:17:29.159 align:start position:0%
them that's the end of the
 
01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
story the data for what that person has
 
01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
caught is
 
01:17:37.470 --> 01:17:37.480 align:start position:0%
lost it's not a
 
01:17:40.510 --> 01:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
requirement and so with that I think
 
01:17:43.550 --> 01:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
there is a concern with the amount of
 
01:17:47.189 --> 01:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
data that's lost in the system right now
 
01:17:50.070 --> 01:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
to gauge and manage the
 
01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
fishery um we're opposed to this
 
01:17:56.030 --> 01:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
we think we don't think there is a
 
01:17:59.189 --> 01:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
benefit except like I've explained loss
 
01:18:00.790 --> 01:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
of Revenue to the
 
01:18:03.629 --> 01:18:03.639 align:start position:0%
department um a variety of other things
 
01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
I've just mentioned and so um that would
 
01:18:10.910 --> 01:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
be the purpose of us opposing the
 
01:18:14.669 --> 01:18:14.679 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you thank you are there any
 
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
questions Jeff representative goaling
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair one quick question
 
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
right down here um
 
01:18:27.510 --> 01:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
are you would the wording on line four
 
01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
also concern you because it says taken
 
01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
by any means doesn't say by taken by
 
01:18:33.990 --> 01:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
legal means doesn't say taken by any any
 
01:18:37.790 --> 01:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:41.149 --> 01:18:41.159 align:start position:0%

thank you for taking my question so I
 
01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
understand the concern about um loss of
 
01:18:51.709 --> 01:18:51.719 align:start position:0%
data um do Recreation do New Hampshire
 
01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:54.239 align:start position:0%
recreational um Lobster Anglers have to
 
01:18:57.390 --> 01:18:57.400 align:start position:0%
report their catch today yes yes they do
 
01:18:59.590 --> 01:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
thank you it's a it's a requirement for
 
01:19:01.229 --> 01:19:01.239 align:start position:0%
them to renew the
 
01:19:05.590 --> 01:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
license and there is a there is a data
 
01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
requirement of what they've cost caught
 
01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
in the last year before they can renew
 
01:19:13.110 --> 01:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
their license thank

question so I understand if you have any
 
01:19:24.430 --> 01:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
your Recreation license you have to
 
01:19:26.790 --> 01:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
report your catch to fishing game for
 
01:19:30.669 --> 01:19:30.679 align:start position:0%
data acquisition if you're in federal
 
01:19:33.750 --> 01:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
waters do you have to do that if you're
 
01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
in federal waters and you don't have a
 
01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire recreational license you
 
01:19:42.629 --> 01:19:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
correct you would have to I I I I might
 
01:19:48.709 --> 01:19:48.719 align:start position:0%
be defer to somebody else but but but I
 
01:19:52.229 --> 01:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
will but I will say I will say because a
 
01:19:54.110 --> 01:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
we Federal waters
 
01:19:57.669 --> 01:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
are there would I would be surprised
 
01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
completely surprised if there's any
 
01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:03.629 align:start position:0%
completely surprised if there's any
recreational

01:20:03.629 --> 01:20:03.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
fishing in federal waters it's because
 
01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
federal waters goes out to 12 miles you
 
01:20:11.310 --> 01:20:11.320 align:start position:0%
know here when you take the AL or
 
01:20:12.550 --> 01:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
shoulds in
 
01:20:15.229 --> 01:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
consideration it's it's it's it's the
 
01:20:18.669 --> 01:20:18.679 align:start position:0%
contig contiguous Line in New Hampshire
 
01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
including the AL of shs so going into
 
01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
fidal Waters I would I would be very
 
01:20:28.750 --> 01:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
surprised if there is any recreational
 
01:20:31.550 --> 01:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
license fishing in federal waterers
 
01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any further
 
01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your

01:22:32.070 --> 01:22:32.080 align:start position:0%

01:22:35.629 --> 01:22:35.639 align:start position:0%
language and the intent of this proposed
 
01:22:38.990 --> 01:22:39.000 align:start position:0%

01:23:07.669 --> 01:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
they are for personal use and then

testimony I will just be hitting some of
 
01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
the highlights and hopefully clarifying
 
01:24:30.669 --> 01:24:30.679 align:start position:0%
some of the questions you've asked other
 
01:24:33.390 --> 01:24:33.400 align:start position:0%
speakers as well along the way um as
 
01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
other speakers have said Lobster are
 
01:24:37.149 --> 01:24:37.159 align:start position:0%

01:24:43.470 --> 01:24:43.480 align:start position:0%
commission we manage as States for
 
01:24:45.629 --> 01:24:45.639 align:start position:0%
lobsters that have landed within the
 
01:24:47.109 --> 01:24:47.119 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that is our
 
01:24:50.109 --> 01:24:50.119 align:start position:0%
requirement we're required to report or
 
01:24:52.669 --> 01:24:52.679 align:start position:0%
to collect catch and effort information
 
01:24:54.709 --> 01:24:54.719 align:start position:0%
no matter where those lobsters came from
 
01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
each state has that mandate through the
 
01:24:59.910 --> 01:24:59.920 align:start position:0%

01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:00.870 align:start position:0%

the
 
01:25:04.109 --> 01:25:04.119 align:start position:0%
commission um and I the The Fishing Game
 
01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
Commission has voted to oppose this bill
 
01:25:09.310 --> 01:25:09.320 align:start position:0%
I neglected to say that apologies there
 
01:25:11.709 --> 01:25:11.719 align:start position:0%
so one of the concerns that we have with
 
01:25:14.590 --> 01:25:14.600 align:start position:0%
this bill is there would be lobster and
 
01:25:15.870 --> 01:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
crab coming into the state of New
 
01:25:18.149 --> 01:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which we could not capture for
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
our mandate to capture by our reporting
 
01:25:23.310 --> 01:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
requirements everyone's required to
 
01:25:25.109 --> 01:25:25.119 align:start position:0%
report including the recreational
 
01:25:27.189 --> 01:25:27.199 align:start position:0%
Harvesters and then any Salem made in
 
01:25:29.870 --> 01:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is also being reported as
 
01:25:32.629 --> 01:25:32.639 align:start position:0%
well additionally that doesn't apply to
 
01:25:34.990 --> 01:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
this bill but that is also a component
 
01:25:37.149 --> 01:25:37.159 align:start position:0%
of our reporting
 
01:25:39.950 --> 01:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
programs um currently as it stands this
 
01:25:43.390 --> 01:25:43.400 align:start position:0%
is one clarification a person with a
 
01:25:46.750 --> 01:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
recreational license in another state or
 
01:25:48.229 --> 01:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
a person diving outside of the
 
01:25:49.870 --> 01:25:49.880 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of New Hampshire could
 
01:25:52.270 --> 01:25:52.280 align:start position:0%
purchase a state of New Hampshire
 
01:25:54.109 --> 01:25:54.119 align:start position:0%
lobster and crab Landing license they're
 
01:25:55.830 --> 01:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
available for residents and
 
01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
non-residents they're not specific to
 
01:26:00.229 --> 01:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
commercial or recreational as indicated
 
01:26:02.270 --> 01:26:02.280 align:start position:0%
the fee for a resident would be
 
01:26:05.910 --> 01:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
$50 the fee for a non-resident is $500
 
01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
so you'll see in my testimony we were
 
01:26:09.870 --> 01:26:09.880 align:start position:0%
more of the understanding that the
 
01:26:11.950 --> 01:26:11.960 align:start position:0%
intent was that that was prohibitive for
 
01:26:14.149 --> 01:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
someone as I've fielded a number of
 
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
phone calls every year for who is moing
 
01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
or docking their boat in New Hampshire
 
01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
but maybe lives right over the Border in
 
01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:23.149 align:start position:0%
but maybe lives right over the Border in
Main

01:26:23.149 --> 01:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
Main
 
01:26:25.350 --> 01:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts those are the field the
 
01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
calls that we often field and yes
 
01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
there's a license that's $500 that is a
 
01:26:32.229 --> 01:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
bit prohibitive we understand that but
 
01:26:34.430 --> 01:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
for a resident that's a $50 license it
 
01:26:36.550 --> 01:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
allows them to do that and would allow
 
01:26:38.430 --> 01:26:38.440 align:start position:0%
us to capture what we need to on our end
 
01:26:41.470 --> 01:26:41.480 align:start position:0%
as well the for reference the Trap
 
01:26:43.149 --> 01:26:43.159 align:start position:0%
license for recreational fishing in New
 
01:26:46.510 --> 01:26:46.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is $40 the helpers licenses so
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
somebody can be on the boat to assist
 
01:26:50.629 --> 01:26:50.639 align:start position:0%
you those are $20 so often our
 
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
recreational Harvesters get the license
 
01:26:55.830 --> 01:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
and one or more helpers licenses so
 
01:26:57.109 --> 01:26:57.119 align:start position:0%
they're paying a fee that is very
 
01:26:59.669 --> 01:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
similar to that $50 recreational or
 
01:27:02.070 --> 01:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
resident fee for landing Lobster in New
 
01:27:04.629 --> 01:27:04.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire another concern that we have
 
01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
is that there's all of our licenses
 
01:27:10.629 --> 01:27:10.639 align:start position:0%
allow not only for the take if their
 
01:27:13.070 --> 01:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
license is to take but they also allow
 
01:27:15.550 --> 01:27:15.560 align:start position:0%
for possession transport landing and the
 
01:27:17.790 --> 01:27:17.800 align:start position:0%
commercial ones allow for sale so that
 
01:27:19.669 --> 01:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
possession is also an important piece of
 
01:27:21.550 --> 01:27:21.560 align:start position:0%
this somebody is holding a license while
 
01:27:23.430 --> 01:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
they have lobster on the water that also
 
01:27:26.350 --> 01:27:26.360 align:start position:0%
allows them to possess that Lobster and
 
01:27:28.270 --> 01:27:28.280 align:start position:0%
gives them permission to Transit through
 
01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
land them in New Hampshire no problem so
 
01:27:33.470 --> 01:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
there is no means for us to have a
 
01:27:34.910 --> 01:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
license holder on the water with
 
01:27:36.709 --> 01:27:36.719 align:start position:0%
possession of Lobster in that case when
 
01:27:38.430 --> 01:27:38.440 align:start position:0%
everybody else holds a license that
 
01:27:41.070 --> 01:27:41.080 align:start position:0%
allows for all of those
 
01:27:44.870 --> 01:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
things um the intent of sale has come up
 
01:27:47.109 --> 01:27:47.119 align:start position:0%
a number of times so we're concerned
 
01:27:49.629 --> 01:27:49.639 align:start position:0%
about a loophole that that could create
 
01:27:51.189 --> 01:27:51.199 align:start position:0%
if somebody has a statement that they
 
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
have intent of sale and now they're
 
01:27:55.830 --> 01:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
exempt from any license requirements
 
01:27:58.590 --> 01:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
whatsoever the there's allowance for
 
01:28:00.669 --> 01:28:00.679 align:start position:0%
commercial Harvesters to land some of
 
01:28:02.149 --> 01:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
their lobster for personal use they're
 
01:28:03.669 --> 01:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
allowed to take them home to feed their
 
01:28:06.189 --> 01:28:06.199 align:start position:0%
family but that is all captured under
 
01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
the normal business requirements and
 
01:28:11.870 --> 01:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
Reporting requirements of those licenses
 
01:28:14.189 --> 01:28:14.199 align:start position:0%
so what's to say a commercial Harvester
 
01:28:15.870 --> 01:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
would be out on the water oh this not
 
01:28:18.350 --> 01:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
for intent of sale and be able to land
 
01:28:20.350 --> 01:28:20.360 align:start position:0%
those lobsters as well just creates an
 
01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement challenge for those on the
 
01:28:24.350 --> 01:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
water and a little bit of a loophole in
 
01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:25.950 align:start position:0%
water and a little bit of a loophole in
the

01:28:25.950 --> 01:28:25.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:28:29.310 --> 01:28:29.320 align:start position:0%
regulation um we are flexible we
 
01:28:32.430 --> 01:28:32.440 align:start position:0%
understand that this $500 license for a
 
01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
non-resident is a lot of money this uh
 
01:28:38.510 --> 01:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
legislation as it's written is not
 
01:28:40.830 --> 01:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
specific to recreational or commercial
 
01:28:42.790 --> 01:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
so if that is the challenge we would be
 
01:28:46.030 --> 01:28:46.040 align:start position:0%
open to working with the committee and
 
01:28:48.590 --> 01:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
working with the sponsor to amend some
 
01:28:50.750 --> 01:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
language that would allow for a license
 
01:28:53.149 --> 01:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
for non-resident recr recreational folks
 
01:28:54.790 --> 01:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
to have a lower license fee than the
 
01:28:54.800 --> 01:29:00.430 align:start position:0%
to have a lower license fee than the

01:29:00.430 --> 01:29:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
specifically and I think other than the
 
01:29:04.709 --> 01:29:04.719 align:start position:0%
we had a couple things coming up about
 
01:29:06.310 --> 01:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
our neighbors and chatting with our
 
01:29:08.590 --> 01:29:08.600 align:start position:0%
neighbors there is no license that
 
01:29:10.510 --> 01:29:10.520 align:start position:0%
allows a recreational Harvester who's a
 
01:29:11.950 --> 01:29:11.960 align:start position:0%
resident of our state to land their
 
01:29:14.990 --> 01:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
catch in a neighboring state that isn't
 
01:29:16.669 --> 01:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
that isn't something that's allowable by
 
01:29:18.310 --> 01:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
licenses they have to hold a state
 
01:29:20.750 --> 01:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
within that license to do so right now
 
01:29:22.669 --> 01:29:22.679 align:start position:0%
but a New Hampshire resident for example
 
01:29:25.510 --> 01:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
who owned more than $5,000 of property
 
01:29:27.629 --> 01:29:27.639 align:start position:0%
could hold a recreational diving or trap
 
01:29:30.590 --> 01:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
license in Massachusetts and then they
 
01:29:33.070 --> 01:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
could buy a recreation or buy the
 
01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
resident Landing license at $50 and come
 
01:29:37.750 --> 01:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
into the state and land their
 
01:29:41.109 --> 01:29:41.119 align:start position:0%
catch that is the conclusion of what I
 
01:29:42.669 --> 01:29:42.679 align:start position:0%
have for you today and if you have any
 
01:29:44.830 --> 01:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
questions please let me know thank you
 
01:29:47.669 --> 01:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
very much we'll start with rep kofalt
 
01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:29:52.390 --> 01:29:52.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I I wanted to
 
01:29:54.510 --> 01:29:54.520 align:start position:0%
verify something that I think I heard
 
01:29:57.629 --> 01:29:57.639 align:start position:0%
and it it it just doesn't sound right
 
01:29:59.629 --> 01:29:59.639 align:start position:0%
with respect to everything else here it
 
01:30:02.189 --> 01:30:02.199 align:start position:0%
sounded like you said that the lobster a
 
01:30:04.950 --> 01:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
resident Lobster license the
 
01:30:09.030 --> 01:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
$40 recreational resident Lobster
 
01:30:12.550 --> 01:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
license authorizes someone to take
 
01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
transport possess and
 
01:30:20.070 --> 01:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
land um Lobster so if they're taking it
 
01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:22.360 align:start position:0%
elsewhere but they have that resident
 
01:30:25.510 --> 01:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
that $40 resident Lobster license does
 
01:30:29.310 --> 01:30:29.320 align:start position:0%
that give them the the permission to
 
01:30:31.430 --> 01:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
also land that or not because it seems
 
01:30:32.669 --> 01:30:32.679 align:start position:0%
like that's what the bill is trying to
 
01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
do but I think I heard you say that
 
01:30:37.350 --> 01:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
maybe I I misheard you yeah so that
 
01:30:39.189 --> 01:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
license is specific to those folks
 
01:30:41.350 --> 01:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
fishing with their five traps that's a
 
01:30:43.590 --> 01:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
specific license I might have to defer
 
01:30:46.070 --> 01:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
to law enforcement a bit on that but the
 
01:30:48.270 --> 01:30:48.280 align:start position:0%
that typically the activities that are
 
01:30:49.830 --> 01:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
authorized under that license or for
 
01:30:51.950 --> 01:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
that license so that would allow that
 
01:30:53.870 --> 01:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
person to land their catch taken by
 
01:30:56.030 --> 01:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
their five recreational traps in the
 
01:30:57.870 --> 01:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and possess those
 
01:30:59.270 --> 01:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
while they're on the
 
01:31:03.109 --> 01:31:03.119 align:start position:0%
water follow up follow up okay so the
 
01:31:05.030 --> 01:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
the confusion I have
 
01:31:08.270 --> 01:31:08.280 align:start position:0%
is they need that license to to possess
 
01:31:12.149 --> 01:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
or transport Lobster taken in another
 
01:31:15.149 --> 01:31:15.159 align:start position:0%
state no that's a separate license so
 
01:31:17.149 --> 01:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
that's this license the lobster and crab
 
01:31:19.149 --> 01:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
Landing license if they took their
 
01:31:21.310 --> 01:31:21.320 align:start position:0%
lobsters we have many folks who have
 
01:31:22.870 --> 01:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
this license
 
01:31:25.310 --> 01:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
so if their lobsters are taken outside
 
01:31:27.629 --> 01:31:27.639 align:start position:0%
the jurisdiction of the state that
 
01:31:29.229 --> 01:31:29.239 align:start position:0%
license allows them to come into New
 
01:31:31.109 --> 01:31:31.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Waters with those lobsters and
 
01:31:33.790 --> 01:31:33.800 align:start position:0%
take them into port and sell them if
 
01:31:35.669 --> 01:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
that is appropriate to their license
 
01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
that they hold that clarifies it thank
 
01:31:40.430 --> 01:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
you yeah you're welcome that brings a
 
01:31:43.709 --> 01:31:43.719 align:start position:0%
question up for me though uh if I can
 
01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
ask if I had a license to to uh dive
 
01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
trap whatever in Massachusetts I've got
 
01:31:53.470 --> 01:31:53.480 align:start position:0%
my boat boat slip here in New
 
01:31:56.910 --> 01:31:56.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I decide I don't want to
 
01:31:58.950 --> 01:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
buy a landing license for $50 as a
 
01:32:01.109 --> 01:32:01.119 align:start position:0%
resident here I'd rather buy a five trp
 
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
license for $40 here can I still fish in
 
01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and come through the
 
01:32:09.229 --> 01:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
waters and land my my lobsters here
 
01:32:11.990 --> 01:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
because I have my resident at $40 and
 
01:32:14.790 --> 01:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
save $10 I am not a lawyer nor am my law
 
01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement so I might have to defer to
 
01:32:19.550 --> 01:32:19.560 align:start position:0%
them on that specific question typically
 
01:32:21.430 --> 01:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
the licenses cover the activity of that
 
01:32:23.430 --> 01:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
license like I said before and that
 
01:32:25.189 --> 01:32:25.199 align:start position:0%
activity of that license is fishing with
 
01:32:27.709 --> 01:32:27.719 align:start position:0%
those traps that that is outside of my
 
01:32:30.030 --> 01:32:30.040 align:start position:0%
scope seems an interesting question
 
01:32:31.990 --> 01:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome any other
 
01:32:35.189 --> 01:32:35.199 align:start position:0%
questions representative Darby thank you
 
01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
01:32:38.629 --> 01:32:38.639 align:start position:0%
question um in the scenario that you
 
01:32:40.910 --> 01:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
laid out where um there's a New
 
01:32:42.870 --> 01:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident that has a
 
01:32:44.990 --> 01:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts recreational
 
01:32:48.550 --> 01:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
license um I think I understood that um
 
01:32:50.189 --> 01:32:50.199 align:start position:0%
if they're coming back into port in New
 
01:32:51.870 --> 01:32:51.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's still New Hampshire sure
 
01:32:53.910 --> 01:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
that has to report that even though it's
 
01:32:56.830 --> 01:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts license that's so they
 
01:32:58.229 --> 01:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
would have reporting requirements
 
01:33:00.109 --> 01:33:00.119 align:start position:0%
probably under the license requirements
 
01:33:02.550 --> 01:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
of Massachusetts but how the how the
 
01:33:04.669 --> 01:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
amend the fishery management plan for
 
01:33:06.590 --> 01:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
lobster is written is the state of
 
01:33:09.109 --> 01:33:09.119 align:start position:0%
Landing that has the responsibility to
 
01:33:11.149 --> 01:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
make sure that that catch and effort is
 
01:33:13.750 --> 01:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
reported as well as those commercial
 
01:33:16.149 --> 01:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
Landings so the sale component of that
 
01:33:18.510 --> 01:33:18.520 align:start position:0%
thank you it was commercial
 
01:33:21.990 --> 01:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
sure any other questions seeing thank
 
01:33:23.750 --> 01:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
you so much for your testimony today
 
01:33:26.430 --> 01:33:26.440 align:start position:0%
thank you and is there anybody who has
 
01:33:28.270 --> 01:33:28.280 align:start position:0%
not spoken that needs to speak and if so
 
01:33:31.709 --> 01:33:31.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:35.669 --> 01:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
card Mr Vice chair can we just get maybe
 
01:33:37.149 --> 01:33:37.159 align:start position:0%
some clarification from law enforcement
 
01:33:38.310 --> 01:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
on a couple those questions that were
 
01:33:39.870 --> 01:33:39.880 align:start position:0%
unanswered saying there's someone here
 
01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
in the room that might be able to help
 
01:33:44.590 --> 01:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
out if he's willing to step up and and
 
01:33:47.950 --> 01:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:50.830 --> 01:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
can chair recognizes Colonel Jordan from
 
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
fishing game law enforcement morning I
 
01:33:54.510 --> 01:33:54.520 align:start position:0%
don't have my Coastal Lieutenant so
 
01:33:56.189 --> 01:33:56.199 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to forgive me uh
 
01:33:57.830 --> 01:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
due to Staffing shortages I couldn't get
 
01:34:00.910 --> 01:34:00.920 align:start position:0%
him here today but I'll do my
 
01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
best so the question I think that I had
 
01:34:05.430 --> 01:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
posed that we needed a law enforcement
 
01:34:08.629 --> 01:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
uh answer on was uh if I being a cheap
 
01:34:10.109 --> 01:34:10.119 align:start position:0%
New Englander like I am don't want to
 
01:34:12.149 --> 01:34:12.159 align:start position:0%
spend $50 for a landing license in New
 
01:34:14.669 --> 01:34:14.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but would rather spend $40 for
 
01:34:17.470 --> 01:34:17.480 align:start position:0%
a recreational trapping license that
 
01:34:20.229 --> 01:34:20.239 align:start position:0%
allows me to catch in New Hampshire
 
01:34:22.870 --> 01:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
transport and then land in New Hampshire
 
01:34:25.790 --> 01:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
yes and I also happen to have one from
 
01:34:28.470 --> 01:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts because I go to the cape
 
01:34:30.669 --> 01:34:30.679 align:start position:0%
or what have you and I trap my lobsters
 
01:34:30.679 --> 01:34:31.550 align:start position:0%
or what have you and I trap my lobsters
in

01:34:31.550 --> 01:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts can I still land them in
 
01:34:35.750 --> 01:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire under my recreational
 
01:34:37.629 --> 01:34:37.639 align:start position:0%
license in New Hampshire now you would
 
01:34:39.510 --> 01:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
have to have a commercial Landing
 
01:34:43.070 --> 01:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
license to do that if you if you were BR
 
01:34:45.109 --> 01:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
recreational if you were going to sell
 
01:34:48.430 --> 01:34:48.440 align:start position:0%
them no no this is for personal use if I
 
01:34:51.629 --> 01:34:51.639 align:start position:0%
if I trap my lobsters in Massachusetts y
 
01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
for personal use Y and instead of buying
 
01:34:56.149 --> 01:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
you're licensed in Massachusetts and I'm
 
01:34:57.950 --> 01:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
licensed in Massachusetts and I'm
 
01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
licensed with a recreational five trap
 
01:35:03.669 --> 01:35:03.679 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire okay instead of the $50
 
01:35:06.030 --> 01:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
Landing license for recreation as a
 
01:35:07.750 --> 01:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
resident in New
 
01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could I still land my lobsters
 
01:35:12.510 --> 01:35:12.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I believe you can if
 
01:35:15.149 --> 01:35:15.159 align:start position:0%
you're not selling them so I could save
 
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
$10 every year you could save $10 yes
 
01:35:19.750 --> 01:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
that's the question I had is there
 
01:35:24.390 --> 01:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
another question um yeah representative
 
01:35:28.030 --> 01:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
Brown so thank you Mr chair sorry and

01:35:30.830 --> 01:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
question so if I'm understanding this
 
01:35:33.310 --> 01:35:33.320 align:start position:0%

01:35:36.510 --> 01:35:36.520 align:start position:0%

that I will close the hearing on
1029

01:36:00.629 --> 01:36:00.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:03.189 --> 01:36:03.199 align:start position:0%
without a pause since we're running late
 
01:36:05.950 --> 01:36:05.960 align:start position:0%
I'm going to open the
 
01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:08.239 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB
 
01:36:10.510 --> 01:36:10.520 align:start position:0%
1148 and the chair recognizes
 
01:36:12.229 --> 01:36:12.239 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey the sponsor of the
 
01:36:20.310 --> 01:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:21.870 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

01:36:21.870 --> 01:36:21.880 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
01:36:23.310 --> 01:36:23.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you to the
 
01:36:26.070 --> 01:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
fishing game committee
 
01:36:28.830 --> 01:36:28.840 align:start position:0%
um I hope to be brief because I'm not
 
01:36:31.590 --> 01:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
really going to talk about the bill um
 
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
so uh this is the exact same bill that I
 
01:36:37.510 --> 01:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
submitted three years two years ago um
 
01:36:40.709 --> 01:36:40.719 align:start position:0%
except I changed an or to an and and I
 
01:36:44.629 --> 01:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
did that at the request of our Sportsman
 
01:36:46.669 --> 01:36:46.679 align:start position:0%
uh two years ago when I submitted this
 
01:36:48.430 --> 01:36:48.440 align:start position:0%
exact same bill I worked with fishing
 
01:36:51.310 --> 01:36:51.320 align:start position:0%
game for six hours over two Zoom calls
 
01:36:55.030 --> 01:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
calls uh to craft this bill and two
 
01:36:56.990 --> 01:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
years ago I had fish and game support
 
01:37:01.750 --> 01:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
for this bill basically there there's
 
01:37:04.149 --> 01:37:04.159 align:start position:0%
some minor things but the basic uh major
 
01:37:06.669 --> 01:37:06.679 align:start position:0%
thing is that it changes the nominating
 
01:37:09.310 --> 01:37:09.320 align:start position:0%
group for Fishing Game Commission from
 
01:37:12.310 --> 01:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
Sportsman's clubs to participating
 
01:37:15.109 --> 01:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
organizations that hold a
 
01:37:15.119 --> 01:37:16.669 align:start position:0%
organizations that hold a
5013c

01:37:16.669 --> 01:37:16.679 align:start position:0%
5013c
 
01:37:21.870 --> 01:37:21.880 align:start position:0%
um tax ID number and our and support
 
01:37:24.750 --> 01:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
Hunting Fishing and trapping and that's
 
01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
the or that was changed back to an and
 
01:37:32.070 --> 01:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
and scientific conservation methods
 
01:37:35.430 --> 01:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
but uh no matter what the wording is on
 
01:37:38.310 --> 01:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
this bill to me that that's not really
 
01:37:42.189 --> 01:37:42.199 align:start position:0%
the important issue today the issue is
 
01:37:46.350 --> 01:37:46.360 align:start position:0%
um is one that I believe many of us have
 
01:37:48.550 --> 01:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
been looking at for a number of years
 
01:37:51.669 --> 01:37:51.679 align:start position:0%
and we seem to be on this merry go round
 
01:37:54.990 --> 01:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
um non-consumptive users feel that they
 
01:37:57.350 --> 01:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
have no representation on the fishing
 
01:38:00.510 --> 01:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
Game Commission and yet they pay taxes
 
01:38:02.510 --> 01:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
and according to the North American
 
01:38:04.950 --> 01:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
wildlife model Wildlife belongs to all
 
01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
of us and yet fishing games uh role is
 
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
definitely to set limits and methods of
 
01:38:15.270 --> 01:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
take and i would support that so I
 
01:38:17.709 --> 01:38:17.719 align:start position:0%
believe that there's many of us on this
 
01:38:21.310 --> 01:38:21.320 align:start position:0%
committee and um in the house that see
 
01:38:24.510 --> 01:38:24.520 align:start position:0%
that there may be a possible conflict
 
01:38:27.589 --> 01:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
between those two issues um I've
 
01:38:30.830 --> 01:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
presented bills representative Reid has
 
01:38:34.149 --> 01:38:34.159 align:start position:0%
presented bills um last year the chair
 
01:38:38.030 --> 01:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
submitted a an amendment and we all take
 
01:38:40.229 --> 01:38:40.239 align:start position:0%
these bills and we look at them and we
 
01:38:42.350 --> 01:38:42.360 align:start position:0%
change a word or two here or a word or
 
01:38:45.870 --> 01:38:45.880 align:start position:0%
two there and um and we still find out
 
01:38:48.510 --> 01:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
that the bill is just not the correct
 
01:38:50.629 --> 01:38:50.639 align:start position:0%
one and to me this is the very
 
01:38:52.950 --> 01:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
definition of insanity doing the same
 
01:38:55.470 --> 01:38:55.480 align:start position:0%
thing over and over and over again and
 
01:38:57.149 --> 01:38:57.159 align:start position:0%
trying to get different results we're on
 
01:39:01.950 --> 01:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
a mar round we we need to stop that um
 
01:39:06.510 --> 01:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
it it is timec consuming it is costly
 
01:39:09.270 --> 01:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
and um it is now costing fishing game
 
01:39:11.430 --> 01:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
money in that they've had lawsuits and
 
01:39:14.390 --> 01:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
probably we'll uh look at more so we we
 
01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
just need to to look at this and so my
 
01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation is that we actually take
 
01:39:23.870 --> 01:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
this bill and form a legitimate um
 
01:39:25.510 --> 01:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
01:39:28.589 --> 01:39:28.599 align:start position:0%
group and if we do that then what we can
 
01:39:31.390 --> 01:39:31.400 align:start position:0%
do is we can first of all look and see
 
01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:35.360 align:start position:0%
is there an issue between the the two
 
01:39:37.870 --> 01:39:37.880 align:start position:0%
groups that I mentioned uh
 
01:39:41.350 --> 01:39:41.360 align:start position:0%
previously is there a problem and can we
 
01:39:44.189 --> 01:39:44.199 align:start position:0%
Define that problem you can't fix a
 
01:39:46.750 --> 01:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
problem until it's defined so can we
 
01:39:49.030 --> 01:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
actually Define that problem if there is
 
01:39:53.629 --> 01:39:53.639 align:start position:0%
one and then can it be be fixed and is
 
01:39:56.990 --> 01:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
that fix a legislative fix it seems to
 
01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
me that um over the course of the eight
 
01:40:02.470 --> 01:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
years that I've been on the committee
 
01:40:04.550 --> 01:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
and even two years before I was on the
 
01:40:06.550 --> 01:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
committee so over the course of 10 years
 
01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
we have looked at this issue at least
 
01:40:12.629 --> 01:40:12.639 align:start position:0%
eight or nine times and we've gotten
 
01:40:15.750 --> 01:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
nowhere fast it's so it seems to me that
 
01:40:17.990 --> 01:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
with that number of bills um being
 
01:40:19.550 --> 01:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
submitted to this fish and game
 
01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
committee we we don't we just don't know
 
01:40:25.870 --> 01:40:25.880 align:start position:0%
what we don't know and to me that's not
 
01:40:29.589 --> 01:40:29.599 align:start position:0%
good conservation so I would um
 
01:40:32.990 --> 01:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
recommend that we look at um this in a
 
01:40:36.030 --> 01:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
new way and sit down with the interested
 
01:40:39.750 --> 01:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
parties and see if we can um do exactly
 
01:40:42.109 --> 01:40:42.119 align:start position:0%
what I said define the problem see if it
 
01:40:44.189 --> 01:40:44.199 align:start position:0%
can be fixed and see if the fix is a
 
01:40:47.550 --> 01:40:47.560 align:start position:0%
legislative one thank you for your
 
01:40:49.870 --> 01:40:49.880 align:start position:0%
time and I assume you'll take questions
 
01:40:52.510 --> 01:40:52.520 align:start position:0%
if we have any sure I have one I just
 
01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:54.320 align:start position:0%
want to clarify as the prime sponsor
 
01:40:55.910 --> 01:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
you've recommended interim study so this
 
01:40:58.189 --> 01:40:58.199 align:start position:0%
can be looked at over the summer yes
 
01:41:00.030 --> 01:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and I would very
 
01:41:02.430 --> 01:41:02.440 align:start position:0%
much like to be on that study if that's
 
01:41:05.350 --> 01:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
um permissible for me to ask the the
 
01:41:08.510 --> 01:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
chair will take that consideration take
 
01:41:10.629 --> 01:41:10.639 align:start position:0%
it into consideration and designate a a
 
01:41:12.910 --> 01:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
team for that interim study as we've got
 
01:41:14.310 --> 01:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
several interim studies we'll probably
 
01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
be having a few on different ones thank
 
01:41:20.390 --> 01:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
you um any further questions
 
01:41:22.790 --> 01:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative goalie thank you Mr chair
 
01:41:26.430 --> 01:41:26.440 align:start position:0%
and I just want to say that while a
 
01:41:28.910 --> 01:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
study committee may be put together that
 
01:41:30.270 --> 01:41:30.280 align:start position:0%
any member on this committee who has
 
01:41:32.149 --> 01:41:32.159 align:start position:0%
interest is more than welcome to attend
 
01:41:35.070 --> 01:41:35.080 align:start position:0%

just for members of the the committee
 
01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
that don't know uh and haven't been on
 
01:41:44.470 --> 01:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
an interim study committee interim study
 
01:41:45.790 --> 01:41:45.800 align:start position:0%
committees are open to the public they
 
01:41:47.990 --> 01:41:48.000 align:start position:0%

questions uh in November of
 
01:43:14.629 --> 01:43:14.639 align:start position:0%
2022 I filed a taxpayer standing lawsuit
 
01:43:16.270 --> 01:43:16.280 align:start position:0%
against the New Hampshire fishing game
 
01:43:19.790 --> 01:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
department in Treasure Superior Court
 
01:43:22.669 --> 01:43:22.679 align:start position:0%
the number of the lawsuit uh the file
 
01:43:25.229 --> 01:43:25.239 align:start position:0%
number is included in the testimony that
 
01:43:27.229 --> 01:43:27.239 align:start position:0%
I uploaded to the general Court's
 
01:43:29.550 --> 01:43:29.560 align:start position:0%
website um if you'd like to track down
 
01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:30.709 align:start position:0%
website um if you'd like to track down
the

01:43:30.709 --> 01:43:30.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:43:34.550 --> 01:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
documents uh the the basic premise of my
 
01:43:38.550 --> 01:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
lawsuit is that it violates a wide
 
01:43:41.950 --> 01:43:41.960 align:start position:0%
variety of constitutional provisions and
 
01:43:45.470 --> 01:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
state statutes when a commission that is
 
01:43:48.709 --> 01:43:48.719 align:start position:0%
unelected reports to no one and is
 
01:43:51.629 --> 01:43:51.639 align:start position:0%
nominated for the explicit purpose
 
01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
of promoting and protecting the
 
01:43:55.510 --> 01:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
interests of a tiny minority of the
 
01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:56.430 align:start position:0%
interests of a tiny minority of the
state

01:43:56.430 --> 01:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:43:56.440 --> 01:43:58.270 align:start position:0%
state
citizens

01:43:58.270 --> 01:43:58.280 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
overseas supervises and approves the use
 
01:44:03.270 --> 01:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
of public
 
01:44:06.030 --> 01:44:06.040 align:start position:0%
funds the state made a motion to dismiss
 
01:44:08.510 --> 01:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
my lawsuit on a technical issue which
 
01:44:11.589 --> 01:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
was granted however the lawsuit was not
 
01:44:14.430 --> 01:44:14.440 align:start position:0%
adjudicated on the merits and the court
 
01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
did not state whether it was dismissed
 
01:44:18.310 --> 01:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
with or without
 
01:44:23.070 --> 01:44:23.080 align:start position:0%
prejudice so it can under RSA 50810 it
 
01:44:26.270 --> 01:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
can be refiled within a year which would
 
01:44:27.790 --> 01:44:27.800 align:start position:0%
be mid
 
01:44:31.310 --> 01:44:31.320 align:start position:0%
April my decision on whether to refile
 
01:44:35.189 --> 01:44:35.199 align:start position:0%
the lawsuit will be based largely on my
 
01:44:38.669 --> 01:44:38.679 align:start position:0%
impression of the legislator's intent to
 
01:44:41.830 --> 01:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
correct the egregious Injustice against
 
01:44:45.350 --> 01:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
the 87% of New Hampshire's population
 
01:44:47.070 --> 01:44:47.080 align:start position:0%
who prefer to have non-fatal
 
01:44:49.350 --> 01:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
interactions with
 
01:44:51.109 --> 01:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
Wildlife um
 
01:44:53.470 --> 01:44:53.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the bill before you now
 
01:44:56.990 --> 01:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
will not do that because it still
 
01:44:59.430 --> 01:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
requires that members of the commission
 
01:45:02.149 --> 01:45:02.159 align:start position:0%
hold hunting trapping or fishing
 
01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
licenses for the duration of their terms
 
01:45:08.270 --> 01:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
and it still requires that nominating
 
01:45:10.990 --> 01:45:11.000 align:start position:0%
organizations um acknowledge in their
 
01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:12.430 align:start position:0%
organizations um acknowledge in their
permanent

01:45:12.430 --> 01:45:12.440 align:start position:0%
permanent
 
01:45:15.589 --> 01:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
bylaws the protection and promotion of
 
01:45:17.950 --> 01:45:17.960 align:start position:0%
hunting tripping and hunting trapping
 
01:45:19.470 --> 01:45:19.480 align:start position:0%
and fishing excuse
 
01:45:23.430 --> 01:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
me but taxpayer standing
 
01:45:25.390 --> 01:45:25.400 align:start position:0%
lawsuits under New Hampshire
 
01:45:28.870 --> 01:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
Constitution part one article 8 can be
 
01:45:31.589 --> 01:45:31.599 align:start position:0%
filed by any taxpayer who is eligible to
 
01:45:34.350 --> 01:45:34.360 align:start position:0%
vote in any
 
01:45:38.470 --> 01:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
County so regardless of my decision as
 
01:45:41.790 --> 01:45:41.800 align:start position:0%
to whether to refile my lawsuit if the
 
01:45:45.750 --> 01:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
legislature decides once again not to
 
01:45:48.750 --> 01:45:48.760 align:start position:0%
extend um representation on the
 
01:45:51.750 --> 01:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
commission to the 87 % of New
 
01:45:53.870 --> 01:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's population who prefer
 
01:45:56.709 --> 01:45:56.719 align:start position:0%
non-fatal interactions with Wildlife I
 
01:45:58.950 --> 01:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
do anticipate that several of my
 
01:46:02.070 --> 01:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
colleagues will file their own taxpayer
 
01:46:05.149 --> 01:46:05.159 align:start position:0%
standing lawsuits in their own
 
01:46:08.830 --> 01:46:08.840 align:start position:0%
counties so to give you some idea as an
 
01:46:10.990 --> 01:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
example of the kind of expenditures that
 
01:46:12.189 --> 01:46:12.199 align:start position:0%
could be
 
01:46:14.910 --> 01:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
challenged The Fishing Game Commission
 
01:46:16.470 --> 01:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
is responsible
 
01:46:20.229 --> 01:46:20.239 align:start position:0%
for developing funding and implementing
 
01:46:22.189 --> 01:46:22.199 align:start position:0%
the long-term strategic plan which
 
01:46:24.270 --> 01:46:24.280 align:start position:0%
guides the direction of the
 
01:46:27.270 --> 01:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
department the wildlife
 
01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
program is a part of the long-term
 
01:46:32.790 --> 01:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
strategic plan so a New Hampshire
 
01:46:35.550 --> 01:46:35.560 align:start position:0%
taxpayer who is eligible to vote could
 
01:46:38.790 --> 01:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
challenge every expenditure of the
 
01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:40.030 align:start position:0%
challenge every expenditure of the
wildlife

01:46:40.030 --> 01:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
wildlife
 
01:46:43.790 --> 01:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
program because the funding is overseen
 
01:46:46.430 --> 01:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
by a commission whose members are
 
01:46:49.510 --> 01:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
unelected report to no one and are
 
01:46:52.589 --> 01:46:52.599 align:start position:0%
nominated for the explicit purpose of
 
01:46:54.310 --> 01:46:54.320 align:start position:0%
protecting and promoting the interests
 
01:46:58.270 --> 01:46:58.280 align:start position:0%
of a tiny minority of New Hampshire
 
01:47:01.510 --> 01:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
citizens New Hampshire Constitution part
 
01:47:06.790 --> 01:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
one article 8 states that expenditures
 
01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
can be challenged that have already
 
01:47:13.669 --> 01:47:13.679 align:start position:0%
happened or expenditures that are
 
01:47:13.679 --> 01:47:15.270 align:start position:0%
happened or expenditures that are
approved

01:47:15.270 --> 01:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
approved
 
01:47:17.990 --> 01:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
so if a person decided to challenge
 
01:47:19.950 --> 01:47:19.960 align:start position:0%
every expenditure in the wildlife
 
01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:21.149 align:start position:0%
every expenditure in the wildlife
program

01:47:21.149 --> 01:47:21.159 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:47:24.790 --> 01:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
they would use the state expenditure
 
01:47:28.350 --> 01:47:28.360 align:start position:0%
register at transparent New Hampshire
 
01:47:30.470 --> 01:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
which makes it very easy to identify
 
01:47:33.910 --> 01:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
every expenditure down to the penny if a
 
01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:34.990 align:start position:0%
every expenditure down to the penny if a
judge

01:47:34.990 --> 01:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
judge
 
01:47:38.910 --> 01:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
agreed that that these expenditures were
 
01:47:40.950 --> 01:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional the next step for the
 
01:47:43.470 --> 01:47:43.480 align:start position:0%
plaintiff might be to ask the court to
 
01:47:45.149 --> 01:47:45.159 align:start position:0%
issue an injunction ma'am we're getting
 
01:47:46.550 --> 01:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
a little off track here I'd like you to
 
01:47:49.350 --> 01:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
stay focused on the bill itself please
 
01:47:50.990 --> 01:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
this is part of the bill no this is
 
01:47:52.990 --> 01:47:53.000 align:start position:0%
talking about litigation this is not
 
01:47:55.109 --> 01:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
focused on the on the bill please stay
 
01:47:57.350 --> 01:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
focused on the bill at hand do you have
 
01:47:59.510 --> 01:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
objections to language in the bill do
 
01:48:02.149 --> 01:48:02.159 align:start position:0%
you have objections to specific parts of
 
01:48:04.750 --> 01:48:04.760 align:start position:0%
the bill excuse me representative Harvey
 
01:48:07.990 --> 01:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
asked me to explain my lawsuit to you
 
01:48:09.550 --> 01:48:09.560 align:start position:0%
you're you're out of bounds and I'm
 
01:48:10.669 --> 01:48:10.679 align:start position:0%
going to ask you to leave because I've
 
01:48:12.229 --> 01:48:12.239 align:start position:0%
asked you twice now to keep it focused
 
01:48:14.470 --> 01:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
and you've you've now challenged my own
 
01:48:19.229 --> 01:48:19.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:19.239 --> 01:48:22.950 align:start position:0%
 
done

01:48:22.950 --> 01:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:25.709 --> 01:48:25.719 align:start position:0%
chair now calls uh Kyle Baker the last
 
01:48:29.950 --> 01:48:29.960 align:start position:0%

1532 and the chair recognizes Jonathan
 
01:56:04.990 --> 01:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
Smith uh from fishing game committee for
 
01:56:06.830 --> 01:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
the as the prime sponsor of the bill for
 
01:56:09.310 --> 01:56:09.320 align:start position:0%
five minutes he's handed out 20 copies
 
01:56:14.310 --> 01:56:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:16.990 --> 01:56:17.000 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you Mr chairman my name
 
01:56:19.109 --> 01:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
is Jonathan Smith I represent the great
 
01:56:22.550 --> 01:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
people of oopy in Carol County District
 
01:56:25.030 --> 01:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
5 um everyone should have in front of
 
01:56:26.870 --> 01:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
them I handed it out earlier I basically
 
01:56:29.270 --> 01:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
took the bill and Below each section of
 
01:56:32.990 --> 01:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
the bill I put my words in bold and in
 
01:56:35.669 --> 01:56:35.679 align:start position:0%
parentheses so you'll reference related
 
01:56:37.109 --> 01:56:37.119 align:start position:0%
so it keeps everyone on track with the
 
01:56:39.189 --> 01:56:39.199 align:start position:0%
different parts of the bill just give a
 
01:56:41.910 --> 01:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
quick history uh this legislation that
 
01:56:44.350 --> 01:56:44.360 align:start position:0%
you see regarding tree stands and game
 
01:56:47.069 --> 01:56:47.079 align:start position:0%
cameras was before us last year the game
 
01:56:48.830 --> 01:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
camera bill was sp14 it went to
 
01:56:49.950 --> 01:56:49.960 align:start position:0%
Committee of conf conference and was
 
01:56:51.390 --> 01:56:51.400 align:start position:0%
placed into HB
 
01:56:53.910 --> 01:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
221 uh on the consent calendar and S
 
01:56:56.270 --> 01:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
sp15 was a standalone bill that became
 
01:56:58.830 --> 01:56:58.840 align:start position:0%
law and in my opinion there's some
 
01:57:00.589 --> 01:57:00.599 align:start position:0%
serious administrative and legal
 
01:57:03.069 --> 01:57:03.079 align:start position:0%
deficiencies within the current law so
 
01:57:06.229 --> 01:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
if you open up your testimony before you
 
01:57:08.669 --> 01:57:08.679 align:start position:0%
and you'll see under Section six of the
 
01:57:10.629 --> 01:57:10.639 align:start position:0%
bill I'm just going to read it because
 
01:57:12.470 --> 01:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
it keeps everybody on track this section
 
01:57:15.430 --> 01:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
six clarifies enforcement currently tree
 
01:57:17.550 --> 01:57:17.560 align:start position:0%
stands can be erected until December
 
01:57:19.950 --> 01:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
31st however tree stands can be left in
 
01:57:22.870 --> 01:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
the woods until June 1st tree stands can
 
01:57:25.629 --> 01:57:25.639 align:start position:0%
then be rected again on April 25th how
 
01:57:27.430 --> 01:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
are fishing game officers going to know
 
01:57:29.149 --> 01:57:29.159 align:start position:0%
if a tree stand in the woods prior to
 
01:57:31.470 --> 01:57:31.480 align:start position:0%
April 25th has been left from the
 
01:57:33.470 --> 01:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
previous year or placed earlier than
 
01:57:36.550 --> 01:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
April 25th in violation of the law my
 
01:57:38.390 --> 01:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
language clarifies it by allowing tree
 
01:57:40.229 --> 01:57:40.239 align:start position:0%
stands to be erected from August 1st to
 
01:57:42.910 --> 01:57:42.920 align:start position:0%
June 1st this requires removal of that
 
01:57:45.270 --> 01:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
tree stand for a two-month period and
 
01:57:47.270 --> 01:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
gives fishing game officers a clear way
 
01:57:49.550 --> 01:57:49.560 align:start position:0%
to conduct enforcement you want me to to
 
01:57:50.669 --> 01:57:50.679 align:start position:0%
keep going Mr chair you want going to
 
01:57:52.870 --> 01:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
have questions on each section keep
 
01:57:56.870 --> 01:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
going okay next section section seven
 
01:57:58.830 --> 01:57:58.840 align:start position:0%
this section s will give flexibility
 
01:58:00.470 --> 01:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
between the landowner and the person
 
01:58:02.270 --> 01:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
requesting to erect a tree stand year
 
01:58:04.550 --> 01:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
round it will allow a landowner to
 
01:58:06.589 --> 01:58:06.599 align:start position:0%
permit a multi-year agreement at their
 
01:58:08.629 --> 01:58:08.639 align:start position:0%
choosing because current law allows uh
 
01:58:08.639 --> 01:58:09.830 align:start position:0%
choosing because current law allows uh
States

01:58:09.830 --> 01:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
States
 
01:58:12.390 --> 01:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
every agreement must expire on December
 
01:58:13.990 --> 01:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
31st each year this will give
 
01:58:16.069 --> 01:58:16.079 align:start position:0%
flexibility to the landowner and
 
01:58:17.750 --> 01:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
relieving the burden of having to come
 
01:58:19.030 --> 01:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
back for yearly agreements between
 
01:58:19.040 --> 01:58:19.910 align:start position:0%
back for yearly agreements between
Hunter

01:58:19.910 --> 01:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
Hunter
 
01:58:22.950 --> 01:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
and the land owners we can go down right
 
01:58:25.350 --> 01:58:25.360 align:start position:0%
straight down to section
 
01:58:28.069 --> 01:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
11 uh section 11 restores the rights of
 
01:58:30.030 --> 01:58:30.040 align:start position:0%
landowners to control and remove what is
 
01:58:32.229 --> 01:58:32.239 align:start position:0%
placed upon their property current law
 
01:58:34.069 --> 01:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
mandates that you must notify law
 
01:58:35.589 --> 01:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
enforcement to get permission to remove
 
01:58:38.069 --> 01:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
a tree stand by replacing the word shall
 
01:58:40.470 --> 01:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
with may you restore property rights to
 
01:58:42.629 --> 01:58:42.639 align:start position:0%
the owner this right is inherent and
 
01:58:44.069 --> 01:58:44.079 align:start position:0%
should not require permission from the
 
01:58:46.030 --> 01:58:46.040 align:start position:0%
government to remove a tree stand this
 
01:58:47.510 --> 01:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
is no different than if you found a
 
01:58:49.950 --> 01:58:49.960 align:start position:0%
bicycle upon your land to be clear this
 
01:58:52.550 --> 01:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
does not give the right of the owner to
 
01:58:54.350 --> 01:58:54.360 align:start position:0%
claim ownership of that property it only
 
01:58:55.910 --> 01:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
gives him the right to be able to remove
 
01:58:58.189 --> 01:58:58.199 align:start position:0%
it uh if the rifle owner requests a
 
01:58:59.830 --> 01:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
return on that property it must be
 
01:59:02.510 --> 01:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
returned as per current law this change
 
01:59:04.589 --> 01:59:04.599 align:start position:0%
is supported by part one article two
 
01:59:06.229 --> 01:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
natural rights of the New Hampshire
 
01:59:08.470 --> 01:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
state constitution and I ask you to read
 
01:59:10.229 --> 01:59:10.239 align:start position:0%
that section while I'm testifying you'll
 
01:59:13.069 --> 01:59:13.079 align:start position:0%
understand the reasoning behind it if we
 
01:59:16.030 --> 01:59:16.040 align:start position:0%
go down to next section this is getting
 
01:59:18.550 --> 01:59:18.560 align:start position:0%
into the game camera area this section
 
01:59:20.790 --> 01:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
four restores the rights of land owners
 
01:59:22.510 --> 01:59:22.520 align:start position:0%
to control and remove what is placed
 
01:59:24.950 --> 01:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
upon their property current law mandates
 
01:59:26.790 --> 01:59:26.800 align:start position:0%
you must notify law enforcement to get
 
01:59:28.669 --> 01:59:28.679 align:start position:0%
commission to remove a game camera by
 
01:59:30.510 --> 01:59:30.520 align:start position:0%
replacing sha with may you restore
 
01:59:32.510 --> 01:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
property rights to the owner this right
 
01:59:33.990 --> 01:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
is inherent and should not require
 
01:59:35.270 --> 01:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
permission from the government to remove
 
01:59:37.589 --> 01:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
a game camera again this is no different
 
01:59:39.189 --> 01:59:39.199 align:start position:0%
than if you found a bicycle upon your
 
01:59:41.310 --> 01:59:41.320 align:start position:0%
land to be clear this does not give the
 
01:59:42.589 --> 01:59:42.599 align:start position:0%
right of the owner to claim that
 
01:59:44.270 --> 01:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
property but if the rightful owner
 
01:59:45.790 --> 01:59:45.800 align:start position:0%
requests the return of that property it
 
01:59:47.669 --> 01:59:47.679 align:start position:0%
must be returned as per current law
 
01:59:49.350 --> 01:59:49.360 align:start position:0%
again this change is supported by part
 
01:59:51.069 --> 01:59:51.079 align:start position:0%

02:00:59.669 --> 02:00:59.679 align:start position:0%
off of my testimony to a couple other
 
02:01:02.109 --> 02:01:02.119 align:start position:0%
areas that I I Envision that maybe
 
02:01:03.629 --> 02:01:03.639 align:start position:0%
counterarguments to these changes which
 
02:01:06.310 --> 02:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
are constitutional changes and directly
 
02:01:07.870 --> 02:01:07.880 align:start position:0%
related to property rights this is
 
02:01:11.910 --> 02:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan everyone here owns uh land
 
02:01:13.709 --> 02:01:13.719 align:start position:0%
if you saw a game camera out your back
 
02:01:15.149 --> 02:01:15.159 align:start position:0%
door wouldn't you want the right to
 
02:01:16.589 --> 02:01:16.599 align:start position:0%
remove it or you're walking down through
 
02:01:17.750 --> 02:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
Trails through your Woods wouldn't you
 
02:01:19.790 --> 02:01:19.800 align:start position:0%
want the right to remove it that is
 
02:01:21.589 --> 02:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
inherent in everyone's property
 
02:01:24.430 --> 02:01:24.440 align:start position:0%
ownership there is something called uh
 
02:01:25.990 --> 02:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
the Open Fields Doctrine or the open
 
02:01:29.149 --> 02:01:29.159 align:start position:0%
Woods doctrine that it's a 1920 Hester
 
02:01:31.790 --> 02:01:31.800 align:start position:0%
vers the US uh it was Hester versus the
 
02:01:34.229 --> 02:01:34.239 align:start position:0%
US in the Supreme Court case where the
 
02:01:37.629 --> 02:01:37.639 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court ruled that fishing game or
 
02:01:39.430 --> 02:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
game wardens as I think they worded it
 
02:01:42.390 --> 02:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
have a right to enter posted land freely
 
02:01:44.470 --> 02:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
and openly to enforce game laws which I
 
02:01:46.030 --> 02:01:46.040 align:start position:0%
don't dispute that that's fine that's
 
02:01:47.669 --> 02:01:47.679 align:start position:0%
actually being contested and going to be
 
02:01:49.430 --> 02:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
back to the Supreme Court soon anyway on
 
02:01:52.350 --> 02:01:52.360 align:start position:0%
multiple fronts so I think the argument
 
02:01:54.990 --> 02:01:55.000 align:start position:0%
is going to be well game cameras placing
 
02:01:56.189 --> 02:01:56.199 align:start position:0%
them in the woods as part of that Open
 
02:01:58.510 --> 02:01:58.520 align:start position:0%
Fields auction I I can I can attest and
 
02:01:59.910 --> 02:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
it's a fact there were no game cameras
 
02:02:02.510 --> 02:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
in 1920 the electronic surveillance
 
02:02:04.510 --> 02:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
technology that exists today did not
 
02:02:06.629 --> 02:02:06.639 align:start position:0%
exist in 1920 I'm not opposed to a
 
02:02:08.270 --> 02:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
fishing game officer walking freely
 
02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
using his eyes to observe but game
 
02:02:14.030 --> 02:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
cameras that that crosses the line uh
 
02:02:15.790 --> 02:02:15.800 align:start position:0%
another example was I just took a drone
 
02:02:18.069 --> 02:02:18.079 align:start position:0%
Class part of your municipality at I'm a
 
02:02:19.470 --> 02:02:19.480 align:start position:0%
selectman in my town
 
02:02:21.109 --> 02:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
and law enforcement was there and I
 
02:02:23.390 --> 02:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
asked the very question can drones be
 
02:02:25.990 --> 02:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
flown freely over someone's property
 
02:02:27.910 --> 02:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
without a warrant and they said not if
 
02:02:29.510 --> 02:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
it's in official capacity conducting
 
02:02:31.470 --> 02:02:31.480 align:start position:0%
official business it will be deemed a
 
02:02:33.189 --> 02:02:33.199 align:start position:0%
warrant would be required why is a game
 
02:02:35.229 --> 02:02:35.239 align:start position:0%
camera any different why can a game
 
02:02:37.589 --> 02:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
camera be placed without a warrant or
 
02:02:40.229 --> 02:02:40.239 align:start position:0%
just with uh other lawful actions as the
 
02:02:43.589 --> 02:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
bill as the law says um and game cameras
 
02:02:46.270 --> 02:02:46.280 align:start position:0%
can't I mean I'm sorry when drones can't
 
02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
and I I think this legislative fix that
 
02:02:51.669 --> 02:02:51.679 align:start position:0%
I present before you there's multiple
 
02:02:53.629 --> 02:02:53.639 align:start position:0%
lawsuits for these very instances in
 
02:02:56.069 --> 02:02:56.079 align:start position:0%
other states where game wardens have
 
02:02:57.629 --> 02:02:57.639 align:start position:0%
placed game cameras for surveillance
 
02:02:59.550 --> 02:02:59.560 align:start position:0%
upon private land without the landowner
 
02:03:01.589 --> 02:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
knowing without a warrant or without
 
02:03:03.109 --> 02:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
written permission and there's multiple
 
02:03:04.790 --> 02:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
multiple lawsuits and this will end up
 
02:03:06.229 --> 02:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
going to the Supreme Court at some point
 
02:03:08.950 --> 02:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
in the future um and I just want to end
 
02:03:11.189 --> 02:03:11.199 align:start position:0%
with if you really think about it it's
 
02:03:14.030 --> 02:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
kind of hypocritical that uh we as a
 
02:03:16.709 --> 02:03:16.719 align:start position:0%
legislative body gave permission for
 
02:03:18.990 --> 02:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
fishing game to put game cameras upon
 
02:03:21.510 --> 02:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
private land without written permission
 
02:03:23.870 --> 02:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
or without consent but then we ask
 
02:03:25.510 --> 02:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
private land owners to get written
 
02:03:27.109 --> 02:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
permission to place gam cameras upon
 
02:03:29.550 --> 02:03:29.560 align:start position:0%
private land the government works for
 
02:03:31.790 --> 02:03:31.800 align:start position:0%
the people it seems backwards there that
 
02:03:33.550 --> 02:03:33.560 align:start position:0%
they have card blanch to place them but
 
02:03:35.870 --> 02:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
a person cannot so I'll be glad to take
 
02:03:38.149 --> 02:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you for your
 
02:03:40.229 --> 02:03:40.239 align:start position:0%
testimony uh let me start off with a
 
02:03:41.790 --> 02:03:41.800 align:start position:0%
question because I just want to clarify
 
02:03:44.669 --> 02:03:44.679 align:start position:0%
sure the bill the way it's written with
 
02:03:48.430 --> 02:03:48.440 align:start position:0%
that you've presented us would allow
 
02:03:50.350 --> 02:03:50.360 align:start position:0%
fishing game officer to place a camera
 
02:03:51.950 --> 02:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
on someone's property if they have the
 
02:03:54.589 --> 02:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
landowner's written permission correct
 
02:03:56.830 --> 02:03:56.840 align:start position:0%
or if the landowner is maybe the subject
 
02:03:58.669 --> 02:03:58.679 align:start position:0%
of the person they're investigating they
 
02:04:00.270 --> 02:04:00.280 align:start position:0%
could get a warrant
 
02:04:02.510 --> 02:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
correct okay because you wouldn't want
 
02:04:03.910 --> 02:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
to ask for written permission from the
 
02:04:05.750 --> 02:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
person you're investigating absolutely
 
02:04:07.229 --> 02:04:07.239 align:start position:0%
correct so that allows for the warrant
 
02:04:09.310 --> 02:04:09.320 align:start position:0%
process correct and then the person the
 
02:04:11.350 --> 02:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
landowner doesn't have to know correct
 
02:04:13.390 --> 02:04:13.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for clarifying that are
 
02:04:15.589 --> 02:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
there any other questions we'll start
 
02:04:16.910 --> 02:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
with representative Tudor who's been
 
02:04:20.390 --> 02:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
very quiet today sure thank you for
 
02:04:22.229 --> 02:04:22.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question please turn on your
 
02:04:24.390 --> 02:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
mic thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:04:25.950 --> 02:04:25.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm just curious
 
02:04:28.149 --> 02:04:28.159 align:start position:0%
that as I walk across my property which
 
02:04:29.830 --> 02:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
has hunting stands all over it and I
 
02:04:32.229 --> 02:04:32.239 align:start position:0%
find them that maybe illegal maybe I
 
02:04:34.270 --> 02:04:34.280 align:start position:0%
haven't given permission for and I take
 
02:04:36.310 --> 02:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
them down do I need to create a shed to
 
02:04:38.629 --> 02:04:38.639 align:start position:0%
store them forever or how long do I have
 
02:04:41.549 --> 02:04:41.559 align:start position:0%
to hold them for before you know since I
 
02:04:42.950 --> 02:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
wait for someone to come back and get
 
02:04:45.189 --> 02:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
them that I couldn't answer at something
 
02:04:46.510 --> 02:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
I guess you'd have to consult with your
 
02:04:48.549 --> 02:04:48.559 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement at what point can
 
02:04:48.559 --> 02:04:49.390 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement at what point can
I

02:04:49.390 --> 02:04:49.400 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:04:51.069 --> 02:04:51.079 align:start position:0%
take ownership of this or consider it
 
02:04:54.229 --> 02:04:54.239 align:start position:0%
lost and found or do I need to surrender
 
02:04:55.510 --> 02:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
it to the local police department that's
 
02:04:56.910 --> 02:04:56.920 align:start position:0%
something to consult with your local uh
 
02:04:56.920 --> 02:04:59.189 align:start position:0%
something to consult with your local uh
police

02:04:59.189 --> 02:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
police
 
02:05:01.750 --> 02:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
chief thank you further questions
 
02:05:01.760 --> 02:05:03.229 align:start position:0%
chief thank you further questions
representative

02:05:03.229 --> 02:05:03.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:05:05.310 --> 02:05:05.320 align:start position:0%
Darby thank you Mr chair thank you
 
02:05:08.270 --> 02:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question so
 
02:05:11.030 --> 02:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
um with respect to the you know removing
 
02:05:13.069 --> 02:05:13.079 align:start position:0%
the property owners uh removing game
 
02:05:16.350 --> 02:05:16.360 align:start position:0%
cameras and tree St I'm sure you've seen
 
02:05:18.149 --> 02:05:18.159 align:start position:0%
because I see it all the time on
 
02:05:20.709 --> 02:05:20.719 align:start position:0%
Facebook people that get very angry when
 
02:05:23.790 --> 02:05:23.800 align:start position:0%
their um game cameras are removed um are
 
02:05:25.629 --> 02:05:25.639 align:start position:0%
you concerned at all that this may
 
02:05:28.350 --> 02:05:28.360 align:start position:0%
result in confrontations between game
 
02:05:32.270 --> 02:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
camera owners and um Property Owners
 
02:05:34.549 --> 02:05:34.559 align:start position:0%
well I think that goes back to maybe the
 
02:05:37.390 --> 02:05:37.400 align:start position:0%
Old Law where maybe in the old way you
 
02:05:39.109 --> 02:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
could place cameras everywhere freely
 
02:05:42.189 --> 02:05:42.199 align:start position:0%
and openly I'm not looking to change uh
 
02:05:44.189 --> 02:05:44.199 align:start position:0%
the current law which states you need
 
02:05:46.830 --> 02:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
permission to place a game camera so if
 
02:05:48.229 --> 02:05:48.239 align:start position:0%
somebody's placing a game camera
 
02:05:49.669 --> 02:05:49.679 align:start position:0%
illegally Al without permission on
 
02:05:51.030 --> 02:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
someone else's land I don't think
 
02:05:52.189 --> 02:05:52.199 align:start position:0%
they're going to be raising a stink
 
02:05:53.629 --> 02:05:53.639 align:start position:0%
because they're saying hey look I'm
 
02:05:54.990 --> 02:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
guilty I put a camera where I'm not
 
02:05:56.430 --> 02:05:56.440 align:start position:0%
supposed to I don't think you're going
 
02:05:57.910 --> 02:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
to see those conflicts especially with
 
02:05:59.669 --> 02:05:59.679 align:start position:0%
the new law that was passed last year
 
02:06:01.790 --> 02:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
and I'm not looking to upend that it's
 
02:06:03.549 --> 02:06:03.559 align:start position:0%
you still going to require written
 
02:06:05.750 --> 02:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
permission to place a game camera upon
 
02:06:08.350 --> 02:06:08.360 align:start position:0%
someone else's land
 
02:06:11.870 --> 02:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
yep any further questions representative
 
02:06:15.270 --> 02:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
Brown uh thank you Mr chair
 
02:06:19.229 --> 02:06:19.239 align:start position:0%
um I noticed rereading this last night
 
02:06:21.669 --> 02:06:21.679 align:start position:0%
that the the landowner permission
 
02:06:23.589 --> 02:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
expires on December
 
02:06:27.549 --> 02:06:27.559 align:start position:0%
31st but you can put your stand back up
 
02:06:30.510 --> 02:06:30.520 align:start position:0%
August 1st to June 1st would it make
 
02:06:33.470 --> 02:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
sense to modify that December 31st to
 
02:06:37.629 --> 02:06:37.639 align:start position:0%
June to the last day in June uh in May
 
02:06:40.950 --> 02:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
so that the landowner doesn't have to
 
02:06:43.229 --> 02:06:43.239 align:start position:0%
reive permission again in the middle of
 
02:06:46.149 --> 02:06:46.159 align:start position:0%
that period so I I I think I understand
 
02:06:48.069 --> 02:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
your your intent there but I think you
 
02:06:50.470 --> 02:06:50.480 align:start position:0%
overwhelm majority of the populace runs
 
02:06:52.950 --> 02:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
their life on a calendar year January 1
 
02:06:56.430 --> 02:06:56.440 align:start position:0%
to December 31 um and to keep it simple
 
02:06:57.669 --> 02:06:57.679 align:start position:0%
come the end of the year if the person
 
02:06:58.990 --> 02:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
wants to extend that agreement he's
 
02:07:00.510 --> 02:07:00.520 align:start position:0%
going to have to say well it's coming up
 
02:07:01.629 --> 02:07:01.639 align:start position:0%
to the end of the year and I want to put
 
02:07:03.629 --> 02:07:03.639 align:start position:0%
my stand back out in April I need to get
 
02:07:05.510 --> 02:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
a new agreement for the following
 
02:07:11.350 --> 02:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
year thank you and another followup um
 
02:07:14.390 --> 02:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
and is a permite and a permit the same
 
02:07:15.629 --> 02:07:15.639 align:start position:0%
thing as owner
 
02:07:17.430 --> 02:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
permission it seems like there's two
 
02:07:18.990 --> 02:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
different terms there reference me to
 
02:07:21.430 --> 02:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
where that is in in the bill let's see
 
02:07:22.830 --> 02:07:22.840 align:start position:0%
page one line
 
02:07:26.109 --> 02:07:26.119 align:start position:0%
910 so we get owner permission from the
 
02:07:28.030 --> 02:07:28.040 align:start position:0%
property owner but on nine and 10 it
 
02:07:32.069 --> 02:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
says uh excuse me on 10 the permit shall
 
02:07:34.310 --> 02:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
expire and elsewhere it says permit T
 
02:07:35.549 --> 02:07:35.559 align:start position:0%
which I can't tell you where that is
 
02:07:37.470 --> 02:07:37.480 align:start position:0%
right now but should it
 
02:07:39.910 --> 02:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
say the landowner permissions shall
 
02:07:42.629 --> 02:07:42.639 align:start position:0%
expire or is that a
 
02:07:45.310 --> 02:07:45.320 align:start position:0%
typical uh terminology used by fishing
 
02:07:46.950 --> 02:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
game for landowner permission would be a
 
02:07:50.069 --> 02:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
permit that's I know that's a little
 
02:07:53.030 --> 02:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
so you said line nine I'm looking at
 
02:07:56.189 --> 02:07:56.199 align:start position:0%
line nine 10 line 10 it says the permit
 
02:07:58.069 --> 02:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
shall expire in December 31st of the
 
02:08:01.629 --> 02:08:01.639 align:start position:0%
current year right and when may I so
 
02:08:03.709 --> 02:08:03.719 align:start position:0%
yeah let me just interject here I think
 
02:08:06.310 --> 02:08:06.320 align:start position:0%
uh repres representative it's he's
 
02:08:09.549 --> 02:08:09.559 align:start position:0%
looking at uh the the is the terminology
 
02:08:11.910 --> 02:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
equated between permission and and
 
02:08:14.470 --> 02:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
permit I.E if you get written permission
 
02:08:16.350 --> 02:08:16.360 align:start position:0%
is that considered to be a permit
 
02:08:20.109 --> 02:08:20.119 align:start position:0%
correct um and so legally maybe that's a
 
02:08:22.709 --> 02:08:22.719 align:start position:0%
better question for uh Colonel Jordan
 
02:08:24.189 --> 02:08:24.199 align:start position:0%
but I think that's in our current law
 
02:08:25.709 --> 02:08:25.719 align:start position:0%
currently right now so it might be
 
02:08:27.790 --> 02:08:27.800 align:start position:0%
something we need to fix if it's not uh
 
02:08:29.350 --> 02:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
if fishing game doesn't consider written
 
02:08:32.470 --> 02:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
permission to be a permit um I
 
02:08:33.910 --> 02:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
understand that's that's I think the rub
 
02:08:35.589 --> 02:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
of and that's the way it's written
 
02:08:38.910 --> 02:08:38.920 align:start position:0%
currently uh any other further questions
 
02:08:41.709 --> 02:08:41.719 align:start position:0%
rep Darby thank you Mr chair thanks
 
02:08:43.510 --> 02:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
again for taking my question on a
 
02:08:47.709 --> 02:08:47.719 align:start position:0%
related note um about the timing um uh
 
02:08:48.990 --> 02:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
as was pointed out
 
02:08:53.189 --> 02:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
you know the ex the um the expiration if
 
02:08:55.990 --> 02:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
it's a yearly um agreement is going to
 
02:08:57.910 --> 02:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
be December 31st but is it your
 
02:08:58.549 --> 02:08:58.559 align:start position:0%
understanding that they wouldn't
 
02:09:01.270 --> 02:09:01.280 align:start position:0%
actually have to remove it until um if
 
02:09:03.549 --> 02:09:03.559 align:start position:0%
it expired at the end of the year so
 
02:09:05.790 --> 02:09:05.800 align:start position:0%
current law again this is I I'm that's
 
02:09:08.750 --> 02:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
why I'm trying to clar current law says
 
02:09:10.750 --> 02:09:10.760 align:start position:0%
you can play erect tree stands up until
 
02:09:10.760 --> 02:09:11.669 align:start position:0%
you can play erect tree stands up until
December

02:09:11.669 --> 02:09:11.679 align:start position:0%
December
 
02:09:14.149 --> 02:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
31st but then it says you can leave them
 
02:09:17.109 --> 02:09:17.119 align:start position:0%
until June 1st so the that came about
 
02:09:18.709 --> 02:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
last year because there was concern Le
 
02:09:21.270 --> 02:09:21.280 align:start position:0%
that tree stands buried in 3et of snow
 
02:09:23.270 --> 02:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
on December 31st someone who's not
 
02:09:24.510 --> 02:09:24.520 align:start position:0%
picking on old people cuz I'm going to
 
02:09:27.350 --> 02:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
be old one day or maybe I already am but
 
02:09:29.229 --> 02:09:29.239 align:start position:0%
somebody who's 75 doesn't have to trudge
 
02:09:30.950 --> 02:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
in two miles into the woods to get their
 
02:09:32.549 --> 02:09:32.559 align:start position:0%
stand out they can wait till the thorw
 
02:09:34.390 --> 02:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
and then get the stand out so that's why
 
02:09:37.149 --> 02:09:37.159 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to clarify those dates and
 
02:09:38.669 --> 02:09:38.679 align:start position:0%
again I'm not they still have to be
 
02:09:39.910 --> 02:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
removed you still have a two-month
 
02:09:41.589 --> 02:09:41.599 align:start position:0%
window fishing game can enforce you
 
02:09:42.790 --> 02:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
still need a part you still need
 
02:09:44.069 --> 02:09:44.079 align:start position:0%
permission you still need I'm not
 
02:09:45.589 --> 02:09:45.599 align:start position:0%
changing any of
 
02:09:48.069 --> 02:09:48.079 align:start position:0%
that I'm trying to clarify enforcement
 
02:09:52.430 --> 02:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:56.270 --> 02:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
easier thank you any further questions
 
02:09:58.430 --> 02:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
02:10:00.950 --> 02:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh I got the Amendments oh you can go
 
02:10:02.310 --> 02:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
ahead and address the amendment so I
 
02:10:04.069 --> 02:10:04.079 align:start position:0%
have a quick uh committee amendment by
 
02:10:06.589 --> 02:10:06.599 align:start position:0%
myself and this was asked on behalf of
 
02:10:08.229 --> 02:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
of a constituent uh you should have it
 
02:10:11.510 --> 02:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
in front of you um it goes into section
 
02:10:13.030 --> 02:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
three of the
 
02:10:16.109 --> 02:10:16.119 align:start position:0%
bill it says right now it says a person
 
02:10:17.709 --> 02:10:17.719 align:start position:0%
who places a game camera on the private
 
02:10:20.069 --> 02:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
property of other or on state owned or
 
02:10:22.109 --> 02:10:22.119 align:start position:0%
state managed properly shall label the
 
02:10:24.750 --> 02:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
camera labeling cameras is extremely
 
02:10:26.790 --> 02:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
difficult there's not a smat a flat
 
02:10:29.030 --> 02:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
smooth writable surface so the person
 
02:10:30.350 --> 02:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
asked if I can put a committee amendment
 
02:10:32.629 --> 02:10:32.639 align:start position:0%
in to say label the camera the camera
 
02:10:35.470 --> 02:10:35.480 align:start position:0%
strap right or the placard on a tree
 
02:10:37.109 --> 02:10:37.119 align:start position:0%
with the name and contact information
 
02:10:39.430 --> 02:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
again you're giving some flexibility so
 
02:10:41.229 --> 02:10:41.239 align:start position:0%
the camera can actually be labeled or
 
02:10:43.310 --> 02:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
the site vers someone trying to write in
 
02:10:44.709 --> 02:10:44.719 align:start position:0%
tiny lettering on the side of a little
 
02:10:45.750 --> 02:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
game camera so that's what that
 
02:10:47.549 --> 02:10:47.559 align:start position:0%
amendment's about and rep love is going
 
02:10:48.870 --> 02:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
to have an amendment also he's going to
 
02:10:51.149 --> 02:10:51.159 align:start position:0%
speak to on this bill if it's up to you

audience who might have wanted to talk
 
02:11:05.270 --> 02:11:05.280 align:start position:0%

02:11:06.709 --> 02:11:06.719 align:start position:0%

1932 the law that passed last year was
 
02:11:54.950 --> 02:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
very important to our members it was a
 
02:11:57.629 --> 02:11:57.639 align:start position:0%
priority for us and it was a legislation
 
02:12:01.430 --> 02:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
that we requested along with a few other
 
02:12:03.589 --> 02:12:03.599 align:start position:0%

into effect January 1st and our position
 
02:12:10.830 --> 02:12:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:15.470 --> 02:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
time that that uh law that passed was a
 
02:12:18.189 --> 02:12:18.199 align:start position:0%
a a compromise by a number of groups
 
02:12:21.589 --> 02:12:21.599 align:start position:0%
working together we there are sections
 
02:12:24.030 --> 02:12:24.040 align:start position:0%

had mentioned we do oppose this bill
 
02:13:21.950 --> 02:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
pretty much for the same reasons that
 
02:13:26.270 --> 02:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
that Mr Johnson had had had articulated
 
02:13:28.549 --> 02:13:28.559 align:start position:0%
the current law has been in place it

active for 37 days we haven't had enough
 
02:13:35.390 --> 02:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
time to see it work our concern is as
 
02:13:37.950 --> 02:13:37.960 align:start position:0%
you start monkeying with dates you start
 
02:13:40.149 --> 02:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
monkeying with kind of
 
02:13:42.589 --> 02:13:42.599 align:start position:0%
requirements um it's going to create an
 
02:13:44.950 --> 02:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
air of confusion PE fishing game has
 
02:13:47.470 --> 02:13:47.480 align:start position:0%
already been out trying to educate the
 
02:13:47.480 --> 02:13:48.990 align:start position:0%
already been out trying to educate the
sports

02:13:48.990 --> 02:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
sports
 
02:13:50.510 --> 02:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
um we are trying to educate our our
 
02:13:53.069 --> 02:13:53.079 align:start position:0%
members about what is what is required
 
02:13:55.549 --> 02:13:55.559 align:start position:0%
what isn't and so at this point we're
 
02:13:58.030 --> 02:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
we're just saying let's be let's walk
 
02:14:00.990 --> 02:14:01.000 align:start position:0%
before we run here and let's let the uh
 
02:14:02.629 --> 02:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
let's let the dust settle let's give it
 
02:14:05.350 --> 02:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
at least a hunting one hunting season to
 
02:14:08.069 --> 02:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
see how it works and at that point see
 
02:14:10.069 --> 02:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
if this if some of the issues are really
 
02:14:13.750 --> 02:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
in fact the problems um with respect I
 
02:14:16.750 --> 02:14:16.760 align:start position:0%
did I haven't seen the the amendment um
 
02:14:19.149 --> 02:14:19.159 align:start position:0%
that was discussed earlier here uh we
 
02:14:22.149 --> 02:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
are very Leary of any placard being
 
02:14:25.149 --> 02:14:25.159 align:start position:0%
applied to trees we like to take trees
 
02:14:28.910 --> 02:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
and saw them and so placards sometimes
 
02:14:32.549 --> 02:14:32.559 align:start position:0%
come with nails Staples Sawmills don't
 
02:14:36.910 --> 02:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
like those um so again I uh appreciate
 
02:14:38.990 --> 02:14:39.000 align:start position:0%

I can you can rest assured that we'll
 
02:14:51.910 --> 02:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
make sure if there is a placard it's not
 
02:14:54.669 --> 02:14:54.679 align:start position:0%
attached by any means that's a nail or a
 
02:14:58.310 --> 02:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
staple um I think that it's covered
 
02:15:00.589 --> 02:15:00.599 align:start position:0%
already for Bare baiting sites in some
 
02:15:02.750 --> 02:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
instances where they label a they put an
 
02:15:06.270 --> 02:15:06.280 align:start position:0%
ID on the tree sometimes so uh we'd try
 
02:15:08.229 --> 02:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
to model that just to make you guys
 
02:15:11.750 --> 02:15:11.760 align:start position:0%

Mr chair thanks for taking my question
 
02:15:24.109 --> 02:15:24.119 align:start position:0%
do you have a an idea of when it would
 
02:15:27.910 --> 02:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
make sense for this to become effective
 
02:15:31.189 --> 02:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
other than August 1 if you want to wait
 
02:15:34.390 --> 02:15:34.400 align:start position:0%

chairman and others on setting those
 
02:15:42.629 --> 02:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
dates um and that was a given take I'd
 
02:15:45.790 --> 02:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
say again let's let the dust settle cuz
 
02:15:47.990 --> 02:15:48.000 align:start position:0%

enforcement New Hampshire fishing gain
 
02:16:39.070 --> 02:16:39.080 align:start position:0%
the commission took the position of
 
02:16:40.910 --> 02:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
opposing the passage of this proposed
 
02:16:42.750 --> 02:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
legislation for a number of reasons I
 
02:16:45.190 --> 02:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
don't like to oppose this is a personal
 
02:16:47.110 --> 02:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
thing not the commission's position I
 
02:16:48.709 --> 02:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
don't like to oppose a bill that a
 
02:16:50.230 --> 02:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
member of the fishing game committee
 
02:16:52.070 --> 02:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
brings I have a great deal of respect
 
02:16:54.950 --> 02:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
for representative Smith I think we got
 
02:16:57.110 --> 02:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
into a very heated debate when this bill
 
02:16:59.110 --> 02:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
went through I see his side of it I
 
02:17:02.030 --> 02:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
think he sees mine um so I'm concerned
 
02:17:04.830 --> 02:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
about opposing it I do
 
02:17:07.709 --> 02:17:07.719 align:start position:0%
oppose uh pieces of it and I I hope I
 
02:17:09.469 --> 02:17:09.479 align:start position:0%
can give you valid reasons for that
 
02:17:11.429 --> 02:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
opposition so just a quick history this
 
02:17:13.830 --> 02:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
bill came this in
 
02:17:16.190 --> 02:17:16.200 align:start position:0%
2022 by the Farm Bureau I think
 
02:17:18.790 --> 02:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
initially brought it and the legislature
 
02:17:20.629 --> 02:17:20.639 align:start position:0%
listened to it was having none of it and
 
02:17:22.709 --> 02:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
they defeated it and it was a problem
 
02:17:24.750 --> 02:17:24.760 align:start position:0%
that we were seeing with our land owners
 
02:17:26.669 --> 02:17:26.679 align:start position:0%
I was getting that was our my number one
 
02:17:29.230 --> 02:17:29.240 align:start position:0%
call in the fall about complaints about
 
02:17:31.389 --> 02:17:31.399 align:start position:0%
tree stands being up no one knowing who
 
02:17:33.429 --> 02:17:33.439 align:start position:0%
they were cameras up on my property so
 
02:17:35.870 --> 02:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
we decided that if we I thought if we
 
02:17:37.589 --> 02:17:37.599 align:start position:0%
didn't get together and address this we
 
02:17:39.230 --> 02:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
were going to lose access to public
 
02:17:41.830 --> 02:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
lands and so I reached out we reached
 
02:17:43.150 --> 02:17:43.160 align:start position:0%
out to the farm bureau in the
 
02:17:45.230 --> 02:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
Timberlands The Wildlife Federation
 
02:17:46.910 --> 02:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
which represents all the hunting groups
 
02:17:48.270 --> 02:17:48.280 align:start position:0%
within the state
 
02:17:50.790 --> 02:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
we had much debate and and to say that
 
02:17:52.629 --> 02:17:52.639 align:start position:0%
there were compromise and meetings as an
 
02:17:54.150 --> 02:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
understatement it went on for a very
 
02:17:57.150 --> 02:17:57.160 align:start position:0%
long time and the bills themselves uh
 
02:17:59.669 --> 02:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
certainly were I went to more hearings
 
02:18:01.750 --> 02:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
on these two bills than I've ever
 
02:18:03.270 --> 02:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
attended in the 10 years I've been at
 
02:18:06.629 --> 02:18:06.639 align:start position:0%
the legislature so there was op there
 
02:18:09.629 --> 02:18:09.639 align:start position:0%
was more than ample opportunity and
 
02:18:12.349 --> 02:18:12.359 align:start position:0%
there were many amendments put in at
 
02:18:14.309 --> 02:18:14.319 align:start position:0%
many different stages it went to two
 
02:18:15.750 --> 02:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
different committees here in the house
 
02:18:18.030 --> 02:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
it went to the Senate it went to
 
02:18:20.190 --> 02:18:20.200 align:start position:0%
Committees of conference and so a lot of
 
02:18:22.870 --> 02:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
this stuff was was debated and hashed
 
02:18:24.910 --> 02:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
out and at the end of the day I believe
 
02:18:26.950 --> 02:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
the chairman put in the bill to make it
 
02:18:29.389 --> 02:18:29.399 align:start position:0%
effective January 1 which I was against
 
02:18:31.549 --> 02:18:31.559 align:start position:0%
I wanted it immediate and and it made
 
02:18:33.589 --> 02:18:33.599 align:start position:0%
sense after we discussed it to wait
 
02:18:36.830 --> 02:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
until January 1 of this year am I
 
02:18:40.429 --> 02:18:40.439 align:start position:0%
correct in that you're correct and and
 
02:18:42.349 --> 02:18:42.359 align:start position:0%
we also had to sneak in the turkey stuff
 
02:18:44.389 --> 02:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
at the last minute in the conference
 
02:18:45.709 --> 02:18:45.719 align:start position:0%
because everybody had forgotten about
 
02:18:48.230 --> 02:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
erecting a stand for turkey season right
 
02:18:49.910 --> 02:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
and so what ended up happening is the
 
02:18:51.549 --> 02:18:51.559 align:start position:0%
law that is printed in the book it's
 
02:18:53.790 --> 02:18:53.800 align:start position:0%
printed uh correctly I've reviewed both
 
02:18:53.800 --> 02:18:54.830 align:start position:0%
printed uh correctly I've reviewed both
laws

02:18:54.830 --> 02:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
laws
 
02:18:57.309 --> 02:18:57.319 align:start position:0%
extensively um I would remind the
 
02:18:58.830 --> 02:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
committee to remember this bill has been
 
02:19:00.509 --> 02:19:00.519 align:start position:0%
in effect for about 30 days a little
 
02:19:02.950 --> 02:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
over 30 days we haven't had a season yet
 
02:19:05.150 --> 02:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
um and I worry that we're trying to fix
 
02:19:07.750 --> 02:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
problems that we don't even know exist
 
02:19:12.309 --> 02:19:12.319 align:start position:0%
um at this point so I would I I am in
 
02:19:14.270 --> 02:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
lock step with the Timberlands
 
02:19:17.070 --> 02:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
Association the Sportsman I think and
 
02:19:18.790 --> 02:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
and the certainly the Farm Bureau in
 
02:19:20.549 --> 02:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
letting this go a season and let's see
 
02:19:22.830 --> 02:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
if we do have issues we have spent we
 
02:19:24.270 --> 02:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
being the fishing game department law
 
02:19:26.070 --> 02:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement division has spent an
 
02:19:29.270 --> 02:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
exorbitant amount of hours explaining
 
02:19:31.629 --> 02:19:31.639 align:start position:0%
this both by answering questions uh
 
02:19:33.469 --> 02:19:33.479 align:start position:0%
putting on presentations you're going to
 
02:19:35.509 --> 02:19:35.519 align:start position:0%
see on our website here if it isn't
 
02:19:37.870 --> 02:19:37.880 align:start position:0%
already there it will be this week a
 
02:19:40.150 --> 02:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
complete presentation a uniform I had a
 
02:19:42.030 --> 02:19:42.040 align:start position:0%
uniformed officer do where we discussed
 
02:19:43.589 --> 02:19:43.599 align:start position:0%
labeling the camera what would be
 
02:19:45.629 --> 02:19:45.639 align:start position:0%
acceptable we wanted to keep that as
 
02:19:46.990 --> 02:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
simple as we could by just putting a
 
02:19:49.469 --> 02:19:49.479 align:start position:0%
piece of tape on it with your name uh we
 
02:19:51.469 --> 02:19:51.479 align:start position:0%
demonstrated tree stands that would need
 
02:19:53.429 --> 02:19:53.439 align:start position:0%
permits and would not need permits we
 
02:19:54.990 --> 02:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
discussed what they needed written
 
02:19:56.830 --> 02:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
permission for and what in fact they
 
02:19:59.389 --> 02:19:59.399 align:start position:0%
didn't need written permission for uh
 
02:20:02.270 --> 02:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
and we did that with the mindset that
 
02:20:04.630 --> 02:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
based on my many years experience with
 
02:20:07.309 --> 02:20:07.319 align:start position:0%
land owners they're hesitant to sign
 
02:20:09.469 --> 02:20:09.479 align:start position:0%
anything that allows someone on their
 
02:20:10.830 --> 02:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
property because they're concerned about
 
02:20:12.670 --> 02:20:12.680 align:start position:0%
liability I get that I understand that
 
02:20:14.389 --> 02:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
even though there are laws to and that's
 
02:20:15.590 --> 02:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
a debate for another day there are
 
02:20:18.550 --> 02:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
plenty of laws to protect the land owner
 
02:20:20.670 --> 02:20:20.680 align:start position:0%
the the idea that land owners will say
 
02:20:22.670 --> 02:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
including the one I hunt on yeah I'll
 
02:20:24.070 --> 02:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
give you permission all day long but I'm
 
02:20:26.870 --> 02:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
not signing anything so we we did that
 
02:20:29.469 --> 02:20:29.479 align:start position:0%
on purpose and I have instructed just so
 
02:20:31.230 --> 02:20:31.240 align:start position:0%
we're clear I don't know that I want
 
02:20:32.910 --> 02:20:32.920 align:start position:0%
this on YouTube but I guess I have no
 
02:20:35.270 --> 02:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
option I've instructed my officers you
 
02:20:38.510 --> 02:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
will not you will not go out this year
 
02:20:40.550 --> 02:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
and issue summonses in this just like
 
02:20:42.790 --> 02:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
any other major law change that we have
 
02:20:45.190 --> 02:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
experienced the last one being uh lead
 
02:20:47.429 --> 02:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
for loon and fishing we're going to
 
02:20:49.429 --> 02:20:49.439 align:start position:0%
spend a year at least in educating
 
02:20:51.270 --> 02:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
people to make sure that people
 
02:20:52.910 --> 02:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
understand this because there is a lot
 
02:20:55.070 --> 02:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
of confusion about it and I think it
 
02:20:57.510 --> 02:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
comes from the many different amendments
 
02:20:59.389 --> 02:20:59.399 align:start position:0%
the many public hearings that were held
 
02:21:02.429 --> 02:21:02.439 align:start position:0%
I we we certainly accomplished confusing
 
02:21:05.070 --> 02:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
the general public we did that very well
 
02:21:07.990 --> 02:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
and so I'm working pretty hard to clear
 
02:21:10.950 --> 02:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
that up if we go in now and got this
 
02:21:12.710 --> 02:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
after we've done this and put this on
 
02:21:14.150 --> 02:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
the website we're going to have to
 
02:21:16.270 --> 02:21:16.280 align:start position:0%
retract all of that and start over again
 
02:21:17.950 --> 02:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
and I think we're just going to well I
 
02:21:19.670 --> 02:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
don't think I can promise you from doing
 
02:21:21.590 --> 02:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
it for 30 years we're going to create
 
02:21:23.030 --> 02:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
criminals out of people that would not
 
02:21:24.590 --> 02:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
normally be criminals they're going to
 
02:21:26.510 --> 02:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
be confused they're confused now it's
 
02:21:28.750 --> 02:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
only going to confuse them further I do
 
02:21:33.309 --> 02:21:33.319 align:start position:0%
not have an issue um with an officer not
 
02:21:35.590 --> 02:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
being allowed to put a camera on without
 
02:21:38.670 --> 02:21:38.680 align:start position:0%
landowner permission so the reason we
 
02:21:40.870 --> 02:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
don't do a lot of that uh and I want to
 
02:21:43.230 --> 02:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
respond to your drone I I will tell you
 
02:21:45.309 --> 02:21:45.319 align:start position:0%
from uh we have drones we have a drone
 
02:21:47.190 --> 02:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
team I have a very good drone operator
 
02:21:48.910 --> 02:21:48.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to read about him here soon
 
02:21:50.670 --> 02:21:50.680 align:start position:0%
again uh with some of his
 
02:21:52.389 --> 02:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
accomplishments and we've done extensive
 
02:21:55.790 --> 02:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
research that's kind of correct but but
 
02:21:58.830 --> 02:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
to be more on point you cannot fly a
 
02:22:02.150 --> 02:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
drone or place a camera in a land
 
02:22:05.030 --> 02:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
owner's curtilage without a warrant or
 
02:22:06.750 --> 02:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
without that land owner's permission you
 
02:22:09.429 --> 02:22:09.439 align:start position:0%
can fly a drone or place a camera
 
02:22:12.750 --> 02:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
currently or go on land in Open Fields
 
02:22:15.910 --> 02:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
without any um restrictions for that any
 
02:22:17.630 --> 02:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
law enforcement can not just fishing
 
02:22:19.190 --> 02:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
game and we've had this debate many
 
02:22:22.230 --> 02:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
times in this committee so the curtilage
 
02:22:23.630 --> 02:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
and and so the next question everybody
 
02:22:25.590 --> 02:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
says well what's curtilage curage a rule
 
02:22:27.950 --> 02:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
of thumb for curtilage would be any
 
02:22:30.309 --> 02:22:30.319 align:start position:0%
place that is in control of the home so
 
02:22:33.950 --> 02:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
what I tell my officers the mod lawn the
 
02:22:36.429 --> 02:22:36.439 align:start position:0%
the uh uh lawn that's cared for the
 
02:22:39.110 --> 02:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
Garden area the driveways the buildings
 
02:22:41.389 --> 02:22:41.399 align:start position:0%
though that is curtilage the Back Field
 
02:22:43.230 --> 02:22:43.240 align:start position:0%
is not that's not considered curtilage
 
02:22:44.790 --> 02:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
this has been challenged and one many
 
02:22:46.510 --> 02:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
many times there's many case laws on
 
02:22:47.710 --> 02:22:47.720 align:start position:0%
that so he kind kind of told you the
 
02:22:49.790 --> 02:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
right thing but I think he if you if you
 
02:22:51.349 --> 02:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
went back to him he would explain to you
 
02:22:52.750 --> 02:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
that that's the curtilage part he can
 
02:22:55.429 --> 02:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
fly over their property currently that
 
02:22:57.469 --> 02:22:57.479 align:start position:0%
may change but right now you can but you
 
02:22:59.870 --> 02:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
can't fly in the curtilage and and
 
02:23:01.510 --> 02:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully that'll never change cuz I
 
02:23:05.389 --> 02:23:05.399 align:start position:0%
live in America too we use game cameras
 
02:23:07.469 --> 02:23:07.479 align:start position:0%
because I don't have staff enough
 
02:23:09.110 --> 02:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes to investigate all the
 
02:23:11.110 --> 02:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
reported crimes that we have so the
 
02:23:13.429 --> 02:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
cameras became a real asset to us when a
 
02:23:15.550 --> 02:23:15.560 align:start position:0%
land owner said look I got bait on my
 
02:23:17.469 --> 02:23:17.479 align:start position:0%
property or I've got a I've got litter
 
02:23:20.190 --> 02:23:20.200 align:start position:0%
on my property or we see that we find
 
02:23:22.750 --> 02:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
that without the land owner's knowledge
 
02:23:24.750 --> 02:23:24.760 align:start position:0%
we don't know yet if it's the landowner
 
02:23:27.150 --> 02:23:27.160 align:start position:0%
or the guy down the road and so we've
 
02:23:29.030 --> 02:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
put the camera up to Aid Us in that
 
02:23:31.630 --> 02:23:31.640 align:start position:0%
surveillance the only thing we lose by
 
02:23:33.670 --> 02:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
this change in your bill would be those
 
02:23:35.510 --> 02:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
cases just won't be made which is
 
02:23:38.030 --> 02:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunate but we we were there 10
 
02:23:40.469 --> 02:23:40.479 align:start position:0%
years ago we can go back there um
 
02:23:41.870 --> 02:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
personally I think it's a mistake I
 
02:23:43.230 --> 02:23:43.240 align:start position:0%
think we've come along ways and we've
 
02:23:44.830 --> 02:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
made cases with these cameras that we
 
02:23:46.670 --> 02:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
never would be able to make I don't have
 
02:23:48.110 --> 02:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
a problem going to a landowner unless
 
02:23:49.950 --> 02:23:49.960 align:start position:0%
the landowner is the suspect then I do
 
02:23:51.830 --> 02:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
have a problem and the way I would get
 
02:23:54.670 --> 02:23:54.680 align:start position:0%
probable cause for the warrant would be
 
02:23:56.950 --> 02:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
through the surveillance so I've either
 
02:23:58.429 --> 02:23:58.439 align:start position:0%
if I can't put the camera there that
 
02:23:59.790 --> 02:23:59.800 align:start position:0%
means I've got to I've got to put an
 
02:24:01.630 --> 02:24:01.640 align:start position:0%
officer there and that puts some severe
 
02:24:03.590 --> 02:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
limitations on our ability to make those
 
02:24:05.550 --> 02:24:05.560 align:start position:0%
so that's I don't have an issue with
 
02:24:07.070 --> 02:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
that I don't think any of my field staff
 
02:24:09.750 --> 02:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
does I don't think that requirement is
 
02:24:12.790 --> 02:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
is um that heavy the rest of it though
 
02:24:15.030 --> 02:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
is going to confuse people and I and I'm
 
02:24:17.070 --> 02:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
not convinced that it's necessary I
 
02:24:19.550 --> 02:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
think we've done a good job with this um
 
02:24:21.269 --> 02:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
I would encourage as we've said in all
 
02:24:23.510 --> 02:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
of our public speaking uh announcements
 
02:24:26.070 --> 02:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
on this remember the landowner can
 
02:24:29.150 --> 02:24:29.160 align:start position:0%
exempt all of this the dates go out the
 
02:24:31.269 --> 02:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
window the permission goes out the W if
 
02:24:33.150 --> 02:24:33.160 align:start position:0%
the land if you go to a landowner and he
 
02:24:34.990 --> 02:24:35.000 align:start position:0%
says I don't care if you put cameras out
 
02:24:36.190 --> 02:24:36.200 align:start position:0%
and I don't care if you put tree stands
 
02:24:38.150 --> 02:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
out then all of this is out the window
 
02:24:40.110 --> 02:24:40.120 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement at all we gave
 
02:24:41.670 --> 02:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
the landowner the
 
02:24:43.710 --> 02:24:43.720 align:start position:0%
authority probably thinking the way
 
02:24:46.269 --> 02:24:46.279 align:start position:0%
you're thinking Mr Smith that it's their
 
02:24:47.790 --> 02:24:47.800 align:start position:0%
right to decide decide whether someone
 
02:24:49.309 --> 02:24:49.319 align:start position:0%
should be on that property or not that's
 
02:24:51.309 --> 02:24:51.319 align:start position:0%
the way we wrote this and then finally
 
02:24:53.070 --> 02:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
the most concerning part of your change
 
02:24:54.389 --> 02:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
and you and I have discussed it at
 
02:24:56.790 --> 02:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
length the most concerning part of our
 
02:24:58.750 --> 02:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
change my you the change in this is
 
02:25:00.830 --> 02:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
giving land owners permission to seize
 
02:25:00.840 --> 02:25:01.630 align:start position:0%
giving land owners permission to seize
this

02:25:01.630 --> 02:25:01.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:25:04.030 --> 02:25:04.040 align:start position:0%
equipment as a land owner I I would
 
02:25:05.230 --> 02:25:05.240 align:start position:0%
agree with you I think I have every
 
02:25:07.190 --> 02:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
right to seize that it's my property and
 
02:25:08.950 --> 02:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
I get that the things you need to
 
02:25:11.750 --> 02:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
understand is as as a person who's
 
02:25:13.750 --> 02:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
refereed many of these that never goes
 
02:25:16.349 --> 02:25:16.359 align:start position:0%
well because people don't recognize that
 
02:25:18.510 --> 02:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
the landown has the authority to to take
 
02:25:20.349 --> 02:25:20.359 align:start position:0%
their private property so they're angry
 
02:25:22.269 --> 02:25:22.279 align:start position:0%
when they go to retrieve it number one
 
02:25:24.309 --> 02:25:24.319 align:start position:0%
number two and so you end up getting
 
02:25:26.070 --> 02:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
called very late in the game and you
 
02:25:27.590 --> 02:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
become a Referee between an angry
 
02:25:30.070 --> 02:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
landowner and an angry cameraman what
 
02:25:33.030 --> 02:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
I've seen many times is then the owner
 
02:25:35.790 --> 02:25:35.800 align:start position:0%
of that personal property will come up
 
02:25:37.670 --> 02:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
with and and I don't I don't want to say
 
02:25:39.830 --> 02:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
their stories an owner will come up with
 
02:25:41.910 --> 02:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
with the idea that my camera has now
 
02:25:44.550 --> 02:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
been damaged the landowner damaged my
 
02:25:46.590 --> 02:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
camera and now the owner is civy on the
 
02:25:49.510 --> 02:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
hook as ridiculous as that sounds he's
 
02:25:51.150 --> 02:25:51.160 align:start position:0%
on the hook or they're on the hook for
 
02:25:53.150 --> 02:25:53.160 align:start position:0%
the damage to that property having a law
 
02:25:55.110 --> 02:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer do that exempts that
 
02:25:57.830 --> 02:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
or would clear that uh the final thing
 
02:25:59.790 --> 02:25:59.800 align:start position:0%
and the most important thing to me if
 
02:26:02.870 --> 02:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
I'm making a case or want to make a case
 
02:26:05.269 --> 02:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
and a land owner hands me the evidence
 
02:26:07.429 --> 02:26:07.439 align:start position:0%
that evidence is now rendered useless to
 
02:26:09.790 --> 02:26:09.800 align:start position:0%
me in a courtroom because I don't have
 
02:26:12.510 --> 02:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
the chain of custody I can't testify
 
02:26:14.710 --> 02:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
where that so I bring that camera in and
 
02:26:17.230 --> 02:26:17.240 align:start position:0%
I say uh U representative sh put a
 
02:26:19.510 --> 02:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
camera on representative Smith's land
 
02:26:21.150 --> 02:26:21.160 align:start position:0%
and it was illegal a good defense
 
02:26:23.469 --> 02:26:23.479 align:start position:0%
attorney would say where'd he put it and
 
02:26:25.630 --> 02:26:25.640 align:start position:0%
I'd have to put representive Smith on
 
02:26:27.230 --> 02:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
understand to tell me where that was
 
02:26:30.429 --> 02:26:30.439 align:start position:0%
where that was done so you get into a
 
02:26:33.070 --> 02:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
whole custody issue on who control that
 
02:26:35.710 --> 02:26:35.720 align:start position:0%
evidence who tampered with it you lose
 
02:26:37.469 --> 02:26:37.479 align:start position:0%
the Integrity of the evidence that's why
 
02:26:38.750 --> 02:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
when you go to a crime scene there's
 
02:26:40.309 --> 02:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
tape up and there's people not allowed
 
02:26:41.630 --> 02:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
in there that's the whole reason for
 
02:26:43.269 --> 02:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
that if you allow a landowner to seize
 
02:26:46.110 --> 02:26:46.120 align:start position:0%
that that's gone um most importantly
 
02:26:47.990 --> 02:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
though you create a situation where
 
02:26:50.150 --> 02:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
you're authorizing a land owner to steal
 
02:26:51.990 --> 02:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
private property and it's just a really
 
02:26:54.790 --> 02:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
slippery slope uh and as far as the
 
02:26:56.429 --> 02:26:56.439 align:start position:0%
question is when does that become my
 
02:26:58.790 --> 02:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
property that's a very good question and
 
02:27:01.750 --> 02:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
no one in the courts in my opinion have
 
02:27:03.830 --> 02:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
ever really answered that and so they're
 
02:27:05.990 --> 02:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
very careful about that type of thing
 
02:27:07.910 --> 02:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
because you're allowing someone to seize
 
02:27:09.469 --> 02:27:09.479 align:start position:0%
someone else's property I have to go get
 
02:27:11.190 --> 02:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
a court order for that and I would say
 
02:27:13.030 --> 02:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
that a private land owner would be
 
02:27:15.110 --> 02:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
forced to do the same I don't think it's
 
02:27:16.230 --> 02:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
something that they would want to be
 
02:27:17.269 --> 02:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
involved in
 
02:27:18.990 --> 02:27:19.000 align:start position:0%
and then the other thing that I will
 
02:27:20.630 --> 02:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
tell you is when a land owner seizes
 
02:27:22.550 --> 02:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
that equipment don't expect the guy to
 
02:27:24.790 --> 02:27:24.800 align:start position:0%
come running to you to get it back you
 
02:27:26.550 --> 02:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
are probably never going to see him
 
02:27:29.030 --> 02:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
again because he realizes it was illegal
 
02:27:30.429 --> 02:27:30.439 align:start position:0%
it's now gone he's not going to go
 
02:27:31.910 --> 02:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
looking for it because then he admits
 
02:27:33.590 --> 02:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
guilt so you're going to end up with a
 
02:27:35.110 --> 02:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
stand that you don't really know what to
 
02:27:38.510 --> 02:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
do with so all reasons why we asked that
 
02:27:40.990 --> 02:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
you go to law enforcement uh to do that
 
02:27:43.110 --> 02:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
because it's a law enforcement action
 
02:27:44.590 --> 02:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's all I have in a nutshell I
 
02:27:48.030 --> 02:27:48.040 align:start position:0%
hope you forgive me Mr Smith I I I don't
 
02:27:49.230 --> 02:27:49.240 align:start position:0%
disagree with a lot of what you're
 
02:27:50.870 --> 02:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
saying I'm just looking at it from a law
 
02:27:52.750 --> 02:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement perspective as opposed to a
 
02:27:55.190 --> 02:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
land owner is very different thank you
 
02:27:57.670 --> 02:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
so much for your clarifying testimony
 
02:27:59.670 --> 02:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for the colonel
 
02:28:01.389 --> 02:28:01.399 align:start position:0%
this makes for some great reading by the
 
02:28:04.150 --> 02:28:04.160 align:start position:0%
way if you have a boring night have 20
 
02:28:07.790 --> 02:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
copies of that yeah representative Darby
 
02:28:09.710 --> 02:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Colonel for
 
02:28:12.429 --> 02:28:12.439 align:start position:0%
taking my question yes sir um I'm I'm
 
02:28:16.030 --> 02:28:16.040 align:start position:0%
curious about the portion of it's that
 
02:28:20.750 --> 02:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
section four on um obtaining uh well the
 
02:28:22.870 --> 02:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
change is excluding game cameras from
 
02:28:24.429 --> 02:28:24.439 align:start position:0%
private land unless written permission
 
02:28:27.230 --> 02:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
is granted and in particular not the the
 
02:28:29.630 --> 02:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
law enforcement piece um which has been
 
02:28:31.670 --> 02:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
the focus of the testimony so far yes
 
02:28:33.790 --> 02:28:33.800 align:start position:0%
but instead the the second section other
 
02:28:36.429 --> 02:28:36.439 align:start position:0%
persons holding a scientific permit from
 
02:28:38.429 --> 02:28:38.439 align:start position:0%
the executive director yes can you
 
02:28:41.990 --> 02:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
describe um whe when those cases might
 
02:28:43.630 --> 02:28:43.640 align:start position:0%
uh when that permission might be granted
 
02:28:46.230 --> 02:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
by the executive director um and what
 
02:28:48.750 --> 02:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
what the used for so it would be our our
 
02:28:51.710 --> 02:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
biological staff tracking animals uh
 
02:28:54.309 --> 02:28:54.319 align:start position:0%
tracking uh or or trying to determine
 
02:28:56.150 --> 02:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
what species are on certain properties
 
02:28:58.349 --> 02:28:58.359 align:start position:0%
there are a number of times and reasons
 
02:28:59.910 --> 02:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
various reasons why you wouldn't want to
 
02:29:01.590 --> 02:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
announce that publicly or want that to
 
02:29:03.269 --> 02:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
leak out that you would doing a study
 
02:29:04.550 --> 02:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
about the number of bears in a
 
02:29:06.550 --> 02:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
neighborhood or you know until you're
 
02:29:07.830 --> 02:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
sure of the information let's go
 
02:29:10.030 --> 02:29:10.040 align:start position:0%
straight to rattlesnakes or rattlesnakes
 
02:29:11.910 --> 02:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
is even a that's even a better point so
 
02:29:13.750 --> 02:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
we do have rattlesnakes there's a Hu
 
02:29:15.710 --> 02:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
that's thank you very much there's
 
02:29:17.670 --> 02:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
there's a black market for that sort of
 
02:29:19.750 --> 02:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
thing so that is something we do have
 
02:29:21.230 --> 02:29:21.240 align:start position:0%
rattles stakes in New Hampshire by the
 
02:29:23.710 --> 02:29:23.720 align:start position:0%
way uh at very Secret locations and we
 
02:29:25.550 --> 02:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
work very hard to keep those locations
 
02:29:28.269 --> 02:29:28.279 align:start position:0%
secret we use cameras or the wildlife
 
02:29:30.510 --> 02:29:30.520 align:start position:0%
division uses cameras to track those
 
02:29:33.190 --> 02:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
non-game and so in that instance that
 
02:29:35.150 --> 02:29:35.160 align:start position:0%
would significantly interfere with that
 
02:29:37.030 --> 02:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
and could cost us that species if it
 
02:29:38.750 --> 02:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
were to leak out that we have it and I'm
 
02:29:40.269 --> 02:29:40.279 align:start position:0%
going to tell you from another piece of
 
02:29:41.429 --> 02:29:41.439 align:start position:0%
experience I know there's other people
 
02:29:42.750 --> 02:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
in this room that will understand
 
02:29:45.110 --> 02:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
exactly what I'm talking about all you
 
02:29:46.630 --> 02:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
and I tell young officers if you you
 
02:29:48.790 --> 02:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
want to if you want to let out a secret
 
02:29:50.110 --> 02:29:50.120 align:start position:0%
tell one
 
02:29:52.469 --> 02:29:52.479 align:start position:0%
person because everybody if you think
 
02:29:54.150 --> 02:29:54.160 align:start position:0%
about it everybody has someone else that
 
02:29:56.670 --> 02:29:56.680 align:start position:0%
they're close and will tell and that
 
02:29:58.950 --> 02:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
keeps going and before you know it it's
 
02:30:01.710 --> 02:30:01.720 align:start position:0%
out and that happens routinely we use it
 
02:30:03.750 --> 02:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
in law enforcement as a tool a lot of
 
02:30:05.469 --> 02:30:05.479 align:start position:0%
times but when you're really trying to
 
02:30:07.670 --> 02:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
keep something quiet in an investigation
 
02:30:09.349 --> 02:30:09.359 align:start position:0%
it is your worst
 
02:30:12.309 --> 02:30:12.319 align:start position:0%
enemy thank you any further questions
 
02:30:14.630 --> 02:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question seeing none
 
02:30:16.190 --> 02:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Colonel Jordan and we have a
 
02:30:20.830 --> 02:30:20.840 align:start position:0%

02:30:30.309 --> 02:30:30.319 align:start position:0%
talk about your Amendment I'd like you
 
02:30:32.190 --> 02:30:32.200 align:start position:0%
to tell us what the amendment does but
 
02:30:34.269 --> 02:30:34.279 align:start position:0%
without reading the amendment because we
 
02:30:36.870 --> 02:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
want to be quick and we don't know if
 
02:30:41.429 --> 02:30:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:43.550 --> 02:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
yet thank you Mr chair thank you
 
02:30:45.349 --> 02:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
committee members uh nice to be back
 
02:30:47.030 --> 02:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
here tonight at this this afternoon
 
02:30:50.510 --> 02:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
rather um this uh this amendment uh
 
02:30:52.349 --> 02:30:52.359 align:start position:0%
pretty much uh
 
02:30:55.750 --> 02:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
it it it tells us who who can't post
 
02:30:59.190 --> 02:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
land uh our current laws say who can uh
 
02:31:01.030 --> 02:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
but nothing who can't there's no no
 
02:31:03.790 --> 02:31:03.800 align:start position:0%
penalties um this one uh says that
 
02:31:06.349 --> 02:31:06.359 align:start position:0%
anybody who does not have uh legal
 
02:31:08.070 --> 02:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
interest in the in the property cannot
 
02:31:10.950 --> 02:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
post and there there are fines for it uh
 
02:31:13.070 --> 02:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
the reason for this is uh my brother
 
02:31:15.710 --> 02:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
went hunting in in Derry uh went into
 
02:31:17.070 --> 02:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
went into the woods
 
02:31:18.590 --> 02:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
and he got a call an hour and a half
 
02:31:20.910 --> 02:31:20.920 align:start position:0%
later from the dairy police he came out
 
02:31:23.750 --> 02:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
and there was a a poster you know 15 20
 
02:31:25.190 --> 02:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
ft from the back of his truck and one in
 
02:31:28.269 --> 02:31:28.279 align:start position:0%
the front and they were brand new and it
 
02:31:29.870 --> 02:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
had rained the last four days so we
 
02:31:31.870 --> 02:31:31.880 align:start position:0%
asked the asked the cop you know what
 
02:31:33.830 --> 02:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
what happens to a drywall screw when it
 
02:31:35.590 --> 02:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
rains out when they get wet he says they
 
02:31:37.950 --> 02:31:37.960 align:start position:0%
rust they rust a lot and he says if you
 
02:31:39.269 --> 02:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
notice there isn't any rust on those
 
02:31:42.230 --> 02:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
drywall screws so the cop more or less
 
02:31:44.309 --> 02:31:44.319 align:start position:0%
said you know they would just put up the
 
02:31:46.150 --> 02:31:46.160 align:start position:0%
next day he goes back and puts a sign in
 
02:31:48.269 --> 02:31:48.279 align:start position:0%
the in the window of his truck and said
 
02:31:49.830 --> 02:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
I have permission to hunt this property
 
02:31:51.429 --> 02:31:51.439 align:start position:0%
he a land owner's name his his phone
 
02:31:53.670 --> 02:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
number another Dairy cop shows up and
 
02:31:55.550 --> 02:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
he's going to run him for Criminal
 
02:31:58.590 --> 02:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
Trespass okay uh you know that with
 
02:32:00.429 --> 02:32:00.439 align:start position:0%
without without taking a making a call
 
02:32:02.790 --> 02:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
or anything uh the problem being my
 
02:32:05.309 --> 02:32:05.319 align:start position:0%
brother's a 38- year old a 38-year
 
02:32:07.790 --> 02:32:07.800 align:start position:0%
federal employee uh he's got about three
 
02:32:09.830 --> 02:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
months to go before he can retire if he
 
02:32:11.550 --> 02:32:11.560 align:start position:0%
got arrested for a misdemeanor which it
 
02:32:13.750 --> 02:32:13.760 align:start position:0%

02:32:15.670 --> 02:32:15.680 align:start position:0%

02:32:21.510 --> 02:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
his pension is is is put in Jeopardy
 
02:32:22.990 --> 02:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
okay let's not get too deep into it
 
02:32:24.110 --> 02:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
because we still don't know if it's
 
02:32:26.870 --> 02:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
gerain to this Bill yes um you know that
 
02:32:28.870 --> 02:32:28.880 align:start position:0%

Germain thank you so much and I'd
 
02:32:38.070 --> 02:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
suggest your brother give his card to
 
02:32:39.389 --> 02:32:39.399 align:start position:0%
Colonel Jordan because Colonel Jordan
 
02:32:40.830 --> 02:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
would defend him about that one as long
 
02:32:42.269 --> 02:32:42.279 align:start position:0%
as he's got the landowner's permission
 
02:32:44.309 --> 02:32:44.319 align:start position:0%
there's no criminal trespass he he did
 
02:32:45.670 --> 02:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
say that in the dairy cop said oh you're
 
02:32:48.510 --> 02:32:48.520 align:start position:0%
going to call the Colonel you
 
02:32:52.230 --> 02:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
know I would have said absolutely I am
 
02:32:54.190 --> 02:32:54.200 align:start position:0%
any questions okay any questions for
 
02:32:55.590 --> 02:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
representative love about the amendment
 
02:32:58.230 --> 02:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
that he's going to present to US during
 
02:32:59.630 --> 02:32:59.640 align:start position:0%
or that we get to look at in ex exec
 
02:33:02.230 --> 02:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
session none uh yes is the point of
 
02:33:04.590 --> 02:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
order what what is the uh determination
 
02:33:06.309 --> 02:33:06.319 align:start position:0%
on germanness here who's going to make
 
02:33:08.510 --> 02:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
that uh I can ask the clerk to make that
 
02:33:10.550 --> 02:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
decision we can look at it ourselves and
 
02:33:13.710 --> 02:33:13.720 align:start position:0%
determine uh if we are in doubt I would
 
02:33:17.389 --> 02:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
go ahead and submit that question to the
 
02:33:20.710 --> 02:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
the clerk or to the uh speaker's office
 
02:33:22.670 --> 02:33:22.680 align:start position:0%
uh typically that's the way it's done uh
 
02:33:24.110 --> 02:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
the chair and the members of the
 
02:33:25.790 --> 02:33:25.800 align:start position:0%

02:33:30.469 --> 02:33:30.479 align:start position:0%
whether we take it up in the committee
 
02:33:33.830 --> 02:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
is mine but if I make a dumb mistake uh
 
02:33:35.510 --> 02:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be held to task so I would
 
02:33:38.910 --> 02:33:38.920 align:start position:0%

for that coyote Bill uh and the and the
 
02:34:32.349 --> 02:34:32.359 align:start position:0%
time that the director has we may need
 
02:34:34.790 --> 02:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
to recess the bill to allow the the
 
02:34:36.389 --> 02:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
department to give us our presentation
 
02:34:38.710 --> 02:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
on the mitigation for the uh fish

representative shirtliff can test to
 
02:34:49.230 --> 02:34:49.240 align:start position:0%
that um it's it's been a long-standing
 
02:34:50.910 --> 02:34:50.920 align:start position:0%
thing we've been battling and we've got
 
02:34:52.590 --> 02:34:52.600 align:start position:0%
some finally some Headway and and they
 
02:34:54.790 --> 02:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to present to the committee so uh
 
02:34:57.110 --> 02:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
we'll see how we can handle that and
 
02:35:00.190 --> 02:35:00.200 align:start position:0%
take uh care of the the director's time
 
02:35:02.790 --> 02:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
and his staff as well uh is that okay
 
02:35:02.800 --> 02:35:03.510 align:start position:0%
and his staff as well uh is that okay
with

02:35:03.510 --> 02:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:35:07.349 --> 02:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
you is that for us I believe it is it
 
02:35:08.710 --> 02:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
was I asked for something to be brought
 
02:35:09.670 --> 02:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
into the room they said they would
 
02:35:11.830 --> 02:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
accommodate us so that should be for you
 
02:35:11.840 --> 02:35:12.950 align:start position:0%
accommodate us so that should be for you
to

02:35:12.950 --> 02:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:35:15.349 --> 02:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
use and with that let's go have some
 
02:35:20.389 --> 02:35:20.399 align:start position:0%
lunch and everybody be back here by 1
 
02:35:25.070 --> 02:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
120 1:30 at the latest and quick uh
 
02:35:29.830 --> 02:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
quick update uh Dems fourth floor 403 at
 
02:35:32.670 --> 02:35:32.680 align:start position:0%
115 for a brief
 
02:35:36.030 --> 02:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
caucus can you let Ellen
 
02:35:38.550 --> 02:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
know oh you're caucusing before we even
 
02:35:41.030 --> 02:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
go into the coyote
 
02:35:42.870 --> 02:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
bill I don't know we're not going to
 
02:35:46.110 --> 02:35:46.120 align:start position:0%
have a long time so I you know what is
 
02:35:48.309 --> 02:35:48.319 align:start position:0%
going to do what you guys want I know we
 
02:35:49.990 --> 02:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
know where we're going I know where it's
 
02:36:14.910 --> 02:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:14.920 --> 03:54:59.110 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:54:59.110 --> 03:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:01.429 --> 03:55:01.439 align:start position:0%
we'll be starting momentarily uh the
 
03:55:03.229 --> 03:55:03.239 align:start position:0%
clerk is going to get his timer because
 
03:55:05.070 --> 03:55:05.080 align:start position:0%
I have enough cards here that I'm going
 
03:55:08.550 --> 03:55:08.560 align:start position:0%
to be limiting uh testimony for everyone
 
03:55:10.670 --> 03:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
on both sides of the argument it's going
 
03:55:12.870 --> 03:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
to be fair it's going to be limited to 3
 
03:55:16.030 --> 03:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
minutes so we will give you a uh a 3
 
03:55:18.269 --> 03:55:18.279 align:start position:0%
minute speaking window please work
 
03:55:22.149 --> 03:55:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:24.309 --> 03:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
minutes and as soon as the clerk comes
 
03:55:37.790 --> 03:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:37.800 --> 03:56:21.349 align:start position:0%
 
start

03:56:21.349 --> 03:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:23.309 --> 03:56:23.319 align:start position:0%
and just so anybody doesn't wonder the
 
03:56:24.950 --> 03:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh the prime sponsor of the bill usually
 
03:56:27.030 --> 03:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
gets the more than the 3 minutes because
 
03:56:28.349 --> 03:56:28.359 align:start position:0%
they are the prime sponsor and have to
 
03:56:35.309 --> 03:56:35.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:39.429 --> 03:56:39.439 align:start position:0%
us all right I believe we are ready uh
 
03:56:41.469 --> 03:56:41.479 align:start position:0%
if somebody wants to close the door so
 
03:56:42.990 --> 03:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
we don't disturb people in the hallway
 
03:56:45.149 --> 03:56:45.159 align:start position:0%
that would be fantastic I'm going to
 
03:56:47.030 --> 03:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
open the hearing on
 
03:56:49.590 --> 03:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
hb100 and I'm going to recognize
 
03:56:51.670 --> 03:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
representative Reed the prime sponsor
 
03:56:53.110 --> 03:56:53.120 align:start position:0%
from Rockingham
 
03:56:55.790 --> 03:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
10 thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:56:57.630 --> 03:56:57.640 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh my name is
 
03:56:59.429 --> 03:56:59.439 align:start position:0%
Ellen Reed I represent Rockingham ton
 
03:57:02.189 --> 03:57:02.199 align:start position:0%
New Market and new Fields um before you
 
03:57:05.189 --> 03:57:05.199 align:start position:0%
is a bill hb100 that would close the
 
03:57:07.870 --> 03:57:07.880 align:start position:0%
coyote hunting season during their pup
 
03:57:07.880 --> 03:57:09.309 align:start position:0%
coyote hunting season during their pup
rearing

03:57:09.309 --> 03:57:09.319 align:start position:0%
rearing
 
03:57:10.990 --> 03:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
so the first attempt at this bill
 
03:57:14.110 --> 03:57:14.120 align:start position:0%
happened in 2019 after the uh
 
03:57:16.389 --> 03:57:16.399 align:start position:0%
Department's wildlife biologist had
 
03:57:20.070 --> 03:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
suggested that we do exactly this and um
 
03:57:23.750 --> 03:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
the commission chose to not um abide by
 
03:57:26.229 --> 03:57:26.239 align:start position:0%
the the scientists recommendations the
 
03:57:28.710 --> 03:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
reason that this was recommended then
 
03:57:30.830 --> 03:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
and has been petitioned for repeatedly
 
03:57:34.030 --> 03:57:34.040 align:start position:0%
every single year since is because
 
03:57:36.110 --> 03:57:36.120 align:start position:0%
coyote are the only species that we do
 
03:57:38.149 --> 03:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
not close their hunting season while
 
03:57:42.110 --> 03:57:42.120 align:start position:0%
they are raising their young um we do
 
03:57:44.309 --> 03:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
that with every other Fox every other
 
03:57:46.030 --> 03:57:46.040 align:start position:0%
canid species including the fox and
 
03:57:48.670 --> 03:57:48.680 align:start position:0%
every other fur bearing species the
 
03:57:51.710 --> 03:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
reason aside from the cruelty of
 
03:57:54.510 --> 03:57:54.520 align:start position:0%
depriving uh the young who cannot f for
 
03:57:56.229 --> 03:57:56.239 align:start position:0%
themselves depriving them of their food
 
03:57:58.110 --> 03:57:58.120 align:start position:0%
source and their parents and how cruel
 
03:58:00.389 --> 03:58:00.399 align:start position:0%
it is to cause them to die in the den of
 
03:58:03.030 --> 03:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
starvation the specific reason why it's
 
03:58:05.950 --> 03:58:05.960 align:start position:0%
important to close um the hunting season
 
03:58:07.750 --> 03:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
on coyote when they are raising their
 
03:58:10.590 --> 03:58:10.600 align:start position:0%
young is because coyote in particular
 
03:58:12.630 --> 03:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
engage in something called responsive
 
03:58:15.469 --> 03:58:15.479 align:start position:0%
reproduction that is by two mechanisms
 
03:58:18.070 --> 03:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
the first is that typically only one
 
03:58:20.710 --> 03:58:20.720 align:start position:0%
female in a pack um reproduces or goes
 
03:58:22.910 --> 03:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
into heat if that female is killed then
 
03:58:25.110 --> 03:58:25.120 align:start position:0%
all of the females will go into heat
 
03:58:27.510 --> 03:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
secondly they produce um if a pack
 
03:58:28.870 --> 03:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
member is killed they will produce
 
03:58:30.309 --> 03:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
stress hormones that will increase their
 
03:58:32.550 --> 03:58:32.560 align:start position:0%
litter numbers so if you are killing
 
03:58:33.950 --> 03:58:33.960 align:start position:0%
coyote while they're supposed to be
 
03:58:35.670 --> 03:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
raising their young you're actually in
 
03:58:38.349 --> 03:58:38.359 align:start position:0%
the short term increasing coyote numbers
 
03:58:40.750 --> 03:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
in in addition to that because now these
 
03:58:43.229 --> 03:58:43.239 align:start position:0%
pups that have not the ones that haven't
 
03:58:46.550 --> 03:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
died of starvation are deprived of their
 
03:58:48.189 --> 03:58:48.199 align:start position:0%
parent while they're supposed to be
 
03:58:50.630 --> 03:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
learning proper food sourcing so those
 
03:58:53.309 --> 03:58:53.319 align:start position:0%
pups end up becoming the nuisance coyote
 
03:58:57.710 --> 03:58:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:01.110 --> 03:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
humans now the reason as I understand it
 
03:59:02.590 --> 03:59:02.600 align:start position:0%
repeatedly that the commission has been
 
03:59:04.830 --> 03:59:04.840 align:start position:0%
opposed to this seems to be not much
 
03:59:07.750 --> 03:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
more than stigma the last time this um
 
03:59:10.550 --> 03:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
bill came board there was there were
 
03:59:13.110 --> 03:59:13.120 align:start position:0%
comments from Commissioners in hearing
 
03:59:14.950 --> 03:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
to the effect of have you ever seen a
 
03:59:18.550 --> 03:59:18.560 align:start position:0%
coyote kill it's so bloody um there were
 
03:59:20.429 --> 03:59:20.439 align:start position:0%
other there have been other comments
 
03:59:23.070 --> 03:59:23.080 align:start position:0%
about coyotes lacking moral compass
 
03:59:25.389 --> 03:59:25.399 align:start position:0%
there's a real stigma like we've had
 
03:59:27.590 --> 03:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
with across the country with things like
 
03:59:30.149 --> 03:59:30.159 align:start position:0%
sharks and bats and other animals that
 
03:59:33.309 --> 03:59:33.319 align:start position:0%
we kind of detest but the science is
 
03:59:35.110 --> 03:59:35.120 align:start position:0%
behind like we do with all the other
 
03:59:37.429 --> 03:59:37.439 align:start position:0%
forbearing species closing the hunting
 
03:59:39.630 --> 03:59:39.640 align:start position:0%
season and to be clear that's hunting
 
03:59:43.389 --> 03:59:43.399 align:start position:0%
that's going out to kill with a gun not
 
03:59:46.990 --> 03:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
trapping not Defending Your Wildlife or
 
03:59:47.000 --> 03:59:48.510 align:start position:0%
trapping not Defending Your Wildlife or
property

03:59:48.510 --> 03:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
property
 
03:59:52.149 --> 03:59:52.159 align:start position:0%
now I do have an amendment before you um
 
03:59:54.110 --> 03:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
part of the amendment it's both in
 
03:59:56.950 --> 03:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
response to um things I understand that
 
04:00:00.469 --> 04:00:00.479 align:start position:0%
the commission wanted the first part um
 
04:00:04.269 --> 04:00:04.279 align:start position:0%
kind of opens up more um ability for the
 
04:00:07.070 --> 04:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
commission to uh establish these rules
 
04:00:09.790 --> 04:00:09.800 align:start position:0%
so it's not just the executive director
 
04:00:12.429 --> 04:00:12.439 align:start position:0%
but also that the commission can direct
 
04:00:12.439 --> 04:00:13.269 align:start position:0%
but also that the commission can direct
the

04:00:13.269 --> 04:00:13.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:00:16.910 --> 04:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
director the last section um instead of
 
04:00:19.110 --> 04:00:19.120 align:start position:0%
having an actual and I'm looking at the
 
04:00:22.110 --> 04:00:22.120 align:start position:0%
wrong page instead of having an actual
 
04:00:25.070 --> 04:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
open and close date um as in the
 
04:00:28.469 --> 04:00:28.479 align:start position:0%
original bill um it simply says to keep
 
04:00:30.309 --> 04:00:30.319 align:start position:0%
it consistent with the other caned
 
04:00:33.429 --> 04:00:33.439 align:start position:0%
species red and gray fox and it gives
 
04:00:36.309 --> 04:00:36.319 align:start position:0%
the department a month leeway on either
 
04:00:38.670 --> 04:00:38.680 align:start position:0%
side of that um already exist existing
 
04:00:41.349 --> 04:00:41.359 align:start position:0%
so just to be clear red and gray fox uh
 
04:00:44.149 --> 04:00:44.159 align:start position:0%
hunting is closed April 1st to through
 
04:00:46.790 --> 04:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
August 31st so there's an additional
 
04:00:48.469 --> 04:00:48.479 align:start position:0%
month on the the beginning of that an
 
04:00:49.630 --> 04:00:49.640 align:start position:0%
additional month on the end of that
 
04:00:51.670 --> 04:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
where the department can decide later
 
04:00:54.269 --> 04:00:54.279 align:start position:0%
through rules to move that back or
 
04:00:56.429 --> 04:00:56.439 align:start position:0%
forward for example if climate change
 
04:00:58.790 --> 04:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
causes uh coyote in the future to start
 
04:00:58.800 --> 04:00:59.870 align:start position:0%
causes uh coyote in the future to start
breeding

04:00:59.870 --> 04:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
breeding
 
04:01:03.030 --> 04:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
sooner but so it unti the hands of the
 
04:01:04.550 --> 04:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
commission or the department to be able
 
04:01:06.790 --> 04:01:06.800 align:start position:0%
to set that but it does say it has to be
 
04:01:08.830 --> 04:01:08.840 align:start position:0%
consistent with the fox species the
 
04:01:10.830 --> 04:01:10.840 align:start position:0%
other caned species and with that I'm
 
04:01:13.070 --> 04:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
happy to take
 
04:01:14.950 --> 04:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
questions thank you member for
 
04:01:16.429 --> 04:01:16.439 align:start position:0%
introducing the bill are there any
 
04:01:19.429 --> 04:01:19.439 align:start position:0%
questions for representative
 
04:01:21.830 --> 04:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
Reed representative
 
04:01:24.309 --> 04:01:24.319 align:start position:0%
Ford thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:01:26.630 --> 04:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question I just want to make
 
04:01:28.670 --> 04:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
sure I understand because I have to do
 
04:01:34.229 --> 04:01:34.239 align:start position:0%
that are there other um laws rsas that
 
04:01:36.830 --> 04:01:36.840 align:start position:0%
protect other animals that wouldn't
 
04:01:39.990 --> 04:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily be um just at the whim of
 
04:01:41.429 --> 04:01:41.439 align:start position:0%
the fish and game department are there
 
04:01:43.790 --> 04:01:43.800 align:start position:0%
actual laws protecting the The Fox and
 
04:01:48.149 --> 04:01:48.159 align:start position:0%
the other kenam Bas animals I'm unclear
 
04:01:51.269 --> 04:01:51.279 align:start position:0%
exactly which laws um apply to Fox in
 
04:01:53.750 --> 04:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
particular or any you species in par
 
04:01:55.550 --> 04:01:55.560 align:start position:0%
other than endangered and threatened
 
04:02:00.469 --> 04:02:00.479 align:start position:0%
species um but it is the practice of all
 
04:02:02.790 --> 04:02:02.800 align:start position:0%
committees and the legislative branch in
 
04:02:05.950 --> 04:02:05.960 align:start position:0%
general to put into RSA things that
 
04:02:07.710 --> 04:02:07.720 align:start position:0%
departments their respective departments
 
04:02:09.469 --> 04:02:09.479 align:start position:0%
need to do and we've done that here in
 
04:02:13.229 --> 04:02:13.239 align:start position:0%
this Committee just this
 
04:02:17.590 --> 04:02:17.600 align:start position:0%
year thank you any further
 
04:02:21.149 --> 04:02:21.159 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
04:02:24.510 --> 04:02:24.520 align:start position:0%
time we will start the 3 minutes because
 
04:02:27.070 --> 04:02:27.080 align:start position:0%
the prime is done speaking so by the
 
04:02:28.550 --> 04:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
time you start your mic you will have
 
04:02:30.349 --> 04:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
your three
 
04:02:33.750 --> 04:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
minutes I will call Deborah
 
04:02:35.990 --> 04:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
Sergeant chair recognizes Deborah
 
04:02:38.469 --> 04:02:38.479 align:start position:0%
Sergeant who was opposed to the bill for
 
04:02:40.830 --> 04:02:40.840 align:start position:0%
five minutes but you'll get three sorry
 
04:02:40.840 --> 04:02:58.429 align:start position:0%
five minutes but you'll get three sorry
for

04:02:58.429 --> 04:02:58.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:01.469 --> 04:03:01.479 align:start position:0%
that hi my name is deorah Sargeant from
 
04:03:04.910 --> 04:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
Epsom New Hampshire uh indiscriminate
 
04:03:07.630 --> 04:03:07.640 align:start position:0%
killing of coyotes temporarily decreases
 
04:03:10.950 --> 04:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
the population onethird of a vacancy in
 
04:03:13.429 --> 04:03:13.439 align:start position:0%
a territory and the coyote is able to
 
04:03:16.110 --> 04:03:16.120 align:start position:0%
fill it currently the coyotes are
 
04:03:18.830 --> 04:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
controlled by an Open Season New
 
04:03:20.910 --> 04:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire coyote population is
 
04:03:23.670 --> 04:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
approximately 4500
 
04:03:26.750 --> 04:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
coyotes fishing game states that about
 
04:03:29.510 --> 04:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
70% of the coyotes die in their first
 
04:03:32.790 --> 04:03:32.800 align:start position:0%
year due to natural causes disease birth
 
04:03:36.269 --> 04:03:36.279 align:start position:0%
defects or altercation with vehicles the
 
04:03:38.670 --> 04:03:38.680 align:start position:0%
other 30% are managed through the
 
04:03:42.790 --> 04:03:42.800 align:start position:0%
licensed Hunter and no not all
 
04:03:46.429 --> 04:03:46.439 align:start position:0%
6,600 licensed Hunters hunt
 
04:03:49.070 --> 04:03:49.080 align:start position:0%
coyotes despite all those Hunters it
 
04:03:51.910 --> 04:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
hasn't reduced the population the
 
04:03:54.229 --> 04:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
question frequently asks are are coyotes
 
04:03:56.510 --> 04:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
a threat to humans we know in
 
04:03:58.670 --> 04:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods at both day and night pets
 
04:04:01.269 --> 04:04:01.279 align:start position:0%
such as cats dogs other Wildlife are
 
04:04:04.229 --> 04:04:04.239 align:start position:0%
very much at risk and yes small children
 
04:04:06.990 --> 04:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
and adults have been injured and a few
 
04:04:07.000 --> 04:04:08.710 align:start position:0%
and adults have been injured and a few
killed

04:04:08.710 --> 04:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
killed
 
04:04:12.269 --> 04:04:12.279 align:start position:0%
one or 100 does not really matter yes
 
04:04:16.389 --> 04:04:16.399 align:start position:0%
they are a threat as Eric ORF States
 
04:04:18.309 --> 04:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
he's the New Hampshire wildlife
 
04:04:21.830 --> 04:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
biologist and he would say conservation
 
04:04:24.870 --> 04:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
matters I say to keep the kote season
 
04:04:27.229 --> 04:04:27.239 align:start position:0%
open year round and include night
 
04:04:31.429 --> 04:04:31.439 align:start position:0%
hunting all year thank
 
04:04:33.910 --> 04:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your testimony will
 
04:04:35.389 --> 04:04:35.399 align:start position:0%
you take any questions if anybody has
 
04:04:38.710 --> 04:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
any sure does anybody have any questions
 
04:04:41.030 --> 04:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
question representative Brown thank you
 
04:04:42.269 --> 04:04:42.279 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thanks for taking my
 
04:04:43.950 --> 04:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
question could you repeat the numbers
 
04:04:46.950 --> 04:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
that you said uh because I couldn't
 
04:04:50.110 --> 04:04:50.120 align:start position:0%
write that fast okay so there in terms
 
04:04:54.389 --> 04:04:54.399 align:start position:0%
of coyotes there's approximately 4500
 
04:04:58.830 --> 04:04:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:03.429 --> 04:05:03.439 align:start position:0%
6,600 licensed uh hunters in New
 
04:05:07.349 --> 04:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire y thank you yep thank you for
 
04:05:08.830 --> 04:05:08.840 align:start position:0%
your testimony are there any further
 
04:05:11.189 --> 04:05:11.199 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you so much
 
04:05:14.910 --> 04:05:14.920 align:start position:0%
thank you we'll now uh recognize Chris
 
04:05:18.309 --> 04:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
shadler from Webster New Hampshire from
 
04:05:20.910 --> 04:05:20.920 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire wildlife
 
04:05:24.229 --> 04:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
Coalition who supports the bill and uh
 
04:05:25.670 --> 04:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
we'll get three
 
04:05:25.680 --> 04:05:27.389 align:start position:0%
we'll get three
minutes

04:05:27.389 --> 04:05:27.399 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
04:05:30.590 --> 04:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
and I will remind you that uh when when
 
04:05:33.389 --> 04:05:33.399 align:start position:0%
you are a lobbyist for an organization
 
04:05:35.070 --> 04:05:35.080 align:start position:0%
or such don't read from your testimony
 
04:05:38.149 --> 04:05:38.159 align:start position:0%
please we we can read so uh hit the
 
04:05:40.229 --> 04:05:40.239 align:start position:0%
Highlight but don't read thank
 
04:05:43.110 --> 04:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you very much thanks for
 
04:05:45.670 --> 04:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
the time
 
04:05:48.590 --> 04:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
um we don't have any idea how many
 
04:05:51.630 --> 04:05:51.640 align:start position:0%
coyotes there are out there nobody's
 
04:05:54.910 --> 04:05:54.920 align:start position:0%
keeping track nobody has studied them
 
04:05:57.070 --> 04:05:57.080 align:start position:0%
fishing game doesn't have the resources
 
04:06:00.149 --> 04:06:00.159 align:start position:0%
to study them UNH has not studied them
 
04:06:04.189 --> 04:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
so the kind of numbers that you just
 
04:06:07.429 --> 04:06:07.439 align:start position:0%
heard may or may not be true we just
 
04:06:09.830 --> 04:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
don't no
 
04:06:12.710 --> 04:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
um the tradition in the state since the
 
04:06:15.269 --> 04:06:15.279 align:start position:0%
1940s has been to allow an open season
 
04:06:18.550 --> 04:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
on coyotes uh because there was a
 
04:06:20.389 --> 04:06:20.399 align:start position:0%
perceived threat that coyotes would
 
04:06:22.910 --> 04:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
eliminate the deer herd and I heard this
 
04:06:26.349 --> 04:06:26.359 align:start position:0%
for years and years and years and years
 
04:06:29.309 --> 04:06:29.319 align:start position:0%
and that has not come to pass uh coyotes
 
04:06:31.950 --> 04:06:31.960 align:start position:0%
across the entire Northeast have not
 
04:06:35.030 --> 04:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
made a dent in the deer herd do coyotes
 
04:06:38.189 --> 04:06:38.199 align:start position:0%
hunt deer they do they hunt fawn on in
 
04:06:40.790 --> 04:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
the spring and they can take adult deer
 
04:06:42.630 --> 04:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
but they've not been able to make a dent
 
04:06:43.830 --> 04:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:06:43.840 --> 04:06:46.550 align:start position:0%
in the
population

04:06:46.550 --> 04:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
population
 
04:06:49.670 --> 04:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
um the big point that I wanted to make
 
04:06:53.550 --> 04:06:53.560 align:start position:0%
about that is that hunting coyotes does
 
04:06:58.550 --> 04:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
not control coyotes it never has the US
 
04:07:01.070 --> 04:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
government and state agencies have been
 
04:07:04.149 --> 04:07:04.159 align:start position:0%
trying to literally eradicate out west
 
04:07:07.830 --> 04:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
the coyote eradicate the coyote and have
 
04:07:10.590 --> 04:07:10.600 align:start position:0%
gone to amazing measures to get the job
 
04:07:13.550 --> 04:07:13.560 align:start position:0%
done and today if you look at the
 
04:07:17.790 --> 04:07:17.800 align:start position:0%
expansion maps of coyote occupation they
 
04:07:20.070 --> 04:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
have expanded their range from the
 
04:07:22.630 --> 04:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
western states to the east up into
 
04:07:25.469 --> 04:07:25.479 align:start position:0%
Canada down through Central America and
 
04:07:28.030 --> 04:07:28.040 align:start position:0%
two years ago just arrived in South
 
04:07:32.229 --> 04:07:32.239 align:start position:0%
America and they did that they did that
 
04:07:35.109 --> 04:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
because they are so intensively
 
04:07:38.309 --> 04:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
hunted which makes little to no sense
 
04:07:40.830 --> 04:07:40.840 align:start position:0%
unless you understand that they use
 
04:07:40.840 --> 04:07:42.830 align:start position:0%
unless you understand that they use
responsive

04:07:42.830 --> 04:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
responsive
 
04:07:46.349 --> 04:07:46.359 align:start position:0%
reproduction um as their mechanism to
 
04:07:49.349 --> 04:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
make up for their own losses so I'm
 
04:07:53.590 --> 04:07:53.600 align:start position:0%
going to say this more
 
04:07:55.830 --> 04:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
easily uh studies out west in
 
04:07:58.030 --> 04:07:58.040 align:start position:0%
Yellowstone National Park where coyotes
 
04:08:00.630 --> 04:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
are not hunted have found that their
 
04:08:03.269 --> 04:08:03.279 align:start position:0%
populations actually stabilize when
 
04:08:04.309 --> 04:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
04:08:07.670 --> 04:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
hunted they have mechanisms to do that
 
04:08:10.189 --> 04:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
to keep their population in check when
 
04:08:13.590 --> 04:08:13.600 align:start position:0%
they're hunted indiscriminately like we
 
04:08:15.950 --> 04:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
do out here
 
04:08:19.550 --> 04:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
um they they have mechanisms with which
 
04:08:22.950 --> 04:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
to respond and there's no need to get
 
04:08:25.710 --> 04:08:25.720 align:start position:0%
into the specifics but I'd love to if
 
04:08:28.389 --> 04:08:28.399 align:start position:0%
you want to know more about it so
 
04:08:31.070 --> 04:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
hunting coyotes according to science has
 
04:08:33.710 --> 04:08:33.720 align:start position:0%
never made any sense if you understand
 
04:08:37.030 --> 04:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
how this animal Works hunting them
 
04:08:39.070 --> 04:08:39.080 align:start position:0%
during their Denning
 
04:08:39.080 --> 04:08:40.670 align:start position:0%
during their Denning
season

04:08:40.670 --> 04:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
season
 
04:08:46.309 --> 04:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
is is so unrod for us because first of
 
04:08:48.670 --> 04:08:48.680 align:start position:0%
all hunting coyotes in the spring and
 
04:08:51.870 --> 04:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
the summer there's no reason to do that
 
04:08:53.790 --> 04:08:53.800 align:start position:0%
um for their pets your 3 minutes I just
 
04:08:55.510 --> 04:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to let you know I'm what you're
 
04:08:59.269 --> 04:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
at your 3 minutes no yes you are oh God
 
04:09:01.070 --> 04:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
I have so much to
 
04:09:03.830 --> 04:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
say I'm try to wrap it up as best as you
 
04:09:06.030 --> 04:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
can okay wrapping it up the pelts are
 
04:09:08.229 --> 04:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
worthless spring and spring summer and
 
04:09:10.590 --> 04:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
early fall so that there's no reason to
 
04:09:13.750 --> 04:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
hunt coyotes for their pelts and I'm
 
04:09:15.109 --> 04:09:15.119 align:start position:0%
sure that there are other people that
 
04:09:17.149 --> 04:09:17.159 align:start position:0%
are going to say that killing those
 
04:09:21.070 --> 04:09:21.080 align:start position:0%
adults during Denning season um causes
 
04:09:23.309 --> 04:09:23.319 align:start position:0%
can cause starvation among the pups but
 
04:09:25.790 --> 04:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
worse and this is from a former sheep
 
04:09:29.429 --> 04:09:29.439 align:start position:0%
farmer worse it puts coyotes that have
 
04:09:32.790 --> 04:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
not learned their proper prey out into
 
04:09:35.750 --> 04:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
the world potentially going after my
 
04:09:38.070 --> 04:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
Lambs other people's chickens

taking my question um you you said that
 
04:10:10.349 --> 04:10:10.359 align:start position:0%
I believe the US government has been
 
04:10:12.349 --> 04:10:12.359 align:start position:0%
trying to eradicate coyotes is that
 
04:10:13.750 --> 04:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
historical or are you saying that's
 
04:10:15.870 --> 04:10:15.880 align:start position:0%
still happening that is still happening
 
04:10:18.429 --> 04:10:18.439 align:start position:0%

going to recess for a short bit to have
 
04:10:30.349 --> 04:10:30.359 align:start position:0%
a nice presentation from the fish and
 
04:10:31.469 --> 04:10:31.479 align:start position:0%
game department on how they're
 
04:10:34.149 --> 04:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
remediating our uh fish farming
 
04:10:37.070 --> 04:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
activities to try to clean our Waters up
 
04:10:37.080 --> 04:10:38.309 align:start position:0%
activities to try to clean our Waters up
um

04:10:38.309 --> 04:10:38.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:45.790 --> 04:10:45.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:49.030 --> 04:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
close representing himself I know you've
 
04:10:55.269 --> 04:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:57.389 --> 04:10:57.399 align:start position:0%
three and I welcome you back to the
 
04:10:59.189 --> 04:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
fishing game committee after so many
 
04:11:00.429 --> 04:11:00.439 align:start position:0%
years of
 
04:11:02.429 --> 04:11:02.439 align:start position:0%
service for those who don't know rep
 
04:11:03.750 --> 04:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
close has been a member of this
 
04:11:06.750 --> 04:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
Committee in the past for a long time
 
04:11:10.349 --> 04:11:10.359 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chair
 
04:11:12.750 --> 04:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
committee I'm not in favor of this bill
 
04:11:15.030 --> 04:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
whatsoever we've had this bill being on
 
04:11:17.189 --> 04:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
this committee for 10 years we've had
 
04:11:19.710 --> 04:11:19.720 align:start position:0%
this bill many times in front of us it
 
04:11:21.710 --> 04:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
changes from time to time but basically
 
04:11:24.990 --> 04:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
it's the same thing about not uh no
 
04:11:28.109 --> 04:11:28.119 align:start position:0%
hunting during the season that pups are
 
04:11:32.109 --> 04:11:32.119 align:start position:0%
born well if you're aware of it when
 
04:11:35.389 --> 04:11:35.399 align:start position:0%
pups are born they only depend on the
 
04:11:37.030 --> 04:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
adult for about two weeks and then
 
04:11:39.389 --> 04:11:39.399 align:start position:0%
they're on their own so for making
 
04:11:42.349 --> 04:11:42.359 align:start position:0%
months of no hunting it just don't even
 
04:11:45.790 --> 04:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
make sense when this bill was first made
 
04:11:48.630 --> 04:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
I was that was about I don't know 15
 
04:11:48.640 --> 04:11:49.990 align:start position:0%
I was that was about I don't know 15
years

04:11:49.990 --> 04:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:11:52.109 --> 04:11:52.119 align:start position:0%
ago we had
 
04:11:55.830 --> 04:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
hunting 7 days a week 24 hours a day all
 
04:11:55.840 --> 04:11:56.790 align:start position:0%
hunting 7 days a week 24 hours a day all
year

04:11:56.790 --> 04:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:11:59.950 --> 04:11:59.960 align:start position:0%
long and with the director we had at
 
04:12:02.670 --> 04:12:02.680 align:start position:0%
that time he said it caused too much
 
04:12:05.109 --> 04:12:05.119 align:start position:0%
turmoil and he wanted to abbreviate it
 
04:12:06.429 --> 04:12:06.439 align:start position:0%
and this is what happened this is what
 
04:12:07.830 --> 04:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
we end up with
 
04:12:14.870 --> 04:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:19.149 --> 04:12:19.159 align:start position:0%
Bill we gave we refer to 541a for rules
 
04:12:20.910 --> 04:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
and regulations from the director he's
 
04:12:22.630 --> 04:12:22.640 align:start position:0%
the one that makes the regulations for
 
04:12:25.790 --> 04:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
it and we gave him a lot of leeway and
 
04:12:27.750 --> 04:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
so far it's worked out pretty
 
04:12:30.630 --> 04:12:30.640 align:start position:0%
well um I've had a lot of person
 
04:12:33.070 --> 04:12:33.080 align:start position:0%
personal personally experience with k
 
04:12:38.830 --> 04:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
with Koy dogs coyotes rather and
 
04:12:41.950 --> 04:12:41.960 align:start position:0%
um I just don't see no reason not to
 
04:12:44.990 --> 04:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
hunt him for that
 
04:12:45.000 --> 04:12:46.790 align:start position:0%
hunt him for that
time

04:12:46.790 --> 04:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:12:51.469 --> 04:12:51.479 align:start position:0%
um also I was selected by fishing game
 
04:12:53.750 --> 04:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
to go down to
 
04:12:57.590 --> 04:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
Georgia uh for the big carcass we had in
 
04:13:01.389 --> 04:13:01.399 align:start position:0%
Georgia for the Sportsman and also for I
 
04:13:04.950 --> 04:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
went to the one in Little Rock Arkansas
 
04:13:09.030 --> 04:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
also and coyotes were one of the top
 
04:13:11.269 --> 04:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
subjects we talked about down here how
 
04:13:13.229 --> 04:13:13.239 align:start position:0%
they're multiplying all through the
 
04:13:16.590 --> 04:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
South Pennsylvania new Mississippi uh
 
04:13:21.070 --> 04:13:21.080 align:start position:0%
Louisiana and it's a major major problem
 
04:13:24.750 --> 04:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
so that's about all I have to say about
 
04:13:26.630 --> 04:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
that thank you so much for your
 
04:13:28.750 --> 04:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
testimony are there any questions for
 
04:13:35.149 --> 04:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:37.389 --> 04:13:37.399 align:start position:0%

with that we're going to recess for
 
04:13:49.070 --> 04:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
about 15 minutes for the committee for
 
04:13:51.189 --> 04:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
the defici game department to give us a
 
04:13:54.630 --> 04:13:54.640 align:start position:0%
presentation and we'll start again uh 15
 
04:14:03.950 --> 04:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:03.960 --> 04:14:06.070 align:start position:0%

04:14:36.070 --> 04:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:36.080 --> 04:14:59.429 align:start position:0%
 
absolutely

04:14:59.429 --> 04:14:59.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:02.149 --> 04:15:02.159 align:start position:0%

if people want them to the to the public
yeah

04:15:25.070 --> 04:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:30.389 --> 04:15:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:33.469 --> 04:15:33.479 align:start position:0%
so oh go ahead
 
04:15:36.149 --> 04:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
okay sorry about that thank you for the
 
04:15:37.910 --> 04:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity again to speak with everyone
 
04:15:39.070 --> 04:15:39.080 align:start position:0%
and give this
 
04:15:43.229 --> 04:15:43.239 align:start position:0%
presentation um I will go through as
 
04:15:45.229 --> 04:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
best that I can and save questions for
 
04:15:46.469 --> 04:15:46.479 align:start position:0%
the end I
 
04:15:46.479 --> 04:15:48.070 align:start position:0%
the end I
guess

04:15:48.070 --> 04:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
guess
 
04:15:50.750 --> 04:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
so so my name is Diane Timmons I'm the
 
04:15:53.510 --> 04:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
Inland Fisheries division Chief and
 
04:15:55.670 --> 04:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
first questions first what got us here
 
04:15:57.070 --> 04:15:57.080 align:start position:0%
why are we talking about Hatchery
 
04:15:58.990 --> 04:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
modernization so a little bit of a
 
04:16:00.950 --> 04:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
refresher for a little bit of a
 
04:16:02.990 --> 04:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
duplicate I guess from this morning um
 
04:16:07.149 --> 04:16:07.159 align:start position:0%
just some history stocking has been a uh
 
04:16:08.830 --> 04:16:08.840 align:start position:0%
Band-Aid for a long time in New
 
04:16:10.950 --> 04:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire well over a hundred years we
 
04:16:13.710 --> 04:16:13.720 align:start position:0%
had issues with over fishing for wild
 
04:16:15.590 --> 04:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
brick trout to the point where in some
 
04:16:19.070 --> 04:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
locations it was extrap we introduced
 
04:16:21.269 --> 04:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
all sorts of fun species including
 
04:16:24.990 --> 04:16:25.000 align:start position:0%
Pacific salmon and so um obviously as
 
04:16:29.269 --> 04:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
science has um updated us we have also
 
04:16:31.590 --> 04:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
made changes and recognized certain
 
04:16:34.229 --> 04:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
species just don't fit in New Hampshire
 
04:16:37.510 --> 04:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
so that being said um our
 
04:16:39.870 --> 04:16:39.880 align:start position:0%
recreational fishing in New Hampshire is
 
04:16:43.790 --> 04:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
a huge activity very popular we spent uh
 
04:16:47.950 --> 04:16:47.960 align:start position:0%
angler spent 3.5 million days fishing in
 
04:16:51.950 --> 04:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
2022 from our recent survey and which
 
04:16:55.910 --> 04:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
contributed 1.4 billion to our economy
 
04:16:58.030 --> 04:16:58.040 align:start position:0%
so fishing in New Hampshire is a huge
 
04:17:00.550 --> 04:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
activity stocking is a part of that and
 
04:17:03.590 --> 04:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
we forever be a part of that and because
 
04:17:06.870 --> 04:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
we have issues with our water chemistry
 
04:17:10.870 --> 04:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
we have issues with no um calcium we
 
04:17:12.870 --> 04:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
have lots of granite being the granite
 
04:17:15.830 --> 04:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
state unlike our neighbors and so we
 
04:17:18.349 --> 04:17:18.359 align:start position:0%
have small bugs small fish and in order
 
04:17:20.349 --> 04:17:20.359 align:start position:0%
to provide those catchable size fish
 
04:17:23.349 --> 04:17:23.359 align:start position:0%
stocking is definitely um an action that
 
04:17:27.750 --> 04:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
needs to take place so um I will just go
 
04:17:29.630 --> 04:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
through um you should have the
 
04:17:32.149 --> 04:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
presentation in front of you as I switch
 
04:17:35.269 --> 04:17:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:38.910 --> 04:17:38.920 align:start position:0%
too so the other part why we're here is
 
04:17:43.070 --> 04:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
that um in 2019 we got sued by the
 
04:17:44.630 --> 04:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
conservation law
 
04:17:48.030 --> 04:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
Foundation at our po Mill Hatchery for
 
04:17:50.670 --> 04:17:50.680 align:start position:0%
um discharge into the maram meting River
 
04:17:53.870 --> 04:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
into um the areas above three impaired
 
04:17:56.950 --> 04:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
water bodies impaired identified by Dees
 
04:17:59.550 --> 04:17:59.560 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
04:18:02.349 --> 04:18:02.359 align:start position:0%
those locations uh we never violated our
 
04:18:04.870 --> 04:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
permit by EPA we did not have
 
04:18:07.109 --> 04:18:07.119 align:start position:0%
restrictions on phosphorus at the time
 
04:18:10.469 --> 04:18:10.479 align:start position:0%
this is a new item for um the country
 
04:18:13.389 --> 04:18:13.399 align:start position:0%
quite frankly and um it's becoming more
 
04:18:16.469 --> 04:18:16.479 align:start position:0%
common today but in the at that time
 
04:18:20.189 --> 04:18:20.199 align:start position:0%
this was our first issue with phosphorus
 
04:18:23.950 --> 04:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
limits the new working with advisory
 
04:18:27.109 --> 04:18:27.119 align:start position:0%
committees and the permitting agencies
 
04:18:29.750 --> 04:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
um the new permit at Powder Mill
 
04:18:33.109 --> 04:18:33.119 align:start position:0%
discharge is 12 parts per billion and
 
04:18:35.109 --> 04:18:35.119 align:start position:0%
that's related to phosphorus in the
 
04:18:38.510 --> 04:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
water we cannot meet that permit at our
 
04:18:41.950 --> 04:18:41.960 align:start position:0%
current um operation and part of that is
 
04:18:44.149 --> 04:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
because as you can see from the images
 
04:18:46.790 --> 04:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
here we have a lot of outdated
 
04:18:49.750 --> 04:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure we have um we have
 
04:18:52.349 --> 04:18:52.359 align:start position:0%
outdated operations so we have no
 
04:18:55.590 --> 04:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
mechanism for us to be able to treat the
 
04:18:57.950 --> 04:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
water without doing a massive water
 
04:19:00.469 --> 04:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
treatment plant and that water treatment
 
04:19:02.630 --> 04:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
plant identified through a feasibility
 
04:19:05.950 --> 04:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
study was $67 million clearly above and
 
04:19:07.710 --> 04:19:07.720 align:start position:0%
beyond our budget
 
04:19:10.830 --> 04:19:10.840 align:start position:0%
and so um as a result we'll talk a
 
04:19:12.950 --> 04:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
little bit further about the next steps
 
04:19:15.389 --> 04:19:15.399 align:start position:0%
there in the next slide but just wanted
 
04:19:18.229 --> 04:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
to reiterate that current operations the
 
04:19:19.950 --> 04:19:19.960 align:start position:0%
way we're running now all of our
 
04:19:22.030 --> 04:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
facilities are what are called serial
 
04:19:24.429 --> 04:19:24.439 align:start position:0%
flow through they start at the top the
 
04:19:26.030 --> 04:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
water goes all the way through there's
 
04:19:28.870 --> 04:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
no mechanism valves to turn anything off
 
04:19:31.590 --> 04:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
if things get clogged then it shuts down
 
04:19:33.990 --> 04:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
the whole water line to the facility so
 
04:19:36.870 --> 04:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
right now not a lot of opportunity this
 
04:19:39.630 --> 04:19:39.640 align:start position:0%
is definitely an outdated mechanism um a
 
04:19:43.030 --> 04:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
lot of states in the United States have
 
04:19:44.990 --> 04:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
upgraded their facilities modernized
 
04:19:47.229 --> 04:19:47.239 align:start position:0%
their facilities to be what are called
 
04:19:49.910 --> 04:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
recirculating systems and we'll get into
 
04:19:51.870 --> 04:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
that as well but right now our current
 
04:19:55.349 --> 04:19:55.359 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is outdated to um
 
04:19:57.309 --> 04:19:57.319 align:start position:0%
maintain our current production with any
 
04:19:59.309 --> 04:19:59.319 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
04:20:02.149 --> 04:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
limits so I mentioned the impaired
 
04:20:04.990 --> 04:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
Waters so you'll note here the Stars on
 
04:20:07.630 --> 04:20:07.640 align:start position:0%
Powder Mill and Berlin so those are two
 
04:20:09.349 --> 04:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
of our water bodies two of our
 
04:20:12.070 --> 04:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
facilities our hatcheries that uh
 
04:20:14.830 --> 04:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
discharge into what have been deemed
 
04:20:17.030 --> 04:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
impaired Waters by the Department of
 
04:20:19.429 --> 04:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services so there are
 
04:20:22.309 --> 04:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
three locations below pter Mill and
 
04:20:25.469 --> 04:20:25.479 align:start position:0%
there's one at Berlin uh York Pond some
 
04:20:27.950 --> 04:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
of you may have heard of that what we've
 
04:20:30.229 --> 04:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
done at poter Mill what our plan is is
 
04:20:33.750 --> 04:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
to reduce our production to 30% of where
 
04:20:37.189 --> 04:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
we're currently at after the feasibility
 
04:20:39.030 --> 04:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
study which was a year and a half long
 
04:20:42.630 --> 04:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
done by HDR engineering they determined
 
04:20:45.469 --> 04:20:45.479 align:start position:0%
that they think if we drop it 2 30%
 
04:20:47.630 --> 04:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
which will be our large lake rainbow
 
04:20:50.630 --> 04:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
program um if we drop it to 30% they
 
04:20:52.670 --> 04:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
think that we can meet that 12 parts per
 
04:20:54.750 --> 04:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
billion so that is our goal at Powder
 
04:20:57.990 --> 04:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
Mill um we we don't want to lose Powder
 
04:21:00.109 --> 04:21:00.119 align:start position:0%
Mill it's one of our best water sources
 
04:21:02.550 --> 04:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
maram meting lake is a gravity fed
 
04:21:05.670 --> 04:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
system we don't need any pumps it's it's
 
04:21:09.630 --> 04:21:09.640 align:start position:0%
um a great large water source that um we
 
04:21:11.910 --> 04:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
definitely want to look to the Future to
 
04:21:14.269 --> 04:21:14.279 align:start position:0%
hopefully be able to come up with a
 
04:21:17.630 --> 04:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
solution at that time the Berlin
 
04:21:20.149 --> 04:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
Hatchery what we've done there is
 
04:21:22.950 --> 04:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
basically remove the area that
 
04:21:26.229 --> 04:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
discharges into York pond so the West
 
04:21:29.750 --> 04:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
West Branch raceways are we used to hold
 
04:21:32.149 --> 04:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
fish in those it's the only location on
 
04:21:34.429 --> 04:21:34.439 align:start position:0%
the facility that discharges into York
 
04:21:36.790 --> 04:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
Pond and so what we've done there is
 
04:21:39.590 --> 04:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
remove those fish out and put them down
 
04:21:41.750 --> 04:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
below we've gotten rid of The Brood
 
04:21:43.950 --> 04:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
program up in the north country that was
 
04:21:45.590 --> 04:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
our brook trout brood for the North
 
04:21:47.670 --> 04:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
Country we think we can supply that at
 
04:21:50.830 --> 04:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
our new Hampton Hatchery without any
 
04:21:53.229 --> 04:21:53.239 align:start position:0%
increase in um production we take those
 
04:21:55.990 --> 04:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
eggs anyway and so now we'll just um
 
04:21:58.429 --> 04:21:58.439 align:start position:0%
take them there that enable us to stock
 
04:22:00.910 --> 04:22:00.920 align:start position:0%
out those large brood and put the FIS
 
04:22:03.229 --> 04:22:03.239 align:start position:0%
from the West Branch in those raceways
 
04:22:06.070 --> 04:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
and take their place so that right now
 
04:22:09.229 --> 04:22:09.239 align:start position:0%
we're not discharging into York pond at
 
04:22:13.750 --> 04:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
all and that is in anticipation of the
 
04:22:16.070 --> 04:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
the renewal permit right now Berlin is
 
04:22:18.750 --> 04:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
operating under a 2013 Nifty permit
 
04:22:22.630 --> 04:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
National pollution and discharge um uh
 
04:22:24.910 --> 04:22:24.920 align:start position:0%
permit and we've
 
04:22:28.590 --> 04:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
basically waiting to have um EPA give us
 
04:22:30.630 --> 04:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
a level at this point we're anticipating
 
04:22:32.670 --> 04:22:32.680 align:start position:0%
there's going to be something so you'll
 
04:22:35.830 --> 04:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
note on the chart that there's a 10,000
 
04:22:37.389 --> 04:22:37.399 align:start position:0%
um pound
 
04:22:40.349 --> 04:22:40.359 align:start position:0%
uh reduction here and that is purely an
 
04:22:42.510 --> 04:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
anticipation of some sort of limit we
 
04:22:44.910 --> 04:22:44.920 align:start position:0%
have no idea hopefully by taking the
 
04:22:46.630 --> 04:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
action that the proactive action that
 
04:22:48.750 --> 04:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
we've taken we're hoping maybe they'll
 
04:22:51.229 --> 04:22:51.239 align:start position:0%
say Oh No Limit you guys stay the same
 
04:22:52.510 --> 04:22:52.520 align:start position:0%
and that would be great and then we
 
04:22:56.269 --> 04:22:56.279 align:start position:0%
could remain back at that 74,000 but one
 
04:22:57.790 --> 04:22:57.800 align:start position:0%
question for you looking at the chart
 
04:23:01.149 --> 04:23:01.159 align:start position:0%
yeah if I may um I'm seeing that uh the
 
04:23:03.309 --> 04:23:03.319 align:start position:0%
the reductions uh because we need to
 
04:23:06.710 --> 04:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
make them in Berlin and uh Powder Mill
 
04:23:09.830 --> 04:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh seem to be made up by New Hampton um
 
04:23:12.269 --> 04:23:12.279 align:start position:0%
with it more than doubling uh the
 
04:23:14.790 --> 04:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
proposed pounds in New Hampton are there
 
04:23:16.670 --> 04:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
concerns there or do they have some
 
04:23:19.830 --> 04:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
natural remediation such as um uh
 
04:23:23.550 --> 04:23:23.560 align:start position:0%
settling ponds and uh natural flood
 
04:23:25.830 --> 04:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
planes Etc outside of that at New
 
04:23:27.990 --> 04:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
Hampton are you talking yes New Hampton
 
04:23:30.469 --> 04:23:30.479 align:start position:0%
to absorb the extra burden we're putting
 
04:23:33.590 --> 04:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
down there yep so New Hampton nice segue
 
04:23:36.269 --> 04:23:36.279 align:start position:0%
thank you so at New Hampton where
 
04:23:38.710 --> 04:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
revamping the entire facility so the
 
04:23:41.870 --> 04:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
whole idea is this would be our Target
 
04:23:44.389 --> 04:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
facility to modernize um it's a
 
04:23:47.070 --> 04:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
centralized location it currently holds
 
04:23:49.189 --> 04:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
all of our brood for brown trout and
 
04:23:53.630 --> 04:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
brook trout and um it is an area we have
 
04:23:56.030 --> 04:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
enough land there that um we can
 
04:23:58.870 --> 04:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
definitely do it at that location and
 
04:24:02.389 --> 04:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
then also in future phases um we have
 
04:24:06.389 --> 04:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to potentially um disch
 
04:24:09.030 --> 04:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
charge into the pemet river after
 
04:24:12.349 --> 04:24:12.359 align:start position:0%
research and um anti-degradation efforts
 
04:24:15.309 --> 04:24:15.319 align:start position:0%
so the thought at New Hampton is that
 
04:24:18.109 --> 04:24:18.119 align:start position:0%
yes we would be doubling it but by doing
 
04:24:20.550 --> 04:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
the recirculating systems which I'll get
 
04:24:23.229 --> 04:24:23.239 align:start position:0%
a little bit in the next slide but um in
 
04:24:26.429 --> 04:24:26.439 align:start position:0%
doing that uh there's a huge well it's
 
04:24:28.630 --> 04:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
the only opportunity for us to do
 
04:24:31.550 --> 04:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
additional filtrations we have uh water
 
04:24:33.550 --> 04:24:33.560 align:start position:0%
treatment there's a whole bunch of
 
04:24:35.910 --> 04:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
things there that enable us to operate
 
04:24:38.269 --> 04:24:38.279 align:start position:0%
on under much better conditions so
 
04:24:40.349 --> 04:24:40.359 align:start position:0%
because we have the opportunity to add
 
04:24:43.670 --> 04:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
oxygen to treat to filter Etc we'll be
 
04:24:48.229 --> 04:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
able to take on that extra fish load and
 
04:24:51.269 --> 04:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
not increase any of our we will maintain
 
04:24:53.109 --> 04:24:53.119 align:start position:0%
our limits where we're currently at at
 
04:24:55.429 --> 04:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampton there'll be no an increase
 
04:24:57.670 --> 04:24:57.680 align:start position:0%
so this is uh entirely handled by
 
04:25:01.469 --> 04:25:01.479 align:start position:0%
mechanical mitigation not any natural um
 
04:25:04.750 --> 04:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
mitigation through um swampy areas and
 
04:25:05.870 --> 04:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
whatnot that we've decided we're going
 
04:25:09.309 --> 04:25:09.319 align:start position:0%
to put in to absorb the nutrients before
 
04:25:11.269 --> 04:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
they get out to the river yeah so
 
04:25:13.750 --> 04:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
there's settling areas within that so
 
04:25:16.309 --> 04:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
there's um Swale ponds that they do
 
04:25:18.590 --> 04:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
that's all part of the production yeah I
 
04:25:21.710 --> 04:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
mean sorry part of the um construction
 
04:25:24.109 --> 04:25:24.119 align:start position:0%
yep and then the other three facilities
 
04:25:25.870 --> 04:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
ideally in the future we'd love to have
 
04:25:28.229 --> 04:25:28.239 align:start position:0%
our own brood Stock Program for rainbows
 
04:25:29.870 --> 04:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
right now those fish come from out of
 
04:25:32.349 --> 04:25:32.359 align:start position:0%
state I won't lie we get yucky eggs
 
04:25:34.590 --> 04:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
fortunately we get the seconds and so
 
04:25:36.030 --> 04:25:36.040 align:start position:0%
obviously the states that are prod
 
04:25:37.590 --> 04:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
producing them get the primary high
 
04:25:40.070 --> 04:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
quality ones and we get the seconds and
 
04:25:42.990 --> 04:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
we have had multiple issues with FedEx
 
04:25:45.830 --> 04:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
we've had multiple issues with just poor
 
04:25:49.269 --> 04:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
quality eggs and we spend a lot of time
 
04:25:52.790 --> 04:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
and a lot of um just effort and just
 
04:25:55.189 --> 04:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
variability on when we get those eggs is
 
04:25:58.030 --> 04:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
a real problem for Hatchery because your
 
04:26:00.590 --> 04:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
your hatch dates are different and so
 
04:26:02.990 --> 04:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
obviously trying to get to a Target size
 
04:26:05.590 --> 04:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
by the stocking date can sometimes be a
 
04:26:07.429 --> 04:26:07.439 align:start position:0%
problem because sometimes instead of
 
04:26:09.950 --> 04:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
getting eggs in September we're not
 
04:26:12.830 --> 04:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
getting eggs until you know sometimes
 
04:26:15.630 --> 04:26:15.640 align:start position:0%
February and so we've had major issues
 
04:26:17.670 --> 04:26:17.680 align:start position:0%
with that as well we'd love to have our
 
04:26:20.309 --> 04:26:20.319 align:start position:0%
own program obviously that's a future
 
04:26:24.309 --> 04:26:24.319 align:start position:0%
effort and um future funding um need but
 
04:26:26.309 --> 04:26:26.319 align:start position:0%
uh we would like to do that at Twin Twin
 
04:26:29.109 --> 04:26:29.119 align:start position:0%
has great alkalinities it has great pH
 
04:26:32.030 --> 04:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
and rainbows respond very well to that
 
04:26:34.349 --> 04:26:34.359 align:start position:0%
type of water chemistry so we'd like to
 
04:26:36.149 --> 04:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
do that at Twin and then as far as far
 
04:26:38.389 --> 04:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
as Milford and Warren um we would
 
04:26:39.910 --> 04:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
continue to just look at those
 
04:26:43.670 --> 04:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:48.790 --> 04:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
future no twin is Carol up north yeah
 
04:26:52.910 --> 04:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
yep um so getting into the recirculating
 
04:26:56.070 --> 04:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
part uh so the conceptual Design This is
 
04:26:58.990 --> 04:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
conceptual we're still working with HDR
 
04:27:01.070 --> 04:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
literally weekly at this point talking
 
04:27:04.149 --> 04:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
about things that our hatch Reef what
 
04:27:06.349 --> 04:27:06.359 align:start position:0%
we'd like to have on station we've
 
04:27:08.469 --> 04:27:08.479 align:start position:0%
actually traveled down to multiple
 
04:27:11.109 --> 04:27:11.119 align:start position:0%
multiple facilities that do have the
 
04:27:13.710 --> 04:27:13.720 align:start position:0%
recirculating type um aquaculture
 
04:27:17.149 --> 04:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
systems and so in concept we would have
 
04:27:19.550 --> 04:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
a brand new Hatchery building one of the
 
04:27:21.630 --> 04:27:21.640 align:start position:0%
other things that um I should mention
 
04:27:24.389 --> 04:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
too is predation and so people don't
 
04:27:26.109 --> 04:27:26.119 align:start position:0%
really realize that predation at a
 
04:27:28.309 --> 04:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
hatchery is just as bad as it is in the
 
04:27:30.830 --> 04:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
wild and sometimes worse because we
 
04:27:33.109 --> 04:27:33.119 align:start position:0%
create little dinner plate atmospheres
 
04:27:35.950 --> 04:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
out there and so we have major major
 
04:27:39.309 --> 04:27:39.319 align:start position:0%
issues with minks otter Osprey Eagles
 
04:27:41.910 --> 04:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
You Name It rats we get every single
 
04:27:43.990 --> 04:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
creature that likes to eat anything in
 
04:27:46.189 --> 04:27:46.199 align:start position:0%
everything at our facilities and right
 
04:27:49.910 --> 04:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
now a lot of our facilities don't have
 
04:27:53.550 --> 04:27:53.560 align:start position:0%
um predation control and so recently in
 
04:27:56.229 --> 04:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampton just last year actually with
 
04:27:59.990 --> 04:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
that ice in the late spring uh well late
 
04:28:02.750 --> 04:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
winter I guess um we had major issues
 
04:28:06.070 --> 04:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
with ice and it fluctuated our green
 
04:28:08.070 --> 04:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
house structures and blew the whole
 
04:28:11.510 --> 04:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
facility over just like that $41,000
 
04:28:13.550 --> 04:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
went out the window and we had no
 
04:28:15.510 --> 04:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
protection on those brown trout as a
 
04:28:17.550 --> 04:28:17.560 align:start position:0%
result we will be short brown trout this
 
04:28:20.309 --> 04:28:20.319 align:start position:0%
year um in our stocking because they got
 
04:28:23.070 --> 04:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
eaten and so predation is huge the other
 
04:28:25.550 --> 04:28:25.560 align:start position:0%
part is the feeding regime you think
 
04:28:27.349 --> 04:28:27.359 align:start position:0%
that there's a certain number of fish in
 
04:28:29.870 --> 04:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
a Raceway you're feeding them and then
 
04:28:31.590 --> 04:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
that certain number gets lower but
 
04:28:33.389 --> 04:28:33.399 align:start position:0%
you're still feeding the same until we
 
04:28:35.510 --> 04:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
do our weekly assessments sometimes by
 
04:28:35.520 --> 04:28:36.630 align:start position:0%
do our weekly assessments sometimes by
month

04:28:36.630 --> 04:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
month
 
04:28:38.550 --> 04:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
and so you keep feeding them and all
 
04:28:41.630 --> 04:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
that food settles to the bottom and also
 
04:28:44.750 --> 04:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
results in a phosphorus issue so it's
 
04:28:46.429 --> 04:28:46.439 align:start position:0%
it's a combination thing fixing
 
04:28:48.910 --> 04:28:48.920 align:start position:0%
predation is not just a feel-good
 
04:28:51.189 --> 04:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
syndrome it's also you know looking at
 
04:28:53.109 --> 04:28:53.119 align:start position:0%
that water quality and chemistry that we
 
04:28:54.630 --> 04:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
need to
 
04:28:57.710 --> 04:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
protect so um so our Hatchery building
 
04:28:59.469 --> 04:28:59.479 align:start position:0%
would be a brand new facility it would
 
04:29:03.349 --> 04:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
be 100% enclosed this would be where our
 
04:29:06.990 --> 04:29:07.000 align:start position:0%
eggs and um Hatchery uh brood fish would
 
04:29:09.349 --> 04:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
be and then we would have the
 
04:29:11.710 --> 04:29:11.720 align:start position:0%
intermediate rearing which would be the
 
04:29:14.429 --> 04:29:14.439 align:start position:0%
level where um we have growout so that
 
04:29:17.149 --> 04:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
small fish you know 3 in grow to the
 
04:29:20.309 --> 04:29:20.319 align:start position:0%
next level and then our massive growout
 
04:29:23.429 --> 04:29:23.439 align:start position:0%
would be a um netting or fabric type
 
04:29:25.149 --> 04:29:25.159 align:start position:0%
structure that would go over so you
 
04:29:27.550 --> 04:29:27.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily need enclosed steel
 
04:29:29.389 --> 04:29:29.399 align:start position:0%
structures for everything as much as I'd
 
04:29:31.950 --> 04:29:31.960 align:start position:0%
love that but you may not necessarily
 
04:29:34.149 --> 04:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
need it um but you definitely need that
 
04:29:36.830 --> 04:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
cover and that protection from
 
04:29:38.830 --> 04:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
Predators just give you a 4-minute
 
04:29:42.229 --> 04:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
warning yep so Raz just real quick this
 
04:29:44.189 --> 04:29:44.199 align:start position:0%
is a very simple thing you can look at
 
04:29:46.389 --> 04:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
it it just goes through like I said it
 
04:29:48.229 --> 04:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
gives you opportunity for ultra
 
04:29:51.149 --> 04:29:51.159 align:start position:0%
filtration it gives you UV oxygen
 
04:29:54.070 --> 04:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
control uh pH you can change all sorts
 
04:29:57.510 --> 04:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
of things temperature all helping you um
 
04:30:01.189 --> 04:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
rid bacteria and um Disease Control as
 
04:30:04.429 --> 04:30:04.439 align:start position:0%
well as U maximizing your growth so
 
04:30:06.950 --> 04:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
bunch of that image with the big large
 
04:30:09.309 --> 04:30:09.319 align:start position:0%
blue cover and gray that's just to give
 
04:30:11.550 --> 04:30:11.560 align:start position:0%
you an idea that's a drum filter they're
 
04:30:13.710 --> 04:30:13.720 align:start position:0%
tremendous and you would have multiple
 
04:30:16.189 --> 04:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
levels of areas where drum filters would
 
04:30:18.630 --> 04:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
be and the Raz system would be in the
 
04:30:20.229 --> 04:30:20.239 align:start position:0%
intermediate building as well as the
 
04:30:22.030 --> 04:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
growout it would not be in the Hatchery
 
04:30:23.750 --> 04:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
building at this
 
04:30:26.469 --> 04:30:26.479 align:start position:0%
point um now the bad part where
 
04:30:28.070 --> 04:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
everybody looks at the cost and
 
04:30:31.630 --> 04:30:31.640 align:start position:0%
everybody freaks out and so um just very
 
04:30:34.870 --> 04:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
quickly looking at this the um cost
 
04:30:38.469 --> 04:30:38.479 align:start position:0%
portion so so HDR has estimated of 47
 
04:30:42.550 --> 04:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
million uh 700,000 cost to this in that
 
04:30:45.429 --> 04:30:45.439 align:start position:0%
is the construction manager piece and um
 
04:30:46.950 --> 04:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
construction manager were doing it a
 
04:30:48.389 --> 04:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
little bit different this time instead
 
04:30:50.189 --> 04:30:50.199 align:start position:0%
of doing just this design by the
 
04:30:52.269 --> 04:30:52.279 align:start position:0%
engineers and then putting the whole
 
04:30:54.830 --> 04:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
thing out to bid and going through the
 
04:30:56.630 --> 04:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
construction Etc we're doing a
 
04:30:59.189 --> 04:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
construction manager at risk based on um
 
04:31:00.510 --> 04:31:00.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Public Works
 
04:31:02.189 --> 04:31:02.199 align:start position:0%
recommendation in order to meet the
 
04:31:04.830 --> 04:31:04.840 align:start position:0%
timeline the construction manager at RIS
 
04:31:07.590 --> 04:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
will work sign simultaneously with the
 
04:31:10.670 --> 04:31:10.680 align:start position:0%
engineers so that the designing process
 
04:31:13.309 --> 04:31:13.319 align:start position:0%
happens the material can be chosen the
 
04:31:16.510 --> 04:31:16.520 align:start position:0%
material can be pre-bought so this
 
04:31:18.510 --> 04:31:18.520 align:start position:0%
enables us to meet those deadlines to
 
04:31:20.710 --> 04:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
encumber the money by December
 
04:31:24.269 --> 04:31:24.279 align:start position:0%
2024 and also look at um so everything's
 
04:31:26.510 --> 04:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
ready we won't have supply chain issues
 
04:31:28.790 --> 04:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
because we can pre-order the large items
 
04:31:30.710 --> 04:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
that we need and be ready for
 
04:31:33.750 --> 04:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
construction when the time comes um and
 
04:31:37.189 --> 04:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
then just you one second just pardon me
 
04:31:39.229 --> 04:31:39.239 align:start position:0%
do you remember how much we passed uh
 
04:31:41.429 --> 04:31:41.439 align:start position:0%
some six or so years ago for this study
 
04:31:44.030 --> 04:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
and for for finding out what we have to
 
04:31:45.710 --> 04:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
do to remediate do you know what the
 
04:31:48.750 --> 04:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
funding was director why don't you go
 
04:31:50.389 --> 04:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
ahead and get near the microphone so we
 
04:31:52.710 --> 04:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
can people on the on the online can hear
 
04:31:54.710 --> 04:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
what you're saying that's fine you stay
 
04:31:57.309 --> 04:31:57.319 align:start position:0%
sit Diane I'll just I'll look over you
 
04:31:58.590 --> 04:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
lean on my should yeah so as long as
 
04:31:59.990 --> 04:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
you're close to it so we can have people
 
04:32:03.990 --> 04:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
here um so we originally received 4.6
 
04:32:06.389 --> 04:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
million in capital budget
 
04:32:09.550 --> 04:32:09.560 align:start position:0%
um when the original estimates we the
 
04:32:11.630 --> 04:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
original estimate was 4.6 Million by the
 
04:32:13.189 --> 04:32:13.199 align:start position:0%
time we got to the capital budget
 
04:32:15.109 --> 04:32:15.119 align:start position:0%
committee it had gone up to
 
04:32:17.630 --> 04:32:17.640 align:start position:0%
5.2 um but what we ended up doing
 
04:32:20.469 --> 04:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
instead is we received a million dollar
 
04:32:23.149 --> 04:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
in a go for Grant through Dees to do a
 
04:32:25.670 --> 04:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
feasibility study now earlier today you
 
04:32:28.389 --> 04:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
heard about uh the committee that when I
 
04:32:30.070 --> 04:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
came in as director I put together a
 
04:32:31.349 --> 04:32:31.359 align:start position:0%
committee the governor appointed a
 
04:32:33.030 --> 04:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
special committee to study the issue
 
04:32:35.030 --> 04:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
that was step one step two was this
 
04:32:38.109 --> 04:32:38.119 align:start position:0%
million feasibility study that
 
04:32:38.119 --> 04:32:39.469 align:start position:0%
million feasibility study that
feasibility

04:32:39.469 --> 04:32:39.479 align:start position:0%
feasibility
 
04:32:42.590 --> 04:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
study that's what Diane was referencing
 
04:32:44.269 --> 04:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
when she said that they came up with hey
 
04:32:46.030 --> 04:32:46.040 align:start position:0%
this going to cost probably $60 million
 
04:32:47.870 --> 04:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
and oh by the way you may not be able to
 
04:32:50.229 --> 04:32:50.239 align:start position:0%
meet 12 parts per billion every month at
 
04:32:52.590 --> 04:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
which point we had to take a harder look
 
04:32:54.590 --> 04:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
at the system and that's where we
 
04:32:57.469 --> 04:32:57.479 align:start position:0%
decided to to move into um New Hampton
 
04:32:59.510 --> 04:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
instead of New Durham for the complete
 
04:33:01.870 --> 04:33:01.880 align:start position:0%
rebuild okay we'd like to maintain the
 
04:33:04.150 --> 04:33:04.160 align:start position:0%
hatchery in New Durham uh at a much
 
04:33:05.869 --> 04:33:05.879 align:start position:0%
smaller rate at that 30,00 000 we
 
04:33:07.390 --> 04:33:07.400 align:start position:0%
believe we can meet the 12 part per
 
04:33:10.750 --> 04:33:10.760 align:start position:0%
billion but the the the the volume and
 
04:33:12.910 --> 04:33:12.920 align:start position:0%
the quality of the water in in at the
 
04:33:14.629 --> 04:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
new Durham Hatchery is wonderful and we
 
04:33:16.990 --> 04:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
rather not lose that well since this is
 
04:33:18.750 --> 04:33:18.760 align:start position:0%
a policy committee and not a funding
 
04:33:21.150 --> 04:33:21.160 align:start position:0%
committee I'm going to leave it at that
 
04:33:23.670 --> 04:33:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh but I hope we can find the funding
 
04:33:26.990 --> 04:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
for it because the policy is
 
04:33:31.429 --> 04:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
sound good okay um thank you director
 
04:33:33.709 --> 04:33:33.719 align:start position:0%
and and let's continue and and get back
 
04:33:36.349 --> 04:33:36.359 align:start position:0%
on track Y no and so yeah the
 
04:33:39.310 --> 04:33:39.320 align:start position:0%
construction manager just to just to tie
 
04:33:41.830 --> 04:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
that in so the it enables us to work
 
04:33:45.429 --> 04:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
directly have best estimates and best um
 
04:33:49.189 --> 04:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
use in the design process as well as um
 
04:33:51.269 --> 04:33:51.279 align:start position:0%
enable us to be fiscally responsible
 
04:33:52.949 --> 04:33:52.959 align:start position:0%
because we're going to be able to talk
 
04:33:55.429 --> 04:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
about pricing and materials and also
 
04:33:58.670 --> 04:33:58.680 align:start position:0%
meet that supply chain um not worry
 
04:34:00.551 --> 04:34:00.561 align:start position:0%
about the supply chain issue because we
 
04:34:02.109 --> 04:34:02.119 align:start position:0%
can be talking things through in our
 
04:34:04.429 --> 04:34:04.439 align:start position:0%
design so just just all around the board
 
04:34:07.070 --> 04:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
enables us to be in a much better place
 
04:34:10.390 --> 04:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
doing that um construction manager piece
 
04:34:15.070 --> 04:34:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:17.949 --> 04:34:17.959 align:start position:0%
design and then just some critical dates
 
04:34:20.551 --> 04:34:20.561 align:start position:0%
and the um critical dates are February
 
04:34:23.629 --> 04:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
that can this month we will be uh well
 
04:34:26.429 --> 04:34:26.439 align:start position:0%
not we Department of Public Works will
 
04:34:29.390 --> 04:34:29.400 align:start position:0%
be um releasing the RFQ for the
 
04:34:32.670 --> 04:34:32.680 align:start position:0%
construction manager and then um in May
 
04:34:34.789 --> 04:34:34.799 align:start position:0%
we'll be looking at getting that
 
04:34:36.910 --> 04:34:36.920 align:start position:0%
information back from those folks that
 
04:34:39.551 --> 04:34:39.561 align:start position:0%
did apply looking at the guaranteed
 
04:34:41.910 --> 04:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
maximum price and a bidding for the
 
04:34:44.750 --> 04:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
design at that point that um HDR will
 
04:34:48.429 --> 04:34:48.439 align:start position:0%
have solidified and then uh August we
 
04:34:51.230 --> 04:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
will have the GNC approval and at that
 
04:34:54.349 --> 04:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
point the notice to proceed and um
 
04:34:56.590 --> 04:34:56.600 align:start position:0%
really be able to move forward with this
 
04:34:58.429 --> 04:34:58.439 align:start position:0%
effort and then
 
04:35:02.709 --> 04:35:02.719 align:start position:0%
2025 um have our construction start and
 
04:35:04.830 --> 04:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
um obviously in those time periods
 
04:35:06.830 --> 04:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
during construction I think it's
 
04:35:09.150 --> 04:35:09.160 align:start position:0%
important to note that obviously there
 
04:35:12.390 --> 04:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
will be a reduction in fish because I
 
04:35:14.949 --> 04:35:14.959 align:start position:0%
will have no place to put them so my
 
04:35:17.150 --> 04:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
facilities are completely maxed at this
 
04:35:21.429 --> 04:35:21.439 align:start position:0%
point and um at the end of 2025 we will
 
04:35:24.230 --> 04:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
be 100% compliant at Powder Mill so I
 
04:35:28.189 --> 04:35:28.199 align:start position:0%
can only have that 30% there and then um
 
04:35:30.189 --> 04:35:30.199 align:start position:0%
our other facilities will be maxed so
 
04:35:32.910 --> 04:35:32.920 align:start position:0%
there will be a reduction um during the
 
04:35:36.230 --> 04:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
construction phase for sure but then in
 
04:35:39.670 --> 04:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
2026 after we you know get everything
 
04:35:41.990 --> 04:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
done and be able to start working
 
04:35:44.029 --> 04:35:44.039 align:start position:0%
through the process and trainings and
 
04:35:46.150 --> 04:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
whatnot um we'll be able to hopefully
 
04:35:47.750 --> 04:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
get things back on
 
04:35:50.789 --> 04:35:50.799 align:start position:0%
schedule okay I have one question um
 
04:35:54.709 --> 04:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
sure do we have a federal EPA deadline
 
04:35:57.990 --> 04:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
for our PPM coming out of our Fisheries
 
04:36:02.070 --> 04:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
um that's been enforced on us or are we
 
04:36:05.310 --> 04:36:05.320 align:start position:0%
good with these dates and are are we
 
04:36:08.470 --> 04:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
going to be reducing the the uh fish
 
04:36:10.910 --> 04:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
held at the Powder Mill in the meantime
 
04:36:12.789 --> 04:36:12.799 align:start position:0%
as we're working towards this or are we
 
04:36:14.949 --> 04:36:14.959 align:start position:0%
going to stay at full blast with the
 
04:36:17.230 --> 04:36:17.240 align:start position:0%
full outflow and the parts per million
 
04:36:19.150 --> 04:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
right up until we open the new
 
04:36:22.510 --> 04:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
facility so the NEP permit is set at 12
 
04:36:25.949 --> 04:36:25.959 align:start position:0%
parts per billion at new at New Durham
 
04:36:28.269 --> 04:36:28.279 align:start position:0%
and so basically we have two hatcheries
 
04:36:30.789 --> 04:36:30.799 align:start position:0%
that have single site nepes permits one
 
04:36:32.390 --> 04:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
is New Durham and the other one is
 
04:36:34.390 --> 04:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
Berlin the other four hatcheries come
 
04:36:37.230 --> 04:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
under a general nepy's permit um and I
 
04:36:38.789 --> 04:36:38.799 align:start position:0%
believe we have no limit on those four
 
04:36:41.029 --> 04:36:41.039 align:start position:0%
correct correct all right so the only
 
04:36:43.269 --> 04:36:43.279 align:start position:0%
two and we have no limit yet that it
 
04:36:46.429 --> 04:36:46.439 align:start position:0%
hasn't been set yet at Berlin we we were
 
04:36:48.070 --> 04:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
told they we're going to have the uh
 
04:36:50.789 --> 04:36:50.799 align:start position:0%
we're in the rep permitting process at
 
04:36:52.470 --> 04:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
burlin we were told they're going to be
 
04:36:54.470 --> 04:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
done by October and they're still
 
04:36:56.551 --> 04:36:56.561 align:start position:0%
working on it so I would be assuming
 
04:36:58.150 --> 04:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
that we would be seeing something within
 
04:37:00.830 --> 04:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
this calendar year from EPA as far as
 
04:37:02.670 --> 04:37:02.680 align:start position:0%
setting a limit at
 
04:37:06.109 --> 04:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
Berlin yeah thank you and thank you for
 
04:37:08.390 --> 04:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
your presentation today just to add one
 
04:37:10.830 --> 04:37:10.840 align:start position:0%
part to that so the December
 
04:37:14.150 --> 04:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
2025 is the time period that we have to
 
04:37:17.709 --> 04:37:17.719 align:start position:0%
meet new Durham's permit that's that one
 
04:37:20.189 --> 04:37:20.199 align:start position:0%
does have a date that's good to know so
 
04:37:21.750 --> 04:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
we're right up against the deadline on
 
04:37:24.551 --> 04:37:24.561 align:start position:0%
that yeah and we we will be making
 
04:37:26.629 --> 04:37:26.639 align:start position:0%
changes this year to our stocking to
 
04:37:29.390 --> 04:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
reflect that okay thank you anybody have
 
04:37:31.869 --> 04:37:31.879 align:start position:0%
any other questions before we move on
 
04:37:34.510 --> 04:37:34.520 align:start position:0%
rep Smith thank you Mr chairman real
 
04:37:36.590 --> 04:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
quick sure how many year facilities is
 
04:37:39.189 --> 04:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
this a 50-year facility 75 what's the
 
04:37:40.869 --> 04:37:40.879 align:start position:0%
pro so we have four facilities that are
 
04:37:43.470 --> 04:37:43.480 align:start position:0%
over 100 one that's over 75 and the
 
04:37:47.070 --> 04:37:47.080 align:start position:0%
other that's 53 so follow up yep it was
 
04:37:48.470 --> 04:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
no the new facility that's going to be
 
04:37:50.990 --> 04:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
built is there what's the expected
 
04:37:52.429 --> 04:37:52.439 align:start position:0%
longevity of the new facility that's
 
04:37:54.629 --> 04:37:54.639 align:start position:0%
going to be built we haven't asked for
 
04:37:57.789 --> 04:37:57.799 align:start position:0%
an expected longevity uh with the
 
04:38:00.590 --> 04:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
mechanical comp complications in the new
 
04:38:02.830 --> 04:38:02.840 align:start position:0%
facility versus the old ones I would be
 
04:38:05.269 --> 04:38:05.279 align:start position:0%
thinking you'd be having to have some
 
04:38:08.070 --> 04:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
major reinvestment in probably the 30e
 
04:38:10.109 --> 04:38:10.119 align:start position:0%
mark because of all the pumps and
 
04:38:11.590 --> 04:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
whatnot it'll be in the new consider it
 
04:38:11.600 --> 04:38:13.789 align:start position:0%
whatnot it'll be in the new consider it
a

04:38:13.789 --> 04:38:13.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:16.429 --> 04:38:16.439 align:start position:0%
roof not a steel
 
04:38:19.789 --> 04:38:19.799 align:start position:0%
roof any other questions representative
 
04:38:21.869 --> 04:38:21.879 align:start position:0%
kofalt thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:38:23.830 --> 04:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I'm looking
 
04:38:25.750 --> 04:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
at the budget and I'm seeing a
 
04:38:27.429 --> 04:38:27.439 align:start position:0%
contingency of
 
04:38:31.510 --> 04:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
44% um this is sort of bottom right the
 
04:38:33.070 --> 04:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
the 12 million
 
04:38:35.910 --> 04:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
12,390 and then jump down a couple of
 
04:38:38.390 --> 04:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
lines some Market volatility adjustment
 
04:38:40.269 --> 04:38:40.279 align:start position:0%
and escalation to midpoint which sound
 
04:38:40.279 --> 04:38:41.269 align:start position:0%
and escalation to midpoint which sound
like

04:38:41.269 --> 04:38:41.279 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:38:44.109 --> 04:38:44.119 align:start position:0%
other other varieties of contingency
 
04:38:46.109 --> 04:38:46.119 align:start position:0%
I've never seen a construction budget
 
04:38:47.949 --> 04:38:47.959 align:start position:0%
with contingency numbers that high can
 
04:38:50.189 --> 04:38:50.199 align:start position:0%
you just give us a quick explanation of
 
04:38:52.390 --> 04:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
why we're seeing that so first of all um
 
04:38:54.029 --> 04:38:54.039 align:start position:0%
you got to understand we are still in
 
04:38:57.789 --> 04:38:57.799 align:start position:0%
the design phase so when an engineer
 
04:39:00.551 --> 04:39:00.561 align:start position:0%
engineering firm has 10% of the design
 
04:39:05.109 --> 04:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
phase done your contingency dollars is
 
04:39:07.189 --> 04:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
much greater as the design gets more and
 
04:39:09.869 --> 04:39:09.879 align:start position:0%
more completed then the contingency
 
04:39:11.429 --> 04:39:11.439 align:start position:0%
they'll know more and more and then the
 
04:39:14.349 --> 04:39:14.359 align:start position:0%
contingency drop drops quite often the
 
04:39:17.269 --> 04:39:17.279 align:start position:0%
budget goes up as as more of this stuff
 
04:39:19.510 --> 04:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
gets flushed out the other issue we're
 
04:39:21.750 --> 04:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
facing and I think you you folks here
 
04:39:23.429 --> 04:39:23.439 align:start position:0%
have seen it some of the other state
 
04:39:24.869 --> 04:39:24.879 align:start position:0%
projects as we are in probably one of
 
04:39:27.070 --> 04:39:27.080 align:start position:0%
the highest construction inflationary
 
04:39:29.429 --> 04:39:29.439 align:start position:0%
periods that we've ever been in um there
 
04:39:31.150 --> 04:39:31.160 align:start position:0%
was a bridge not too long ago that the
 
04:39:33.070 --> 04:39:33.080 align:start position:0%
estimate was 40 million and the only bid
 
04:39:34.470 --> 04:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
came back at I think close to $80
 
04:39:37.310 --> 04:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
million to build so yes there is quite a
 
04:39:40.430 --> 04:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
bit of float in here um but we are you
 
04:39:42.150 --> 04:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
know first of all we won't waste money
 
04:39:44.948 --> 04:39:44.958 align:start position:0%
secondly um we believe we can get it
 
04:39:47.868 --> 04:39:47.878 align:start position:0%
done you thank you any further questions
 
04:39:51.070 --> 04:39:51.080 align:start position:0%
before we let rep representative
 
04:39:52.830 --> 04:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
ulette thank you and thank you for
 
04:39:56.310 --> 04:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh 55 million how are
 
04:39:58.510 --> 04:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
we paying for that this is all go for
 
04:40:01.750 --> 04:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
money okay uh when um when I first came
 
04:40:05.390 --> 04:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
on as director um we met with the
 
04:40:07.708 --> 04:40:07.718 align:start position:0%
governor and he identified this as one
 
04:40:09.510 --> 04:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
of the the issues that he wanted to
 
04:40:12.550 --> 04:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
solve for the state and uh as Diane
 
04:40:14.830 --> 04:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier in our testimony today
 
04:40:15.990 --> 04:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
what is it I can't remember the number
 
04:40:17.990 --> 04:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's $4 billion dollars of tourist
 
04:40:19.990 --> 04:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
dollars are spent in angling in New
 
04:40:23.070 --> 04:40:23.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I fudging 1.4 billion yeah
 
04:40:26.070 --> 04:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
so it's a huge amount and um so it is
 
04:40:28.390 --> 04:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
important to tourism um it's one of the
 
04:40:30.070 --> 04:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
things you know when families are trying
 
04:40:33.628 --> 04:40:33.638 align:start position:0%
to make up their mind where they go um
 
04:40:35.190 --> 04:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
you know maybe more families are willing
 
04:40:36.830 --> 04:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
to go to Story Land because Dad can get
 
04:40:38.788 --> 04:40:38.798 align:start position:0%
an afternoon off to go trout fishing you
 
04:40:40.390 --> 04:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
know that kind of stuff or you know
 
04:40:42.868 --> 04:40:42.878 align:start position:0%
whatever the Dynamics are um it's it's
 
04:40:44.350 --> 04:40:44.360 align:start position:0%
just one of those things it's not
 
04:40:46.590 --> 04:40:46.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily a standalone event but it is
 
04:40:48.430 --> 04:40:48.440 align:start position:0%
certainly something that you know
 
04:40:50.430 --> 04:40:50.440 align:start position:0%
families do make decisions to come here
 
04:40:52.590 --> 04:40:52.600 align:start position:0%
for yeah and if I could add the other
 
04:40:55.110 --> 04:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
part key part here is that the water
 
04:40:58.190 --> 04:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
quality at the end of the day is so much
 
04:41:00.868 --> 04:41:00.878 align:start position:0%
better in these Raz facilities than they
 
04:41:05.150 --> 04:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
currently are in ours so as um things
 
04:41:06.948 --> 04:41:06.958 align:start position:0%
happen in our Hatchery currently it
 
04:41:08.788 --> 04:41:08.798 align:start position:0%
starts at the top and it literally flows
 
04:41:10.708 --> 04:41:10.718 align:start position:0%
through to the bottom and so now you'll
 
04:41:12.868 --> 04:41:12.878 align:start position:0%
have that filtration you'll be able to
 
04:41:15.030 --> 04:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
use less water in the recirculating
 
04:41:17.390 --> 04:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
system so your treatment everything is
 
04:41:19.510 --> 04:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
just much much better water quality wise
 
04:41:21.510 --> 04:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
our discharge is actually going to be
 
04:41:25.670 --> 04:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
better than it currently is so thank you
 
04:41:27.430 --> 04:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
any further
 
04:41:29.628 --> 04:41:29.638 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
04:41:29.638 --> 04:41:31.350 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
presentation

04:41:31.350 --> 04:41:31.360 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
04:41:34.670 --> 04:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
today I will now reopen the hearing on
 
04:41:39.708 --> 04:41:39.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:42.628 --> 04:41:42.638 align:start position:0%
1100 if we can wheel the television out
 
04:41:44.550 --> 04:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
to the side so that the audience can see
 
04:41:47.590 --> 04:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
what's going on I'm going to call Kurt
 
04:41:51.070 --> 04:41:51.080 align:start position:0%
erenberg from the Humane
 
04:41:53.708 --> 04:41:53.718 align:start position:0%
Society Kurt you have written
 
04:41:55.948 --> 04:41:55.958 align:start position:0%
testimony so pass it out and please
 
04:41:58.590 --> 04:41:58.600 align:start position:0%
don't read from it you've asked for four
 
04:42:02.550 --> 04:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:05.310 --> 04:42:05.320 align:start position:0%
three and don't repeat your any previous
 
04:42:06.910 --> 04:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
testimony if you've heard it already
 
04:42:08.350 --> 04:42:08.360 align:start position:0%
please don't repeat it we already heard
 
04:42:10.470 --> 04:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
it thank you Mr
 
04:42:13.670 --> 04:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
chairman Vice chairman goalie members of
 
04:42:15.270 --> 04:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm Kurt aronburg I'm of
 
04:42:17.310 --> 04:42:17.320 align:start position:0%
the Humane Society of the United States
 
04:42:19.868 --> 04:42:19.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire state director appreciate
 
04:42:23.350 --> 04:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
the time I will be brief
 
04:42:26.550 --> 04:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
um there is WR written testimony I don't
 
04:42:28.310 --> 04:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
have it on paper I did submit it
 
04:42:30.990 --> 04:42:31.000 align:start position:0%
electronically so I hope that can be
 
04:42:31.000 --> 04:42:32.628 align:start position:0%
electronically so I hope that can be
distributed

04:42:32.628 --> 04:42:32.638 align:start position:0%
distributed
 
04:42:34.948 --> 04:42:34.958 align:start position:0%
um I think this committee is is in a
 
04:42:38.830 --> 04:42:38.840 align:start position:0%
position today to be reasonable in the
 
04:42:41.830 --> 04:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
face of unreasonable cruelty which takes
 
04:42:44.750 --> 04:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
place every spring in this state with
 
04:42:48.708 --> 04:42:48.718 align:start position:0%
the killing of coyote mothers of pups
 
04:42:49.708 --> 04:42:49.718 align:start position:0%
that then
 
04:42:52.750 --> 04:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
suffer unnecessarily there's no
 
04:42:54.430 --> 04:42:54.440 align:start position:0%
scientific reason for this I think
 
04:42:56.550 --> 04:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
you'll hear this from others I would
 
04:42:59.390 --> 04:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
just point out that the New Hampshire
 
04:43:02.310 --> 04:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game department pointed out
 
04:43:05.670 --> 04:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
itself that year round indiscriminate
 
04:43:07.948 --> 04:43:07.958 align:start position:0%
killing of coyotes will not reduce their
 
04:43:10.510 --> 04:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
populations in fact it encourages more
 
04:43:13.270 --> 04:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
breeding and migration into the depleted
 
04:43:15.830 --> 04:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
area and ultimately results in more
 
04:43:17.788 --> 04:43:17.798 align:start position:0%
coyotes that's from the New Hampshire
 
04:43:19.910 --> 04:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
fishing game department I have the
 
04:43:22.990 --> 04:43:23.000 align:start position:0%
citation if you need it and I'm
 
04:43:25.990 --> 04:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
done well thank you that was a minute
 
04:43:28.510 --> 04:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
and 15 I maybe I won't hold people till
 
04:43:30.230 --> 04:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
more than a minute in the
 
04:43:33.470 --> 04:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
future uh are there any questions for
 
04:43:36.910 --> 04:43:36.920 align:start position:0%
Kurt representative Darby and let me
 
04:43:38.470 --> 04:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
remind representative Reed she's allowed
 
04:43:40.830 --> 04:43:40.840 align:start position:0%
to take her seat she just can't start
 
04:43:43.350 --> 04:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
with the questions okay I just didn't
 
04:43:45.868 --> 04:43:45.878 align:start position:0%
want you standing for no reason uh after
 
04:43:47.628 --> 04:43:47.638 align:start position:0%
presenting a bill we are allowed to go
 
04:43:49.030 --> 04:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
back to our seat we just cannot
 
04:43:51.628 --> 04:43:51.638 align:start position:0%
participate in the questioning uh so
 
04:43:53.628 --> 04:43:53.638 align:start position:0%
representative Darby the floor is yours
 
04:43:55.310 --> 04:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair uh thank you for
 
04:43:57.510 --> 04:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question just very briefly um
 
04:43:59.510 --> 04:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
you said that you had the reference um
 
04:44:01.628 --> 04:44:01.638 align:start position:0%
did you include that in your on in the
 
04:44:05.470 --> 04:44:05.480 align:start position:0%
testimony you submitted yes thank you
 
04:44:07.708 --> 04:44:07.718 align:start position:0%
representative Brown uh thank you Mr
 
04:44:09.510 --> 04:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking my
 
04:44:13.628 --> 04:44:13.638 align:start position:0%
question so I've heard that the pup
 
04:44:15.948 --> 04:44:15.958 align:start position:0%
season that's not true that the pups are
 
04:44:18.350 --> 04:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
only managed by the parents for two
 
04:44:20.990 --> 04:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
weeks and then they're out on their own
 
04:44:23.750 --> 04:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
and so if what you're saying about
 
04:44:25.788 --> 04:44:25.798 align:start position:0%
having the hunting season dur during the
 
04:44:30.670 --> 04:44:30.680 align:start position:0%
pup season will impact that the
 
04:44:33.590 --> 04:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
population is it a a two-e window or is
 
04:44:36.110 --> 04:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
it a larger window is that an accurate
 
04:44:37.590 --> 04:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
assessment that it's really only two
 
04:44:38.990 --> 04:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
weeks and the pups are able to survive
 
04:44:40.550 --> 04:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
on their
 
04:44:43.190 --> 04:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
own you know I could answer that but I
 
04:44:44.310 --> 04:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
think there are people here more
 
04:44:46.150 --> 04:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
qualified to answer that and I think
 
04:44:47.868 --> 04:44:47.878 align:start position:0%
that there are people from Vis and game
 
04:44:49.708 --> 04:44:49.718 align:start position:0%
that could probably answer that thank
 
04:44:52.350 --> 04:44:52.360 align:start position:0%
you uh but they did they you know the
 
04:44:55.190 --> 04:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
citation I think you should look it up
 
04:44:57.590 --> 04:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
again it's cruelty it's
 
04:45:00.430 --> 04:45:00.440 align:start position:0%
unnecessary thank you any further
 
04:45:02.510 --> 04:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
04:45:05.750 --> 04:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
testimony today
 
04:45:08.628 --> 04:45:08.638 align:start position:0%
the chair will now recognize Fred
 
04:45:10.390 --> 04:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
bird from
 
04:45:13.830 --> 04:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
CSF that's the Congressional Sportsman
 
04:45:16.868 --> 04:45:16.878 align:start position:0%
foundation and uh you got three minutes
 
04:45:18.788 --> 04:45:18.798 align:start position:0%
very good thank you Mr chairman uh
 
04:45:20.510 --> 04:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee uh
 
04:45:22.470 --> 04:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
good afternoon once again uh I'm going
 
04:45:24.750 --> 04:45:24.760 align:start position:0%
to try to hopefully take the emotion out
 
04:45:27.070 --> 04:45:27.080 align:start position:0%
of what is a very emotional conversation
 
04:45:29.910 --> 04:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
for both sides and CSF has opposed this
 
04:45:31.670 --> 04:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
bill for the simple fact that the
 
04:45:34.070 --> 04:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
rulemaking authority should be staying
 
04:45:35.708 --> 04:45:35.718 align:start position:0%
with with the The Fishing Game
 
04:45:39.270 --> 04:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
Commission and the department um that is
 
04:45:41.750 --> 04:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
our concern the removal of that rule and
 
04:45:43.390 --> 04:45:43.400 align:start position:0%
season setting authority of the
 
04:45:45.430 --> 04:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
department and seaing it instead of the
 
04:45:48.150 --> 04:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
legislator is problematic we have
 
04:45:49.628 --> 04:45:49.638 align:start position:0%
professionals at the department they're
 
04:45:51.230 --> 04:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
vetted they these people have gone
 
04:45:53.310 --> 04:45:53.320 align:start position:0%
through school on the management side
 
04:45:55.230 --> 04:45:55.240 align:start position:0%
law enforcement is vetted we got to
 
04:45:57.390 --> 04:45:57.400 align:start position:0%
trust the professionals over there on
 
04:46:01.628 --> 04:46:01.638 align:start position:0%
Hazen Drive um examples of this when our
 
04:46:04.270 --> 04:46:04.280 align:start position:0%
Fisher population was in trouble the
 
04:46:05.830 --> 04:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
Department adjusted That season they
 
04:46:08.550 --> 04:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
were able to do that in real time if we
 
04:46:12.230 --> 04:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
codify species specific season setting
 
04:46:14.708 --> 04:46:14.718 align:start position:0%
with laws here in this body it's going
 
04:46:16.550 --> 04:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
to be very cumbersome to go back and
 
04:46:18.430 --> 04:46:18.440 align:start position:0%
adjust as we move forward as the science
 
04:46:20.230 --> 04:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
changes I would agree with the bill
 
04:46:21.830 --> 04:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
sponsor that we should be trusting the
 
04:46:23.948 --> 04:46:23.958 align:start position:0%
science on the ground and as that
 
04:46:25.750 --> 04:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
changes allow the department and the
 
04:46:27.910 --> 04:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
commission to adjust uh we've done the
 
04:46:29.230 --> 04:46:29.240 align:start position:0%
same thing with deer seasons in the
 
04:46:30.990 --> 04:46:31.000 align:start position:0%
North Country we've adjusted the take
 
04:46:33.070 --> 04:46:33.080 align:start position:0%
and when that season is conversely in
 
04:46:35.510 --> 04:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
the South we've roduced M tags and L
 
04:46:39.150 --> 04:46:39.160 align:start position:0%
tags to balance that that uh herd size
 
04:46:40.830 --> 04:46:40.840 align:start position:0%
if the wildlife division Chief and the
 
04:46:43.030 --> 04:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
very capable and qualified fur bear
 
04:46:46.350 --> 04:46:46.360 align:start position:0%
biologists deem an adjustment in the
 
04:46:48.990 --> 04:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
coyote season is needed we should allow
 
04:46:50.430 --> 04:46:50.440 align:start position:0%
them to make that recommendation of the
 
04:46:52.628 --> 04:46:52.638 align:start position:0%
commissioning move forward from that
 
04:46:54.708 --> 04:46:54.718 align:start position:0%
that's all I have thank you so much
 
04:46:56.990 --> 04:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
thank you you open to questions yes sir
 
04:46:58.910 --> 04:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
please are there any
 
04:47:01.708 --> 04:47:01.718 align:start position:0%
questions representative Darby thank you
 
04:47:03.110 --> 04:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
04:47:07.110 --> 04:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
question um I I understand that
 
04:47:09.150 --> 04:47:09.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes um coyotes are hunted with
 
04:47:12.590 --> 04:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
dogs um can you describe um the process
 
04:47:13.910 --> 04:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
of hunting coyotes with dogs are you
 
04:47:15.830 --> 04:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
familiar with that I am I've never done
 
04:47:17.470 --> 04:47:17.480 align:start position:0%
it myself or participated it's a
 
04:47:20.510 --> 04:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
long-standing hounding tradition um
 
04:47:22.430 --> 04:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
probably done by a handful of folks in
 
04:47:23.628 --> 04:47:23.638 align:start position:0%
the state don't hold me to that because
 
04:47:25.910 --> 04:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
I don't actually have facts uh perhaps
 
04:47:28.030 --> 04:47:28.040 align:start position:0%
the the state can answer that for you
 
04:47:29.628 --> 04:47:29.638 align:start position:0%
but that might actually be a better
 
04:47:31.430 --> 04:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
question for fishing game because they
 
04:47:33.070 --> 04:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
would have those
 
04:47:33.080 --> 04:47:35.910 align:start position:0%
would have those
numbers

04:47:35.910 --> 04:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
04:47:38.310 --> 04:47:38.320 align:start position:0%
follow up um my my actual question was
 
04:47:41.230 --> 04:47:41.240 align:start position:0%
on the process of hunting with with uh
 
04:47:42.990 --> 04:47:43.000 align:start position:0%
dogs but if you think that would also be
 
04:47:45.270 --> 04:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
better then I can hold
 
04:47:48.270 --> 04:47:48.280 align:start position:0%
that well it's it's not part of the bill
 
04:47:50.830 --> 04:47:50.840 align:start position:0%
uh to hunt with dogs or without dogs but
 
04:47:53.990 --> 04:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
I mean peripherally it might be of
 
04:47:55.548 --> 04:47:55.558 align:start position:0%
interest and I would probably hold that
 
04:47:59.310 --> 04:47:59.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:02.070 --> 04:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
game uh any other
 
04:48:04.310 --> 04:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you so much
 
04:48:18.788 --> 04:48:18.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:22.390 --> 04:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
you the chair now recognizes Joan
 
04:48:25.230 --> 04:48:25.240 align:start position:0%
O'Brien representing herself supports
 
04:48:28.230 --> 04:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
the bill and you'll get three
 
04:48:30.990 --> 04:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you for coming in
 
04:48:33.548 --> 04:48:33.558 align:start position:0%
today we appreciate you making the TR
 
04:48:37.868 --> 04:48:37.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:40.190 --> 04:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
way please turn the mic on when it's red
 
04:48:41.628 --> 04:48:41.638 align:start position:0%
it's on thank you chair thank you
 
04:48:43.430 --> 04:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is Joan
 
04:48:46.350 --> 04:48:46.360 align:start position:0%
O'Brien I'm from Amherst I'm speaking in
 
04:48:48.990 --> 04:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
support of the bill I have attended a
 
04:48:51.230 --> 04:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
couple presentations by coyote expert
 
04:48:52.788 --> 04:48:52.798 align:start position:0%
Chris shadler who was behind me and
 
04:48:55.788 --> 04:48:55.798 align:start position:0%
testified so I I know a bit about um the
 
04:49:00.030 --> 04:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
coyotes from her knowledge and um what
 
04:49:02.910 --> 04:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
we don't realize is that most of us have
 
04:49:05.150 --> 04:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
coyotes around us all the time there's a
 
04:49:07.150 --> 04:49:07.160 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a a pack somewhere
 
04:49:09.510 --> 04:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
within the vicinity of your house
 
04:49:11.548 --> 04:49:11.558 align:start position:0%
because there's so many but how often do
 
04:49:14.470 --> 04:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
we actually see them they find ways to
 
04:49:16.350 --> 04:49:16.360 align:start position:0%
live among us and they're everywhere and
 
04:49:18.628 --> 04:49:18.638 align:start position:0%
if they're left to do it their own way
 
04:49:18.638 --> 04:49:21.510 align:start position:0%
if they're left to do it their own way
they're

04:49:21.510 --> 04:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:24.510 --> 04:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
managed uh the every year in this
 
04:49:28.030 --> 04:49:28.040 align:start position:0%
country people suffer from 4.5 million
 
04:49:31.910 --> 04:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
dog bites we hear about coyote attacks
 
04:49:34.310 --> 04:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
but the dog is a far greater threat to
 
04:49:38.628 --> 04:49:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:42.110 --> 04:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
coyotes and at the beginning of this
 
04:49:44.190 --> 04:49:44.200 align:start position:0%
hearing somebody mentioned how often
 
04:49:46.510 --> 04:49:46.520 align:start position:0%
this bill has come back to this
 
04:49:47.990 --> 04:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
committee and I think that just speaks
 
04:49:51.948 --> 04:49:51.958 align:start position:0%
to how important the issue is to us out
 
04:49:54.990 --> 04:49:55.000 align:start position:0%
there who care about wildlife and don't
 
04:49:57.350 --> 04:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
want these uncomfortable hunting methods
 
04:49:57.360 --> 04:49:58.990 align:start position:0%
want these uncomfortable hunting methods
to

04:49:58.990 --> 04:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:50:03.070 --> 04:50:03.080 align:start position:0%
continue and lastly I don't know how
 
04:50:07.190 --> 04:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:08.708 --> 04:50:08.718 align:start position:0%
I'll just tell you a quick personal
 
04:50:11.708 --> 04:50:11.718 align:start position:0%
story I live on land that backs up to
 
04:50:15.030 --> 04:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
conservation land and on a spring night
 
04:50:18.230 --> 04:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
shortly before dusk um I heard what I
 
04:50:20.470 --> 04:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
thought was the distress calls of a
 
04:50:22.430 --> 04:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
young animal in in the back of my
 
04:50:24.708 --> 04:50:24.718 align:start position:0%
property and so I grabbed my coat and I
 
04:50:27.030 --> 04:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
ran outside and I ran down to the woods
 
04:50:29.150 --> 04:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
tracking the sound of this crying animal
 
04:50:31.868 --> 04:50:31.878 align:start position:0%
to see if I could help and I arrived to
 
04:50:35.190 --> 04:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
find sitting on a log a speaker was um
 
04:50:37.470 --> 04:50:37.480 align:start position:0%
playing the sounds of like coyote pups
 
04:50:40.190 --> 04:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
in distress and I was like what am I
 
04:50:41.868 --> 04:50:41.878 align:start position:0%
looking at you know and then I looked to
 
04:50:43.510 --> 04:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
the right and I saw two Hunters up in a
 
04:50:45.350 --> 04:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
tree stand couple of young guys out on a
 
04:50:47.708 --> 04:50:47.718 align:start position:0%
Friday night just sitting there calling
 
04:50:49.270 --> 04:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
these coyotes and wanting to shoot them
 
04:50:54.110 --> 04:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:57.948 --> 04:50:57.958 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you for your time um I
 
04:51:00.510 --> 04:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
guess there's no questions
 
04:51:05.548 --> 04:51:05.558 align:start position:0%
um the chair now recognizes David
 
04:51:08.310 --> 04:51:08.320 align:start position:0%
mtor Min
 
04:51:11.030 --> 04:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
Minton I I got one diagonal line so I
 
04:51:12.788 --> 04:51:12.798 align:start position:0%
was trying to make the best of it my
 
04:51:14.430 --> 04:51:14.440 align:start position:0%
handwriting is great that's all right
 
04:51:16.150 --> 04:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
you support the bill you'll get uh three
 
04:51:17.708 --> 04:51:17.718 align:start position:0%
minutes but you've asked for two so you
 
04:51:19.310 --> 04:51:19.320 align:start position:0%
get a
 
04:51:24.270 --> 04:51:24.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:27.788 --> 04:51:27.798 align:start position:0%
David my name is David Minon and I'm a
 
04:51:30.390 --> 04:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
Hunter and I have lived and hunted in
 
04:51:32.750 --> 04:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for over 52
 
04:51:35.750 --> 04:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
years during the past decades we have
 
04:51:39.868 --> 04:51:39.878 align:start position:0%
all seen the loss of biodiversity in our
 
04:51:39.878 --> 04:51:41.070 align:start position:0%
all seen the loss of biodiversity in our
natural

04:51:41.070 --> 04:51:41.080 align:start position:0%
natural
 
04:51:45.670 --> 04:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
world more flora fauna wildlife of All
 
04:51:48.590 --> 04:51:48.600 align:start position:0%
Sorts is becoming endangered or extinct
 
04:51:51.670 --> 04:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
every year and extinctions are on the
 
04:51:54.030 --> 04:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
rise 21
 
04:51:57.270 --> 04:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
species were declared officially extinct
 
04:51:59.628 --> 04:51:59.638 align:start position:0%
in the United States last
 
04:52:03.350 --> 04:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
year so why are we making it ever more
 
04:52:08.270 --> 04:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
difficult for wildlife to coexist with
 
04:52:11.310 --> 04:52:11.320 align:start position:0%
humans biological diversity in an
 
04:52:13.788 --> 04:52:13.798 align:start position:0%
environment as indicated by a large
 
04:52:17.070 --> 04:52:17.080 align:start position:0%
number of different species of plants of
 
04:52:20.470 --> 04:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
animals is what we as a society should
 
04:52:20.480 --> 04:52:21.430 align:start position:0%
animals is what we as a society should
strive

04:52:21.430 --> 04:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
strive
 
04:52:25.548 --> 04:52:25.558 align:start position:0%
for it is our responsibility as humans
 
04:52:27.270 --> 04:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
to see that we
 
04:52:30.110 --> 04:52:30.120 align:start position:0%
share what little Wilderness we have
 
04:52:32.708 --> 04:52:32.718 align:start position:0%
left on this planet with the wildlife
 
04:52:36.150 --> 04:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
that we stole most of the Wilderness
 
04:52:38.750 --> 04:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
from I personally
 
04:52:41.788 --> 04:52:41.798 align:start position:0%
believe it is a plus that coyotes are
 
04:52:43.910 --> 04:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
around and came into our environment
 
04:52:46.708 --> 04:52:46.718 align:start position:0%
through natural means in New Hampshire
 
04:52:49.270 --> 04:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
we have lost all of our major predators
 
04:52:51.788 --> 04:52:51.798 align:start position:0%
and coyotes are filling the niche after
 
04:52:54.350 --> 04:52:54.360 align:start position:0%
our forefathers wiped out the wolf the
 
04:52:57.670 --> 04:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
mountain lion and other top predators we
 
04:53:00.310 --> 04:53:00.320 align:start position:0%
need a wild Predator to make the system
 
04:53:03.230 --> 04:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
function in the way it was supposed to
 
04:53:06.070 --> 04:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
we need biological diversity for a
 
04:53:07.948 --> 04:53:07.958 align:start position:0%
natural system to
 
04:53:10.270 --> 04:53:10.280 align:start position:0%
function and don't try to convince the
 
04:53:12.190 --> 04:53:12.200 align:start position:0%
public that coyotes are decimating the
 
04:53:14.868 --> 04:53:14.878 align:start position:0%
deer herd you look at the annual deer
 
04:53:17.070 --> 04:53:17.080 align:start position:0%
kill for the past 20 years it has gone
 
04:53:19.830 --> 04:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
up tremendously from the 80s when many
 
04:53:20.948 --> 04:53:20.958 align:start position:0%
of us
 
04:53:23.628 --> 04:53:23.638 align:start position:0%
hunters would spend days or weeks out in
 
04:53:25.868 --> 04:53:25.878 align:start position:0%
the woods without not much to show for
 
04:53:28.590 --> 04:53:28.600 align:start position:0%
it back then the annual kill was around
 
04:53:32.150 --> 04:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
4,000 to 6,000 deer a year now it hovers
 
04:53:35.590 --> 04:53:35.600 align:start position:0%
around 12,000 to 14 14,000 and coyotes
 
04:53:38.788 --> 04:53:38.798 align:start position:0%
have been in our state for over 50 years
 
04:53:40.990 --> 04:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
and still the deer the annual deer kill
 
04:53:43.708 --> 04:53:43.718 align:start position:0%
has gone up this is an animal which
 
04:53:45.830 --> 04:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
displaced the wolf that was wiped out it
 
04:53:48.030 --> 04:53:48.040 align:start position:0%
is taking its place in our natural
 
04:53:50.390 --> 04:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
environment and we should allow nature
 
04:53:53.548 --> 04:53:53.558 align:start position:0%
to take its course having a year- round
 
04:53:56.590 --> 04:53:56.600 align:start position:0%
hunting season especially during the pup
 
04:54:01.310 --> 04:54:01.320 align:start position:0%
season rearing season is inhumane and
 
04:54:03.590 --> 04:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
unconscionable let us not forget what
 
04:54:05.590 --> 04:54:05.600 align:start position:0%
happened when years ago fishing game was
 
04:54:07.470 --> 04:54:07.480 align:start position:0%
proposing a trap and seasoning on the
 
04:54:10.230 --> 04:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
Bobcat another animal that was making a
 
04:54:13.070 --> 04:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
solid comeback into New
 
04:54:16.830 --> 04:54:16.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we as a society must consider
 
04:54:19.868 --> 04:54:19.878 align:start position:0%
the needs of Wildlife and as I've stated
 
04:54:22.990 --> 04:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
earlier I a human being and a hunter
 
04:54:24.948 --> 04:54:24.958 align:start position:0%
look for a healthy Lev you your three
 
04:54:26.470 --> 04:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
minutes sir so wrap it up please of
 
04:54:29.270 --> 04:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
biodiversity in our environment uh as I
 
04:54:31.628 --> 04:54:31.638 align:start position:0%
said I'm a deer hunter and I welcome the
 
04:54:33.990 --> 04:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
coyote and I urge the legislature to
 
04:54:38.708 --> 04:54:38.718 align:start position:0%
approve and pass hb100 it is the morally
 
04:54:40.910 --> 04:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
right thing to
 
04:54:43.070 --> 04:54:43.080 align:start position:0%
do thank you so much will you take
 
04:54:46.830 --> 04:54:46.840 align:start position:0%
questions sure are there any
 
04:54:48.990 --> 04:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:54:51.310 --> 04:54:51.320 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you Mr chair thanks for
 
04:54:54.350 --> 04:54:54.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:54:57.190 --> 04:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
um please take this I I'm being as
 
04:55:00.910 --> 04:55:00.920 align:start position:0%
respectful as I can I'm not I want to so
 
04:55:03.470 --> 04:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing you say that if we continue
 
04:55:05.350 --> 04:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
hunting it could hurt the coyote
 
04:55:07.510 --> 04:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
population where others this morning
 
04:55:09.990 --> 04:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
have said if we have hunting during
 
04:55:12.030 --> 04:55:12.040 align:start position:0%
pupping it will change the reproduction
 
04:55:14.430 --> 04:55:14.440 align:start position:0%
process and create more coyotes those
 
04:55:15.788 --> 04:55:15.798 align:start position:0%
seem to be two different things can you
 
04:55:17.390 --> 04:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
speak to that yeah and and I'm not a
 
04:55:19.750 --> 04:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
biologist by any means okay what what
 
04:55:21.628 --> 04:55:21.638 align:start position:0%
I'm saying is you have an animal that's
 
04:55:25.430 --> 04:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
made a comeback into our environment I
 
04:55:26.910 --> 04:55:26.920 align:start position:0%
don't see why we have to put up
 
04:55:29.230 --> 04:55:29.240 align:start position:0%
roadblocks no other animal that I'm
 
04:55:31.590 --> 04:55:31.600 align:start position:0%
aware of is hunted during the pup season
 
04:55:34.270 --> 04:55:34.280 align:start position:0%
it's inhumane it's not right
 
04:55:37.670 --> 04:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah thank you any further
 
04:55:39.830 --> 04:55:39.840 align:start position:0%

um the uh placement restrictions on the
 
04:57:06.030 --> 04:57:06.040 align:start position:0%
uh hunting season is a dangerous
 
04:57:09.910 --> 04:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
president uh we we look forward to
 
04:57:13.510 --> 04:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
having fishing game biologists give uh
 
04:57:16.150 --> 04:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
put seasons in place bringing it over to
 
04:57:18.510 --> 04:57:18.520 align:start position:0%
the state legislation complicate some
 
04:57:21.708 --> 04:57:21.718 align:start position:0%
matters and U Mr bird just spoke on that
 
04:57:25.190 --> 04:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
and um each year the coyote population
 
04:57:28.750 --> 04:57:28.760 align:start position:0%
seems to grow uh uh it more
 
04:57:28.760 --> 04:57:30.750 align:start position:0%
seems to grow uh uh it more
confrontations

the scientific
 
04:57:55.070 --> 04:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
dat thank you and I think we've all
 
04:57:56.430 --> 04:57:56.440 align:start position:0%
gotten your written testimony so I
 
04:57:58.510 --> 04:57:58.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate you not reading from it and
 
04:58:01.310 --> 04:58:01.320 align:start position:0%
and uh giving us all the the scoop are
 
04:58:04.788 --> 04:58:04.798 align:start position:0%
there any questions repes pres of Darby
 
04:58:06.190 --> 04:58:06.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:58:09.190 --> 04:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
my question uh you mentioned the um
 
04:58:12.830 --> 04:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
coyot coyote population growing yeah um
 
04:58:15.270 --> 04:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
I I looked at the um the latest report
 
04:58:18.150 --> 04:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
from fish and game on um you know deer
 
04:58:20.868 --> 04:58:20.878 align:start position:0%
numbers um turkey numbers um fur bearing
 
04:58:23.030 --> 04:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
numbers it appears from what I can tell
 
04:58:25.590 --> 04:58:25.600 align:start position:0%
that the only uh tracking they do of
 
04:58:28.628 --> 04:58:28.638 align:start position:0%
coyotes is um is trapping as opposed to
 
04:58:32.030 --> 04:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
hunting um so I'm just curious what uh
 
04:58:34.788 --> 04:58:34.798 align:start position:0%
what the basis of the population growing
 
04:58:37.750 --> 04:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
is well more encounters with the general
 
04:58:42.670 --> 04:58:42.680 align:start position:0%
public and uh definitely roadkill um and
 
04:58:44.670 --> 04:58:44.680 align:start position:0%
uh I think you'll see coming out uh
 
04:58:46.788 --> 04:58:46.798 align:start position:0%
before long that there'll be more data
 
04:58:50.910 --> 04:58:50.920 align:start position:0%
recovered from um hunting and of Road
 
04:58:53.190 --> 04:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
kills uh down the
 
04:58:57.190 --> 04:58:57.200 align:start position:0%
road representative goalie thank you Mr
 
04:58:59.788 --> 04:58:59.798 align:start position:0%
chair isn't there also another way and I
 
04:59:03.190 --> 04:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
know I've seen it quite often in areas
 
04:59:05.150 --> 04:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
hunt and I think a lot of the folks in
 
04:59:07.830 --> 04:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
your organization probably gather better
 
04:59:11.230 --> 04:59:11.240 align:start position:0%
better data that on game cameras where
 
04:59:12.868 --> 04:59:12.878 align:start position:0%
they never used to see coyotes before in
 
04:59:14.868 --> 04:59:14.878 align:start position:0%
the deer yards that you're constantly
 
04:59:17.350 --> 04:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
seeing pictures of coyotes that's
 
04:59:17.360 --> 04:59:18.670 align:start position:0%
seeing pictures of coyotes that's
absolutely

04:59:18.670 --> 04:59:18.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
04:59:20.830 --> 04:59:20.840 align:start position:0%
true any further
 
04:59:24.070 --> 04:59:24.080 align:start position:0%
questions anyone else seeing none thank
 
04:59:25.628 --> 04:59:25.638 align:start position:0%
you so much for your
 
04:59:30.350 --> 04:59:30.360 align:start position:0%

Dion representing the voices of Wildlife
 
04:59:36.030 --> 04:59:36.040 align:start position:0%
life ask for 3 minutes and you'll get
 
04:59:37.830 --> 04:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
three minutes okay thank you I was
 
04:59:39.230 --> 04:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
wondering if I could give my time to
 
04:59:41.788 --> 04:59:41.798 align:start position:0%
Chris shadler because she is the expert
 
04:59:44.070 --> 04:59:44.080 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing a lot of false
 
04:59:46.590 --> 04:59:46.600 align:start position:0%
information some we don't want to hear
 
04:59:47.788 --> 04:59:47.798 align:start position:0%
uh from the same people who've already
 
04:59:58.670 --> 04:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:00.628 --> 05:00:00.638 align:start position:0%
minutes is this
 
05:00:03.590 --> 05:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
on okay about it um k
 
05:00:06.430 --> 05:00:06.440 align:start position:0%
being uh weaned you know the puppet two
 
05:00:09.350 --> 05:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
weeks that's totally false if any of you
 
05:00:11.750 --> 05:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
have ever had puppies the coyotes at
 
05:00:14.788 --> 05:00:14.798 align:start position:0%
dogs you don't take the puppies away at
 
05:00:18.310 --> 05:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
two weeks and and especially in the wild
 
05:00:20.670 --> 05:00:20.680 align:start position:0%
that is not going to happen Okay so that
 
05:00:22.830 --> 05:00:22.840 align:start position:0%
was totally false a couple people said
 
05:00:25.830 --> 05:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
that even one of you repeated it you
 
05:00:27.750 --> 05:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
know that's why you need the expert
 
05:00:27.760 --> 05:00:28.868 align:start position:0%
know that's why you need the expert
Chris

05:00:28.868 --> 05:00:28.878 align:start position:0%
Chris
 
05:00:32.150 --> 05:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
shadler uh what else did I hear oh we
 
05:00:34.548 --> 05:00:34.558 align:start position:0%
keep hearing the coyotes are multiplying
 
05:00:36.830 --> 05:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
there's more coyotes than ever before
 
05:00:38.670 --> 05:00:38.680 align:start position:0%
well we must be doing something wrong
 
05:00:40.628 --> 05:00:40.638 align:start position:0%
don't you think if there's too many
 
05:00:43.030 --> 05:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
coyotes this is not working what we're
 
05:00:46.270 --> 05:00:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:49.390 --> 05:00:49.400 align:start position:0%
working um oh I was a little bit
 
05:00:52.948 --> 05:00:52.958 align:start position:0%
involved with a pesticide Bill last year
 
05:00:55.190 --> 05:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
and uh the head of the pesticide board
 
05:00:57.270 --> 05:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
he said that in the last 10 years he's
 
05:00:59.230 --> 05:00:59.240 align:start position:0%
getting more rodent complaints than ever
 
05:01:02.590 --> 05:01:02.600 align:start position:0%
before these carnivores like a coyote I
 
05:01:05.230 --> 05:01:05.240 align:start position:0%
heard the Coyote's favorite food is a
 
05:01:08.830 --> 05:01:08.840 align:start position:0%
mouse so we need these guys out there
 
05:01:10.948 --> 05:01:10.958 align:start position:0%
and um cuz we all know about lime
 
05:01:13.430 --> 05:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
disease and ticks that's all from the
 
05:01:15.590 --> 05:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
little white footed mouse that the
 
05:01:17.350 --> 05:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
coyote loves to
 
05:01:20.270 --> 05:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
eat uh the other thing about this hiding
 
05:01:22.190 --> 05:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
coyotes in these warm months the fur is
 
05:01:25.788 --> 05:01:25.798 align:start position:0%

they're not going to sell the fur the
 
05:01:40.990 --> 05:01:41.000 align:start position:0%
coyote is just going to lie there
 
05:01:44.548 --> 05:01:44.558 align:start position:0%
dead um on fishing games website they
 
05:01:46.830 --> 05:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
also say this they say a coyote can be a
 
05:01:50.390 --> 05:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
farmer's best friend if you um protect
 
05:01:52.830 --> 05:01:52.840 align:start position:0%
your animals the the coyote will be your
 
05:01:54.910 --> 05:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
best friend because he will eat the
 
05:01:56.390 --> 05:01:56.400 align:start position:0%

I mean there's so much false information
 
05:02:08.270 --> 05:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
you really need experts and another
 
05:02:09.868 --> 05:02:09.878 align:start position:0%
thing we do respect the fishing game
 
05:02:12.270 --> 05:02:12.280 align:start position:0%
biologists we really do and I have seen
 
05:02:14.868 --> 05:02:14.878 align:start position:0%
fishing game biologists
 
05:02:18.070 --> 05:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
propose um closing the hunting season
 
05:02:19.430 --> 05:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
but they get old going to hear from one
 
05:02:21.110 --> 05:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
in just a moment yeah well he won't
 
05:02:24.070 --> 05:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
admit it because um he is govern ma'am I
 
05:02:25.708 --> 05:02:25.718 align:start position:0%
won't allow aspersions being cast on
 
05:02:28.788 --> 05:02:28.798 align:start position:0%
anyone so please I like the ERS on I
 
05:02:30.310 --> 05:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
think he's wonderful he's a great
 
05:02:32.948 --> 05:02:32.958 align:start position:0%
biologist let's keep things light happy
 
05:02:34.070 --> 05:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
the reason they can't admit it is
 
05:02:35.070 --> 05:02:35.080 align:start position:0%
because they're governed by the
 
05:02:37.510 --> 05:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
commission whatever the commission says
 
05:02:39.470 --> 05:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
that's what they have to say and the
 
05:02:41.350 --> 05:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
commission as we know is a problem at
 
05:02:43.628 --> 05:02:43.638 align:start position:0%
fishing game they just all hunters and
 
05:02:43.638 --> 05:02:44.868 align:start position:0%
fishing game they just all hunters and
Trappers

05:02:44.868 --> 05:02:44.878 align:start position:0%
Trappers
 
05:02:48.190 --> 05:02:48.200 align:start position:0%
and I've seen that I've seen biologists
 
05:02:50.948 --> 05:02:50.958 align:start position:0%
overruled by the Commission in the past
 
05:02:53.150 --> 05:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
one time they wanted to put limits on uh
 
05:02:54.868 --> 05:02:54.878 align:start position:0%
foxes trapped
 
05:02:57.510 --> 05:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
foxes um biologists wanted to do that
 
05:02:59.670 --> 05:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
because they see the decline The Fishing
 
05:03:02.270 --> 05:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
Game Commission would not allow it and
 
05:03:03.910 --> 05:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
the fish commission call that's your
 
05:03:07.548 --> 05:03:07.558 align:start position:0%
three minutes ma'am y thank you okay
 
05:03:08.510 --> 05:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
question are you willing to take
 
05:03:11.230 --> 05:03:11.240 align:start position:0%
questions sure why not thank you so
 
05:03:15.390 --> 05:03:15.400 align:start position:0%
much rep car rep Brown thank you Mr
 
05:03:16.788 --> 05:03:16.798 align:start position:0%
chair I don't know if this is a question
 
05:03:19.708 --> 05:03:19.718 align:start position:0%
or a clarification or a point of order
 
05:03:21.868 --> 05:03:21.878 align:start position:0%
information I wanted to be clear that
 
05:03:24.310 --> 05:03:24.320 align:start position:0%
what you said that someone up here said
 
05:03:26.230 --> 05:03:26.240 align:start position:0%
there is a two-e pup season I didn't
 
05:03:28.270 --> 05:03:28.280 align:start position:0%
mean to say that I agreed with that or I
 
05:03:30.470 --> 05:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
believe that I was asking a question
 
05:03:33.270 --> 05:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
about it thank you okay thanks yeah my
 
05:03:35.190 --> 05:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
apologies um I didn't even know it was
 
05:03:37.070 --> 05:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
you I just heard somebody say okay thank
 
05:03:39.788 --> 05:03:39.798 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
05:03:42.750 --> 05:03:42.760 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you so much
 
05:03:44.510 --> 05:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
for your testimony the chair now
 
05:03:46.830 --> 05:03:46.840 align:start position:0%
recognizes Dan berson biologist of
 
05:03:46.840 --> 05:03:49.750 align:start position:0%

05:03:52.110 --> 05:03:52.120 align:start position:0%
game who's asked for six minutes but
 
05:03:53.190 --> 05:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
we'll get
 
05:04:01.590 --> 05:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:01.600 --> 05:04:05.350 align:start position:0%
 
enough

05:04:05.350 --> 05:04:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:06.868 --> 05:04:06.878 align:start position:0%
um good morning chairman Spain members
 
05:04:08.230 --> 05:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh thank you for
 
05:04:10.150 --> 05:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
allowing me to testify um I'm
 
05:04:11.548 --> 05:04:11.558 align:start position:0%
representing the department my name is
 
05:04:13.150 --> 05:04:13.160 align:start position:0%
Dan beron I'm the chief of the wildlife
 
05:04:15.510 --> 05:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
division I'm representing New Hampshire
 
05:04:18.110 --> 05:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
fishing game in opposition of
 
05:04:20.390 --> 05:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
hb100 um so issues surrounding the
 
05:04:22.190 --> 05:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
management of fur bearing species in
 
05:04:25.150 --> 05:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
particular coyote um are are always
 
05:04:27.390 --> 05:04:27.400 align:start position:0%
controversial um this was noted by our
 
05:04:29.590 --> 05:04:29.600 align:start position:0%
commission um at our most recent bional
 
05:04:31.190 --> 05:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
Ru making session we had a lot of
 
05:04:32.788 --> 05:04:32.798 align:start position:0%
comments that came in regarding the
 
05:04:35.270 --> 05:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
management of coyotes um even though we
 
05:04:37.708 --> 05:04:37.718 align:start position:0%
had no proposals on the table um to
 
05:04:39.230 --> 05:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
change any of the Season structures
 
05:04:41.470 --> 05:04:41.480 align:start position:0%
around coyotes um because of the number
 
05:04:43.470 --> 05:04:43.480 align:start position:0%
of comments that the department received
 
05:04:45.590 --> 05:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
the commission had asked um biological
 
05:04:47.788 --> 05:04:47.798 align:start position:0%
staff um at a later date to come up with
 
05:04:52.350 --> 05:04:52.360 align:start position:0%
a presentation um and um future um
 
05:04:54.350 --> 05:04:54.360 align:start position:0%
future things we could look at uh to get
 
05:04:57.430 --> 05:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
a better idea of um what's going on with
 
05:05:00.070 --> 05:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
the state's County population um the
 
05:05:02.990 --> 05:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
department had done that and as a result
 
05:05:05.788 --> 05:05:05.798 align:start position:0%
um what what we had proposed and what we
 
05:05:08.150 --> 05:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
are looking to do um through the rule
 
05:05:10.350 --> 05:05:10.360 align:start position:0%
making process will be to create a
 
05:05:13.310 --> 05:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
mandatory uh registration process for
 
05:05:15.548 --> 05:05:15.558 align:start position:0%
any fur bearing species that's that's
 
05:05:18.510 --> 05:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
taken by hunting currently um virtually
 
05:05:19.750 --> 05:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
all the information we have on fur
 
05:05:21.230 --> 05:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
bearing species comes through an annual
 
05:05:21.240 --> 05:05:22.390 align:start position:0%
bearing species comes through an annual
trapping

05:05:22.390 --> 05:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
trapping
 
05:05:25.110 --> 05:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
report um that has been our longest
 
05:05:27.868 --> 05:05:27.878 align:start position:0%
standing index um and way to track
 
05:05:30.030 --> 05:05:30.040 align:start position:0%
changes in the population of fur bearing
 
05:05:32.510 --> 05:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
species um there are there are a hand
 
05:05:34.190 --> 05:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
full of fur bearing species that are
 
05:05:36.030 --> 05:05:36.040 align:start position:0%
required to be reported fish is one of
 
05:05:38.150 --> 05:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
them um if any fish are taken whether
 
05:05:39.548 --> 05:05:39.558 align:start position:0%
it's hunting or trapping needs to be
 
05:05:42.230 --> 05:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
sealed um but we tend to see very low
 
05:05:44.110 --> 05:05:44.120 align:start position:0%
numbers that are taken during hunting on
 
05:05:45.868 --> 05:05:45.878 align:start position:0%
species like that coyote arguably is
 
05:05:49.030 --> 05:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
probably different um from surveys we've
 
05:05:50.948 --> 05:05:50.958 align:start position:0%
done in the past we do we do believe
 
05:05:52.190 --> 05:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
that there's likely more hunting
 
05:05:54.548 --> 05:05:54.558 align:start position:0%
pressure on coyotes than um other fur
 
05:05:57.830 --> 05:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
bearing species um that said um we we
 
05:06:00.270 --> 05:06:00.280 align:start position:0%
don't have those specific numbers um
 
05:06:02.070 --> 05:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
we've largely relied on this capture per
 
05:06:04.548 --> 05:06:04.558 align:start position:0%
unit effort data um and that's how we
 
05:06:06.070 --> 05:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
track changes in the population so
 
05:06:07.670 --> 05:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of um there's been a
 
05:06:10.030 --> 05:06:10.040 align:start position:0%
lot of talk about knowing the number of
 
05:06:11.910 --> 05:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
of any individual species in the state
 
05:06:13.590 --> 05:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
quite frankly we don't know the number
 
05:06:16.548 --> 05:06:16.558 align:start position:0%
of any of the species in the state um we
 
05:06:18.510 --> 05:06:18.520 align:start position:0%
do have population models that will give
 
05:06:21.670 --> 05:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
us information um um but even when we
 
05:06:23.830 --> 05:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
have an estimate of of what the
 
05:06:25.390 --> 05:06:25.400 align:start position:0%
population is what we're really looking
 
05:06:27.430 --> 05:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
at is the trend in that population we're
 
05:06:29.948 --> 05:06:29.958 align:start position:0%
not assuming um that those numbers are
 
05:06:32.390 --> 05:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
are 100% accurate we know there's
 
05:06:33.868 --> 05:06:33.878 align:start position:0%
there's variation in there and we're
 
05:06:36.230 --> 05:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
interested in the trend and we get that
 
05:06:38.110 --> 05:06:38.120 align:start position:0%
information through um what's called
 
05:06:40.590 --> 05:06:40.600 align:start position:0%
capture perun effort information um
 
05:06:43.310 --> 05:06:43.320 align:start position:0%
through mandatory trapping reports um
 
05:06:45.390 --> 05:06:45.400 align:start position:0%
the information we have for coyotes
 
05:06:47.110 --> 05:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
through our capture per unit effort data
 
05:06:49.470 --> 05:06:49.480 align:start position:0%
shows that the states county population
 
05:06:51.190 --> 05:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
over roughly the last 30 years has been
 
05:06:53.548 --> 05:06:53.558 align:start position:0%
largely stable um again we don't know
 
05:06:55.788 --> 05:06:55.798 align:start position:0%
the number of animals um but we know
 
05:06:57.470 --> 05:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
that the population has been largely
 
05:07:00.470 --> 05:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
stable based on capture perun effort um
 
05:07:01.910 --> 05:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
which is an indication that current
 
05:07:04.190 --> 05:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
season structures are not having an
 
05:07:07.548 --> 05:07:07.558 align:start position:0%
negative impact on the population as a
 
05:07:11.470 --> 05:07:11.480 align:start position:0%
whole um so our our current information
 
05:07:13.190 --> 05:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
you're at your three minute Mark so
 
05:07:14.868 --> 05:07:14.878 align:start position:0%
let's wrap it up thank you I just want
 
05:07:16.350 --> 05:07:16.360 align:start position:0%
to be fair to everybody yeah and the
 
05:07:17.990 --> 05:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
last thing I'll just mention is that um
 
05:07:19.548 --> 05:07:19.558 align:start position:0%
it was mentioned before we are working
 
05:07:21.708 --> 05:07:21.718 align:start position:0%
with UNH to do some camera trap research
 
05:07:23.750 --> 05:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
to come up with additional ways to index
 
05:07:26.350 --> 05:07:26.360 align:start position:0%
the the population um so for those
 
05:07:28.510 --> 05:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
reasons um we would asked that the
 
05:07:29.990 --> 05:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
department be able to retain its
 
05:07:32.270 --> 05:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
rulemaking Authority on setting season
 
05:07:34.350 --> 05:07:34.360 align:start position:0%
dates and timing um and allow us to
 
05:07:35.628 --> 05:07:35.638 align:start position:0%
collect more
 
05:07:38.510 --> 05:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
information thank you so much are there
 
05:07:38.520 --> 05:07:39.310 align:start position:0%
information thank you so much are there
any

05:07:39.310 --> 05:07:39.320 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:07:42.350 --> 05:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
questions rep
 
05:07:45.990 --> 05:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
Ford thank you Mr chair um 30 years
 
05:07:48.150 --> 05:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
stable um that's for New Hampshire can
 
05:07:50.868 --> 05:07:50.878 align:start position:0%
you tell me any information if possible
 
05:07:52.708 --> 05:07:52.718 align:start position:0%
about Maine and Vermont because they
 
05:07:54.708 --> 05:07:54.718 align:start position:0%
seem to touch our border too so and I
 
05:07:56.430 --> 05:07:56.440 align:start position:0%
would imagine coyotes don't just stay in
 
05:07:58.750 --> 05:07:58.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um so what did that what
 
05:08:00.670 --> 05:08:00.680 align:start position:0%
do those Trends look like yeah so I'm
 
05:08:03.230 --> 05:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
not I'm not sure specifically of what
 
05:08:05.910 --> 05:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
they've seen for long-term trends uh my
 
05:08:08.430 --> 05:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
guess is it would be very fairly similar
 
05:08:10.990 --> 05:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
to what we've seen um certainly coyotes
 
05:08:12.750 --> 05:08:12.760 align:start position:0%
are a gous species they've expanded
 
05:08:16.150 --> 05:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
their range um um you'll see annual
 
05:08:18.270 --> 05:08:18.280 align:start position:0%
fluctuations that might go up and down
 
05:08:20.110 --> 05:08:20.120 align:start position:0%
quite a bit a lot of that is due to you
 
05:08:22.190 --> 05:08:22.200 align:start position:0%
know natural food ability things like
 
05:08:24.830 --> 05:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
that um so you know again we're looking
 
05:08:28.310 --> 05:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
at very long-term trends in this so and
 
05:08:30.510 --> 05:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
this is at Large Scale so our estimate
 
05:08:32.190 --> 05:08:32.200 align:start position:0%
for coyotes in particular is at a
 
05:08:34.830 --> 05:08:34.840 align:start position:0%
Statewide level um things can vary quite
 
05:08:36.868 --> 05:08:36.878 align:start position:0%
a bit you know throughout the the range
 
05:08:38.190 --> 05:08:38.200 align:start position:0%
of coyotes so you could have certain
 
05:08:39.830 --> 05:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
areas of the state where you know for
 
05:08:41.190 --> 05:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
some portion of time you might see an
 
05:08:43.548 --> 05:08:43.558 align:start position:0%
increase other areas might be declining
 
05:08:46.230 --> 05:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
but generally speaking on a Statewide
 
05:08:48.590 --> 05:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
level our coyote population based on the
 
05:08:51.910 --> 05:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
information we currently have has been
 
05:08:53.990 --> 05:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
stable thank
 
05:08:59.590 --> 05:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
you uh representative uh PE sorry thank
 
05:09:01.190 --> 05:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:09:03.470 --> 05:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
question couple things as a biologist
 
05:09:05.190 --> 05:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
pull the mic closer so that the YouTube
 
05:09:07.590 --> 05:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
people might be able to hear that hello
 
05:09:10.948 --> 05:09:10.958 align:start position:0%
test test test okay um we've heard a
 
05:09:13.070 --> 05:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
couple of things about the bi basic
 
05:09:16.948 --> 05:09:16.958 align:start position:0%
biology of coyotes the reproductive um
 
05:09:19.788 --> 05:09:19.798 align:start position:0%
mechanisms of them and this business of
 
05:09:21.868 --> 05:09:21.878 align:start position:0%
well they they only mind their pops for
 
05:09:23.868 --> 05:09:23.878 align:start position:0%
two weeks and and that's the end of it
 
05:09:25.628 --> 05:09:25.638 align:start position:0%
would you care to add a professional
 
05:09:27.510 --> 05:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
comment on either of these
 
05:09:31.110 --> 05:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
items um certainly
 
05:09:36.708 --> 05:09:36.718 align:start position:0%
so yeah so two weeks um so pups start to
 
05:09:38.390 --> 05:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
leave the den after about two to three
 
05:09:41.708 --> 05:09:41.718 align:start position:0%
weeks they're weaned um roughly
 
05:09:44.070 --> 05:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
around um you know it varies we haven't
 
05:09:45.510 --> 05:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
done any specific research in New
 
05:09:47.350 --> 05:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but they're we weaned probably
 
05:09:50.708 --> 05:09:50.718 align:start position:0%
around 7 to 8 weeks um they stay with
 
05:09:52.670 --> 05:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
you know the the juveniles start to
 
05:09:55.590 --> 05:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
disperse around 6 to 8 months so um two
 
05:09:58.230 --> 05:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
to two to 3 weeks is certainly short if
 
05:09:59.990 --> 05:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
you're talking about how long the pups
 
05:10:02.670 --> 05:10:02.680 align:start position:0%
are actually with the adults um so that
 
05:10:04.510 --> 05:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
but they're that's typically when
 
05:10:06.868 --> 05:10:06.878 align:start position:0%
they'll start to leave the
 
05:10:10.510 --> 05:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
den oh so is it fair to say that EXC
 
05:10:12.788 --> 05:10:12.798 align:start position:0%
followup oh sorry followup you were
 
05:10:16.070 --> 05:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
granted a followup thank you is it fair
 
05:10:17.590 --> 05:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
to say that they're learning pack
 
05:10:20.788 --> 05:10:20.798 align:start position:0%
Behavior Uh or adult Behavior over that
 
05:10:22.590 --> 05:10:22.600 align:start position:0%
eight-week period before they start
 
05:10:25.750 --> 05:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
dispersing to other things on their own
 
05:10:27.150 --> 05:10:27.160 align:start position:0%
I think it would be fair to say that the
 
05:10:28.510 --> 05:10:28.520 align:start position:0%
time that the pups are with the adults
 
05:10:32.110 --> 05:10:32.120 align:start position:0%
they're learning from the adults um um
 
05:10:35.868 --> 05:10:35.878 align:start position:0%
pack behavior um not all coyotes do run
 
05:10:38.350 --> 05:10:38.360 align:start position:0%
in packs but but certainly the time
 
05:10:39.708 --> 05:10:39.718 align:start position:0%
they're with the adults they learn that
 
05:10:41.270 --> 05:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
and that's true for most Wildlife deer
 
05:10:43.430 --> 05:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
is a good example um fawns when they're
 
05:10:45.190 --> 05:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
with the with the Doe's have learned
 
05:10:47.150 --> 05:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
behaviors as
 
05:10:51.110 --> 05:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
well and and and followup again well
 
05:10:53.788 --> 05:10:53.798 align:start position:0%
this is sort of a re rework but I uh it
 
05:10:55.270 --> 05:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
would have to be another followup if you
 
05:10:57.030 --> 05:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
were at all right well we'll call it a
 
05:10:58.868 --> 05:10:58.878 align:start position:0%
followup then you get another followup
 
05:11:00.670 --> 05:11:00.680 align:start position:0%
thank you sir thank you um I had also
 
05:11:05.868 --> 05:11:05.878 align:start position:0%
asked about the um um uh their um mating
 
05:11:08.510 --> 05:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
behaviors and the size of litters and so
 
05:11:12.230 --> 05:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
forth yeah so um so largely what's
 
05:11:14.750 --> 05:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
what's seen is less behavioral and more
 
05:11:17.990 --> 05:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
a result of um access to additional
 
05:11:19.830 --> 05:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
resources and that's again that's seen
 
05:11:22.708 --> 05:11:22.718 align:start position:0%
in um really most Wildlife species deer
 
05:11:24.750 --> 05:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
is another good example if you have a
 
05:11:27.310 --> 05:11:27.320 align:start position:0%
very high deer population um that is
 
05:11:28.708 --> 05:11:28.718 align:start position:0%
near the carrying capacity of the
 
05:11:31.430 --> 05:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
habitat or um it's it's essentially
 
05:11:33.190 --> 05:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
using up all the resources that the
 
05:11:36.030 --> 05:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
habitat has available if you reduce that
 
05:11:38.470 --> 05:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
population that opens up resources and
 
05:11:40.390 --> 05:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
you'll see an increase in productivity
 
05:11:42.708 --> 05:11:42.718 align:start position:0%
in that in that deer population as well
 
05:11:44.190 --> 05:11:44.200 align:start position:0%
and that's largely what's seen in
 
05:11:47.110 --> 05:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
coyotes as well um so again that
 
05:11:49.548 --> 05:11:49.558 align:start position:0%
response will largely be dependent on
 
05:11:52.150 --> 05:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
what's limiting the population um so if
 
05:11:54.830 --> 05:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
they're not food limited um you you may
 
05:11:57.750 --> 05:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
not see that response and again um given
 
05:11:59.350 --> 05:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
the season framework that we've had in
 
05:12:01.948 --> 05:12:01.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um we have not seen any
 
05:12:04.310 --> 05:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
increase um any sort of drastic increase
 
05:12:06.470 --> 05:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
in the Cy population again you know
 
05:12:08.190 --> 05:12:08.200 align:start position:0%
fluctuations annually but the
 
05:12:11.788 --> 05:12:11.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:16.030 --> 05:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
stable thank you representative
 
05:12:18.670 --> 05:12:18.680 align:start position:0%
Harvey thank you Mr chair I did it right
 
05:12:20.948 --> 05:12:20.958 align:start position:0%
this time uh and thank you for taking my
 
05:12:24.628 --> 05:12:24.638 align:start position:0%
question um so she started the question
 
05:12:26.270 --> 05:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'm just doing a follow up to
 
05:12:29.350 --> 05:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
hers um would you say that the
 
05:12:33.708 --> 05:12:33.718 align:start position:0%
reproduction of the coyote is
 
05:12:35.470 --> 05:12:35.480 align:start position:0%
if you had to compare responsive
 
05:12:38.750 --> 05:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
reproduction and the food source which
 
05:12:42.708 --> 05:12:42.718 align:start position:0%
do you think would most um affect the
 
05:12:45.510 --> 05:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
number of young the coyote have I think
 
05:12:48.670 --> 05:12:48.680 align:start position:0%
at a population level I think food
 
05:12:51.390 --> 05:12:51.400 align:start position:0%
availability thank you uh representative
 
05:12:54.868 --> 05:12:54.878 align:start position:0%
wette then representative
 
05:12:56.948 --> 05:12:56.958 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:12:59.070 --> 05:12:59.080 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question thank you as
 
05:13:01.470 --> 05:13:01.480 align:start position:0%
I'm sitting here uh couple things go
 
05:13:04.430 --> 05:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
through one mind um we all uh understand
 
05:13:07.670 --> 05:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
the Natural Balance of animal population
 
05:13:11.590 --> 05:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
and stuff and as I'm sitting here um is
 
05:13:13.990 --> 05:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
the coyote in New Hampshire the only fur
 
05:13:15.548 --> 05:13:15.558 align:start position:0%
bearing animal that does not have a
 
05:13:15.558 --> 05:13:17.110 align:start position:0%
bearing animal that does not have a
natural

05:13:17.110 --> 05:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
natural
 
05:13:17.120 --> 05:13:21.030 align:start position:0%
natural
predator

05:13:21.030 --> 05:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:26.590 --> 05:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:31.070 --> 05:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
sorry um that is pro uh fur bearing
 
05:13:35.470 --> 05:13:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:39.150 --> 05:13:39.160 align:start position:0%
true okay uh representative goalie thank
 
05:13:41.948 --> 05:13:41.958 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:13:44.990 --> 05:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
question youve stated that the
 
05:13:46.990 --> 05:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
population is
 
05:13:49.470 --> 05:13:49.480 align:start position:0%
stable could you expound upon that a
 
05:13:50.868 --> 05:13:50.878 align:start position:0%
little bit because from what I'm seeing
 
05:13:52.150 --> 05:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
and hearing from other people in the
 
05:13:53.830 --> 05:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
woods they're seeing more and more
 
05:13:56.350 --> 05:13:56.360 align:start position:0%
pictures of coyotes on cameras and
 
05:13:59.230 --> 05:13:59.240 align:start position:0%
encounters is stable mean that it's
 
05:14:02.788 --> 05:14:02.798 align:start position:0%
sustainable and or is it it hasn't
 
05:14:04.310 --> 05:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
population hasn't increased over the
 
05:14:06.788 --> 05:14:06.798 align:start position:0%
last 5 years it hasn't decreased or we
 
05:14:10.548 --> 05:14:10.558 align:start position:0%
just don't know and it's hard to tell um
 
05:14:12.990 --> 05:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
so again our numbers are pretty General
 
05:14:17.510 --> 05:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
on a Statewide level um we don't have so
 
05:14:21.110 --> 05:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
um so species like deer and other things
 
05:14:23.430 --> 05:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
where we get a lot of information um at
 
05:14:24.990 --> 05:14:25.000 align:start position:0%
the management unit level which is
 
05:14:27.628 --> 05:14:27.638 align:start position:0%
typically an aggregate of multiple towns
 
05:14:30.548 --> 05:14:30.558 align:start position:0%
um we can say more precisely at smaller
 
05:14:32.510 --> 05:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
scales with those popul ations are doing
 
05:14:36.030 --> 05:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
for for most fur bearing species and
 
05:14:39.030 --> 05:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
coyote in particular um we really only
 
05:14:40.868 --> 05:14:40.878 align:start position:0%
have confident numbers at a Statewide
 
05:14:45.910 --> 05:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
level so um you know again it it there
 
05:14:47.230 --> 05:14:47.240 align:start position:0%
could be certain areas of the state
 
05:14:48.868 --> 05:14:48.878 align:start position:0%
where there's you know temporary
 
05:14:51.230 --> 05:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
increases declines but from a Statewide
 
05:14:53.510 --> 05:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
level um we have not seen what we would
 
05:14:55.868 --> 05:14:55.878 align:start position:0%
call a dramatic increase in the overall
 
05:15:00.350 --> 05:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
number of coyotes at a Statewide um now
 
05:15:02.230 --> 05:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
certainly um
 
05:15:04.788 --> 05:15:04.798 align:start position:0%
in terms of people's observations I
 
05:15:07.190 --> 05:15:07.200 align:start position:0%
always caution to be careful about
 
05:15:09.910 --> 05:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
individual observations we do use some
 
05:15:12.470 --> 05:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
observational data but we try to uh the
 
05:15:14.150 --> 05:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
method we collect that information we
 
05:15:15.628 --> 05:15:15.638 align:start position:0%
try and standardize it so it's
 
05:15:18.110 --> 05:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
comparable from um across different
 
05:15:21.390 --> 05:15:21.400 align:start position:0%
areas from year to year um so one of the
 
05:15:23.310 --> 05:15:23.320 align:start position:0%
reasons that people might start to see
 
05:15:24.708 --> 05:15:24.718 align:start position:0%
more things is there's a lot more
 
05:15:27.310 --> 05:15:27.320 align:start position:0%
cameras in the woods um Technologies
 
05:15:29.628 --> 05:15:29.638 align:start position:0%
increase so they capture things more
 
05:15:32.030 --> 05:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
readily um that's not the say that there
 
05:15:33.708 --> 05:15:33.718 align:start position:0%
might not be local areas where there's
 
05:15:35.070 --> 05:15:35.080 align:start position:0%
something going on that's caused an
 
05:15:37.150 --> 05:15:37.160 align:start position:0%
increase in that specific area but again
 
05:15:39.788 --> 05:15:39.798 align:start position:0%
from a Statewide level um are our
 
05:15:41.510 --> 05:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
information indicates that there's not
 
05:15:43.590 --> 05:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
been any significant increase in the
 
05:15:43.600 --> 05:15:44.868 align:start position:0%
been any significant increase in the
coyote

05:15:44.868 --> 05:15:44.878 align:start position:0%
coyote
 
05:15:47.230 --> 05:15:47.240 align:start position:0%
population follow
 
05:15:51.110 --> 05:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
up just one quick followup yep because
 
05:15:53.590 --> 05:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
as you know as you stated there's more
 
05:15:55.390 --> 05:15:55.400 align:start position:0%
and more cameras in the
 
05:15:58.430 --> 05:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
woods is fishing game at any time going
 
05:16:00.230 --> 05:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
to start reaching out to those who are
 
05:16:02.990 --> 05:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
in the woods viewing the pictures what's
 
05:16:06.230 --> 05:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
going on the most contact cover more
 
05:16:09.310 --> 05:16:09.320 align:start position:0%
Woods than anybody in the state and look
 
05:16:10.590 --> 05:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
for the information that they're
 
05:16:12.548 --> 05:16:12.558 align:start position:0%
receiving on their cameras to get real
 
05:16:14.030 --> 05:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
time information to help out with the
 
05:16:16.270 --> 05:16:16.280 align:start position:0%
Department on their numbers so we do
 
05:16:19.270 --> 05:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
have um we do have some Hunter surveys
 
05:16:20.590 --> 05:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
where we'll get sighting rates from
 
05:16:22.628 --> 05:16:22.638 align:start position:0%
hunters and again um those are
 
05:16:24.070 --> 05:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
structured in a way that are
 
05:16:25.948 --> 05:16:25.958 align:start position:0%
standardized so it's sent out to the
 
05:16:28.750 --> 05:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
same number of people every year um and
 
05:16:30.628 --> 05:16:30.638 align:start position:0%
we you know we get number of hours
 
05:16:32.868 --> 05:16:32.878 align:start position:0%
number of individuals scene um from the
 
05:16:35.510 --> 05:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
camera perspective we have and I I kind
 
05:16:38.708 --> 05:16:38.718 align:start position:0%
of lost um ran out of time but we're
 
05:16:40.310 --> 05:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
currently working with the University of
 
05:16:43.990 --> 05:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to use trail cameras um to
 
05:16:46.390 --> 05:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
index different Wildlife populations fur
 
05:16:48.910 --> 05:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
bears but also Mose um potentially other
 
05:16:51.470 --> 05:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
things in the future um and again the
 
05:16:55.150 --> 05:16:55.160 align:start position:0%
the problem with just getting
 
05:16:57.628 --> 05:16:57.638 align:start position:0%
um the the cameras need to be set up in
 
05:17:02.390 --> 05:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
a very specific way um and monitored in
 
05:17:04.628 --> 05:17:04.638 align:start position:0%
a specific way um to make the
 
05:17:07.910 --> 05:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
information comparable and usable so um
 
05:17:12.590 --> 05:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
you know where you know um we try and
 
05:17:14.430 --> 05:17:14.440 align:start position:0%
Scatter it across multiple types of
 
05:17:16.788 --> 05:17:16.798 align:start position:0%
habitat they're all set at the same
 
05:17:18.628 --> 05:17:18.638 align:start position:0%
height they're checked at the same
 
05:17:22.548 --> 05:17:22.558 align:start position:0%
intervals um there's um there are
 
05:17:24.628 --> 05:17:24.638 align:start position:0%
markings so that we can tell distances
 
05:17:26.190 --> 05:17:26.200 align:start position:0%
that animals cross in front of it so
 
05:17:28.230 --> 05:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
it'd be difficult to get information
 
05:17:30.948 --> 05:17:30.958 align:start position:0%
from the general public and have it be
 
05:17:33.708 --> 05:17:33.718 align:start position:0%
uh usable um to come up with some sort
 
05:17:35.910 --> 05:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
of population
 
05:17:38.788 --> 05:17:38.798 align:start position:0%
estimate followup thank you and just one
 
05:17:41.590 --> 05:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
quick last followup because in talking
 
05:17:44.510 --> 05:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
about the surveys that you send out and
 
05:17:46.150 --> 05:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong I believe the
 
05:17:47.910 --> 05:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
last one I received didn't have any
 
05:17:49.830 --> 05:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
reporting for coyotes is that
 
05:17:53.830 --> 05:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
true um that's yeah it would I'd have to
 
05:17:55.670 --> 05:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
go back and check the S so we we got a
 
05:17:59.350 --> 05:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
number of surveys um coyotes is not one
 
05:18:01.708 --> 05:18:01.718 align:start position:0%
that would you typically get the Deer
 
05:18:04.510 --> 05:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
Hunter survey that's not asked on that
 
05:18:07.670 --> 05:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
correct and can we add
 
05:18:11.910 --> 05:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
it um we we potentially could um we did
 
05:18:13.708 --> 05:18:13.718 align:start position:0%
I believe we added coyotes to our spring
 
05:18:16.350 --> 05:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
turkey hunter
 
05:18:19.990 --> 05:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
survey okay any other questions rep
 
05:18:22.270 --> 05:18:22.280 align:start position:0%
Darby thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:18:24.470 --> 05:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:18:27.708 --> 05:18:27.718 align:start position:0%
um with respect to um you know fishing
 
05:18:30.590 --> 05:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
game setting Seasons um can you talk
 
05:18:32.470 --> 05:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
about how
 
05:18:36.390 --> 05:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
um the the principles of fair Chase as
 
05:18:38.190 --> 05:18:38.200 align:start position:0%
um espoused by you know Teddy Roosevelt
 
05:18:39.510 --> 05:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
are really started the conservation
 
05:18:41.990 --> 05:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
movement and and currently supported by
 
05:18:43.628 --> 05:18:43.638 align:start position:0%
organizations um like the Boon and
 
05:18:47.948 --> 05:18:47.958 align:start position:0%
Crockett Club um are um incorporated
 
05:18:49.830 --> 05:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
into setting of those
 
05:18:52.350 --> 05:18:52.360 align:start position:0%
Seasons um yeah
 
05:18:57.390 --> 05:18:57.400 align:start position:0%
so um we we try to incorporate Fair
 
05:19:01.750 --> 05:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
Chase as best we can um Fair Chase
 
05:19:05.910 --> 05:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
um Fair Chase is a social aspect of of
 
05:19:08.548 --> 05:19:08.558 align:start position:0%
what we do um we try and make decisions
 
05:19:11.190 --> 05:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
largely based on science um social
 
05:19:15.390 --> 05:19:15.400 align:start position:0%
issues always creep in um the problem is
 
05:19:18.150 --> 05:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
that there are certain methods um where
 
05:19:19.788 --> 05:19:19.798 align:start position:0%
there is debate on whether or not it's
 
05:19:22.670 --> 05:19:22.680 align:start position:0%
fair Chase um many methods that are
 
05:19:24.548 --> 05:19:24.558 align:start position:0%
considered Fair chase by group such as
 
05:19:26.270 --> 05:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
Boon and Crockett are not considered
 
05:19:28.590 --> 05:19:28.600 align:start position:0%
Fair chase by other groups so um it
 
05:19:32.070 --> 05:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
becomes very difficult um to try and
 
05:19:34.830 --> 05:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
capture you know methods that every
 
05:19:36.788 --> 05:19:36.798 align:start position:0%
different constituency group that that
 
05:19:39.510 --> 05:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
has a um interest in this consider Fair
 
05:19:43.030 --> 05:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
Chase um Bai baiting is an example um
 
05:19:45.788 --> 05:19:45.798 align:start position:0%
you know there are certain um there are
 
05:19:47.830 --> 05:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
certainly conservation organizations
 
05:19:49.590 --> 05:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
that consider those methods Fair Chase
 
05:19:51.390 --> 05:19:51.400 align:start position:0%
there's a large member of the group of
 
05:19:54.030 --> 05:19:54.040 align:start position:0%
the public that do not so it it's It's
 
05:19:55.868 --> 05:19:55.878 align:start position:0%
tricky because there's a lot of varying
 
05:19:57.548 --> 05:19:57.558 align:start position:0%
viewpoints on what is considered Fair
 
05:20:00.350 --> 05:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
Chase we do our best um to incorporate
 
05:20:02.150 --> 05:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
what we believe is Fair Chase but again
 
05:20:04.708 --> 05:20:04.718 align:start position:0%
it's the the people's viewpoints on that
 
05:20:07.430 --> 05:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:11.830 --> 05:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
widely thank you any other questions
 
05:20:11.840 --> 05:20:13.830 align:start position:0%
widely thank you any other questions

Brown

05:20:18.948 --> 05:20:18.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:21.830 --> 05:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
um you lost it I have
 
05:20:25.430 --> 05:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
one um anecdotally we we hear from
 
05:20:27.390 --> 05:20:27.400 align:start position:0%
Hunters a lot that they see a lot more
 
05:20:31.590 --> 05:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
coyotes um I've mentally Cor corelated
 
05:20:33.708 --> 05:20:33.718 align:start position:0%
this with the increase in the Turkey
 
05:20:36.788 --> 05:20:36.798 align:start position:0%
population uh would you be able to
 
05:20:40.030 --> 05:20:40.040 align:start position:0%
expound to us on whether turkeys are a
 
05:20:43.150 --> 05:20:43.160 align:start position:0%
natural uh food source for the coyotes
 
05:20:46.070 --> 05:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
and whether the extremely successful
 
05:20:48.150 --> 05:20:48.160 align:start position:0%
Rebound in the Turkey population has had
 
05:20:50.390 --> 05:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
any impact on the coyote population as
 
05:20:52.628 --> 05:20:52.638 align:start position:0%
well as the other Predator populations
 
05:20:55.070 --> 05:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
whereas we've seen the uh rebound on the
 
05:20:58.190 --> 05:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
Bobcats as well and such like that sure
 
05:21:01.548 --> 05:21:01.558 align:start position:0%
um so um turkey's absolutely are a food
 
05:21:03.510 --> 05:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
source for coyotes um coyotes are a
 
05:21:05.910 --> 05:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
generous species so virtually everything
 
05:21:09.350 --> 05:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
is a food source for coyotes um you know
 
05:21:12.230 --> 05:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
acorns people love to talk about how
 
05:21:14.190 --> 05:21:14.200 align:start position:0%
turkeys eat the acorns that the deer
 
05:21:16.510 --> 05:21:16.520 align:start position:0%
should be eating everything eats acorns
 
05:21:19.110 --> 05:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
so you know it's I always find it
 
05:21:23.190 --> 05:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
interesting when people say you know um
 
05:21:25.670 --> 05:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
certain food sources is kind of reserved
 
05:21:28.510 --> 05:21:28.520 align:start position:0%
for an individual species um because
 
05:21:31.430 --> 05:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
again um most species eat a variet of
 
05:21:34.310 --> 05:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
things so um I would say absolutely
 
05:21:36.948 --> 05:21:36.958 align:start position:0%
turkeys are a food source for coyotes um
 
05:21:41.110 --> 05:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
deer fawns are um small mammals they eat
 
05:21:44.510 --> 05:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
fruits they eat nuts um I'll also state
 
05:21:47.548 --> 05:21:47.558 align:start position:0%
that we've seen um you know stable to
 
05:21:50.270 --> 05:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
increase in CI population increasing
 
05:21:52.830 --> 05:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
Turkey population increasing deer
 
05:21:55.788 --> 05:21:55.798 align:start position:0%
population um stable to increasing bear
 
05:21:57.990 --> 05:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
population depending on the the portion
 
05:21:59.750 --> 05:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
of the state you're you're talking about
 
05:22:02.430 --> 05:22:02.440 align:start position:0%
so we've seen a number of species all
 
05:22:04.510 --> 05:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
increasing um at the same time and and
 
05:22:07.270 --> 05:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
you'd mentioned it as well anecdotally
 
05:22:09.150 --> 05:22:09.160 align:start position:0%
more than anecdotally Bobcats as well so
 
05:22:10.750 --> 05:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
we've seen an increase in a number of
 
05:22:13.430 --> 05:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
these species um we don't have any
 
05:22:15.430 --> 05:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
indication that um really any of them
 
05:22:18.430 --> 05:22:18.440 align:start position:0%
are having State at a Statewide level a
 
05:22:20.070 --> 05:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
negative impact on the other at this
 
05:22:22.190 --> 05:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
point um if depending on the species
 
05:22:25.110 --> 05:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
you're talking about um but again we've
 
05:22:28.110 --> 05:22:28.120 align:start position:0%
seen increases in all those species um
 
05:22:29.430 --> 05:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
at the same
 
05:22:32.030 --> 05:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
time thank you and I I have another
 
05:22:33.510 --> 05:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
question before we get to everyone else
 
05:22:35.670 --> 05:22:35.680 align:start position:0%
because I was waiting for everyone else
 
05:22:41.070 --> 05:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
for so long um when it comes to uh
 
05:22:42.830 --> 05:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
determination of
 
05:22:45.270 --> 05:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
Seasons I have been on this committee
 
05:22:48.350 --> 05:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
for 10 years five terms in the house uh
 
05:22:50.310 --> 05:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
I've been a hunter for far many more
 
05:22:51.510 --> 05:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
than that and I'm not going to get into
 
05:22:52.788 --> 05:22:52.798 align:start position:0%
details because I don't want to date
 
05:22:55.150 --> 05:22:55.160 align:start position:0%
myself although no one else will so I
 
05:22:59.270 --> 05:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
might as well um the when it comes down
 
05:23:01.910 --> 05:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
to the fishing game setting season
 
05:23:05.190 --> 05:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
and listing species as managed species
 
05:23:06.948 --> 05:23:06.958 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that it's done on
 
05:23:08.590 --> 05:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
one criteria
 
05:23:12.470 --> 05:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
scientifically and not others the one
 
05:23:15.430 --> 05:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
criteria being will this species be
 
05:23:18.390 --> 05:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
harmed irreparably or suffer detriment
 
05:23:21.750 --> 05:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
if we don't have a season and don't have
 
05:23:23.708 --> 05:23:23.718 align:start position:0%
uh them listed as a managed species for
 
05:23:27.750 --> 05:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
bag limits or such um we don't typically
 
05:23:29.868 --> 05:23:29.878 align:start position:0%
take into account is it
 
05:23:33.350 --> 05:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
cute is it having babies if those were
 
05:23:34.948 --> 05:23:34.958 align:start position:0%
qualifications I think we'd never hunt
 
05:23:36.230 --> 05:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
bunnies because they're constantly
 
05:23:38.310 --> 05:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
having babies and they're always cute
 
05:23:40.270 --> 05:23:40.280 align:start position:0%
would you speak to the scientific
 
05:23:41.990 --> 05:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
determination that determines whether
 
05:23:45.030 --> 05:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
something is a managed species or has a
 
05:23:47.230 --> 05:23:47.240 align:start position:0%
season or bag limit set for it
 
05:23:49.868 --> 05:23:49.878 align:start position:0%
please um yeah so generally speaking the
 
05:23:51.990 --> 05:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
main criteria is whether or not there's
 
05:23:54.830 --> 05:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
a there the population can be
 
05:23:58.510 --> 05:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
sustainably Harvest harvested um so so
 
05:24:01.070 --> 05:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
certainly um again most of our name
 
05:24:04.150 --> 05:24:04.160 align:start position:0%
species have high reproductive potential
 
05:24:06.708 --> 05:24:06.718 align:start position:0%
um you know they're they're not limited
 
05:24:09.270 --> 05:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
by habitat or other things like that um
 
05:24:12.070 --> 05:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
so that is certainly the main criteria
 
05:24:14.110 --> 05:24:14.120 align:start position:0%
once a species is managed then we start
 
05:24:16.628 --> 05:24:16.638 align:start position:0%
to consider other factors where you have
 
05:24:18.788 --> 05:24:18.798 align:start position:0%
that Liberty but um that's certainly the
 
05:24:20.868 --> 05:24:20.878 align:start position:0%
main factor on whether or not to include
 
05:24:24.548 --> 05:24:24.558 align:start position:0%
a species as a managed species thank you
 
05:24:24.558 --> 05:24:25.990 align:start position:0%
a species as a managed species thank you
represent

05:24:25.990 --> 05:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
represent
 
05:24:30.910 --> 05:24:30.920 align:start position:0%
Ford thank you Mr chair um chief that it
 
05:24:33.470 --> 05:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
my question is not uh combative I just
 
05:24:36.670 --> 05:24:36.680 align:start position:0%
want to know and you can pass this on to
 
05:24:39.548 --> 05:24:39.558 align:start position:0%
I guess the Commissioners but 10 years
 
05:24:41.910 --> 05:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
with this particular coyote thing and
 
05:24:43.628 --> 05:24:43.638 align:start position:0%
today I've heard a lot of things that
 
05:24:46.390 --> 05:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
this keeps coming up and um the two
 
05:24:48.350 --> 05:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
sides debate whether or not it should be
 
05:24:50.750 --> 05:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
codified or keep it in the rules but
 
05:24:53.230 --> 05:24:53.240 align:start position:0%
clearly the rules aren't working because
 
05:24:55.868 --> 05:24:55.878 align:start position:0%
it keeps coming up so I guess my
 
05:24:58.670 --> 05:24:58.680 align:start position:0%
question is when will the Commissioners
 
05:25:01.150 --> 05:25:01.160 align:start position:0%
and the what is stated in your letter
 
05:25:04.510 --> 05:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
here the ability to place rules wait
 
05:25:06.788 --> 05:25:06.798 align:start position:0%
wait where was it or like the ability to
 
05:25:08.708 --> 05:25:08.718 align:start position:0%
set rules so when are we're going to get
 
05:25:11.070 --> 05:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
a rule about coyotes we're going to get
 
05:25:12.868 --> 05:25:12.878 align:start position:0%
a rule about all these other different
 
05:25:14.750 --> 05:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
things that we are saying leave it to us
 
05:25:17.430 --> 05:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
to set the rules but here we are 10th
 
05:25:19.830 --> 05:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
year of the same bill coming forth
 
05:25:21.230 --> 05:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
either the Commissioners and the fish
 
05:25:22.830 --> 05:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
and game department doesn't believe
 
05:25:25.030 --> 05:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
there should be a rule on coyotes or
 
05:25:26.670 --> 05:25:26.680 align:start position:0%
you're just choosing not to set a rule
 
05:25:28.070 --> 05:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
because you don't want to set a rule on
 
05:25:30.708 --> 05:25:30.718 align:start position:0%
coyotes which I would just like to know
 
05:25:33.430 --> 05:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that yes absolutely
 
05:25:38.030 --> 05:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
so um so this this question is largely
 
05:25:40.310 --> 05:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
um it's not a biological question
 
05:25:42.110 --> 05:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
because again all of our information
 
05:25:43.990 --> 05:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
suggests that the population is is
 
05:25:47.788 --> 05:25:47.798 align:start position:0%
healthy and stable um so therefore you
 
05:25:51.350 --> 05:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
have to base it on um you know again
 
05:25:54.070 --> 05:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
we're weighing input from a vast array
 
05:25:55.750 --> 05:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
of people who are um who are a
 
05:25:58.390 --> 05:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
constituents so um you know some would
 
05:26:00.030 --> 05:26:00.040 align:start position:0%
have us do nothing some would have us
 
05:26:03.430 --> 05:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
get rid of it Al together um so it's
 
05:26:05.868 --> 05:26:05.878 align:start position:0%
difficult to make those decisions when
 
05:26:08.310 --> 05:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
you're you're you're really not doing it
 
05:26:10.470 --> 05:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
for a biological reason um because again
 
05:26:11.990 --> 05:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
we have no reason to believe that the
 
05:26:14.150 --> 05:26:14.160 align:start position:0%
the coyote population is in Jeopardy
 
05:26:16.910 --> 05:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
from a population level
 
05:26:20.230 --> 05:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
perspective follow up that's what I was
 
05:26:22.430 --> 05:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
hoping you would say so how long will it
 
05:26:24.750 --> 05:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
take for us to get scientific biological
 
05:26:26.628 --> 05:26:26.638 align:start position:0%
data on coyotes in the state of New
 
05:26:29.070 --> 05:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if we're partnering with UNH
 
05:26:30.830 --> 05:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
and we're looking at the we're getting
 
05:26:32.548 --> 05:26:32.558 align:start position:0%
Trapper information to surveys how long
 
05:26:34.270 --> 05:26:34.280 align:start position:0%
will this take and will I have to wait
 
05:26:36.230 --> 05:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
another 10 years before yeah so so the
 
05:26:38.948 --> 05:26:38.958 align:start position:0%
trapping information we have um roughly
 
05:26:41.470 --> 05:26:41.480 align:start position:0%
30 years worth of that on what the trend
 
05:26:44.110 --> 05:26:44.120 align:start position:0%
in the population is um we've seen a
 
05:26:46.110 --> 05:26:46.120 align:start position:0%
decline in the number of Trappers in the
 
05:26:50.470 --> 05:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
state um so as the numbers decline your
 
05:26:52.270 --> 05:26:52.280 align:start position:0%
sample size gets smaller so then the
 
05:26:53.788 --> 05:26:53.798 align:start position:0%
data that you get you know you start to
 
05:26:55.470 --> 05:26:55.480 align:start position:0%
question is it still valid that's why
 
05:26:58.150 --> 05:26:58.160 align:start position:0%
we've um partnered with UNH um to do
 
05:26:59.948 --> 05:26:59.958 align:start position:0%
this camera research to come up with an
 
05:27:01.948 --> 05:27:01.958 align:start position:0%
additional index um to track some of
 
05:27:03.670 --> 05:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
these populations where where our sample
 
05:27:05.830 --> 05:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
sizes are smaller again there's you know
 
05:27:08.190 --> 05:27:08.200 align:start position:0%
there's 50 to 60,000 hunters in the
 
05:27:09.670 --> 05:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
state that provide us information on
 
05:27:11.230 --> 05:27:11.240 align:start position:0%
something like a white tail deer there's
 
05:27:12.788 --> 05:27:12.798 align:start position:0%
there's likely nowhere near that for a
 
05:27:14.830 --> 05:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
lot of these other species so um we have
 
05:27:16.708 --> 05:27:16.718 align:start position:0%
to come up with alternate ways to to
 
05:27:19.070 --> 05:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
find that information um anytime you
 
05:27:20.628 --> 05:27:20.638 align:start position:0%
start to collect new information
 
05:27:22.150 --> 05:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
particularly Trend information it takes
 
05:27:24.990 --> 05:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
at least a few years um to you know one
 
05:27:27.070 --> 05:27:27.080 align:start position:0%
one point on the map tells you virtually
 
05:27:31.390 --> 05:27:31.400 align:start position:0%
nothing um so you know we we would it
 
05:27:32.910 --> 05:27:32.920 align:start position:0%
would be at least a few years worth of
 
05:27:35.070 --> 05:27:35.080 align:start position:0%
data I think before we felt comfortable
 
05:27:36.628 --> 05:27:36.638 align:start position:0%
now it depends what questions being
 
05:27:39.430 --> 05:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
asked as well so um you know with
 
05:27:41.868 --> 05:27:41.878 align:start position:0%
mandatory registration um we'll start to
 
05:27:43.590 --> 05:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
get the number of people that do this at
 
05:27:45.510 --> 05:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
different times a year how many animals
 
05:27:47.628 --> 05:27:47.638 align:start position:0%
they're taking and that at the very
 
05:27:50.750 --> 05:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
least would give us an idea of um um you
 
05:27:53.110 --> 05:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
know under current structures um when
 
05:27:55.190 --> 05:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
are the bulk of these animals taking
 
05:27:57.110 --> 05:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
place so if you were to shorten things
 
05:27:59.350 --> 05:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
at this end or that end um is there
 
05:28:01.350 --> 05:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
going to be big impact no impact you
 
05:28:02.910 --> 05:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
know again we'll be speaking in general
 
05:28:05.110 --> 05:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
terms but you know after a couple years
 
05:28:08.230 --> 05:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
we'd probably have that type of
 
05:28:10.628 --> 05:28:10.638 align:start position:0%
information thank you and representative
 
05:28:13.230 --> 05:28:13.240 align:start position:0%
Darby thank you Mr chair um just
 
05:28:15.070 --> 05:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
following up on the the last two
 
05:28:18.590 --> 05:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
questions um can you um can you describe
 
05:28:22.310 --> 05:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
the reason um then for the the fox
 
05:28:24.270 --> 05:28:24.280 align:start position:0%
there's a fox season um a closed Fox
 
05:28:27.948 --> 05:28:27.958 align:start position:0%
season and not a closed um closed coyote
 
05:28:31.150 --> 05:28:31.160 align:start position:0%
season um it's likely it's likely
 
05:28:34.548 --> 05:28:34.558 align:start position:0%
largely um historical um when coyotes
 
05:28:37.910 --> 05:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
because again coyotes um coyotes are
 
05:28:40.670 --> 05:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
somewhat more of a recent um species in
 
05:28:43.830 --> 05:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire um they also
 
05:28:46.470 --> 05:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
are there's biologically a lot of
 
05:28:48.430 --> 05:28:48.440 align:start position:0%
differences between productivity rates
 
05:28:51.030 --> 05:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
of coyotes and foxes coyotes are a
 
05:28:53.430 --> 05:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
generalist species um they have higher
 
05:28:56.270 --> 05:28:56.280 align:start position:0%
reproductive potential um so that alone
 
05:28:58.350 --> 05:28:58.360 align:start position:0%
would would necessitate some differences
 
05:29:00.750 --> 05:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
in the season structure um some of it
 
05:29:02.948 --> 05:29:02.958 align:start position:0%
might be again you know historically
 
05:29:06.070 --> 05:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
that's what the seasons were um again
 
05:29:07.990 --> 05:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
long-term looking at the data there's
 
05:29:09.390 --> 05:29:09.400 align:start position:0%
nothing to indicate that the current
 
05:29:10.910 --> 05:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
season structur is having a negative
 
05:29:14.470 --> 05:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
impact on the population um but you know
 
05:29:16.350 --> 05:29:16.360 align:start position:0%
and there's you'll see that you I mean
 
05:29:18.868 --> 05:29:18.878 align:start position:0%
some even within an individual species
 
05:29:20.830 --> 05:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes we'll have varying Seasons
 
05:29:22.548 --> 05:29:22.558 align:start position:0%
from one part of the state to the next
 
05:29:26.350 --> 05:29:26.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:29.310 --> 05:29:29.320 align:start position:0%
variation thank you any other
 
05:29:29.320 --> 05:29:31.230 align:start position:0%
variation thank you any other
questions

05:29:31.230 --> 05:29:31.240 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:29:33.150 --> 05:29:33.160 align:start position:0%
representative Brown uh thank you Mr
 
05:29:36.548 --> 05:29:36.558 align:start position:0%
chair and thanks for taking my question
 
05:29:40.230 --> 05:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
again so
 
05:29:44.548 --> 05:29:44.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:49.830 --> 05:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
mind okay not too much keep
 
05:29:52.470 --> 05:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
writing any other
 
05:29:54.750 --> 05:29:54.760 align:start position:0%
questions all right seeing none thank

05:30:31.868 --> 05:30:31.878 align:start position:0%
that um I'm actually not going to speak
 
05:30:34.230 --> 05:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
for 3 minutes because I submitted
 
05:30:36.670 --> 05:30:36.680 align:start position:0%
written testimony my name is BJ wall I
 
05:30:40.030 --> 05:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
live in Sullivan which is near Keen um
 
05:30:41.830 --> 05:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
the only thing I do want to say and I I
 
05:30:44.830 --> 05:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
do hope you read my written testimony is
 
05:30:46.628 --> 05:30:46.638 align:start position:0%
that when I went online this morning and
 
05:30:48.990 --> 05:30:49.000 align:start position:0%
looked at all of the online submissions
 
05:30:51.390 --> 05:30:51.400 align:start position:0%
there were well over 200 people in
 
05:30:53.350 --> 05:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
support of this bill and there were
 
05:30:57.070 --> 05:30:57.080 align:start position:0%
seven people opposed to it and if this
 
05:30:59.510 --> 05:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
committee and the legislature in general
 
05:31:01.110 --> 05:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
is truly
 
05:31:03.910 --> 05:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
supposed to represent the people then I
 
05:31:06.590 --> 05:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
feel like you have no choice but to
 
05:31:08.948 --> 05:31:08.958 align:start position:0%
support this bill because it's clearly
 
05:31:10.948 --> 05:31:10.958 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly the will of the people
 
05:31:13.110 --> 05:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
that this bill be passed that's all I
 
05:31:14.708 --> 05:31:14.718 align:start position:0%
need to
 
05:31:17.910 --> 05:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
say thank you are there any
 
05:31:20.190 --> 05:31:20.200 align:start position:0%

hb100 we can take a five minute break uh
 
05:31:32.670 --> 05:31:32.680 align:start position:0%
expect people can caucus if they want to
 
05:31:40.788 --> 05:31:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:59.070 --> 05:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:59.080 --> 05:45:48.750 align:start position:0%
 
moments

05:45:48.750 --> 05:45:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:52.990 --> 05:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:55.708 --> 05:45:55.718 align:start position:0%

05:46:07.190 --> 05:46:07.200 align:start position:0%

05:46:29.430 --> 05:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
05:46:32.110 --> 05:46:32.120 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to uh look to rep ulette
 
05:46:34.030 --> 05:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
to make a
 
05:46:37.468 --> 05:46:37.478 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chairman I move that
 
05:46:41.628 --> 05:46:41.638 align:start position:0%
we um itl HB
 
05:46:45.510 --> 05:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:49.590 --> 05:46:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:52.628 --> 05:46:52.638 align:start position:0%
seconded any
 
05:46:55.468 --> 05:46:55.478 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Darby thank
 
05:46:59.030 --> 05:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I believe that um Fishing
 
05:47:01.468 --> 05:47:01.478 align:start position:0%
Game Commission should be um The
 
05:47:04.990 --> 05:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
Authority for setting um for setting uh
 
05:47:08.468 --> 05:47:08.478 align:start position:0%
hunting and fishing um dates and Seasons
 
05:47:12.670 --> 05:47:12.680 align:start position:0%
that being said I'm very um I personally
 
05:47:14.948 --> 05:47:14.958 align:start position:0%
oppose and I think that my constituents
 
05:47:17.750 --> 05:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
personally would also oppose um the
 
05:47:22.110 --> 05:47:22.120 align:start position:0%
hunting of uh coyotes by with dogs which
 
05:47:25.788 --> 05:47:25.798 align:start position:0%
is a very small population I know during
 
05:47:28.390 --> 05:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
um the critical P bearing um phase
 
05:47:29.750 --> 05:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
especially especially Denning but even
 
05:47:32.590 --> 05:47:32.600 align:start position:0%
the uh first few weeks after Denning so
 
05:47:34.830 --> 05:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
I'll be uh I'll be supporting the itail
 
05:47:37.230 --> 05:47:37.240 align:start position:0%
motion but I surely hope that uh The
 
05:47:40.350 --> 05:47:40.360 align:start position:0%
Fishing Game Commission can consider um
 
05:47:43.150 --> 05:47:43.160 align:start position:0%
what I would consider ethical rules um
 
05:47:47.230 --> 05:47:47.240 align:start position:0%
of of uh Denning um Denny mothers that
 
05:47:50.230 --> 05:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh Denning coyote mothers that protect
 
05:47:52.590 --> 05:47:52.600 align:start position:0%
hunting rights as well in the future
 
05:47:54.548 --> 05:47:54.558 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Darby I I think
 
05:47:56.230 --> 05:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
I will mention to you that there's a
 
05:47:58.150 --> 05:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
bill in the Senate I believe uh
 
05:47:59.948 --> 05:47:59.958 align:start position:0%
regarding hunting with dogs but this
 
05:48:02.390 --> 05:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
bill does not address any of the dog
 
05:48:05.468 --> 05:48:05.478 align:start position:0%
issue um any other discussion on the
 
05:48:07.628 --> 05:48:07.638 align:start position:0%
bill representative
 
05:48:12.030 --> 05:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
Ford thank you Mr chair I um I
 
05:48:14.110 --> 05:48:14.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate this bill I just it's one of
 
05:48:18.070 --> 05:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
those things where um as a newbie um to
 
05:48:20.270 --> 05:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
the legislature and also to this
 
05:48:22.310 --> 05:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
committee to hear that something has
 
05:48:24.910 --> 05:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
come up multiple times um in
 
05:48:26.468 --> 05:48:26.478 align:start position:0%
understanding like to hear this next
 
05:48:28.708 --> 05:48:28.718 align:start position:0%
year and the year after because you know
 
05:48:30.390 --> 05:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
constituents and folks on the committee
 
05:48:33.830 --> 05:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
May um want this type of thing and so um
 
05:48:35.868 --> 05:48:35.878 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the conversation that we're
 
05:48:38.670 --> 05:48:38.680 align:start position:0%
having about this and um I'm starting to
 
05:48:41.670 --> 05:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
lean toward letting the rules uh the
 
05:48:44.230 --> 05:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
rules folks create the rules but at some
 
05:48:47.510 --> 05:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
point we have to um we have to do
 
05:48:48.910 --> 05:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
something and I don't want to be another
 
05:48:52.390 --> 05:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
10 years of data collection and research
 
05:48:55.230 --> 05:48:55.240 align:start position:0%
and all these things where um or use of
 
05:48:57.310 --> 05:48:57.320 align:start position:0%
cameras or survey usage and things like
 
05:49:00.750 --> 05:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
that um but I I think I I think I will
 
05:49:04.230 --> 05:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
be supporting the it on this particular
 
05:49:05.830 --> 05:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
bill just based on conversation or
 
05:49:08.390 --> 05:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
hearing that the division the department
 
05:49:10.070 --> 05:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
will be working on collecting data
 
05:49:12.670 --> 05:49:12.680 align:start position:0%
having data for us in regards to Coyote
 
05:49:15.468 --> 05:49:15.478 align:start position:0%
so that next session we don't hear we
 
05:49:17.150 --> 05:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
need to pass something without having
 
05:49:19.070 --> 05:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
data so I would like to have the data
 
05:49:22.190 --> 05:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
for that thank you representative Harvey
 
05:49:25.910 --> 05:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
um so being the per one of the one of
 
05:49:27.350 --> 05:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
the members of this committee that
 
05:49:29.150 --> 05:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
actually goes to fishing game
 
05:49:32.590 --> 05:49:32.600 align:start position:0%
um I can tell you uh representative Ford
 
05:49:36.708 --> 05:49:36.718 align:start position:0%
the coyote question was uh debated and
 
05:49:40.510 --> 05:49:40.520 align:start position:0%
um two Commissioners actually voted uh
 
05:49:44.548 --> 05:49:44.558 align:start position:0%
to um Institute some sort of season so I
 
05:49:48.230 --> 05:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
I think that um the the commission is
 
05:49:48.240 --> 05:49:49.750 align:start position:0%
I think that um the the commission is
hearing

05:49:49.750 --> 05:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
05:49:52.510 --> 05:49:52.520 align:start position:0%
us is hearing us
 
05:49:56.230 --> 05:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
thanks any further discussion on
 
05:49:59.548 --> 05:49:59.558 align:start position:0%
this representative goalie
 
05:50:00.948 --> 05:50:00.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I will be
 
05:50:04.430 --> 05:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
supporting the itl um I do believe that
 
05:50:06.548 --> 05:50:06.558 align:start position:0%
season setting belongs in rules and this
 
05:50:08.310 --> 05:50:08.320 align:start position:0%
is going down a slippery slope putting
 
05:50:12.430 --> 05:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
this into statute um and I also you know
 
05:50:14.548 --> 05:50:14.558 align:start position:0%
believe that you know hearing the way
 
05:50:16.548 --> 05:50:16.558 align:start position:0%
things are going right now with no
 
05:50:18.868 --> 05:50:18.878 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements we don't even
 
05:50:23.270 --> 05:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
know if there's 1 5 10 15 coyotes killed
 
05:50:25.230 --> 05:50:25.240 align:start position:0%
during this period of time during this
 
05:50:26.948 --> 05:50:26.958 align:start position:0%
hunting season going on now the
 
05:50:28.110 --> 05:50:28.120 align:start position:0%
department is going to do something
 
05:50:29.310 --> 05:50:29.320 align:start position:0%
about it they're going to require
 
05:50:31.548 --> 05:50:31.558 align:start position:0%
reporting we'll get the data we can find
 
05:50:33.910 --> 05:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
out what's going on and see where what's
 
05:50:35.350 --> 05:50:35.360 align:start position:0%
happening with this but until we have
 
05:50:37.670 --> 05:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
that data I think it's not right to move
 
05:50:39.548 --> 05:50:39.558 align:start position:0%
forward with this and hopefully they
 
05:50:41.910 --> 05:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
keep this coyote reporting on the muzzle
 
05:50:44.788 --> 05:50:44.798 align:start position:0%
loader and deer archery Hunter survey
 
05:50:47.430 --> 05:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
that goes out because some of us didn't
 
05:50:49.110 --> 05:50:49.120 align:start position:0%
see it on the last
 
05:50:52.830 --> 05:50:52.840 align:start position:0%
one any other questions conversation
 
05:50:52.840 --> 05:50:54.110 align:start position:0%
one any other questions conversation
representative

05:50:54.110 --> 05:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:50:59.270 --> 05:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you um just this year alone
 
05:51:01.708 --> 05:51:01.718 align:start position:0%
this committee has passed unanimously
 
05:51:03.548 --> 05:51:03.558 align:start position:0%
putting things that have always been in
 
05:51:06.948 --> 05:51:06.958 align:start position:0%
rules only in rules into statute this
 
05:51:09.670 --> 05:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
particular issue hasn't come before the
 
05:51:12.190 --> 05:51:12.200 align:start position:0%
legislature more than twice I introduced
 
05:51:14.110 --> 05:51:14.120 align:start position:0%
it in 2019 and now I'm introducing it
 
05:51:16.390 --> 05:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
now but it has become come before the
 
05:51:18.788 --> 05:51:18.798 align:start position:0%
commission over and over and over and
 
05:51:20.750 --> 05:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
over again and it's the culture of the
 
05:51:22.270 --> 05:51:22.280 align:start position:0%
commission that's the issue and it's our
 
05:51:25.910 --> 05:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
job to actually reign in any for
 
05:51:27.430 --> 05:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
whatever committee to reign in the
 
05:51:28.548 --> 05:51:28.558 align:start position:0%
department when the department is is
 
05:51:30.708 --> 05:51:30.718 align:start position:0%

05:51:47.708 --> 05:51:47.718 align:start position:0%
of the State of New Hampshire and to set
 
05:51:49.708 --> 05:51:49.718 align:start position:0%
General policy in the following areas
 
05:51:51.830 --> 05:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
and the area that is most pertinent is
 
05:51:53.670 --> 05:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
the first which is conservation
 
05:51:55.150 --> 05:51:55.160 align:start position:0%
protection and management of wildlife
 
05:51:56.990 --> 05:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
populations and habitats the collection
 
05:51:59.190 --> 05:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
of necessary scientific information and
 
05:52:00.830 --> 05:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
the enforcement of fish and game laws
 
05:52:02.230 --> 05:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of sustaining healthy
 
05:52:04.190 --> 05:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
populations of Fish Wildlife and Marine
 
05:52:06.468 --> 05:52:06.478 align:start position:0%
Resources and we've seen the culture of
 
05:52:08.430 --> 05:52:08.440 align:start position:0%
this particular commission go against
 
05:52:11.390 --> 05:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
that over and over and over so after all
 
05:52:13.628 --> 05:52:13.638 align:start position:0%
of these years and all of these attempts
 
05:52:16.590 --> 05:52:16.600 align:start position:0%
it is our job to step in like we did
 
05:52:19.948 --> 05:52:19.958 align:start position:0%
with the caliber of uh of bullets for
 
05:52:22.868 --> 05:52:22.878 align:start position:0%
example so yeah we I think we have to do
 
05:52:25.830 --> 05:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:28.708 --> 05:52:28.718 align:start position:0%
point any further comments Jeff
 
05:52:31.270 --> 05:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
represented goalie thank you Mr chair
 
05:52:32.750 --> 05:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
and as we talk about the mission of
 
05:52:34.430 --> 05:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
fishing game I believe they are being
 
05:52:36.070 --> 05:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
true stewards because I have not heard
 
05:52:38.150 --> 05:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
of any reduction
 
05:52:41.430 --> 05:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
or serious decline in the coyote
 
05:52:43.670 --> 05:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
population nor is it in Jeopardy of
 
05:52:45.708 --> 05:52:45.718 align:start position:0%
going that way thank
 
05:52:48.788 --> 05:52:48.798 align:start position:0%
you representative Reed and I don't want
 
05:52:51.230 --> 05:52:51.240 align:start position:0%
this to become a debate so let's go
 
05:52:53.110 --> 05:52:53.120 align:start position:0%
ahead and make our comments then we can
 
05:52:58.548 --> 05:52:58.558 align:start position:0%
leave it at two and two then um so as we
 
05:53:00.990 --> 05:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
talked about as many people testified to
 
05:53:03.590 --> 05:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
including the state's best experts on
 
05:53:05.670 --> 05:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
coyote coyote engage in responsive
 
05:53:08.110 --> 05:53:08.120 align:start position:0%
reproduction so that would explain very
 
05:53:10.310 --> 05:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
well why the populations have remained
 
05:53:13.310 --> 05:53:13.320 align:start position:0%
stable what hasn't remained stable is
 
05:53:15.510 --> 05:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
the interactions between coyote and
 
05:53:17.150 --> 05:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
humans and the reason that hasn't
 
05:53:19.270 --> 05:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
remained stable is because the coyote
 
05:53:21.150 --> 05:53:21.160 align:start position:0%
become nuisance coyote when they are
 
05:53:23.670 --> 05:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
forced to go out into the wild without
 
05:53:25.628 --> 05:53:25.638 align:start position:0%
proper guidance as to what their the
 
05:53:27.750 --> 05:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
correct food sources are and that's
 
05:53:29.150 --> 05:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
what's happen happening when we hunt
 
05:53:31.830 --> 05:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
them indiscriminately year
 
05:53:34.468 --> 05:53:34.478 align:start position:0%
round any further comments before we
 
05:53:38.150 --> 05:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
take the role representative Ford I just
 
05:53:41.868 --> 05:53:41.878 align:start position:0%
have a question shair um question of the
 
05:53:45.030 --> 05:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
chair of like can I ask representative
 
05:53:48.230 --> 05:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
Reed a question yeah like we're having
 
05:53:49.990 --> 05:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
discussion go for it but this is not
 
05:53:52.110 --> 05:53:52.120 align:start position:0%
going to become a debate okay no no it's
 
05:53:55.270 --> 05:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
a um I guess my question
 
05:53:58.230 --> 05:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
is knowing what it what this bill is
 
05:54:01.150 --> 05:54:01.160 align:start position:0%
about would you be okay with the fish
 
05:54:03.230 --> 05:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
and game department collecting data to
 
05:54:06.270 --> 05:54:06.280 align:start position:0%
say this is the this is how many coyotes
 
05:54:08.548 --> 05:54:08.558 align:start position:0%
we have or this is projection of what we
 
05:54:12.468 --> 05:54:12.478 align:start position:0%
have and this is what we know of for the
 
05:54:13.868 --> 05:54:13.878 align:start position:0%
baby making period I don't know what
 
05:54:17.230 --> 05:54:17.240 align:start position:0%
it's called natural world um but this is
 
05:54:18.948 --> 05:54:18.958 align:start position:0%
the period and this is the time that we
 
05:54:21.468 --> 05:54:21.478 align:start position:0%
would set forth if we wanted to have a
 
05:54:23.468 --> 05:54:23.478 align:start position:0%
freeze on Hunting of coyotes would you
 
05:54:25.390 --> 05:54:25.400 align:start position:0%
be okay with them having that period of
 
05:54:28.230 --> 05:54:28.240 align:start position:0%
time to give us the data if do doesn't
 
05:54:29.390 --> 05:54:29.400 align:start position:0%
make sense when I'm asking are you
 
05:54:31.750 --> 05:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
asking for a moratorium on coyote
 
05:54:33.670 --> 05:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
hunting while they collect the data is
 
05:54:36.390 --> 05:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
that you set a freeze no no no no no no
 
05:54:38.390 --> 05:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
no no no no no no I know what committee
 
05:54:41.628 --> 05:54:41.638 align:start position:0%
I'm on I'm not GNA be calling for that
 
05:54:45.548 --> 05:54:45.558 align:start position:0%
hunting okay um to answer your question
 
05:54:47.150 --> 05:54:47.160 align:start position:0%
I think as I heard your question you can
 
05:54:49.350 --> 05:54:49.360 align:start position:0%
correct me if I if I didn't understand
 
05:54:51.230 --> 05:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
correctly am I in favor of the
 
05:54:52.990 --> 05:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
department collecting data yes the
 
05:54:55.468 --> 05:54:55.478 align:start position:0%
Department's job as I just read is to
 
05:54:58.270 --> 05:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
collect scientific data we do not fund
 
05:55:00.590 --> 05:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
those particular activities at the
 
05:55:02.750 --> 05:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
levels that need to be done for coyote
 
05:55:06.070 --> 05:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
or any other species we don't give them
 
05:55:08.110 --> 05:55:08.120 align:start position:0%
what they need to collect the scientific
 
05:55:11.110 --> 05:55:11.120 align:start position:0%
information to do appropriate um to
 
05:55:14.350 --> 05:55:14.360 align:start position:0%
collect appropriate data and and um and
 
05:55:16.750 --> 05:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
give us what what we really want out of
 
05:55:18.750 --> 05:55:18.760 align:start position:0%
the department so is that going to
 
05:55:20.430 --> 05:55:20.440 align:start position:0%
change are we going to change this into
 
05:55:22.628 --> 05:55:22.638 align:start position:0%
a funding bill so we can fund that data
 
05:55:24.270 --> 05:55:24.280 align:start position:0%
collection and if that's not going to
 
05:55:26.788 --> 05:55:26.798 align:start position:0%
happen then I really struggle to
 
05:55:28.430 --> 05:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
understand what additional information
 
05:55:30.110 --> 05:55:30.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to get if we're not going to
 
05:55:31.708 --> 05:55:31.718 align:start position:0%
fund that data collection that we
 
05:55:34.628 --> 05:55:34.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:38.868 --> 05:55:38.878 align:start position:0%
fund all right any other questions

Mr chair it's been moved and seconded do
 
06:01:04.830 --> 06:01:04.840 align:start position:0%
we have any discussion on hb1
 
06:01:08.750 --> 06:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
1417 yes sir uh Mr chairman I uh put
 
06:01:10.830 --> 06:01:10.840 align:start position:0%
forth an itl motion based on the fact
 
06:01:12.788 --> 06:01:12.798 align:start position:0%
that fishing game already has a vehicle
 
06:01:15.150 --> 06:01:15.160 align:start position:0%
for trout management and we do not need
 
06:01:17.750 --> 06:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
to codify this in New Hampshire
 
06:01:21.628 --> 06:01:21.638 align:start position:0%
statute thank you is there any further
 
06:01:25.590 --> 06:01:25.600 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none oh oh
 
06:01:29.190 --> 06:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
representative Reed thank you I disagree
 
06:01:31.430 --> 06:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
that we don't need to codify it because
 
06:01:33.990 --> 06:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
the department has not added any Waters
 
06:01:36.750 --> 06:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
in 20 years because the department's
 
06:01:41.390 --> 06:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
website has I guess mysteriously um the
 
06:01:43.070 --> 06:01:43.080 align:start position:0%
information about the program has
 
06:01:46.030 --> 06:01:46.040 align:start position:0%
disappeared uh the bill as written gives
 
06:01:48.590 --> 06:01:48.600 align:start position:0%
the department great leeway as to how
 
06:01:50.548 --> 06:01:50.558 align:start position:0%
they manage that program and what Waters
 
06:01:53.270 --> 06:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
to include or take off to grow the
 
06:01:55.750 --> 06:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
program and even shrink the program um
 
06:01:57.548 --> 06:01:57.558 align:start position:0%
but what is clear is the department has
 
06:02:00.230 --> 06:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
not taken this program for years very
 
06:02:02.110 --> 06:02:02.120 align:start position:0%
seriously I do hope that that will
 
06:02:04.670 --> 06:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
change but um this has been an issue
 
06:02:06.830 --> 06:02:06.840 align:start position:0%
that has been brought to them repeatedly
 
06:02:08.110 --> 06:02:08.120 align:start position:0%
and they've repeatedly promised they
 
06:02:09.670 --> 06:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
would do something about it and as of
 
06:02:12.548 --> 06:02:12.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:16.270 --> 06:02:16.280 align:start position:0%

does anybody have any comments on this
 
06:05:00.948 --> 06:05:00.958 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I feel strongly that HB 1148
 
06:05:03.110 --> 06:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
was recommended for interim study by its
 
06:05:05.590 --> 06:05:05.600 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor and therefore I recommend
 
06:05:10.590 --> 06:05:10.600 align:start position:0%
that thank you any other input on this a
 
06:05:12.750 --> 06:05:12.760 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor want to say

anything I I think it's the right
 
06:05:16.590 --> 06:05:16.600 align:start position:0%
decision I I hope that when we have an
 
06:05:18.990 --> 06:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
interim study it's a legitimate interim
 
06:05:21.390 --> 06:05:21.400 align:start position:0%
study and we really do look at the
 
06:05:23.270 --> 06:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
question and see if we can come to some
 
06:05:26.390 --> 06:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
sort of um consensus so that we don't

pass on House Bill 1029 do I have a
 
06:07:18.990 --> 06:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
second on that
 
06:07:23.948 --> 06:07:23.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:26.430 --> 06:07:26.440 align:start position:0%
tutor representative Smith you're free
 
06:07:29.788 --> 06:07:29.798 align:start position:0%
to speak now or offer amendments as such
 
06:07:32.350 --> 06:07:32.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh every there was an
 
06:07:34.708 --> 06:07:34.718 align:start position:0%
amendment passed out number
 
06:07:36.868 --> 06:07:36.878 align:start position:0%
0519 everyone should have it in front of
 
06:07:38.990 --> 06:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
them this amendment addresses the
 
06:07:41.230 --> 06:07:41.240 align:start position:0%
concerns that were inuring testimony
 
06:07:44.270 --> 06:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
regarding uh the manner of taking it now
 
06:07:47.270 --> 06:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
says any legal legal mean so you can't
 
06:07:48.830 --> 06:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
misconstrue that you took it in an
 
06:07:51.070 --> 06:07:51.080 align:start position:0%
illegal fashion and bring it to Shore
 
06:07:53.030 --> 06:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
and the also concern was that New
 
06:07:55.310 --> 06:07:55.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um excuse me that Maine and
 
06:07:57.070 --> 06:07:57.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts residents would benefit
 
06:07:59.270 --> 06:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
this this clarifies it also that it only
 
06:08:00.948 --> 06:08:00.958 align:start position:0%
applies to New Hampshire residents so
 
06:08:02.708 --> 06:08:02.718 align:start position:0%
those were the two big concerns that
 
06:08:04.190 --> 06:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
were presented and I think this bill
 
06:08:07.030 --> 06:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
clarifies that and uh excuse me this
 
06:08:09.788 --> 06:08:09.798 align:start position:0%
amendment clarifies that and uh it makes
 
06:08:12.708 --> 06:08:12.718 align:start position:0%
it my mind
 
06:08:15.670 --> 06:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
passable representative
 
06:08:19.628 --> 06:08:19.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:23.708 --> 06:08:23.718 align:start position:0%
chair I don't believe it still fixes the
 
06:08:28.270 --> 06:08:28.280 align:start position:0%
problem we heard that
 
06:08:32.990 --> 06:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:35.110 --> 06:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could not take now we've
 
06:08:36.230 --> 06:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
introduced the amendment we're going to
 
06:08:39.468 --> 06:08:39.478 align:start position:0%
take a vote on the amendment who M will
 
06:08:43.110 --> 06:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
someone who m a boat in another state
 
06:08:45.590 --> 06:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
could not I could not take the lobsters
 
06:08:49.390 --> 06:08:49.400 align:start position:0%
into Maine and not have to be required
 
06:08:53.990 --> 06:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
to a uh get a landing permit and also
 
06:08:55.708 --> 06:08:55.718 align:start position:0%
the same thing went on
 
06:09:00.350 --> 06:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
for folks who brought their catch into
 
06:09:05.510 --> 06:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so this doesn't solve that
 
06:09:08.030 --> 06:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
issue also the issue goes
 
06:09:10.750 --> 06:09:10.760 align:start position:0%
to reporting requirements that are
 
06:09:13.830 --> 06:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
required by the Atlantic marine
 
06:09:16.030 --> 06:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
fisheries this goes around that
 
06:09:18.830 --> 06:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
reporting as well that is required for
 
06:09:20.670 --> 06:09:20.680 align:start position:0%
the states to do up and down the East
 
06:09:23.430 --> 06:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
Coast um this takes that reporting away
 
06:09:25.868 --> 06:09:25.878 align:start position:0%
and for for that reason I cannot support
 
06:09:25.878 --> 06:09:27.350 align:start position:0%
and for for that reason I cannot support
this

06:09:27.350 --> 06:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:09:30.628 --> 06:09:30.638 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Harvey um I I
 
06:09:32.750 --> 06:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
won't be supporting this bill either as
 
06:09:34.548 --> 06:09:34.558 align:start position:0%
we heard more and more testimony I just
 
06:09:36.788 --> 06:09:36.798 align:start position:0%
kept getting more and more confused but
 
06:09:38.590 --> 06:09:38.600 align:start position:0%
more and more confused on a higher level
 
06:09:42.110 --> 06:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
I guess um and I don't think that this
 
06:09:44.430 --> 06:09:44.440 align:start position:0%
answers the the questions that were
 
06:09:45.990 --> 06:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
posed this morning in fact I think I
 
06:09:47.948 --> 06:09:47.958 align:start position:0%
heard at one point a statement that was
 
06:09:50.310 --> 06:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
made so we're being asked to pass a bill
 
06:09:52.948 --> 06:09:52.958 align:start position:0%
that's basically illegal and um so I
 
06:09:55.628 --> 06:09:55.638 align:start position:0%
won't be supporting this
 
06:09:55.638 --> 06:09:58.230 align:start position:0%
won't be supporting this
yes

06:09:58.230 --> 06:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:10:00.708 --> 06:10:00.718 align:start position:0%
any further
 
06:10:03.868 --> 06:10:03.878 align:start position:0%
comments representative Khan thank you
 
06:10:06.868 --> 06:10:06.878 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh Mr chairman uh we heard
 
06:10:10.230 --> 06:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
the testimony this morning from multiple
 
06:10:13.430 --> 06:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
fishing industry uh uh
 
06:10:16.628 --> 06:10:16.638 align:start position:0%
representative uh also the fish and game
 
06:10:19.830 --> 06:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative and their written
 
06:10:24.110 --> 06:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
testimony states that um how big this
 
06:10:26.628 --> 06:10:26.638 align:start position:0%
industry is and how much they are
 
06:10:29.310 --> 06:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
helping our niham economy for many years
 
06:10:33.070 --> 06:10:33.080 align:start position:0%
and uh in order to touch this uh
 
06:10:36.030 --> 06:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
industry we have to be very careful that
 
06:10:39.390 --> 06:10:39.400 align:start position:0%
how we can affect negatively so
 
06:10:42.628 --> 06:10:42.638 align:start position:0%
therefore you know after listening after
 
06:10:45.150 --> 06:10:45.160 align:start position:0%
for me coming from SE Coast I cannot
 
06:10:48.510 --> 06:10:48.520 align:start position:0%

06:10:51.270 --> 06:10:51.280 align:start position:0%

I would like to uh reinforce
 
06:11:11.708 --> 06:11:11.718 align:start position:0%
representative Khan's um comments that
 
06:11:13.628 --> 06:11:13.638 align:start position:0%
the commercial fishing industry came
 
06:11:15.708 --> 06:11:15.718 align:start position:0%
against it they are facing a lot of
 
06:11:18.788 --> 06:11:18.798 align:start position:0%
pressure as the um new regulations are
 
06:11:21.628 --> 06:11:21.638 align:start position:0%
being um passed um on Commercial
 
06:11:23.788 --> 06:11:23.798 align:start position:0%
lobstering and uh the reporting
 
06:11:25.788 --> 06:11:25.798 align:start position:0%
requirements are more important than
 
06:11:28.350 --> 06:11:28.360 align:start position:0%
ever and as we heard from uh fishing
 
06:11:31.708 --> 06:11:31.718 align:start position:0%
game this will really um go around the
 
06:11:35.310 --> 06:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements for the um uh for
 
06:11:39.350 --> 06:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
the um recreational angles thank you
 
06:11:41.590 --> 06:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
thank you any further
 
06:11:43.830 --> 06:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
comments we are on the
 
06:11:46.270 --> 06:11:46.280 align:start position:0%
amendment representative
 
06:11:50.030 --> 06:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you Mr chair and I just you
 
06:11:52.830 --> 06:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
know we heard
 
06:11:55.190 --> 06:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
about the price for non-resident
 
06:11:57.350 --> 06:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
licensing and
 
06:11:59.468 --> 06:11:59.478 align:start position:0%
that is an exorbitant amount and I would
 
06:12:01.190 --> 06:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
hope at some point we can address that
 
06:12:02.830 --> 06:12:02.840 align:start position:0%
and bring it down a little bit so that
 
06:12:06.590 --> 06:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
folks can afford this um but other than
 
06:12:08.830 --> 06:12:08.840 align:start position:0%
that that's I think about the only
 
06:12:10.468 --> 06:12:10.478 align:start position:0%
change that really needs to be
 
06:12:12.670 --> 06:12:12.680 align:start position:0%
addressed thank you before I forget I'm
 
06:12:14.190 --> 06:12:14.200 align:start position:0%

as otpa at this point I know a lot of
 
06:13:54.468 --> 06:13:54.478 align:start position:0%
the discussion on the amendment was
 
06:13:56.590 --> 06:13:56.600 align:start position:0%
actually on the underlying bill but uh
 
06:13:58.270 --> 06:13:58.280 align:start position:0%
I'm flexible that
 
06:14:01.070 --> 06:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
way and so seeing none I will ask the

06:14:13.548 --> 06:14:13.558 align:start position:0%
um Atlantic State Fisheries um
 
06:14:13.558 --> 06:14:15.468 align:start position:0%
um Atlantic State Fisheries um
requirement

06:14:15.468 --> 06:14:15.478 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
06:14:19.430 --> 06:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
of the uh marking down on the catch here
 
06:14:21.430 --> 06:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire if we go by passing
 
06:14:24.190 --> 06:14:24.200 align:start position:0%
this thank you and remind me to always
 
06:14:25.868 --> 06:14:25.878 align:start position:0%
go for a gunfight against you CU you're
 
06:14:29.628 --> 06:14:29.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:32.390 --> 06:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
draw the clerk will now oh wait a minute
 
06:14:35.190 --> 06:14:35.200 align:start position:0%
we've got a rep Ford as well recognize
 
06:14:37.590 --> 06:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
for your comment thank you I I'm sorry
 
06:14:39.628 --> 06:14:39.638 align:start position:0%
I'm also slow on the draw so you would
 
06:14:42.708 --> 06:14:42.718 align:start position:0%
definitely win in a gun fight but um I
 
06:14:45.430 --> 06:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
guess I'm I guess the amendment and now
 
06:14:48.990 --> 06:14:49.000 align:start position:0%
the bill any legal
 
06:14:49.000 --> 06:14:50.510 align:start position:0%
the bill any legal
means

06:14:50.510 --> 06:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
means
 
06:14:53.590 --> 06:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
what outside jurisdiction of the state
 
06:14:55.310 --> 06:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
right so we're talking about main Waters
 
06:14:58.030 --> 06:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
massachusett Waters in federal waters
 
06:15:01.708 --> 06:15:01.718 align:start position:0%
right I I guess I'm trying to
 
06:15:05.270 --> 06:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
understand what what will this bill do
 
06:15:07.830 --> 06:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
pro outside of like reaffirming that you
 
06:15:10.230 --> 06:15:10.240 align:start position:0%
could just lie about whether or not
 
06:15:12.270 --> 06:15:12.280 align:start position:0%
you're going to sell the lobsters or
 
06:15:15.110 --> 06:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
keep the lobsters to yourself because
 
06:15:16.830 --> 06:15:16.840 align:start position:0%
it's basically saying if you go to any
 
06:15:18.230 --> 06:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
other waters outside of New Hampshire
 
06:15:19.788 --> 06:15:19.798 align:start position:0%
and catch these lobsters including
 
06:15:21.628 --> 06:15:21.638 align:start position:0%
Federal and I pretty sure you have to
 
06:15:24.350 --> 06:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
have a license to do the skin diving for
 
06:15:26.468 --> 06:15:26.478 align:start position:0%
lobsters as well right with the Federal
 
06:15:29.390 --> 06:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
no so you can go federal waters you're
 
06:15:31.830 --> 06:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
allowed to die for lobster with no no uh
 
06:15:33.750 --> 06:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
no license great so you go do that and
 
06:15:35.468 --> 06:15:35.478 align:start position:0%
then you're you come back maybe you will
 
06:15:37.270 --> 06:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
sell them maybe you I it just seems like
 
06:15:39.350 --> 06:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't
 
06:15:41.708 --> 06:15:41.718 align:start position:0%
necessarily need to happen maybe we talk
 
06:15:45.070 --> 06:15:45.080 align:start position:0%
about the fees but yeah I'm just so to
 
06:15:47.030 --> 06:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
answer the you asked something about the
 
06:15:49.670 --> 06:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
any legal means that was because it said
 
06:15:52.270 --> 06:15:52.280 align:start position:0%
before any means which which would have
 
06:15:54.590 --> 06:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
meant that potentially you could go out
 
06:15:57.110 --> 06:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
and poach them and still bring them back
 
06:16:00.310 --> 06:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
by the amendment says any means to make
 
06:16:02.070 --> 06:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
that if they're caught in Massachusetts
 
06:16:03.390 --> 06:16:03.400 align:start position:0%
they have to legally caught in
 
06:16:04.708 --> 06:16:04.718 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts if they're caught in Maine
 
06:16:06.310 --> 06:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
they have to be legally caught in Maine
 
06:16:07.590 --> 06:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
if they're caught in federal waters they
 
06:16:09.110 --> 06:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
have to be legally caught in federal
 
06:16:12.190 --> 06:16:12.200 align:start position:0%
waters which also uh imposes the size
 
06:16:13.868 --> 06:16:13.878 align:start position:0%
limits and everything else for those
 
06:16:17.190 --> 06:16:17.200 align:start position:0%
Waters um and currently you cannot die
 
06:16:18.830 --> 06:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
for lobsters in Maine so those would be
 
06:16:20.910 --> 06:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
trapped lobsters in Maine but you can
 
06:16:22.430 --> 06:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
dive for lobsters in Mass so it could
 
06:16:25.788 --> 06:16:25.798 align:start position:0%
have been trapped or yeah uh dive for
 
06:16:28.030 --> 06:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
them uh I don't know about crabs in
 
06:16:31.270 --> 06:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
Maine crabs are okay in Maine for diving
 
06:16:34.868 --> 06:16:34.878 align:start position:0%
I don't know uh crabs are able to be you
 
06:16:37.788 --> 06:16:37.798 align:start position:0%
can dive for them in in mass and here uh
 
06:16:40.390 --> 06:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
so so you know it's basically saying if
 
06:16:42.628 --> 06:16:42.638 align:start position:0%
if you're following the law that's what
 
06:16:44.548 --> 06:16:44.558 align:start position:0%
legal means means so I just want to
 
06:16:46.070 --> 06:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
clarify that because you did have the
 
06:16:47.948 --> 06:16:47.958 align:start position:0%
question on legal means yeah no and that
 
06:16:50.390 --> 06:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
see slow on the draw should have been a
 
06:16:52.390 --> 06:16:52.400 align:start position:0%
question during the amendment portion
 
06:16:54.310 --> 06:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
discussion so that's fine fine that's
 
06:16:55.548 --> 06:16:55.558 align:start position:0%
what we here for an exact session is
 
06:16:58.390 --> 06:16:58.400 align:start position:0%
when we can ask we can challenge I just
 
06:17:01.030 --> 06:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
don't want debates right we don't want
 
06:17:02.510 --> 06:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
to break down into that type of a
 
06:17:05.948 --> 06:17:05.958 align:start position:0%
situation representative Harvey because
 
06:17:07.430 --> 06:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
goalie has already spoken a couple of
 
06:17:10.150 --> 06:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
times okay but that that doesn't um
 
06:17:12.468 --> 06:17:12.478 align:start position:0%
alleviate the
 
06:17:18.788 --> 06:17:18.798 align:start position:0%
um that we are bypassing the um the
 
06:17:20.868 --> 06:17:20.878 align:start position:0%
statute that says we need to report and
 
06:17:24.030 --> 06:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
it also doesn't um it does open the door
 
06:17:26.070 --> 06:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
that people could say oh I'm I'm not
 
06:17:27.948 --> 06:17:27.958 align:start position:0%
selling these lobsters and then go home
 
06:17:29.948 --> 06:17:29.958 align:start position:0%
and ask your neighbor you know I have a
 
06:17:33.310 --> 06:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
lobster can I give $ five doar for it so
 
06:17:35.430 --> 06:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
I I will be opposed to the bill although
 
06:17:37.628 --> 06:17:37.638 align:start position:0%
I think the amendment made it better I'm
 
06:17:39.548 --> 06:17:39.558 align:start position:0%
going to throw in my comment because the
 
06:17:41.590 --> 06:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
the lying has come up a couple of times
 
06:17:43.788 --> 06:17:43.798 align:start position:0%
you really can't stop someone from lying
 
06:17:47.270 --> 06:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
at any time like um for example I could
 
06:17:50.750 --> 06:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
be out on the street selling drugs and
 
06:17:53.030 --> 06:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
they could stop me and say what are
 
06:17:54.910 --> 06:17:54.920 align:start position:0%
these for and I could say personal
 
06:17:54.920 --> 06:17:56.868 align:start position:0%
these for and I could say personal
use

06:17:56.868 --> 06:17:56.878 align:start position:0%
use
 
06:17:59.110 --> 06:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
when you're bringing in the fish catch
 
06:18:01.750 --> 06:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
um you could certainly go and say I'm
 
06:18:03.750 --> 06:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
bringing in but at some point there's a
 
06:18:06.468 --> 06:18:06.478 align:start position:0%
quantity right if I'm bringing back four
 
06:18:07.948 --> 06:18:07.958 align:start position:0%
lobsters it's very reasonable that
 
06:18:09.948 --> 06:18:09.958 align:start position:0%
they're for personal use if I'm bringing
 
06:18:12.868 --> 06:18:12.878 align:start position:0%
back 20 it's probably not unless I'm a
 
06:18:15.150 --> 06:18:15.160 align:start position:0%
glutton uh so I think that law
 
06:18:16.830 --> 06:18:16.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement has some pretty good Clues
 
06:18:18.350 --> 06:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
as to some whether someone's lying or
 
06:18:20.350 --> 06:18:20.360 align:start position:0%
not in that kind of situation and I'll
 
06:18:23.390 --> 06:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
leave my argument at that point um if
 
06:18:24.390 --> 06:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
someone's going to break the law they're
 
06:18:27.230 --> 06:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
going to break the law our job is to to
 
06:18:29.830 --> 06:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
try to make it better for people who are
 
06:18:31.468 --> 06:18:31.478 align:start position:0%
not breaking the law so they don't
 
06:18:33.230 --> 06:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
unintentionally break the law or so that
 
06:18:36.430 --> 06:18:36.440 align:start position:0%
they have an easier time to uh to do the
 
06:18:38.590 --> 06:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
things that they enjoy without breaking
 
06:18:41.788 --> 06:18:41.798 align:start position:0%
the law and representative Smith thank
 
06:18:43.750 --> 06:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I have a procedural
 
06:18:46.310 --> 06:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
question because it's been brought up
 
06:18:49.150 --> 06:18:49.160 align:start position:0%
repeatedly that this if this became law
 
06:18:51.230 --> 06:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
would bypass the reporting requirements
 
06:18:54.468 --> 06:18:54.478 align:start position:0%
is there any way in rules or possibly a
 
06:18:56.590 --> 06:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
floor amendment to make it where
 
06:18:58.310 --> 06:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
there still is a reporting requirement
 
06:19:00.750 --> 06:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
even though you're coming to shore for
 
06:19:02.430 --> 06:19:02.440 align:start position:0%
your own personal use that it still has
 
06:19:03.990 --> 06:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
to be reported I'm sure because the
 
06:19:05.430 --> 06:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
intent of this was only to remove the
 
06:19:07.708 --> 06:19:07.718 align:start position:0%
fee for a landing license I don't think
 
06:19:09.868 --> 06:19:09.878 align:start position:0%
that there'd be any prob problem with
 
06:19:11.628 --> 06:19:11.638 align:start position:0%
putting a reporting requirement on
 
06:19:14.150 --> 06:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
bringing them ashore um I don't know
 
06:19:15.628 --> 06:19:15.638 align:start position:0%
whether that would be something rules
 
06:19:17.150 --> 06:19:17.160 align:start position:0%
related and I would be willing to call
 
06:19:18.868 --> 06:19:18.878 align:start position:0%
up Colonel Jordan to answer whether
 
06:19:20.070 --> 06:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
that's something that can be handled in
 
06:19:21.708 --> 06:19:21.718 align:start position:0%
rules if the committee would like to
 
06:19:24.270 --> 06:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
hear from him uh but he may not know it
 
06:19:25.430 --> 06:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
might be something that has to be looked
 
06:19:28.830 --> 06:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
into before we can get an answer
 
06:19:31.468 --> 06:19:31.478 align:start position:0%
um at the very least a floor Amendment
 
06:19:32.948 --> 06:19:32.958 align:start position:0%
could do it or an amendment in the
 
06:19:35.190 --> 06:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
Senate uh if we wanted to make sure the
 
06:19:37.430 --> 06:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
reporting Amendment gets on to it uh
 
06:19:41.590 --> 06:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
representative Hill I don't think as
 
06:19:45.230 --> 06:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
I I don't think that there was a uh in
 
06:19:47.628 --> 06:19:47.638 align:start position:0%
this in this section of the statute
 
06:19:51.468 --> 06:19:51.478 align:start position:0%
there was anything about the um
 
06:19:54.788 --> 06:19:54.798 align:start position:0%
reporting that was necessary or that was
 
06:19:58.510 --> 06:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
included you weren't here for the whole
 
06:20:01.510 --> 06:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
testimony over the correct correct and
 
06:20:03.990 --> 06:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh we heard testimony that part of the
 
06:20:06.670 --> 06:20:06.680 align:start position:0%
landing process and Landing license
 
06:20:10.430 --> 06:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
process was that uh you had to file a
 
06:20:10.440 --> 06:20:12.150 align:start position:0%
process was that uh you had to file a
mandatory

06:20:12.150 --> 06:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
mandatory
 
06:20:15.390 --> 06:20:15.400 align:start position:0%
report um and so if you remove the
 
06:20:17.190 --> 06:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
license then you're removing the
 
06:20:20.390 --> 06:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
required reporting and that was the
 
06:20:22.270 --> 06:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
testimony as it was said to this
 
06:20:24.150 --> 06:20:24.160 align:start position:0%
committee so am
 
06:20:27.830 --> 06:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
I okay just want to make sure that I was
 
06:20:30.990 --> 06:20:31.000 align:start position:0%
so with that being said it would seem to
 
06:20:33.190 --> 06:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
me that
 
06:20:35.948 --> 06:20:35.958 align:start position:0%
um a New Hampshire resident that's still
 
06:20:39.110 --> 06:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
Landing these um whether you're paying
 
06:20:43.030 --> 06:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
the fee or not um doesn't
 
06:20:46.310 --> 06:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
change the ability for somebody to count
 
06:20:46.320 --> 06:20:49.150 align:start position:0%
change the ability for somebody to count
and

06:20:49.150 --> 06:20:49.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:53.070 --> 06:20:53.080 align:start position:0%
Report representative Harvey okay so um
 
06:20:54.868 --> 06:20:54.878 align:start position:0%
it takes away that requirement because
 
06:20:57.910 --> 06:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
you don't have to do it um but you're
 
06:21:00.390 --> 06:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
right it could possibly be added and I
 
06:21:01.990 --> 06:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
would feel much more comfortable if we
 
06:21:04.990 --> 06:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
had some sort of a an amendment that put
 
06:21:08.390 --> 06:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
that uh back in so that
 
06:21:12.150 --> 06:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
um the statistics were still
 
06:21:14.750 --> 06:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
there I've got a bunch of people hold on
 
06:21:16.030 --> 06:21:16.040 align:start position:0%
rep Darby
 
06:21:19.030 --> 06:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
first um I I would uh be interested in
 
06:21:21.788 --> 06:21:21.798 align:start position:0%
hearing from um fishing game on on you
 
06:21:23.390 --> 06:21:23.400 align:start position:0%
as you
 
06:21:25.788 --> 06:21:25.798 align:start position:0%
suggested representative Ford did do you
 
06:21:27.990 --> 06:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
have a I saw a hand go up so I didn't
 
06:21:31.468 --> 06:21:31.478 align:start position:0%
know if you okay representative tutor I
 
06:21:34.110 --> 06:21:34.120 align:start position:0%
might be wrong but I thought um
 
06:21:37.030 --> 06:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
testimony said that um the fact that
 
06:21:39.030 --> 06:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
they had a New Hampshire trapping
 
06:21:40.830 --> 06:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
license to start with and now that this
 
06:21:43.190 --> 06:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
is just New Hampshire residents they had
 
06:21:45.750 --> 06:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
to report under the license so that's if
 
06:21:47.628 --> 06:21:47.638 align:start position:0%
they have the trapping license but this
 
06:21:49.270 --> 06:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
Landing license is separate from the
 
06:21:49.280 --> 06:21:50.430 align:start position:0%
Landing license is separate from the
trapping

06:21:50.430 --> 06:21:50.440 align:start position:0%
trapping
 
06:21:54.548 --> 06:21:54.558 align:start position:0%
license correct the landing license
 
06:21:56.990 --> 06:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
fee being waved for New Hampshire
 
06:21:58.788 --> 06:21:58.798 align:start position:0%
residents doesn't stop the landing
 
06:22:00.430 --> 06:22:00.440 align:start position:0%
license from being required for
 
06:22:02.910 --> 06:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
non-residents or commercial people that
 
06:22:05.788 --> 06:22:05.798 align:start position:0%
are non residents it's only stopping it
 
06:22:07.628 --> 06:22:07.638 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire
 
06:22:10.708 --> 06:22:10.718 align:start position:0%
residents uh representative Brown first
 
06:22:13.628 --> 06:22:13.638 align:start position:0%
then representative Hill um uh thank you
 
06:22:13.638 --> 06:22:14.708 align:start position:0%
then representative Hill um uh thank you
Mr

06:22:14.708 --> 06:22:14.718 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
06:22:17.750 --> 06:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
chair if anyone on the committee
 
06:22:20.670 --> 06:22:20.680 align:start position:0%
knows when someone comes up to the dock
 
06:22:22.910 --> 06:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
and they're they're going home for the
 
06:22:25.948 --> 06:22:25.958 align:start position:0%
day who is there to know how many LW ERS
 
06:22:30.990 --> 06:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:32.948 --> 06:22:32.958 align:start position:0%
work that might be a question for
 
06:22:34.150 --> 06:22:34.160 align:start position:0%
fishing game because I don't know how
 
06:22:36.030 --> 06:22:36.040 align:start position:0%
they enforce that representative Hill
 
06:22:38.510 --> 06:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
and then representative Khan so I do
 
06:22:42.310 --> 06:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
know um having had one um the
 
06:22:47.430 --> 06:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts license requires reporting
 
06:22:49.670 --> 06:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
so if you have a non-resident
 
06:22:52.750 --> 06:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
license and you're doing this um you're
 
06:22:54.868 --> 06:22:54.878 align:start position:0%
getting your lobsters in Massachusetts
 
06:22:57.670 --> 06:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
and coming to New Hampshire to with your
 
06:23:01.390 --> 06:23:01.400 align:start position:0%
boat you are reporting so it's um so
 
06:23:01.400 --> 06:23:02.310 align:start position:0%
boat you are reporting so it's um so
that

06:23:02.310 --> 06:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:23:06.948 --> 06:23:06.958 align:start position:0%
part you're you're we're eliminating um
 
06:23:09.590 --> 06:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
I would say 90% of that reporting
 
06:23:11.270 --> 06:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
question I think at that point because
 
06:23:14.070 --> 06:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
there is a a reporting that's done to
 
06:23:16.788 --> 06:23:16.798 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so the numbers do get
 
06:23:20.430 --> 06:23:20.440 align:start position:0%
into um the Atlantic states
 
06:23:23.948 --> 06:23:23.958 align:start position:0%
Fisheries project um but I would be
 
06:23:27.628 --> 06:23:27.638 align:start position:0%
happy to work with representative Harvey
 
06:23:30.390 --> 06:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
on a floor Amendment
 
06:23:34.430 --> 06:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
um working out some way to try to create
 
06:23:37.628 --> 06:23:37.638 align:start position:0%
this this reporting um it's certainly
 
06:23:40.310 --> 06:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
not the intent of what we're trying to
 
06:23:43.830 --> 06:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
do to avoid reporting and under and and
 
06:23:47.510 --> 06:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
hurting the Fisheries in any way so if
 
06:23:49.590 --> 06:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
there is something that needs to be done
 
06:23:54.150 --> 06:23:54.160 align:start position:0%
in order to um augment the the reporting
 
06:23:58.270 --> 06:23:58.280 align:start position:0%
accuracy I'm happy to do that with
 
06:24:02.030 --> 06:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
you yeah yes I I just feel
 
06:24:04.788 --> 06:24:04.798 align:start position:0%
like it's not your turn it's
 
06:24:07.150 --> 06:24:07.160 align:start position:0%
representative Khan's turn first he's
 
06:24:09.310 --> 06:24:09.320 align:start position:0%
had his hand up for a long time thank
 
06:24:11.548 --> 06:24:11.558 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman Mr chairman with your
 
06:24:15.468 --> 06:24:15.478 align:start position:0%
permission I have a concern for a
 
06:24:17.990 --> 06:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
quotation by the ficient game that I'm
 
06:24:21.468 --> 06:24:21.478 align:start position:0%
going to read it uh in addition the
 
06:24:23.270 --> 06:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
department has a concern with the
 
06:24:26.030 --> 06:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
unenforceability of the Landing this
 
06:24:28.830 --> 06:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
bill creates for example when checking a
 
06:24:31.830 --> 06:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
vessel at sea or at Port law enforcement
 
06:24:34.110 --> 06:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
would be unable to determine if the
 
06:24:36.628 --> 06:24:36.638 align:start position:0%
lobster or crab landing were from a
 
06:24:39.510 --> 06:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
recreational or commercial license in
 
06:24:42.830 --> 06:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
another state so this was my concern
 
06:24:45.628 --> 06:24:45.638 align:start position:0%
also Mr chairman thank you thank you I
 
06:24:47.110 --> 06:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
would imagine that they would be able to
 
06:24:49.830 --> 06:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
show their license from that other state
 
06:24:51.468 --> 06:24:51.478 align:start position:0%
um to show they were licensed in that
 
06:24:53.510 --> 06:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
other state but it is now representative
 
06:24:55.350 --> 06:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
Reed's turn and then it'll be
 
06:24:57.430 --> 06:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey's turn thank you
 
06:24:59.670 --> 06:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so on the surface of this I
 
06:25:02.548 --> 06:25:02.558 align:start position:0%
don't really see any real problem um I
 
06:25:04.350 --> 06:25:04.360 align:start position:0%
don't see where it's taking away any
 
06:25:06.350 --> 06:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements I don't see any
 
06:25:09.230 --> 06:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
reason that a New Hampshire citizen who
 
06:25:12.708 --> 06:25:12.718 align:start position:0%
is not selling um the catch should have
 
06:25:16.030 --> 06:25:16.040 align:start position:0%
to pay a landing fee and I don't um see
 
06:25:19.910 --> 06:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
that uh that the the issue of purpose is
 
06:25:22.430 --> 06:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
an issue because we have intent through
 
06:25:24.310 --> 06:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of criminal law as a matter of
 
06:25:26.030 --> 06:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
fact and and those are the types of
 
06:25:28.150 --> 06:25:28.160 align:start position:0%
things that have to be proven however
 
06:25:30.270 --> 06:25:30.280 align:start position:0%
I've heard repeatedly today how these
 
06:25:31.590 --> 06:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
things should be in rules it should be
 
06:25:33.150 --> 06:25:33.160 align:start position:0%
in rules it should be in rules and this
 
06:25:36.190 --> 06:25:36.200 align:start position:0%
has been in rules and we just voted down
 
06:25:38.590 --> 06:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
a couple way more important way longer
 
06:25:40.030 --> 06:25:40.040 align:start position:0%
standing things because it should be in
 
06:25:41.788 --> 06:25:41.798 align:start position:0%
rules so I guess I'm going to have to
 
06:25:43.430 --> 06:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
take the advice of my colleagues and
 
06:25:44.670 --> 06:25:44.680 align:start position:0%
vote against this because it should be
 
06:25:44.680 --> 06:25:47.708 align:start position:0%
vote against this because it should be
in

06:25:47.708 --> 06:25:47.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:50.310 --> 06:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
rules thank you representative Reed
 
06:25:51.548 --> 06:25:51.558 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey did you have
 
06:25:55.270 --> 06:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
another uh it it just seems like we're
 
06:25:56.430 --> 06:25:56.440 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of confusion on the
 
06:25:57.948 --> 06:25:57.958 align:start position:0%
committee and a lot of discussion which
 
06:26:01.030 --> 06:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
is a good thing but but when committees
 
06:26:03.230 --> 06:26:03.240 align:start position:0%
have this much discussion and questions
 
06:26:05.270 --> 06:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
it sort of points to the idea that maybe
 
06:26:07.350 --> 06:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
the bill is not ready for prime time
 
06:26:09.350 --> 06:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for your comment any
 
06:26:09.360 --> 06:26:11.750 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for your comment any
further

06:26:11.750 --> 06:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
further
 
06:26:16.350 --> 06:26:16.360 align:start position:0%
comments representative Ford sorry um
 
06:26:19.750 --> 06:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I I guess if the
 
06:26:21.590 --> 06:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
concern is about the landing fees
 
06:26:24.708 --> 06:26:24.718 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we focus on the that part
 
06:26:26.708 --> 06:26:26.718 align:start position:0%
right and talk to fishing game about how
 
06:26:29.310 --> 06:26:29.320 align:start position:0%
much the fee is to whether you're
 
06:26:32.830 --> 06:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
getting four for your family or 20 for
 
06:26:35.708 --> 06:26:35.718 align:start position:0%
your bigger family it should be the same
 
06:26:38.070 --> 06:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
cost and I and I think we could talk
 
06:26:39.670 --> 06:26:39.680 align:start position:0%
about the fees not necessarily saying
 
06:26:42.030 --> 06:26:42.040 align:start position:0%
like it's free go out and do legal means
 
06:26:43.190 --> 06:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
to getting your Lobster and then coming
 
06:26:44.910 --> 06:26:44.920 align:start position:0%
back right we have the landing fees for
 
06:26:47.468 --> 06:26:47.478 align:start position:0%
reason and until we fully fund the fish
 
06:26:49.190 --> 06:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
and game department I say let them get
 
06:26:52.110 --> 06:26:52.120 align:start position:0%
their money the best way they can so um
 
06:26:53.948 --> 06:26:53.958 align:start position:0%
I would that's the reason I'm opposing
 
06:26:55.990 --> 06:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
this outside of that it's confusing
 
06:26:57.910 --> 06:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
because I don't understand launching and
 
06:27:00.830 --> 06:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
landing and restriction and jurisdiction
 
06:27:03.350 --> 06:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
and all that jazz but if the fishing
 
06:27:05.990 --> 06:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
game are getting fees from Landing
 
06:27:07.548 --> 06:27:07.558 align:start position:0%
whether it's for recreational or
 
06:27:10.628 --> 06:27:10.638 align:start position:0%
commercial I say let them go for it and
 
06:27:15.030 --> 06:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
I would I will uh um say that if that's
 
06:27:16.750 --> 06:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
the case then obviously I won't be
 
06:27:18.990 --> 06:27:19.000 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill but um if it's
 
06:27:21.110 --> 06:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
about the fees let fishing game deal
 
06:27:23.070 --> 06:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
with the fees and lure them if they see
 
06:27:26.510 --> 06:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
fit um for that
 
06:27:26.520 --> 06:27:27.750 align:start position:0%
fit um for that
representative

06:27:27.750 --> 06:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:27:31.110 --> 06:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you Mr chair
 
06:27:35.070 --> 06:27:35.080 align:start position:0%
and the fees are set I believe in Rules
 
06:27:36.628 --> 06:27:36.638 align:start position:0%
by the
 
06:27:39.430 --> 06:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
director from what I understand but my
 
06:27:41.590 --> 06:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
problem with it is still the reporting
 
06:27:43.030 --> 06:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
and if we can get around that reporting
 
06:27:54.030 --> 06:27:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:57.830 --> 06:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
forward representative Brown so thank
 
06:28:01.230 --> 06:28:01.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman everyone so there isn't
 
06:28:03.110 --> 06:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
a fee every time you land Lobster
 
06:28:04.670 --> 06:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
there's only a fee for the landing
 
06:28:08.270 --> 06:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
license is that correct thank you colon
 
06:28:09.390 --> 06:28:09.400 align:start position:0%
Jordan would you like to take the mic
 
06:28:11.430 --> 06:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
and tell us what you found out yes I
 
06:28:13.548 --> 06:28:13.558 align:start position:0%
called and I apologize I couldn't get
 
06:28:15.430 --> 06:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
him here today he should have been here
 
06:28:17.590 --> 06:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
um but I called the lieutenant down
 
06:28:19.270 --> 06:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
there I got a hold of him so the
 
06:28:21.390 --> 06:28:21.400 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement comes in that
 
06:28:24.430 --> 06:28:24.440 align:start position:0%
Landing license so if we exempt anyone a
 
06:28:26.150 --> 06:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
resident or nonresident there will be no
 
06:28:28.590 --> 06:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
reporting and his concern was you know
 
06:28:30.468 --> 06:28:30.478 align:start position:0%
we won't have any idea of the resource I
 
06:28:31.990 --> 06:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
said I understand that all I want you to
 
06:28:34.190 --> 06:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
do is answer my question so the
 
06:28:36.190 --> 06:28:36.200 align:start position:0%
reporting part of it would go away and
 
06:28:37.868 --> 06:28:37.878 align:start position:0%
to answer your question representative
 
06:28:39.350 --> 06:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
Brown the only way you would know so
 
06:28:42.030 --> 06:28:42.040 align:start position:0%
that's required every I believe he said
 
06:28:42.040 --> 06:28:43.030 align:start position:0%
that's required every I believe he said
every

06:28:43.030 --> 06:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
every
 
06:28:45.830 --> 06:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
month um and that's strictly enforced
 
06:28:46.990 --> 06:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
because that's how they track the
 
06:28:48.310 --> 06:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
resource the only other way you would
 
06:28:49.948 --> 06:28:49.958 align:start position:0%
know what people get for lobsters the
 
06:28:51.750 --> 06:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
way that we know it is when we stop the
 
06:28:53.948 --> 06:28:53.958 align:start position:0%
boat which we do routinely and check
 
06:28:56.548 --> 06:28:56.558 align:start position:0%
them and and that's one other way we
 
06:28:58.670 --> 06:28:58.680 align:start position:0%
don't report that that's basically to
 
06:28:59.910 --> 06:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
make sure they're in compliance with all
 
06:29:03.270 --> 06:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire regulations so so they
 
06:29:05.430 --> 06:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
file a report once a month with how much
 
06:29:07.070 --> 06:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
they've taken that's what he said and
 
06:29:09.548 --> 06:29:09.558 align:start position:0%
it's basically a voluntary thing uh it
 
06:29:10.948 --> 06:29:10.958 align:start position:0%
comes with the requirement of the
 
06:29:13.310 --> 06:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
license so he said they could still lie
 
06:29:15.230 --> 06:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
and say they could oh yeah oh people can
 
06:29:17.270 --> 06:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
lie in any of this oh yeah but if you
 
06:29:19.750 --> 06:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
eliminate the license requirement you
 
06:29:21.708 --> 06:29:21.718 align:start position:0%
would eliminate the requirement for
 
06:29:24.030 --> 06:29:24.040 align:start position:0%
reporting too so both would go unless
 
06:29:26.548 --> 06:29:26.558 align:start position:0%
you amended it all right we have uh
 
06:29:28.270 --> 06:29:28.280 align:start position:0%
representative Harvey first and then
 
06:29:30.990 --> 06:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
representative Derby so just to be clear
 
06:29:33.310 --> 06:29:33.320 align:start position:0%
on my position I I'm not going to
 
06:29:35.310 --> 06:29:35.320 align:start position:0%
support this but should it pass I'll be
 
06:29:37.390 --> 06:29:37.400 align:start position:0%
happy to work with
 
06:29:40.868 --> 06:29:40.878 align:start position:0%
you representative Darby thank you um I
 
06:29:42.670 --> 06:29:42.680 align:start position:0%
was hoping to ask uh the colonel a
 
06:29:44.868 --> 06:29:44.878 align:start position:0%
question um with respect to if
 
06:29:47.750 --> 06:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement is ever done at the Docks
 
06:29:49.990 --> 06:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
themselves you know for examp R yes in
 
06:29:51.708 --> 06:29:51.718 align:start position:0%
fact we have details where officers are
 
06:29:54.150 --> 06:29:54.160 align:start position:0%
assigned to the docks at the fish Co-op
 
06:29:57.390 --> 06:29:57.400 align:start position:0%
and other places and then we um have two
 
06:29:59.548 --> 06:29:59.558 align:start position:0%
uh two three Patrol bools that we go out
 
06:30:02.708 --> 06:30:02.718 align:start position:0%
for yes thank you so much yes sir
 
06:30:04.868 --> 06:30:04.878 align:start position:0%
representative hill before you
 
06:30:09.270 --> 06:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
leave so how do you do if someone is
 
06:30:11.910 --> 06:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
diving in Massachusetts on a
 
06:30:14.350 --> 06:30:14.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts license they come back to
 
06:30:17.190 --> 06:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and you're reporting it
 
06:30:19.190 --> 06:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
and they're turning around and Reporting
 
06:30:21.390 --> 06:30:21.400 align:start position:0%
it as they are required to do under
 
06:30:23.030 --> 06:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
their massachusett so we're not
 
06:30:24.548 --> 06:30:24.558 align:start position:0%
reporting it representative Hill we're
 
06:30:27.110 --> 06:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
check checking them to see limits make
 
06:30:28.750 --> 06:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
sure they're within compliance of the
 
06:30:30.548 --> 06:30:30.558 align:start position:0%
law the reporting part falls to the
 
06:30:33.230 --> 06:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
fisherman we don't file a report on what
 
06:30:36.110 --> 06:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
we see if that's your question so it's
 
06:30:39.150 --> 06:30:39.160 align:start position:0%
both a vol it's a voluntary on the part
 
06:30:42.030 --> 06:30:42.040 align:start position:0%
of the the person that's bringing it in
 
06:30:44.388 --> 06:30:44.398 align:start position:0%
in both places no it's a requirement to
 
06:30:46.230 --> 06:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
renew his license so if you get a
 
06:30:48.270 --> 06:30:48.280 align:start position:0%
landing license which is now currently
 
06:30:51.110 --> 06:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
required by law and you failed to report
 
06:30:53.590 --> 06:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't get another Landing license
 
06:30:55.270 --> 06:30:55.280 align:start position:0%
but um
 
06:30:58.788 --> 06:30:58.798 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you um you do get
 
06:31:01.430 --> 06:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
involved in this we're a little less
 
06:31:04.788 --> 06:31:04.798 align:start position:0%
rigid in exec session so because we're
 
06:31:06.350 --> 06:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
we're trying to flesh this out I'm only
 
06:31:10.230 --> 06:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
a chairman um but it would seem to me
 
06:31:10.240 --> 06:31:11.910 align:start position:0%
a chairman um but it would seem to me
that

06:31:11.910 --> 06:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:31:16.548 --> 06:31:16.558 align:start position:0%
um it's possible not to if if there was
 
06:31:20.510 --> 06:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
a person and all they did was dive using
 
06:31:23.350 --> 06:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
their non-resident license in in
 
06:31:27.110 --> 06:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
massachusett waters y it's possible that
 
06:31:29.910 --> 06:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
that's the only place that they would be
 
06:31:31.948 --> 06:31:31.958 align:start position:0%
reporting if they're not Landing in New
 
06:31:33.388 --> 06:31:33.398 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that would be correct if they
 
06:31:34.830 --> 06:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
land in New Hampshire they would have to
 
06:31:36.910 --> 06:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
report in New Hampshire under the
 
06:31:39.510 --> 06:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
current law and they do not report those
 
06:31:42.110 --> 06:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
in on on their Massachusetts license
 
06:31:43.628 --> 06:31:43.638 align:start position:0%
that I don't know I don't know what they
 
06:31:45.350 --> 06:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
do in Mass I think they're reporting
 
06:31:47.628 --> 06:31:47.638 align:start position:0%
twice yeah they they definitely do it in
 
06:31:49.388 --> 06:31:49.398 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire if they if they have a
 
06:31:52.230 --> 06:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
landing license it's required thank you
 
06:31:52.240 --> 06:31:53.670 align:start position:0%
landing license it's required thank you
yes

06:31:53.670 --> 06:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:31:53.680 --> 06:31:55.510 align:start position:0%
yes
sir

06:31:55.510 --> 06:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
sir
 
06:31:57.590 --> 06:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
thank I got I would like to hear from
 
06:31:59.190 --> 06:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
the director because he's been quiet for
 
06:32:02.230 --> 06:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
so long
 
06:32:04.590 --> 06:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
allene works with the atantic states
 
06:32:06.388 --> 06:32:06.398 align:start position:0%
would actually a answer that question a
 
06:32:06.398 --> 06:32:08.190 align:start position:0%
would actually a answer that question a
little

06:32:08.190 --> 06:32:08.200 align:start position:0%
little
 
06:32:08.200 --> 06:32:09.750 align:start position:0%
little
okay

06:32:09.750 --> 06:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:32:11.948 --> 06:32:11.958 align:start position:0%
absolutely we'd love to have Renee come
 
06:32:14.270 --> 06:32:14.280 align:start position:0%
back up again get reported
 
06:32:16.830 --> 06:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
under thank you Mr chairman so that yeah
 
06:32:18.350 --> 06:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
the reporting requirements all come down
 
06:32:20.590 --> 06:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
to The Landing State we do not operate
 
06:32:22.388 --> 06:32:22.398 align:start position:0%
in a vacuum we have a standardized data
 
06:32:25.270 --> 06:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
reporting program so for example example
 
06:32:27.590 --> 06:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
a federal vessel fishing only out in
 
06:32:29.628 --> 06:32:29.638 align:start position:0%
federal waters way
 
06:32:31.788 --> 06:32:31.798 align:start position:0%
out we have a
 
06:32:33.948 --> 06:32:33.958 align:start position:0%
requirement however they're required to
 
06:32:37.110 --> 06:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
report to no officies we take their no
 
06:32:39.310 --> 06:32:39.320 align:start position:0%
officies information as their
 
06:32:41.350 --> 06:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
requirement for New Hampshire so all the
 
06:32:43.190 --> 06:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
states are in coordination with each
 
06:32:46.670 --> 06:32:46.680 align:start position:0%
other so if somebody was reporting that
 
06:32:49.110 --> 06:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
information to Massachusetts they we
 
06:32:51.590 --> 06:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
have that communication we identify that
 
06:32:54.708 --> 06:32:54.718 align:start position:0%
as part of our licensing requirements um
 
06:32:56.230 --> 06:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
um and the licensing requirement
 
06:32:58.230 --> 06:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
triggers us to say hey we're going to
 
06:33:00.628 --> 06:33:00.638 align:start position:0%
double check make sure this is compliant
 
06:33:02.190 --> 06:33:02.200 align:start position:0%
and we're able to pull that information
 
06:33:04.990 --> 06:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
from Massachusetts so yes thank you so
 
06:33:10.270 --> 06:33:10.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:13.788 --> 06:33:13.798 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you Mr chair and I just
 
06:33:16.910 --> 06:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
want to follow up on this
 
06:33:19.350 --> 06:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
because while we talk about diving in
 
06:33:22.230 --> 06:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
only a few lobsters being
 
06:33:25.708 --> 06:33:25.718 align:start position:0%
taken with this not all also
 
06:33:28.388 --> 06:33:28.398 align:start position:0%
exempt someone who has a non-commercial
 
06:33:30.548 --> 06:33:30.558 align:start position:0%
license in Maine coming back to New
 
06:33:33.070 --> 06:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at they catch not having to
 
06:33:35.310 --> 06:33:35.320 align:start position:0%
report as well because they're coming in
 
06:33:37.948 --> 06:33:37.958 align:start position:0%
from out of state or from Massachusetts
 
06:33:41.230 --> 06:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
the way this is worded if you had just
 
06:33:45.350 --> 06:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
a um non-commercial license or just a um
 
06:33:48.430 --> 06:33:48.440 align:start position:0%
what's the five trap or six trap license
 
06:33:50.750 --> 06:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
Renee if you wouldn't mind I my
 
06:33:52.230 --> 06:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
impression based on what you said before
 
06:33:53.430 --> 06:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
is that they would have to report that
 
06:33:55.110 --> 06:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
in main under their license that they
 
06:33:57.868 --> 06:33:57.878 align:start position:0%
trapped in main with but go for it thank
 
06:33:59.670 --> 06:33:59.680 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair so yes if they're catching
 
06:34:01.628 --> 06:34:01.638 align:start position:0%
it under a license and that state has a
 
06:34:04.150 --> 06:34:04.160 align:start position:0%
requirement the state of Maine is coming
 
06:34:05.990 --> 06:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
into compliance they have a huge
 
06:34:08.270 --> 06:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
population of fishers as you can imagine
 
06:34:09.510 --> 06:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
and they're in the process of rolling
 
06:34:12.030 --> 06:34:12.040 align:start position:0%
out mandatory reporting um they've been
 
06:34:14.270 --> 06:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
given an exemption for partial reporting
 
06:34:17.110 --> 06:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
to date to get statistics now we we know
 
06:34:18.830 --> 06:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
that all of those data are super
 
06:34:21.230 --> 06:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
important we have winds we have whales
 
06:34:22.628 --> 06:34:22.638 align:start position:0%
we have all sorts of things going on in
 
06:34:25.510 --> 06:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
the marine fisheries world uh including
 
06:34:27.868 --> 06:34:27.878 align:start position:0%
a stock that has shown some challenges
 
06:34:29.910 --> 06:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
so Lobster as you heard were having
 
06:34:32.948 --> 06:34:32.958 align:start position:0%
gauge changes uh so yes if there is
 
06:34:34.750 --> 06:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
reporting information there that's great
 
06:34:36.830 --> 06:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
if not we collect that information we've
 
06:34:38.708 --> 06:34:38.718 align:start position:0%
collected main fisherman information for
 
06:34:40.388 --> 06:34:40.398 align:start position:0%
years because they're Landing in New
 
06:34:43.030 --> 06:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that license allows us to
 
06:34:45.190 --> 06:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
identify those folks to make sure that
 
06:34:46.948 --> 06:34:46.958 align:start position:0%
they are meeting the requirements that
 
06:34:48.190 --> 06:34:48.200 align:start position:0%
we are
 
06:34:50.990 --> 06:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
under thank you and by large population
 
06:34:52.310 --> 06:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
of fishers I assume you mean the
 
06:34:55.388 --> 06:34:55.398 align:start position:0%
profession and not the animal yes the
 
06:34:56.948 --> 06:34:56.958 align:start position:0%
profession of I bet they have a lot of
 
06:35:00.350 --> 06:35:00.360 align:start position:0%
the animal too Vice chair goalie you
 
06:35:03.190 --> 06:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:06.468 --> 06:35:06.478 align:start position:0%
followup but my question goes to if they
 
06:35:09.110 --> 06:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
are not no longer required to get a
 
06:35:10.510 --> 06:35:10.520 align:start position:0%
landing license here in New Hampshire
 
06:35:12.350 --> 06:35:12.360 align:start position:0%
and catching in either Maine or
 
06:35:15.510 --> 06:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts coming back they're not
 
06:35:17.230 --> 06:35:17.240 align:start position:0%

it now between now and whenever but I
 
06:38:19.948 --> 06:38:19.958 align:start position:0%

study this versus itl to come to some
 
06:38:27.510 --> 06:38:27.520 align:start position:0%

chairman I believe this bill is
 
06:41:36.708 --> 06:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:39.548 --> 06:41:39.558 align:start position:0%
rights thank you any further discussion
 
06:41:41.788 --> 06:41:41.798 align:start position:0%
on this
 
06:41:45.990 --> 06:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
bill is that a hand up representative
 
06:41:50.270 --> 06:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you Mr chair and well I do
 
06:41:51.868 --> 06:41:51.878 align:start position:0%
agree and I think we heard from the
 
06:41:53.948 --> 06:41:53.958 align:start position:0%
colonel some of these uh most of these
 
06:41:57.708 --> 06:41:57.718 align:start position:0%
aspects that they could work with um
 
06:42:00.548 --> 06:42:00.558 align:start position:0%
there were some issues uh that I feel
 
06:42:04.070 --> 06:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
need to be addressed one calling it a
 
06:42:06.910 --> 06:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
permit when we have no permit
 
06:42:06.920 --> 06:42:10.070 align:start position:0%
permit when we have no permit
available

06:42:10.070 --> 06:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:15.468 --> 06:42:15.478 align:start position:0%
um doesn't work and I think there was a
 
06:42:19.070 --> 06:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
few concerns about the changing the
 
06:42:22.110 --> 06:42:22.120 align:start position:0%
times once again to when tree STS could
 
06:42:26.150 --> 06:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
be in place and removed um no I think
 
06:42:28.868 --> 06:42:28.878 align:start position:0%
this bill just passed last year um they
 
06:42:32.350 --> 06:42:32.360 align:start position:0%
spent a year getting people in line with
 
06:42:35.350 --> 06:42:35.360 align:start position:0%
what's going on with promoting this and
 
06:42:37.948 --> 06:42:37.958 align:start position:0%
putting it out there as much as they
 
06:42:39.750 --> 06:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
could letting folks know that these
 
06:42:41.270 --> 06:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
changes were coming
 
06:42:41.280 --> 06:42:43.548 align:start position:0%
changes were coming
forth

06:42:43.548 --> 06:42:43.558 align:start position:0%
forth
 
06:42:45.830 --> 06:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
and we're going
 
06:42:49.270 --> 06:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
to six months before a new season comes
 
06:42:51.388 --> 06:42:51.398 align:start position:0%
throw another change at
 
06:42:54.548 --> 06:42:54.558 align:start position:0%
them and have to romote
 
06:42:56.070 --> 06:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
what the requirements
 
06:43:01.230 --> 06:43:01.240 align:start position:0%
are um I'm not sure how you we heard the
 
06:43:03.948 --> 06:43:03.958 align:start position:0%
concerns about when you label your
 
06:43:07.910 --> 06:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
camera using a tag well to put a tag on
 
06:43:10.430 --> 06:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
a tree I'm assuming you have to use a
 
06:43:13.150 --> 06:43:13.160 align:start position:0%
nail which no landowner wants put into
 
06:43:14.948 --> 06:43:14.958 align:start position:0%
their trees especially those who are
 
06:43:17.030 --> 06:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
loggers or Timberland owners Who harvest
 
06:43:19.270 --> 06:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
their trees um neither do they want to
 
06:43:21.070 --> 06:43:21.080 align:start position:0%
have to go around pulling these pla
 
06:43:22.708 --> 06:43:22.718 align:start position:0%
cards off when they go to do their
 
06:43:26.310 --> 06:43:26.320 align:start position:0%
logging so so um with that I
 
06:43:29.788 --> 06:43:29.798 align:start position:0%
cannot um support this as it is I think
 
06:43:31.628 --> 06:43:31.638 align:start position:0%
with a little bit of work it would be
 
06:43:33.590 --> 06:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
workable to address those concerns of
 
06:43:33.600 --> 06:43:34.910 align:start position:0%
workable to address those concerns of
Representative

06:43:34.910 --> 06:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
Representative
 
06:43:37.270 --> 06:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you I'm going to ask rep
 
06:43:38.788 --> 06:43:38.798 align:start position:0%
peir to please check the table and see
 
06:43:41.750 --> 06:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
if the blue sheet for 1532 is there I
 
06:43:43.910 --> 06:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
hand them all in I thought because we
 
06:43:45.910 --> 06:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
can't seem to find it up here I do have
 
06:43:50.830 --> 06:43:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:53.230 --> 06:43:53.240 align:start position:0%
oppose and representative Smith you
 
06:43:55.868 --> 06:43:55.878 align:start position:0%
recogn now thank you Mr chair I just
 
06:43:57.230 --> 06:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
want to I think there was a lot of
 
06:43:59.190 --> 06:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
testimony and there is some confusion
 
06:44:01.670 --> 06:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
with the intent of the bill that I
 
06:44:05.430 --> 06:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
presented um with rep goal's just
 
06:44:07.830 --> 06:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
statement regarding the placard that was
 
06:44:09.110 --> 06:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
in the amendment that's not in the
 
06:44:13.150 --> 06:44:13.160 align:start position:0%
original bill um the idea of the date so
 
06:44:16.468 --> 06:44:16.478 align:start position:0%
my proposal is pretty clear it follows
 
06:44:18.750 --> 06:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
current law all I'm doing is clarifying
 
06:44:20.670 --> 06:44:20.680 align:start position:0%
current law right now says you can leave
 
06:44:23.510 --> 06:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
a tree stand in there from uh August
 
06:44:26.350 --> 06:44:26.360 align:start position:0%
August 1st right around to June 1st
 
06:44:28.590 --> 06:44:28.600 align:start position:0%
that's current law but again the issue
 
06:44:30.628 --> 06:44:30.638 align:start position:0%
is how is Colonel Jordan or his men or
 
06:44:32.388 --> 06:44:32.398 align:start position:0%
women going to be able to enforce that
 
06:44:34.230 --> 06:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
when he find finds a tree standing there
 
06:44:37.350 --> 06:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
from January 1 to April 25th because the
 
06:44:39.548 --> 06:44:39.558 align:start position:0%
person has to say I'm leaving it over
 
06:44:41.430 --> 06:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
from December 31st because I can leave
 
06:44:43.948 --> 06:44:43.958 align:start position:0%
it till June 1st so again I'm not
 
06:44:45.868 --> 06:44:45.878 align:start position:0%
expanding or confusing this is
 
06:44:49.190 --> 06:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
clarifying the window of time as to when
 
06:44:50.990 --> 06:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
you can place a tree stand and clarifies
 
06:44:53.788 --> 06:44:53.798 align:start position:0%
his enforcement for a fishing game it's
 
06:44:55.830 --> 06:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
really and it's very confusing because
 
06:44:58.230 --> 06:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
of the dates bouncing around but it's
 
06:44:58.240 --> 06:44:59.788 align:start position:0%
of the dates bouncing around but it's
pretty

06:44:59.788 --> 06:44:59.798 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
06:45:02.750 --> 06:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
straightforward I have the blue sheet
 
06:45:06.110 --> 06:45:06.120 align:start position:0%
here uh two in favor five against inside
 
06:45:09.110 --> 06:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
so we've got uh online four in support
 
06:45:12.990 --> 06:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
one oppos and in the room two support
 
06:45:16.670 --> 06:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
and five opposed and rep Smith I
 
06:45:18.430 --> 06:45:18.440 align:start position:0%
neglected to ask you if you were
 
06:45:20.670 --> 06:45:20.680 align:start position:0%
offering your Amendment on
 
06:45:23.868 --> 06:45:23.878 align:start position:0%
this yeah not if the amend is going to
 
06:45:26.548 --> 06:45:26.558 align:start position:0%
hurt the bill Mr
 
06:45:28.750 --> 06:45:28.760 align:start position:0%
chairman and the am the amendment was
 
06:45:31.670 --> 06:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
the placard part
 
06:45:34.110 --> 06:45:34.120 align:start position:0%
correct I I would like to vote on that
 
06:45:36.110 --> 06:45:36.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment because I think it helps the
 
06:45:36.120 --> 06:45:37.388 align:start position:0%
Amendment because I think it helps the
bill

06:45:37.388 --> 06:45:37.398 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:45:39.430 --> 06:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
actually would you like to offer your
 
06:45:41.430 --> 06:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment we can see if everybody likes
 
06:45:43.910 --> 06:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
it and everybody or if everybody
 
06:45:46.670 --> 06:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't sure all right so you offer
 
06:45:49.270 --> 06:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment what's the number on that let
 
06:45:52.150 --> 06:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
me it out and I'll need a second for
 
06:45:53.670 --> 06:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
that Amendment who would like to second
 
06:45:56.708 --> 06:45:56.718 align:start position:0%
the amendment it's Amendment
 
06:45:56.718 --> 06:45:58.830 align:start position:0%
the amendment it's Amendment
0024

06:45:58.830 --> 06:45:58.840 align:start position:0%
0024
 
06:46:01.948 --> 06:46:01.958 align:start position:0%
0024 offered you got that
 
06:46:04.230 --> 06:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
number offered by rep Smith and it's
 
06:46:07.910 --> 06:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
seconded by rep Brown and now we are
 
06:46:10.270 --> 06:46:10.280 align:start position:0%
open for discussion of the amendment uh
 
06:46:11.708 --> 06:46:11.718 align:start position:0%
rep Smith would you like to go over
 
06:46:13.430 --> 06:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
again what your Amendment does sure
 
06:46:15.708 --> 06:46:15.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so the amendment
 
06:46:17.708 --> 06:46:17.718 align:start position:0%
was asked by obviously constituent in
 
06:46:19.548 --> 06:46:19.558 align:start position:0%
the field because he has a camera it's
 
06:46:21.788 --> 06:46:21.798 align:start position:0%
got uneven sides it's it's just not a
 
06:46:23.708 --> 06:46:23.718 align:start position:0%
Smooth Spot to place his name and
 
06:46:25.468 --> 06:46:25.478 align:start position:0%
address or contact information she said
 
06:46:27.590 --> 06:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
why can't I put it on the cam strap or
 
06:46:29.948 --> 06:46:29.958 align:start position:0%
on a placard the amendment doesn't
 
06:46:31.590 --> 06:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
authorize it to be nailed into a tree
 
06:46:33.270 --> 06:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
frankly that's already illegal you can't
 
06:46:35.190 --> 06:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
nail a nail into someone's private
 
06:46:36.750 --> 06:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
property which is a tree that's already
 
06:46:39.388 --> 06:46:39.398 align:start position:0%
against the law um so a placard you
 
06:46:41.150 --> 06:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
could hang that placard from the strap
 
06:46:42.948 --> 06:46:42.958 align:start position:0%
of the camera you can hang that placard
 
06:46:44.548 --> 06:46:44.558 align:start position:0%
from the tree via string you can hang it
 
06:46:46.350 --> 06:46:46.360 align:start position:0%
from a tree branch you don't have to
 
06:46:48.590 --> 06:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
nail it or screw it to the tree uh
 
06:46:50.388 --> 06:46:50.398 align:start position:0%
matter of fact in baiting rules I think
 
06:46:52.868 --> 06:46:52.878 align:start position:0%
for be baiting it's actually illegal to
 
06:46:54.388 --> 06:46:54.398 align:start position:0%
physically screw it into the tree
 
06:46:57.230 --> 06:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
obviously unless you own that tree so
 
06:46:59.110 --> 06:46:59.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment just puts Clarity even
 
06:47:01.510 --> 06:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
Colonel Jordan I if I'm can speak to
 
06:47:04.430 --> 06:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
this I think he put guidance out to his
 
06:47:06.990 --> 06:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
officers to allow it to be labeled in a
 
06:47:09.430 --> 06:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
broader fashion but guidance within the
 
06:47:10.990 --> 06:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
department is one thing I think you need
 
06:47:12.990 --> 06:47:13.000 align:start position:0%
Clarity in the law and that Clarity is
 
06:47:14.628 --> 06:47:14.638 align:start position:0%
here by allowing it on a strap or a
 
06:47:17.270 --> 06:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
placard or the
 
06:47:19.350 --> 06:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
camera okay further discussion on the
 
06:47:21.708 --> 06:47:21.718 align:start position:0%
amendment representative Darby thank you
 
06:47:24.070 --> 06:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chair well I don't support the bill
 
06:47:25.788 --> 06:47:25.798 align:start position:0%
in general I definitely support this
 
06:47:28.750 --> 06:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
amendment having hung lots of uh cameras
 
06:47:30.910 --> 06:47:30.920 align:start position:0%
myself I don't I think it would be a
 
06:47:32.270 --> 06:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
pain in the butt to actually have to
 
06:47:34.868 --> 06:47:34.878 align:start position:0%
label them in a way that is waterproof
 
06:47:37.110 --> 06:47:37.120 align:start position:0%
um and people can see it so this is this
 
06:47:39.430 --> 06:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
makes a lot of sense to
 
06:47:42.110 --> 06:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
me further
 
06:47:45.070 --> 06:47:45.080 align:start position:0%
discussion representative goalie thank
 
06:47:48.150 --> 06:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and I I don't
 
06:47:51.190 --> 06:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
see an issue with labeling cameras
 
06:47:53.868 --> 06:47:53.878 align:start position:0%
themselves um nothing more than
 
06:47:56.670 --> 06:47:56.680 align:start position:0%
um taking a fine point Sharpie and a
 
06:47:58.270 --> 06:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
piece of duct tape with your name and
 
06:48:00.948 --> 06:48:00.958 align:start position:0%
address on it and sticking that to a
 
06:48:02.910 --> 06:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
camera once it's written on on a flat
 
06:48:05.388 --> 06:48:05.398 align:start position:0%
piece of on a table
 
06:48:08.430 --> 06:48:08.440 align:start position:0%
um I don't see where the issue is um
 
06:48:10.990 --> 06:48:11.000 align:start position:0%
they are square some of them are around
 
06:48:13.670 --> 06:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
but tape is flexible and that's probably
 
06:48:15.070 --> 06:48:15.080 align:start position:0%
one of the most easiest I think we've
 
06:48:17.628 --> 06:48:17.638 align:start position:0%
all done um address labels in our lives
 
06:48:19.990 --> 06:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
on stuff and they all work and Sharpies
 
06:48:23.708 --> 06:48:23.718 align:start position:0%
are waterproof um they wear well they'll
 
06:48:25.990 --> 06:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
last more than a season I can testify
 
06:48:28.270 --> 06:48:28.280 align:start position:0%
that as you have to put your name on
 
06:48:29.990 --> 06:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
address on arrows that are out in the
 
06:48:32.788 --> 06:48:32.798 align:start position:0%
woods in the weather all the time they
 
06:48:36.628 --> 06:48:36.638 align:start position:0%
hold up so that's where I'm at when I
 
06:48:38.150 --> 06:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
can attest that Sharpies work well on
 
06:48:40.910 --> 06:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
arrows on the Fletching don't write it
 
06:48:44.510 --> 06:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
on the shaft it wears off um any further
 
06:48:46.670 --> 06:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
discussion on the amendment sure
 
06:48:48.430 --> 06:48:48.440 align:start position:0%

06:48:50.030 --> 06:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
can anyone in the room verify if it's
 
06:48:52.110 --> 06:48:52.120 align:start position:0%
illegal to put nails into a
 
06:48:52.120 --> 06:48:55.510 align:start position:0%
illegal to put nails into a
tree

06:48:55.510 --> 06:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:56.830 --> 06:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
it is
 
06:49:00.430 --> 06:49:00.440 align:start position:0%
not without it's not legal without
 
06:49:01.750 --> 06:49:01.760 align:start position:0%

nail in a
 
06:49:07.468 --> 06:49:07.478 align:start position:0%
tree if it's your own tree you can do
 
06:49:09.430 --> 06:49:09.440 align:start position:0%

further discussion representative Darby
 
06:51:38.708 --> 06:51:38.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um as we heard a few
 
06:51:42.788 --> 06:51:42.798 align:start position:0%
minutes ago um uh number of uh people
 
06:51:44.468 --> 06:51:44.478 align:start position:0%
were opposed to this including the Farm
 
06:51:47.110 --> 06:51:47.120 align:start position:0%
Bureau Timber Owners Association and
 
06:51:49.190 --> 06:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
very importantly um fishing game
 
06:51:51.110 --> 06:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
although they um they did say they were
 
06:51:53.230 --> 06:51:53.240 align:start position:0%
willing to work on some of the the pr y
 
06:51:54.990 --> 06:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
concerns the thing that is most
 
06:51:58.948 --> 06:51:58.958 align:start position:0%
concerning to me is um the inability to
 
06:52:03.310 --> 06:52:03.320 align:start position:0%
place um to place cameras um for uh
 
06:52:06.270 --> 06:52:06.280 align:start position:0%
endangered um and non-game species which
 
06:52:08.150 --> 06:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
are used for studies right now that this
 
06:52:10.788 --> 06:52:10.798 align:start position:0%
would prohibit without um without
 
06:52:13.910 --> 06:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
permission and as we heard um the
 
06:52:16.070 --> 06:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
telling one person is the worst way to
 
06:52:18.110 --> 06:52:18.120 align:start position:0%
keep secret so that's why I'll be
