will be attending today and then I will
 
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
start with representa Hall who is
 
00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
replacing represent Myer standing in for
 
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:18.760 align:start position:0%
representative Myer on the committee at
 
00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:20.120 align:start position:0%
this time is that
 
00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:23.720 align:start position:0%
correct big shoes to fill yeah I think
 
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:27.640 align:start position:0%
represent I represent Bo and hopkington
 
00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair Dave luno serving the
 
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:35.800 align:start position:0%
education committee also represent Bowen
 
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
hopkington thank and I understand Hopkin
 
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
is really having some issues with their
 
00:09:42.509 --> 00:09:42.519 align:start position:0%
property taxes with the assessment
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
values going up significantly so we're
 
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:47.800 align:start position:0%
seeing this uh obviously in places all
 
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:50.680 align:start position:0%
across the state and hopkinton's um
 
00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:54.200 align:start position:0%
overall valuation went up by 78% so if
 
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
your um property was valued at more than
 
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
78% then your taxes go up less than 78%
 
00:10:01.829 --> 00:10:01.839 align:start position:0%
then your taxes go down but I think this
 
00:10:06.269 --> 00:10:06.279 align:start position:0%
is a byproduct of uh of a um you know
 
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
coming out of covid and U and with lots
 
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
of weird things sort of um you know
 
00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:12.440 align:start position:0%
happening in the real estate industry I
 
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:13.720 align:start position:0%
don't think anybody would call this a
 
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
normal Market yeah yeah absolutely
 
00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:18.670 align:start position:0%

they were it's cost a
 
00:10:46.629 --> 00:10:46.639 align:start position:0%
firestorm and of course we also have to
 
00:10:48.069 --> 00:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
rely upon the Department of Revenue
 
00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:50.600 align:start position:0%
Administration in terms of the equalized
 
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
ratios to see where we stand on that but
 
00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
uh it's happening throughout the state
 
00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.480 align:start position:0%

00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
is is absent today
 
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
and we have Steve applebe uh sitting
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
with us I asked Steve to sit here with
 
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:38.440 align:start position:0%
us seeing that he has also shared the
 
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
task force which looked at the alignment
 
00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:11:43.389 --> 00:11:43.399 align:start position:0%
strategies uh for the community college
 
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
system and the university system and put
 
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
the report out that's already got all of
 
00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:51.320 align:start position:0%
us hopping and moving forward so Steve
 
00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
do you have anything to say about
 
00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
that just no because there's a group of
 
00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
people over there will probably tiar and
 
00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
feather me so uh no I don't just uh
 
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:02.120 align:start position:0%
happy to be here in support however I
 
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
can we met for about three months and
 
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
was well close about 60 hours worth of
 
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
time we put into that with the I think
 
00:12:13.949 --> 00:12:13.959 align:start position:0%
about 12 people on that task force a lot
 
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
of work a lot of effort and I think the
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
product is is one that's worthy and and
 
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
um tying it in with hp1
 
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:25.720 align:start position:0%
1450 uh I think we're making some good
 
00:12:28.509 --> 00:12:28.519 align:start position:0%
Headway so we have in front of us today
 
00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0%
several pieces the paper which uh for
 
00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
those in the public don't have copy
 
00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:34.720 align:start position:0%
there's copies over on the side there we
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
have an agenda and there's also
 
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
supportive information uh which came out
 
00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
of the task force and it's not the whole
 
00:12:45.509 --> 00:12:45.519 align:start position:0%
task force report it only has attached
 
00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
to it the short-term and long-term
 
00:12:51.509 --> 00:12:51.519 align:start position:0%
recommendations which came out of that
 
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
uh task force which there are a number
 
00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:53.870 align:start position:0%
uh task force which there are a number
of

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations and we will get into
 
00:12:57.949 --> 00:12:57.959 align:start position:0%

into that part of the the docket
 
00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
today just as an
 
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
overview um the governor's executive
 
00:13:27.389 --> 00:13:27.399 align:start position:0%
order that's
 
00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
20236 and HB
 
00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:33.839 align:start position:0%
1450 had some very specific uh issues
 
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
which we were asked to address and I'll
 
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:39.160 align:start position:0%
just go over that they're in the agenda
 
00:13:45.949 --> 00:13:45.959 align:start position:0%
under uh item 2 a one or I public high
 
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
education strategy alignment one to
 
00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
increase education attainment
 
00:13:52.829 --> 00:13:52.839 align:start position:0%
opportunities to meet Workforce needs
 
00:13:56.269 --> 00:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
that was one of those goals improve
 
00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:58.240 align:start position:0%
accessibility and compatibility for New
 
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students so we really want to
 
00:14:03.069 --> 00:14:03.079 align:start position:0%
look at this issue of access of all of
 
00:14:05.389 --> 00:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
our students in the state to higher
 
00:14:08.189 --> 00:14:08.199 align:start position:0%
education three minimize duplication of
 
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
academic programs appro as appropriate
 
00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:13.839 align:start position:0%
appropriate while optimizing access to
 
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:16.600 align:start position:0%
students so if there's duplication of
 
00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
programs going on if that there can be
 
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
some ISS uh changes made uh that could
 
00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:25.720 align:start position:0%
be a changing uh uh Savings of of
 
00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
dollars however we won't don't we we
 
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
need to be cautious that we are
 
00:14:33.949 --> 00:14:33.959 align:start position:0%
optimizing and not taking the access of
 
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
these programs away from students for
 
00:14:39.189 --> 00:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
example isolated locations so it's it's
 
00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
an issue which we have to carefully look
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
at number four create potential for
 
00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
economies of scale and Synergy if we
 
00:14:47.389 --> 00:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
work together we're going to accomplish
 
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:49.160 align:start position:0%
a whole lot more so with the community
 
00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
college system University system working
 
00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
closely together um I think we can
 
00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
accomplish many of those uh
 
00:14:58.590 --> 00:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
recommendations and goals set forth in
 
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
their report and I'd like to recognize
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%

delandro okay speech is silver but
 
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
silence is golden great okay the sixth
 
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
um uh our fifth uh goal which was in the
 
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
report 1450 and which the task force Lo
 
00:15:34.629 --> 00:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
is to enhance regional growth and
 
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
development six streamline and
 
00:15:39.389 --> 00:15:39.399 align:start position:0%
administrative costs and obligations I
 
00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
think we'll hear something about that
 
00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:43.480 align:start position:0%
today for sure and number seven continue
 
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
to work towards transfer a program and
 
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
credit across the two systems and that
 
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
hearkens back to HB 1530 which we have
 
00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
passed several years ago to try to have
 
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
transferability and Pathways established
 
00:15:59.670 --> 00:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
between the Community College system to
 
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
the four-year
 
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
system with that I'd also like to
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
recognize director
 
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
applebe uh who was in chair of that task
 
00:16:13.069 --> 00:16:13.079 align:start position:0%
force and Steve is sitting at the table
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
with us right now uh that report was
 
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
issued this this year in March 27 2024
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
it says 324 I don't think that's
 
00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:25.720 align:start position:0%
possible but
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
2024 and that report is available online
 
00:16:32.749 --> 00:16:32.759 align:start position:0%
and we do have uh a bit of it available
 
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
for the public as I've said uh in the
 
00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.269 align:start position:0%
for the public as I've said uh in the
reports

00:16:37.269 --> 00:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
reports
 
00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
uh Mr appy would you like to say
 
00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:42.440 align:start position:0%
anything about that study committee and
 
00:16:44.189 --> 00:16:44.199 align:start position:0%
what it
 
00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
accomplished just to give us some
 
00:16:48.509 --> 00:16:48.519 align:start position:0%
groundwork yeah thank you chair lad um
 
00:16:50.069 --> 00:16:50.079 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure what yourself and
 
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
representative luno have been doing with
 
00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
your Fridays since that ended I know
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%

all through the winter um no thank you
 
00:16:59.710 --> 00:16:59.720 align:start position:0%
to both of you and thank you to the
 
00:17:02.949 --> 00:17:02.959 align:start position:0%
chancellors who gave their time um in
 
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
that effort really generously I mean we
 
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
we spent a lot of time talked a lot
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
about a lot of a lot of different
 
00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:12.079 align:start position:0%
possible ideas um and hopefully the
 
00:17:14.309 --> 00:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
synthesis to a set of shortterm and a
 
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
set of longer term goals um made it a
 
00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
little more manageable for the systems
 
00:17:21.189 --> 00:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
and I noted in the in the first filing
 
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
there were a number of items um that
 
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
they're already working on which is
 
00:17:26.549 --> 00:17:26.559 align:start position:0%
wonderful or already have completed so
 
00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:28.600 align:start position:0%
and I look forward to to talking more
 
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
about that so thank you very much and
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
item three underneath the new business
 
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
is I put this in here because some might
 
00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
ask why is the study committee
 
00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:41.240 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney you you're welcome
 
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
to sit over here to the
 
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
right you must have sped down that road
 
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
to get
 
00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
here okay uh item three reads the
 
00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
chancellors of the University system of
 
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:55.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and Community College
 
00:17:57.549 --> 00:17:57.559 align:start position:0%
system of New Hampshire shall submit
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
joint quarterly progress reports
 
00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:02.440 align:start position:0%
addressing higher education strategic
 
00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
alignment outcomes to the public higher
 
00:18:06.669 --> 00:18:06.679 align:start position:0%
education study committee beginning with
 
00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:10.520 align:start position:0%
the calendar quarter ending June 30 2024
 
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
or as requested by the committee that's
 
00:18:15.789 --> 00:18:15.799 align:start position:0%
in law right now and that's why we are
 
00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
meeting today to have that first
 
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
quarterly report presented to this body
 
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
beginning November 1 2024 and each
 
00:18:27.789 --> 00:18:27.799 align:start position:0%
November 1 thereafter the chancellor
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
shall submit and annual report regarding
 
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
implementation of comprehensive higher
 
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
education alignment strategies and
 
00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:37.559 align:start position:0%
findings to the governor and Council
 
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
Senate finance and education committees
 
00:18:42.029 --> 00:18:42.039 align:start position:0%
the house finance and policy committees
 
00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:43.799 align:start position:0%
the Board of Trustees of the University
 
00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:45.640 align:start position:0%
system of New Hampshire and the
 
00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
community college system of New
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the commissioner of
 
00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
education so this is a real important uh
 
00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:58.799 align:start position:0%
uh issue which is moving forward and I
 
00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
can recall that when I talked to Fred
 
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:03.400 align:start position:0%
Coker at WMUR he said this is probably
 
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
one of the most important issues in
 
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:07.480 align:start position:0%
higher education that he seen in this
 
00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
lifetime and there's a lot of potential
 
00:19:12.909 --> 00:19:12.919 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at here because our
 
00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
our our systems were going through this
 
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
shrinking demographic of students and
 
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:20.200 align:start position:0%
the availability of dollars uh may not
 
00:19:23.149 --> 00:19:23.159 align:start position:0%
be matching those demographic shifts so
 
00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:25.919 align:start position:0%
with that I'd like to welcome
 
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
chancellors Kathy prenter and Mark
 
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
Rubenstein sign and could you please
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
take us through the report that you've
 
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
issued and uh under uh two be here uh
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
presenting that report I I noticed that
 
00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
there's uh about seven or eight items
 
00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
that you'd like to really speak to
 
00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
so I'll leave it to
 
00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:51.159 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair um good morning
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
we're very pleased to present what we've
 
00:19:57.870 --> 00:19:57.880 align:start position:0%
been doing since the report was issued
 
00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is Katherine
 
00:20:00.789 --> 00:20:00.799 align:start position:0%
preventure I serve as the chancellor of
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
our state university
 
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
system um maybe we could just start with
 
00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:08.200 align:start position:0%
a little bit of background to talk about
 
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
what we actually as soon as the report
 
00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
was issued in I think the end of March
 
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
um Chancellor Rubenstein and I met with
 
00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:19.880 align:start position:0%
um leaders from both systems to try to
 
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
digest the report because it is sweeping
 
00:20:27.549 --> 00:20:27.559 align:start position:0%
and we can't tackle everything at once
 
00:20:29.669 --> 00:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
so there's a little graph as in an
 
00:20:32.549 --> 00:20:32.559 align:start position:0%
appendix to this first report that we
 
00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:36.799 align:start position:0%
submitted to the committee and we we
 
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
identified a number of initiatives that
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
we were already jointly working
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
on but maybe not with the intention that
 
00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
um was deserved and so we I think the
 
00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
six or seven that are in your the first
 
00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
quarterly report or there eight um these
 
00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
are on goinging initiatives there are
 
00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:03.320 align:start position:0%
others um but but and we can speak to
 
00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:04.799 align:start position:0%
these and there's there are even some
 
00:21:07.789 --> 00:21:07.799 align:start position:0%
updates since since this report and
 
00:21:11.789 --> 00:21:11.799 align:start position:0%
while I have the floor the November 1st
 
00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
report um I I'm thinking we're in all
 
00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:17.240 align:start position:0%
likelihood maybe just going to give an
 
00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
update to the items that are in this
 
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
report or if any others um any other
 
00:21:26.149 --> 00:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
initiatives come on the docket but both
 
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
systems have a lot going on and so we
 
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
are we're not going to submit a Our
 
00:21:33.269 --> 00:21:33.279 align:start position:0%
intention is not to submit a report
 
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
addressing all the short-term and all
 
00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:37.720 align:start position:0%
the long-term recommendations rather
 
00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
those we've identified as we're going to
 
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:41.240 align:start position:0%
start here we're going to get some wind
 
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
in our sales and continue moving moving
 
00:21:46.269 --> 00:21:46.279 align:start position:0%
forward does that make sense to the
 
00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
committee that that to me that makes
 
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
sense uh because we're talking about one
 
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
month from today exactly and um this has
 
00:21:58.269 --> 00:21:58.279 align:start position:0%
happened very quickly and and looking at
 
00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:01.039 align:start position:0%
this report right here I know there's a
 
00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:04.360 align:start position:0%
number of short-term goals and longer
 
00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.430 align:start position:0%
number of short-term goals and longer
term

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:06.440 align:start position:0%
term
 
00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
recommendations and you really have had
 
00:22:13.269 --> 00:22:13.279 align:start position:0%
to sort of initially here pick out
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
certain issues that you can address
 
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
right now and others which are more
 
00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
long-term need a lot of work I get it
 
00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:24.200 align:start position:0%
and so it'd be really great if you could
 
00:22:26.549 --> 00:22:26.559 align:start position:0%
for example start on page two of that
 
00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
report with item number one which deals
 
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:31.640 align:start position:0%
with the how we're where we are in terms
 
00:22:33.909 --> 00:22:33.919 align:start position:0%
of approving ability to transfer from
 
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
community college system to the
 
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:37.240 align:start position:0%
university system New Hampshire that's
 
00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:39.400 align:start position:0%
number one right there that you've opted
 
00:22:43.269 --> 00:22:43.279 align:start position:0%
to address in this report um then I I
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
think we can close out this thing at
 
00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
least from my perspective and looking at
 
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
some of those other goals or incent
 
00:22:51.909 --> 00:22:51.919 align:start position:0%
initiatives that we have there which are
 
00:22:55.269 --> 00:22:55.279 align:start position:0%
important due to the issues surrounding
 
00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
the state right now in terms of higher
 
00:22:59.149 --> 00:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
education just article in the Wall
 
00:23:01.549 --> 00:23:01.559 align:start position:0%
Street Journal just several days ago
 
00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
that we know we have a number of our
 
00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:06.200 align:start position:0%
high school kids which graduate from
 
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
schools in New Hampshire that opt to go
 
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
outside uh by outside to another state
 
00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:14.799 align:start position:0%
within New England or further but the
 
00:23:16.269 --> 00:23:16.279 align:start position:0%
Wall Street Journal came forward and
 
00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
said this is no longer just a New
 
00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire problem it's a New England
 
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
issue that there's many students up here
 
00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:25.640 align:start position:0%
now are opting to go to the southern
 
00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
states like a Georgia Tech or a UNC
 
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
due to costs affordability and program
 
00:23:36.149 --> 00:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
that maybe best fits their needs right
 
00:23:38.669 --> 00:23:38.679 align:start position:0%
now all those various needs so we're
 
00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:41.320 align:start position:0%
losing students to other locations
 
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
regions in this country today due to the
 
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
affordability the private school at
 
00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
$77,000 a year is just Out Of Reach now
 
00:23:52.269 --> 00:23:52.279 align:start position:0%
and so let's start off with number one
 
00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
and then work towards some of those
 
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
other issues uh throughout the report
 
00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
here and then talk about those La that
 
00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:58.990 align:start position:0%
here and then talk about those La that
last

00:23:58.990 --> 00:23:59.000 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
part recommendations for where we're
 
00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
going for at least 25 years the issue of
 
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
transferability between the two systems
 
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
has been a conversation between the two
 
00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
systems and also with the legislature
 
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
and other
 
00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:17.320 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and I would tell you in the
 
00:24:19.269 --> 00:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
last several years we've seen real
 
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
progress particularly catalyzed by House
 
00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:22.750 align:start position:0%
progress particularly catalyzed by House
Bill

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
1530 we now have very tangible uh I
 
00:24:29.149 --> 00:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
think we're approaching 100 Pathways the
 
00:24:31.389 --> 00:24:31.399 align:start position:0%
original deliverable was was 50 which
 
00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:34.799 align:start position:0%
exceeded the request of Statute but at
 
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
at this point roughly 100 programs that
 
00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:39.320 align:start position:0%
have been identified where students who
 
00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
follow pathways through the community
 
00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
college system can move seamlessly into
 
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
the university system and the thought is
 
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
that that has long-term benefits for
 
00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
students not having to repeat courses
 
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
not having the frustration of
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
uncertainty and over time as we
 
00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
Implement some new tools to be able to
 
00:24:59.750 --> 00:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
help students m their degree progress
 
00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
between the two systems to see how
 
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
courses and programs at our CCS nature
 
00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
institutions will flow into the
 
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
university system we're going to make
 
00:25:12.149 --> 00:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
that much easier later on I'll come back
 
00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
to talk about Early College because the
 
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
ability to help anchor students
 
00:25:18.389 --> 00:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
opportunities and interest while they're
 
00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:19.720 align:start position:0%
still in high school here in New
 
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think has long-term benefit
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
for keeping more of those students here
 
00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire making what might
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
appeal appear as appealing options to
 
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
the South or other states perhaps Le
 
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
less appealing less compelling when the
 
00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:34.120 align:start position:0%
students have already made significant
 
00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
progress and they and their families
 
00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
have had significant benefit on the
 
00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:43.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
enrollment I'd like to um I agree with
 
00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
everything Jen
 
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
Rubenstein um shared I I do want to
 
00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
point out a couple things um there's
 
00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
technology needed to
 
00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
make this really seamless and
 
00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:03.320 align:start position:0%
userfriendly for this for our students
 
00:26:05.029 --> 00:26:05.039 align:start position:0%
both community college and university
 
00:26:06.909 --> 00:26:06.919 align:start position:0%
system so we're starting to Pilot some
 
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
of that um but it it's not as simple you
 
00:26:13.669 --> 00:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
know because here's your
 
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
pathway these are the courses you need
 
00:26:18.029 --> 00:26:18.039 align:start position:0%
to take
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
to come to the university system and get
 
00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:24.559 align:start position:0%
a bachelor's degree in whatever your one
 
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
of the hundred um
 
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
Pathways but with techn techology that
 
00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
faculty could keep up to dat as
 
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
curriculum changes over time and that
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
would help the students um be able to
 
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
interact with their Pathways and as they
 
00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:44.120 align:start position:0%
choose different things or stop out and
 
00:26:48.549 --> 00:26:48.559 align:start position:0%
come back so um that that that will be
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
an issue right we can make all these
 
00:26:52.669 --> 00:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
Pathways but the technology will be
 
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
important and there's a CA to that
 
00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
Chancellor can you speak to this a
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
little bit in the report which we got
 
00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:00.200 align:start position:0%
July 2
 
00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:03.320 align:start position:0%
2024 uh that came in from Wayne Jones I
 
00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
believe uh the final report summary for
 
00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:10.840 align:start position:0%
1530 had uh an area which dealt with
 
00:27:14.029 --> 00:27:14.039 align:start position:0%
ongoing activities and it says advise
 
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
advisor training and Pathways
 
00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:17.960 align:start position:0%
particularly for community college
 
00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:20.120 align:start position:0%
system New Hampshire advisors is now a
 
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
top priority while both University
 
00:27:24.029 --> 00:27:24.039 align:start position:0%
system and the community college system
 
00:27:26.149 --> 00:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
are working toward full implementation
 
00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:29.320 align:start position:0%
of tests the trans transer equivalency
 
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
system a common database of course
 
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
equivalencies necessary to help students
 
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
understand Pathways and customize their
 
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
Journey we are still working with
 
00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:41.480 align:start position:0%
Pathways in PDF format manual advising
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
on navigating the course equivalencies
 
00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
manual updating of courses equivalencies
 
00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:50.120 align:start position:0%
and Pathways so how's this how's this
 
00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:52.200 align:start position:0%
moving in terms of a student that's
 
00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:55.240 align:start position:0%
going to be let's say at White Mountain
 
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
and wanting to go off into the fouryear
 
00:27:59.389 --> 00:27:59.399 align:start position:0%
system knowing that the course I'm
 
00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:02.600 align:start position:0%
taking is going to be a transferable is
 
00:28:05.789 --> 00:28:05.799 align:start position:0%
there can they access this database or
 
00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
is are advisors helping them right now
 
00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:11.480 align:start position:0%
advisors are helping them right now but
 
00:28:13.789 --> 00:28:13.799 align:start position:0%
what we don't yet have fully implemented
 
00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
is the transfer database and the
 
00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:18.760 align:start position:0%
transfer pathways through a separate
 
00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
program so a lot of this is still very
 
00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:23.480 align:start position:0%
labor intensive and it requires students
 
00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
and advisors working closely together
 
00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:28.120 align:start position:0%
you you may be happy to know that advis
 
00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:31.640 align:start position:0%
users gathered at nhti conquer Community
 
00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:33.640 align:start position:0%
College within the last two weeks for a
 
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
training session on this very topic to
 
00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:38.200 align:start position:0%
try and make sure that we've got broader
 
00:28:40.029 --> 00:28:40.039 align:start position:0%
awareness and understanding of what the
 
00:28:42.149 --> 00:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
opportunities are for students across
 
00:28:44.909 --> 00:28:44.919 align:start position:0%
each of the campuses But ultimately you
 
00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:47.720 align:start position:0%
know that this generation in particular
 
00:28:50.269 --> 00:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
is more likely to pick up their phone
 
00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
than to text than they are to call or
 
00:28:54.909 --> 00:28:54.919 align:start position:0%
ask a question so to the extent that we
 
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
can enable the technology and give
 
00:28:59.190 --> 00:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
students the tools that are available
 
00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:01.480 align:start position:0%
when they're ready to ask the question
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
of the technology and not speak with an
 
00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
advisor we will undoubtedly make this
 
00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
work better for
 
00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:11.039 align:start position:0%
them other questions represent
 
00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
luno thanks very much Mr chair and
 
00:29:15.509 --> 00:29:15.519 align:start position:0%
thanks very much for uh for uh taking
 
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
the time to uh to talk with us about
 
00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
this this morning um for a for a student
 
00:29:23.909 --> 00:29:23.919 align:start position:0%
who has successfully completed a a
 
00:29:25.509 --> 00:29:25.519 align:start position:0%
pathway through the community college
 
00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
system and is ready to go about a
 
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
transferred to the university system
 
00:29:31.789 --> 00:29:31.799 align:start position:0%
what's the admissions process uh like
 
00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:33.640 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
student believe that's a direct admit
 
00:29:37.509 --> 00:29:37.519 align:start position:0%
that's what you that's what we're
 
00:29:37.519 --> 00:29:38.430 align:start position:0%
that's what you that's what we're
working

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:38.440 align:start position:0%
working
 
00:29:41.149 --> 00:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
toward that's well if they're in the
 
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
pathways this this was a separate the
 
00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
the advising is likely going hand inand
 
00:29:49.389 --> 00:29:49.399 align:start position:0%
on the pathways versus well what I'm
 
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
what I'm really what I'm really getting
 
00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
at is um is um let's say let's say the
 
00:29:56.669 --> 00:29:56.679 align:start position:0%
student started out at
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
nhti and um uh in an in an open
 
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
admissions is that the term um you know
 
00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
a program that doesn't require any any
 
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
um U additional you know
 
00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
um work uh but and and that student
 
00:30:15.509 --> 00:30:15.519 align:start position:0%
successfully completes the pathway
 
00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:17.240 align:start position:0%
whether that's an associates degree or
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
whether it's some some other certificate
 
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
program but is there for um has met the
 
00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
requirements for for transfering to the
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
university system do they have to any
 
00:30:30.909 --> 00:30:30.919 align:start position:0%
additional admissions or sat tests or
 
00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
anything like that no no SAT test but
 
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
this is the process that we're working
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
on for direct admission to make this
 
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
more seamless that a student completing
 
00:30:43.549 --> 00:30:43.559 align:start position:0%
that associate degree program is
 
00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:45.919 align:start position:0%
directly admitted into the
 
00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:49.240 align:start position:0%
usnh pathway that extends from the
 
00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
associate degree toward a bachelor's
 
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
degree right now there's still an
 
00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
application process and what we're
 
00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
currently working on between the two
 
00:30:59.509 --> 00:30:59.519 align:start position:0%
systems is a directed admission program
 
00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
that would allow that student no
 
00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
application fee simplified and there
 
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
there still needs to be some
 
00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
communication from the student to let
 
00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
them to let the US nature in institution
 
00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
know who they are where they're headed
 
00:31:14.509 --> 00:31:14.519 align:start position:0%
which institution which program but we
 
00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
are trying to make that much simpler for
 
00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
students and remove what has been a
 
00:31:21.549 --> 00:31:21.559 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic uh step that students need
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
to take great great I I that's that's
 
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
wonderful to hear because I think that's
 
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
that's you know important for the
 
00:31:28.909 --> 00:31:28.919 align:start position:0%
students I think it's important for the
 
00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
families um as well to be able to see
 
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
that that that path exists for that
 
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
student from the first day they step on
 
00:31:41.389 --> 00:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
the nhti campus uh uh that uh that you
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
know following successful completion uh
 
00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
they'll be able to continue seamlessly
 
00:31:48.909 --> 00:31:48.919 align:start position:0%
right through the university system and
 
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
I think um um more than a decade ago I
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
think we implemented a program like that
 
00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:56.120 align:start position:0%
with uh the engineering technology
 
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
program in partnership with un
 
00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
Manchester and um and
 
00:32:03.149 --> 00:32:03.159 align:start position:0%
nhti and in fact on the the day they
 
00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
started at nhti they were also
 
00:32:10.029 --> 00:32:10.039 align:start position:0%
considered to be UNH students and um um
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
so uh so I'm really glad to hear that
 
00:32:16.269 --> 00:32:16.279 align:start position:0%
that that approach uh uh can be extended
 
00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
to so many other
 
00:32:21.509 --> 00:32:21.519 align:start position:0%
programs another
 
00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:24.440 align:start position:0%
um more intangible benefit of all of
 
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
this work is that folks from the
 
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
University system and the community
 
00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
college system are working in Tandem and
 
00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:34.760 align:start position:0%
are in constant contact UM the
 
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
enrollment people the the um advising
 
00:32:42.149 --> 00:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
the even the communications people are
 
00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
the Provost from the University system
 
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
and the vice presidents of academic
 
00:32:48.029 --> 00:32:48.039 align:start position:0%
Affairs at the all the community
 
00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
colleges are
 
00:32:52.509 --> 00:32:52.519 align:start position:0%
meeting together quarterly so you know
 
00:32:56.509 --> 00:32:56.519 align:start position:0%
it builds trust it it it really um is
 
00:32:58.350 --> 00:32:58.360 align:start position:0%
providing a closer connection between
 
00:33:00.909 --> 00:33:00.919 align:start position:0%
the two systems just just this one piece
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
of work
 
00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
that's I actually mentioned the question
 
00:33:06.549 --> 00:33:06.559 align:start position:0%
that we've just been addressing is
 
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
actually represented by reflected in
 
00:33:11.149 --> 00:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
item two in the report we submitted that
 
00:33:13.549 --> 00:33:13.559 align:start position:0%
describes direct admission a process by
 
00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
which students who are completing
 
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
programs would flow seamlessly into the
 
00:33:21.269 --> 00:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
the next program within the university
 
00:33:24.549 --> 00:33:24.559 align:start position:0%
system that's great thank you very much
 
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
and would you like to move on to number
 
00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
two no I'd like to one more question of
 
00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:31.720 align:start position:0%
you what are the costs associated with
 
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
Tess in terms of to have this program
 
00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
the software package in place which
 
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
seems to me to be a key to it being
 
00:33:43.549 --> 00:33:43.559 align:start position:0%
successful as far as transferability for
 
00:33:46.029 --> 00:33:46.039 align:start position:0%
our student so there are actually two
 
00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
component programs and I won't get into
 
00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:49.720 align:start position:0%
it because I'm not here to do a sales
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
pitch for the company but the the two
 
00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:56.120 align:start position:0%
products together licensing for the next
 
00:33:58.350 --> 00:33:58.360 align:start position:0%
3 years will cost the community college
 
00:34:00.549 --> 00:34:00.559 align:start position:0%
system about
 
00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:03.320 align:start position:0%
$150,000 probably the more important
 
00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
piece is that somebody actually has to
 
00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
manage the work of this and probably
 
00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
looking at an additional 125,000 of
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
expense for the staff work surrounding
 
00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
this so all in somewhere in the
 
00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:18.919 align:start position:0%
$175,000 a year for the Community
 
00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:21.800 align:start position:0%
College systems efforts that doesn't
 
00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:23.800 align:start position:0%
account for every bit of time on each of
 
00:34:25.829 --> 00:34:25.839 align:start position:0%
the campuses where faculty are working
 
00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:27.800 align:start position:0%
on course equivalencies and the under
 
00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
lying material that will feed the system
 
00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
it's really more the administrative
 
00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
support for the system and how does that
 
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
work with a university system with Keen
 
00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
or Plymouth or UNH so so keen and
 
00:34:42.829 --> 00:34:42.839 align:start position:0%
Plymouth are not so UNH is piloting
 
00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
tests now the there's another product as
 
00:34:49.589 --> 00:34:49.599 align:start position:0%
as the chancellor um U just stated UNH
 
00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
is thinking about that understanding the
 
00:34:55.629 --> 00:34:55.639 align:start position:0%
the importance of the um of the tool but
 
00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
again it doesn't come without cost and
 
00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh so I would estimate the university
 
00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:05.839 align:start position:0%
system would incur similar costs that
 
00:35:08.589 --> 00:35:08.599 align:start position:0%
the that Mark has just mentioned it's
 
00:35:10.589 --> 00:35:10.599 align:start position:0%
it's the people it's keeping it up to
 
00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
it's the
 
00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
implementation working across all the
 
00:35:17.069 --> 00:35:17.079 align:start position:0%
institutions um The Faculty will need to
 
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
be involved to because it will be when
 
00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
curriculum is updated that will need to
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
be included in the in the
 
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
database so I I would yes across the two
 
00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:30.040 align:start position:0%
systems we're probably looking at a half
 
00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
a million dollars when you talk about
 
00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
the licensing the people the the
 
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:38.440 align:start position:0%
um technology maybe an implementation
 
00:35:41.109 --> 00:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
partner that will need to help stand
 
00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:43.400 align:start position:0%
this up on on seven campuses and three
 
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
campuses so it's it it's not without
 
00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:48.910 align:start position:0%
campuses so it's it it's not without
cost

00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
for repres Mr
 
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
Appleby thank you no no
 
00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
representative a quick question um
 
00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
understanding the costs to implement
 
00:36:01.069 --> 00:36:01.079 align:start position:0%
this do you have any idea what the costs
 
00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:03.800 align:start position:0%
are with the current system where oneoff
 
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
people apply they come from White
 
00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
Mountain they want to go to Plymouth
 
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
someone has to analyze their Trend I'm
 
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
currently right now we're managing this
 
00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:18.280 align:start position:0%
primarily with the resources that are
 
00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
part of our enterprise system and that
 
00:36:23.589 --> 00:36:23.599 align:start position:0%
covers a much broader range of functions
 
00:36:25.589 --> 00:36:25.599 align:start position:0%
than just this so I don't have a good
 
00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
way of breaking out a a specific cost
 
00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:31.480 align:start position:0%
associated with it I I would say that
 
00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:35.480 align:start position:0%
what we currently have isn't sufficient
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
and unlikely to be as effective as what
 
00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:39.880 align:start position:0%
we think we're moving toward and in that
 
00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:41.720 align:start position:0%
regard the cost is really lost
 
00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:50.440 align:start position:0%
students so then if if we if you receive
 
00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
like $550,000 or so would that be offset
 
00:36:57.790 --> 00:36:57.800 align:start position:0%
by the students now knowing my path way
 
00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:01.640 align:start position:0%
I've selected I can continue it and not
 
00:37:04.349 --> 00:37:04.359 align:start position:0%
worry about losing the money that I've
 
00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
spent right now and having things not
 
00:37:11.069 --> 00:37:11.079 align:start position:0%
transfer uh I'm is is the allocation or
 
00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:13.720 align:start position:0%
appropriation of another half a million
 
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
do offset by the the positive outcome we
 
00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:22.760 align:start position:0%
have from students oh would say
 
00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:26.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely be I can't I'm not going to
 
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
sign in blood that that's the case but
 
00:37:32.349 --> 00:37:32.359 align:start position:0%
if it's if it's difficult to to engage
 
00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
if if it's difficult for a
 
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
student they're not as apt to
 
00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
to enroll transfer and enroll in the
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
programs if it's easy I would think
 
00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:45.880 align:start position:0%
there would be many more students taking
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
advantage of it can I I'm going to back
 
00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
up just for a minute we um so the
 
00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
university system accepts all
 
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
credits right there it's not that
 
00:37:59.630 --> 00:37:59.640 align:start position:0%
credits aren't accepted it's that if you
 
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
need credits certain credits for a
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
major if those credits don't apply for
 
00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
the courses that you need for the major
 
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
okay if you take these courses in the
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
community college system they're all
 
00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:14.440 align:start position:0%
going to transfer into the courses you
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
need for this program that that you want
 
00:38:20.349 --> 00:38:20.359 align:start position:0%
to continue at the four-year level does
 
00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
that make
 
00:38:25.349 --> 00:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
sense okay if I may representative luno
 
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
earlier asked it use the phrase open
 
00:38:30.589 --> 00:38:30.599 align:start position:0%
admission for for many of our programs
 
00:38:32.589 --> 00:38:32.599 align:start position:0%
and as community colleges we are in fact
 
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
open admission if you've satisfied High
 
00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:38.200 align:start position:0%
School completion highet GED you're
 
00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
eligible for admission to our college
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
and to most of our programs but we do
 
00:38:44.829 --> 00:38:44.839 align:start position:0%
have some that are competitive and have
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
specific prerequisites where student
 
00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:50.920 align:start position:0%
needs to demonstrate capability in math
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
science whatever it might happen to
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
be in in some respects this discussion
 
00:38:58.950 --> 00:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
about trans transferability has a
 
00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
similar U split for a lot of students
 
00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
who are not sure what they want to study
 
00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:06.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of the courses they're likely to
 
00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:09.720 align:start position:0%
take will satisfy general education
 
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
requirements or elective requirements
 
00:39:14.069 --> 00:39:14.079 align:start position:0%
but if they're pursuing some of the more
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
structured and competitive programs in
 
00:39:19.069 --> 00:39:19.079 align:start position:0%
engineering technology and healthc Care
 
00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
in addition to having perhaps fewer
 
00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
electives associated with them it's
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
often the case that math is critical
 
00:39:27.069 --> 00:39:27.079 align:start position:0%
that a student has to begin with a
 
00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
certain level of math and so a student
 
00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:31.240 align:start position:0%
who's unsure what they're going to study
 
00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:33.720 align:start position:0%
and takes math courses that are not you
 
00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
know below the level of calculus for
 
00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:37.400 align:start position:0%
instance and perhaps then takes a
 
00:39:39.069 --> 00:39:39.079 align:start position:0%
Physics course that's algebra based
 
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
rather than calculus based may have to
 
00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:43.960 align:start position:0%
continue to make up those credits take
 
00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
those courses so the majority of
 
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
students who are in our more accessible
 
00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
programs probably don't lose a lot of
 
00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:54.920 align:start position:0%
credits in this process particularly if
 
00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
the programs they eventually find their
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
way toward are more in Liberal Arts or
 
00:40:01.069 --> 00:40:01.079 align:start position:0%
business where the structure of the
 
00:40:02.829 --> 00:40:02.839 align:start position:0%
curriculum often lends itself to a
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
little bit more breath and flexibility
 
00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:07.400 align:start position:0%
but for students interested in health
 
00:40:10.829 --> 00:40:10.839 align:start position:0%
care technology science programs that
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
have some of those underlying structural
 
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
requirements and this is where we'll
 
00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:19.000 align:start position:0%
we'll be helpful for students to see
 
00:40:21.069 --> 00:40:21.079 align:start position:0%
where they need to start uh for a
 
00:40:23.349 --> 00:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
student who's still genuinely undecided
 
00:40:25.069 --> 00:40:25.079 align:start position:0%
and is not prepared to take that more
 
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
rigorous Math course you know again this
 
00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:29.560 align:start position:0%
may not resolve that problem but for
 
00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:31.480 align:start position:0%
students who know that this is their
 
00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:33.880 align:start position:0%
aspiration they will have Clarity that
 
00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
this is where they need to start the
 
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
journey is that rigorous Math course
 
00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
being taught at the community college
 
00:40:42.829 --> 00:40:42.839 align:start position:0%
system level or do they have to wait and
 
00:40:44.829 --> 00:40:44.839 align:start position:0%
take that elsewhere no that that is
 
00:40:48.109 --> 00:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
taught at the community colleges uh no
 
00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
no no difficulty accessing High highly
 
00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
demanding curriculum for our students
 
00:40:54.829 --> 00:40:54.839 align:start position:0%
but again it becomes a question does the
 
00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
student understand that that's what the
 
00:40:59.430 --> 00:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
need is and by having these Pathways
 
00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:01.480 align:start position:0%
mapped out for a student who aspires to
 
00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:03.880 align:start position:0%
an engineering degree to know that an
 
00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:06.200 align:start position:0%
abet accredited engineering program at
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
UNH requires calculus as the
 
00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
foundation again that's very helpful
 
00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:14.200 align:start position:0%
guidance early on for a student and and
 
00:41:16.349 --> 00:41:16.359 align:start position:0%
this approach will be helpful for
 
00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:19.240 align:start position:0%
students to find that sign early rather
 
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
than just fortuitously have a
 
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
conversation with an
 
00:41:24.349 --> 00:41:24.359 align:start position:0%
advisor thank are there any other
 
00:41:26.109 --> 00:41:26.119 align:start position:0%
questions on this number one we have you
 
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
know Ju Just A clarifying um thing thank
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair so just on that on that
 
00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:33.800 align:start position:0%
point though where where you have sort
 
00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
of some underlying structural um um
 
00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
skills uh to
 
00:41:42.829 --> 00:41:42.839 align:start position:0%
to on the part on the part of the
 
00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
student to uh to even to enter some of
 
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
these programs at the community college
 
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
level uh once they've once they've
 
00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:54.280 align:start position:0%
demonstrated that they've met that um
 
00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
that either through the work they've
 
00:41:58.990 --> 00:41:59.000 align:start position:0%
done in high school or an application
 
00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
that you know uh you know at the
 
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
community college level or work they do
 
00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:05.480 align:start position:0%
at Community College uh once they've
 
00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:07.880 align:start position:0%
successfully completed the program or
 
00:42:10.309 --> 00:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
the pathway at the community college
 
00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
it's then seamless getting into the
 
00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
university system so so that that
 
00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:17.800 align:start position:0%
guarantee of of
 
00:42:20.829 --> 00:42:20.839 align:start position:0%
structural skill is done at the
 
00:42:23.589 --> 00:42:23.599 align:start position:0%
community college level and not
 
00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
corre correct but I want to clarify the
 
00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
student who has taken our calculus
 
00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:35.960 align:start position:0%
courses has satisfied the requirements
 
00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
for the calculus courses there are still
 
00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
competitive programs within the
 
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
university system I'd defer to
 
00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:45.640 align:start position:0%
Chancellor preventure to clarify whether
 
00:42:47.829 --> 00:42:47.839 align:start position:0%
uh completing the courses do would mean
 
00:42:49.589 --> 00:42:49.599 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't have to repeat the courses
 
00:42:51.309 --> 00:42:51.319 align:start position:0%
but I don't want to say that we've reach
 
00:42:53.829 --> 00:42:53.839 align:start position:0%
a point where every program is uniformly
 
00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
accessible through Pathways because some
 
00:43:00.589 --> 00:43:00.599 align:start position:0%
still have competive access okay okay
 
00:43:04.549 --> 00:43:04.559 align:start position:0%
the the Paul the Paul col Paul College
 
00:43:06.589 --> 00:43:06.599 align:start position:0%
business school is the most competitive
 
00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:08.440 align:start position:0%
nursing's number two and engineering's
 
00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:10.309 align:start position:0%
nursing's number two and engineering's
number

00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:43:12.829 --> 00:43:12.839 align:start position:0%
three I I would add one other point
 
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
about the transfer system and the
 
00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:17.480 align:start position:0%
technology that we're looking at we've
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
focused exclusively in this conversation
 
00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:23.480 align:start position:0%
about coures part of what we ultimately
 
00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
want to be able to do I apologize the
 
00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
speakers is poorly position here for eye
 
00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
contact part of what we'd like to be
 
00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
able to do is that there are industry
 
00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
recognized credentials there's training
 
00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:36.920 align:start position:0%
that employers provide that students can
 
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
demonstrate competency some of that
 
00:43:41.549 --> 00:43:41.559 align:start position:0%
aligns with courses that we offer and if
 
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
a student can demonstrate that
 
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
competency and we can document that as
 
00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:47.480 align:start position:0%
college level learning appropriate to
 
00:43:49.069 --> 00:43:49.079 align:start position:0%
the discipline with the right learning
 
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
outcomes we also don't want the student
 
00:43:53.309 --> 00:43:53.319 align:start position:0%
have to repeat that as a classroom
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
exercise if in fact they've already
 
00:43:59.109 --> 00:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
mastered it for reasons of time and cost
 
00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:02.200 align:start position:0%
but also
 
00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
you many students come directly from
 
00:44:06.589 --> 00:44:06.599 align:start position:0%
high school into college and for many of
 
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
us that was a typical pathway but
 
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
majority of our students are part-time
 
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
students and uh not a majority but
 
00:44:15.549 --> 00:44:15.559 align:start position:0%
plurality of them are older students and
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
often they're piecing together education
 
00:44:20.549 --> 00:44:20.559 align:start position:0%
we would like students who may have
 
00:44:22.349 --> 00:44:22.359 align:start position:0%
missed the opportunity right after high
 
00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
school to go to college and worried that
 
00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
they weren't capable students who have
 
00:44:28.589 --> 00:44:28.599 align:start position:0%
mastered some of these competencies
 
00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
through employment whether it's through
 
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:32.200 align:start position:0%
military service or with Employers in
 
00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
industry or Healthcare wherever the
 
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
setting we want them to recognize that
 
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
that's college level learning they've
 
00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
demonstrated success they are capable of
 
00:44:42.309 --> 00:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
doing it we think that this is also
 
00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
something that encourages people whose
 
00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
paths are somewhat different in reaching
 
00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
higher education postsecondary education
 
00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:50.920 align:start position:0%
to know that they have the opportunity
 
00:44:52.349 --> 00:44:52.359 align:start position:0%
but more importantly they have the
 
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
capability when they may be left High
 
00:44:56.670 --> 00:44:56.680 align:start position:0%
School believing that they didn't we'll
 
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
be able we'll talk a little bit more of
 
00:44:59.309 --> 00:44:59.319 align:start position:0%
that when we get to item number three
 
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
where we're talking about workplace and
 
00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:03.309 align:start position:0%
where we're talking about workplace and
recognize

00:45:03.309 --> 00:45:03.319 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
credentials uh in Industry credentials
 
00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:09.720 align:start position:0%
that may contribute to uh this whole
 
00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:11.960 align:start position:0%
process let's go on to number two right
 
00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
now the emissions process streamlining
 
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
acceptance processes to proactively
 
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
accept students um uh uh based on GPA
 
00:45:25.549 --> 00:45:25.559 align:start position:0%
and all that that's number two do you
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
want to speak to that I know we've sort
 
00:45:32.109 --> 00:45:32.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
bit so on the
 
00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:37.240 align:start position:0%
University system side to the from the
 
00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
community college system what we're
 
00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
talking about right now with our
 
00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
counterparts in the University system is
 
00:45:44.069 --> 00:45:44.079 align:start position:0%
something called direct admission that
 
00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:46.200 align:start position:0%
students who fulfill the requirements
 
00:45:48.069 --> 00:45:48.079 align:start position:0%
complete the associate degree following
 
00:45:50.069 --> 00:45:50.079 align:start position:0%
these Pathways would be directly
 
00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
admitted into the university system in
 
00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of the usnh programs
 
00:45:57.910 --> 00:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
without the additional burden of an
 
00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:00.040 align:start position:0%
application fee and with a streamlined
 
00:46:02.069 --> 00:46:02.079 align:start position:0%
application process that in some ways is
 
00:46:04.109 --> 00:46:04.119 align:start position:0%
almost more of a notification of I'm on
 
00:46:08.109 --> 00:46:08.119 align:start position:0%
my way so no uncertainty about whether
 
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
the student would be admissible having
 
00:46:11.549 --> 00:46:11.559 align:start position:0%
satisfied the requirements for the
 
00:46:14.309 --> 00:46:14.319 align:start position:0%
associate degree as part of the pathway
 
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
for the community college system we're
 
00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:17.960 align:start position:0%
also looking at whether there's an
 
00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:20.079 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us to make New
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's high school students more
 
00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
broadly aware of the opportunities for
 
00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:25.720 align:start position:0%
the University system or the community
 
00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
college system we understand from
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
discussions with director applebe and
 
00:46:32.430 --> 00:46:32.440 align:start position:0%
others that there are some impediments
 
00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
to the ways in which we can communicate
 
00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
with high school students and the ways
 
00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
in which the Department of Education can
 
00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
make information available or or to to
 
00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
those students and that may require some
 
00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
legislative attention uh to to address
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
our ability to reach that broader
 
00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
audience we certainly have access to
 
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
information about the roughly 6,000
 
00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
seniors in a given year who are taking
 
00:46:56.910 --> 00:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
Early College courses or the roughly
 
00:46:59.030 --> 00:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
10,000 students a year who take Early
 
00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
College courses who may be seniors or
 
00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:03.400 align:start position:0%
Juniors we can reach that group but we
 
00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:05.720 align:start position:0%
can't necessarily reach the other 5 to
 
00:47:08.829 --> 00:47:08.839 align:start position:0%
6,000 High School seniors in each cohort
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
who who may also benefit from knowing
 
00:47:12.349 --> 00:47:12.359 align:start position:0%
about opportunities that are available
 
00:47:14.109 --> 00:47:14.119 align:start position:0%
to them what are some of those
 
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
impediments that you speak of is it
 
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
or second yes
 
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
um understanding that data isn't my
 
00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
division that's Caitlyn
 
00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:29.720 align:start position:0%
but my understanding is there's a lot of
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
data we don't collect we're not allowed
 
00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
to collect on individual students in our
 
00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
K12 system so to provide a list to let's
 
00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:40.520 align:start position:0%
say the community college or university
 
00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:43.960 align:start position:0%
system um of all of the Juniors right
 
00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
now enrolled in a public high school in
 
00:47:48.069 --> 00:47:48.079 align:start position:0%
the state we're not we don't collect a
 
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
lot of that data and more important and
 
00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:53.240 align:start position:0%
we can't share what we do collect so I
 
00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:56.440 align:start position:0%
think what what we'd love to do is uh
 
00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:00.520 align:start position:0%
send a text or an email or phone call to
 
00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:01.870 align:start position:0%
send a text or an email or phone call to
every

00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
every
 
00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:05.480 align:start position:0%
graduating senior in in the state that
 
00:48:08.309 --> 00:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
maybe that's but but you know that data
 
00:48:10.069 --> 00:48:10.079 align:start position:0%
is hard to come by that you know if you
 
00:48:11.549 --> 00:48:11.559 align:start position:0%
met there certain eligibility you're
 
00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
admitted to the community college system
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
or the university system
 
00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
automatically and I believe the direct
 
00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
admit correct me if I'm wrong Mark um
 
00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:21.880 align:start position:0%
between the community college system and
 
00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
the university
 
00:48:27.069 --> 00:48:27.079 align:start position:0%
system even if a student graduate from
 
00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
the community college system outside of
 
00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:31.880 align:start position:0%
one of these Pathways and met certain
 
00:48:33.829 --> 00:48:33.839 align:start position:0%
GPA um
 
00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
levels we'd like to direct admit those
 
00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
students as well they may have to we
 
00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
talked about this already with the
 
00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:42.200 align:start position:0%
credits but at least give those students
 
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
an option if they were interested in in
 
00:48:48.069 --> 00:48:48.079 align:start position:0%
continuing on with their with their
 
00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
education but again we have we have
 
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
data in order to text every high school
 
00:48:57.150 --> 00:48:57.160 align:start position:0%
graduate in the state we need all their
 
00:49:00.549 --> 00:49:00.559 align:start position:0%
phone numbers or email or addresses that
 
00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
we could send them a postcard with a QR
 
00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:05.240 align:start position:0%
code on it you know it's you're you're
 
00:49:07.789 --> 00:49:07.799 align:start position:0%
directly admitted but that's personal
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
wow yeah for example um one of the
 
00:49:16.309 --> 00:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
articles I left with the chair this
 
00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
morning speaking about Georgia and the
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
success Georgia has seen with direct
 
00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
admission notes that one of the Georgia
 
00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
programs at the state level collects all
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
the contact information for high
 
00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:29.480 align:start position:0%
schoolers which then they make available
 
00:49:32.309 --> 00:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
to their their state systems for the
 
00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
direct one you know one of the benefits
 
00:49:35.789 --> 00:49:35.799 align:start position:0%
of having that data is they can work
 
00:49:37.829 --> 00:49:37.839 align:start position:0%
with their systems to make that data
 
00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
available so I I I believe it's in the
 
00:49:42.789 --> 00:49:42.799 align:start position:0%
Georgia article um that I left on your
 
00:49:46.589 --> 00:49:46.599 align:start position:0%
desk but you know that's a practical
 
00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:49.960 align:start position:0%
limitation to effectively doing direct
 
00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
admission yes we could deliver a box of
 
00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
postcards to every guidance counselor in
 
00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
the state but it's certainly far more
 
00:50:01.309 --> 00:50:01.319 align:start position:0%
effective if every if every student gets
 
00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
a text
 
00:50:07.349 --> 00:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
or some type of direct Outreach personto
 
00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:09.839 align:start position:0%
person then the guidance office has a
 
00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:12.200 align:start position:0%
stack of postcards and they give them
 
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
out we've given the College Board the
 
00:50:18.910 --> 00:50:18.920 align:start position:0%
authority to communicate with folks
 
00:50:21.309 --> 00:50:21.319 align:start position:0%
parents about the SAT scores and results
 
00:50:24.069 --> 00:50:24.079 align:start position:0%
directly could that same thing be done
 
00:50:28.510 --> 00:50:28.520 align:start position:0%
by the department to to the higher
 
00:50:31.109 --> 00:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
education systems so that we can have
 
00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
this you know direct admittance and sped
 
00:50:37.349 --> 00:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
up and and so that you've graduated from
 
00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
high school you're you're now accepted
 
00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
to PSU yeah I think that would be a good
 
00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
question for Caitlyn so I can certainly
 
00:50:47.470 --> 00:50:47.480 align:start position:0%
ask her when I see
 
00:50:49.870 --> 00:50:49.880 align:start position:0%
her you know what we could do there and
 
00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
if we needed statutory Assistance or I'm
 
00:50:54.309 --> 00:50:54.319 align:start position:0%
not even sure how much we actually
 
00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
collect at the department I don't think
 
00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:05.589 --> 00:51:05.599 align:start position:0%
this yeah sounded right I'm with you I I
 
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
just don't understand you know we've
 
00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
missed the boat
 
00:51:15.150 --> 00:51:15.160 align:start position:0%
here just go ahead um this narrative
 
00:51:17.069 --> 00:51:17.079 align:start position:0%
that has gone on for quite a period of
 
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
time uh we we've been hearing this
 
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:23.640 align:start position:0%
narrative I have for the last 30
 
00:51:28.109 --> 00:51:28.119 align:start position:0%
years 30 years Walter pet and I headed a
 
00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
task force about transferability and
 
00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
acceptance 30 years ago and we thought
 
00:51:38.109 --> 00:51:38.119 align:start position:0%
we solved the problem 30 years ago
 
00:51:40.829 --> 00:51:40.839 align:start position:0%
evidently it's not only uh
 
00:51:43.549 --> 00:51:43.559 align:start position:0%
resurfaced but it now has
 
00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
expanded and and we're trying to deal
 
00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:47.960 align:start position:0%
with it with different uh different
 
00:51:51.549 --> 00:51:51.559 align:start position:0%
methodologies but it it seems to me if
 
00:51:54.069 --> 00:51:54.079 align:start position:0%
basic data is not
 
00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
available we're we're we're sort of
 
00:52:00.349 --> 00:52:00.359 align:start position:0%
fighting a game that we can't win and
 
00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:02.680 align:start position:0%
our our goal is to
 
00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
provide the best opportunity for our
 
00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
students and I want to compliment the
 
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
Community College my grandson is a
 
00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
student at the University of Utah He's a
 
00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
freshman he got nine credits accepted
 
00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
that he took at portzman high school
 
00:52:19.710 --> 00:52:19.720 align:start position:0%
under the under the program they
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
accepted the credits I I don't know what
 
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
category they put them but they accepted
 
00:52:26.069 --> 00:52:26.079 align:start position:0%
the credits so that's a plus Forest I'm
 
00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
going to bring good news to the to the
 
00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:30.640 align:start position:0%
occasion today that they they were
 
00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
accepted was it going to save my my
 
00:52:34.789 --> 00:52:34.799 align:start position:0%
daughter and her husband money I don't
 
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
think so but indeed the credits got
 
00:52:40.829 --> 00:52:40.839 align:start position:0%
accepted I I think the thing that that I
 
00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
look at is basic fundamentals if basic
 
00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
knowledge is not available for us for
 
00:52:49.630 --> 00:52:49.640 align:start position:0%
example knowledge about each one of our
 
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
our graduates how how are we going to
 
00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
assist them as as they move as they move
 
00:52:57.710 --> 00:52:57.720 align:start position:0%
forward and you know we talked about
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
direct that that's that's I think that's
 
00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
the that's the first question I want
 
00:53:04.750 --> 00:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
address if that's not available how do
 
00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
we how do we positively affect these
 
00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
these people these students because we
 
00:53:13.630 --> 00:53:13.640 align:start position:0%
want them to move on to move on to the
 
00:53:15.789 --> 00:53:15.799 align:start position:0%
Community College if that's the the path
 
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
that they want to take to the university
 
00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:20.680 align:start position:0%
system if that's the path that they that
 
00:53:23.109 --> 00:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
they want to take but you know
 
00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
connectability is problematic in the old
 
00:53:29.069 --> 00:53:29.079 align:start position:0%
days the old days we had the title 3
 
00:53:33.069 --> 00:53:33.079 align:start position:0%
Program which financed Admissions and
 
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
admissions councils would go out to
 
00:53:37.630 --> 00:53:37.640 align:start position:0%
every High School in the state and
 
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
gather information it seemed to work now
 
00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
the title 3 program is good that that
 
00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
initiative is good but as a result
 
00:53:49.150 --> 00:53:49.160 align:start position:0%
there's a g it seems to me there's a gap
 
00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
Mr CH and if we kit fill the Gap how we
 
00:53:53.829 --> 00:53:53.839 align:start position:0%
going to service the
 
00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
kids thank you
 
00:54:00.670 --> 00:54:00.680 align:start position:0%
if if I may say and I appreciate and
 
00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
what I said roughly 25 years ago was in
 
00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
the context of the work that you and
 
00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:09.400 align:start position:0%
Governor Peterson worked on at the time
 
00:54:11.309 --> 00:54:11.319 align:start position:0%
he was serving as a trustee of both
 
00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
systems and and pointed to this issue I
 
00:54:16.910 --> 00:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
would tell you we've made significant
 
00:54:19.109 --> 00:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
progress over time that we're we're
 
00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
getting much further along than we were
 
00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:24.520 align:start position:0%
in the early days part of the issue was
 
00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
accreditation the accreditation the
 
00:54:28.109 --> 00:54:28.119 align:start position:0%
Community College systems not aligned
 
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
with the accreditation of the University
 
00:54:31.390 --> 00:54:31.400 align:start position:0%
system which became a barrier there have
 
00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
been some additional layers of of
 
00:54:37.150 --> 00:54:37.160 align:start position:0%
specialized accreditation whether it was
 
00:54:41.549 --> 00:54:41.559 align:start position:0%
aacs aacsb for business programs or AET
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
accredit much of that has been resolved
 
00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
where we really are right now is gaps in
 
00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:48.280 align:start position:0%
information that we're trying to fix
 
00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
rather than resistance on the part of
 
00:54:53.230 --> 00:54:53.240 align:start position:0%
the University system instances where a
 
00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:55.720 align:start position:0%
student doesn't know what courses will
 
00:54:58.069 --> 00:54:58.079 align:start position:0%
or won't transfer and may again as an
 
00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:00.280 align:start position:0%
undecided student may start with a math
 
00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:02.680 align:start position:0%
course that does not align with the abet
 
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
required calculus based course so I
 
00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
think we've made some progress for years
 
00:55:12.190 --> 00:55:12.200 align:start position:0%
the College Board has allowed colleges
 
00:55:16.270 --> 00:55:16.280 align:start position:0%
to purchase contact information for sat
 
00:55:19.630 --> 00:55:19.640 align:start position:0%
takers the problem for us the limitation
 
00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:21.880 align:start position:0%
is that that only allows us to purchase
 
00:55:24.109 --> 00:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
the contact information for students who
 
00:55:27.390 --> 00:55:27.400 align:start position:0%
take the SAT but not for every student
 
00:55:29.589 --> 00:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
who has the potential to be successful
 
00:55:31.230 --> 00:55:31.240 align:start position:0%
generally speaking community colleges
 
00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:33.720 align:start position:0%
don't require the SAT and for a lot of
 
00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:35.640 align:start position:0%
students who have not taken the
 
00:55:38.109 --> 00:55:38.119 align:start position:0%
SAT they're in a place where we don't
 
00:55:40.029 --> 00:55:40.039 align:start position:0%
have access to them we don't know how to
 
00:55:41.309 --> 00:55:41.319 align:start position:0%
reach them other than through the
 
00:55:42.589 --> 00:55:42.599 align:start position:0%
schools and again those who've
 
00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
participated in our early college it
 
00:55:46.750 --> 00:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
gives us some entree but we're really
 
00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:48.760 align:start position:0%
talking about and I think it's part of
 
00:55:51.710 --> 00:55:51.720 align:start position:0%
the Statewide need for the future if
 
00:55:54.069 --> 00:55:54.079 align:start position:0%
we're going to be successful with what
 
00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
are declining demographics an aging
 
00:55:59.390 --> 00:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
Workforce the need for succession in
 
00:56:01.789 --> 00:56:01.799 align:start position:0%
every industry that we have plus filling
 
00:56:04.029 --> 00:56:04.039 align:start position:0%
the needs of new industries that we have
 
00:56:06.349 --> 00:56:06.359 align:start position:0%
we can't waste Talent so the ability to
 
00:56:08.549 --> 00:56:08.559 align:start position:0%
find those students who have aptitude
 
00:56:10.430 --> 00:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
but don't know it have aptitude but
 
00:56:12.589 --> 00:56:12.599 align:start position:0%
don't have confidence have potential but
 
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
are worried that cost is going to be a
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
barrier we've got to find ways to reach
 
00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
them and this is what we're trying to
 
00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
find is is there a way through direct
 
00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
admission with cooperation support from
 
00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Education enabled by
 
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:32.750 --> 00:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
families represent Mooney oh did you
 
00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
followup I mean I I concur with
 
00:56:38.829 --> 00:56:38.839 align:start position:0%
everything you're saying obviously but
 
00:56:40.829 --> 00:56:40.839 align:start position:0%
the question is doing it getting it
 
00:56:44.109 --> 00:56:44.119 align:start position:0%
getting it done and this has
 
00:56:47.109 --> 00:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
been for me it's it's like a lifelong
 
00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
process and I'm at the end of that
 
00:56:52.829 --> 00:56:52.839 align:start position:0%
lifespan you know I'm believe in town
 
00:56:54.990 --> 00:56:55.000 align:start position:0%
and I don't know how much I've
 
00:56:57.710 --> 00:56:57.720 align:start position:0%
accomplished in in the 50 years I've
 
00:57:00.069 --> 00:57:00.079 align:start position:0%
been in public life I I I really wor I
 
00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
worry about it and and now I have
 
00:57:04.750 --> 00:57:04.760 align:start position:0%
grandchildren who are going through the
 
00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
process and luckily their parents are
 
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
very keen both College graab you know
 
00:57:13.309 --> 00:57:13.319 align:start position:0%
and so forth so on so they they have a
 
00:57:16.589 --> 00:57:16.599 align:start position:0%
path but I I worry about I worry about
 
00:57:19.230 --> 00:57:19.240 align:start position:0%
the kids at Manchester High School West
 
00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:21.240 align:start position:0%
where we have a 60% High School
 
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
graduation rate where we have a minority
 
00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
scho I've got eight minority schools in
 
00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:31.000 align:start position:0%
my district how do we address this
 
00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
situation these kids the treny rate is
 
00:57:37.710 --> 00:57:37.720 align:start position:0%
very high I can understand why you can't
 
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
get data they don't show up at
 
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
school it I mean these are social
 
00:57:44.069 --> 00:57:44.079 align:start position:0%
problems that are occurring in the
 
00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
environment that I've represented for a
 
00:57:48.789 --> 00:57:48.799 align:start position:0%
long period of time and these are things
 
00:57:50.549 --> 00:57:50.559 align:start position:0%
that have to be addressed for all of the
 
00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:53.720 align:start position:0%
things you just mentioned the workforce
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
I mean what are we going to do if we
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
don't if we don't
 
00:57:59.829 --> 00:57:59.839 align:start position:0%
don't get these get these things done
 
00:58:01.710 --> 00:58:01.720 align:start position:0%
the workforce is disappearing the
 
00:58:03.150 --> 00:58:03.160 align:start position:0%
workforce is
 
00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
aging the the new era is requires more
 
00:58:09.870 --> 00:58:09.880 align:start position:0%
knowledge more technology what what
 
00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
we're bringing into Manchester now
 
00:58:14.430 --> 00:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
requires a high level of
 
00:58:17.390 --> 00:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
Education all right we've got we've got
 
00:58:20.789 --> 00:58:20.799 align:start position:0%
a a birging industry this
 
00:58:25.630 --> 00:58:25.640 align:start position:0%
this you know the C and his crew I
 
00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
talked to need he needs a th000 people
 
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
he needs well educated people we gave
 
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
him money to pay bonuses to bring these
 
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
people we we'll try to do a lot of
 
00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
things but we've got to get to that base
 
00:58:43.870 --> 00:58:43.880 align:start position:0%
and and I I really worry about that I
 
00:58:47.109 --> 00:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
really thank thank you thank
 
00:58:49.589 --> 00:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
you Chancellor provent will indul me a
 
00:58:51.950 --> 00:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
little bit more I I will say we share
 
00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
that I I would tell you that I genuinely
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
believe we're making progress and we've
 
00:58:59.910 --> 00:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
made progress because you and others who
 
00:59:02.349 --> 00:59:02.359 align:start position:0%
share this interest have pushed us and
 
00:59:04.789 --> 00:59:04.799 align:start position:0%
have worked to make sure that we create
 
00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:07.160 align:start position:0%
these opportunities we've gotten better
 
00:59:10.549 --> 00:59:10.559 align:start position:0%
over time we still have work to do and
 
00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:12.760 align:start position:0%
part of this is the needs of the state
 
00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
for a Workforce part of this is equity
 
00:59:15.990 --> 00:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
we're either going to bring everybody
 
00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
with us or we're going to leave some
 
00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
folks behind and that ultimately is
 
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
going to create more challenges for the
 
00:59:25.069 --> 00:59:25.079 align:start position:0%
state if students coming out of K
 
00:59:27.789 --> 00:59:27.799 align:start position:0%
through 12 can be literate andn numerate
 
00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
and love learning that's going to be
 
00:59:31.710 --> 00:59:31.720 align:start position:0%
critical because they're going to have
 
00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
to learn throughout their lives we note
 
00:59:37.390 --> 00:59:37.400 align:start position:0%
consistently that the work life of 50 or
 
00:59:39.510 --> 00:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
60 years after high school is going to
 
00:59:41.470 --> 00:59:41.480 align:start position:0%
require students to
 
00:59:43.349 --> 00:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
continuously understand changing
 
00:59:46.029 --> 00:59:46.039 align:start position:0%
technology changing Industries in this
 
00:59:48.990 --> 00:59:49.000 align:start position:0%
state and being prepared to make the
 
00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
kinds of transitions in their lives that
 
00:59:53.069 --> 00:59:53.079 align:start position:0%
that are important to them I I've
 
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
remarked in other
 
00:59:57.150 --> 00:59:57.160 align:start position:0%
settings we offer an associate degree in
 
00:59:59.630 --> 00:59:59.640 align:start position:0%
nursing one in five of our students in
 
01:00:01.470 --> 01:00:01.480 align:start position:0%
our nursing program already holds a
 
01:00:03.309 --> 01:00:03.319 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree in some other field
 
01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
but found out later in life that what
 
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
they needed to be doing was to become a
 
01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
nurse so we need to prepare for students
 
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
over the course of a 50 or 60 year work
 
01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
life are going to make those transitions
 
01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
it starts with having students with the
 
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
fundamental building blocks of of the
 
01:00:20.270 --> 01:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
ability to learn and the passion for
 
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
Learning and what we're working on are
 
01:00:24.910 --> 01:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
putting in some of the structures that
 
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
will support that I I would say that
 
01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
when we start talking about the
 
01:00:30.990 --> 01:00:31.000 align:start position:0%
technology platforms direct admission
 
01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
we're we're starting to operationalize
 
01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:34.720 align:start position:0%
what have been aspirations we're
 
01:00:37.069 --> 01:00:37.079 align:start position:0%
starting to make more concrete how the
 
01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:39.160 align:start position:0%
work actually gets done rather than just
 
01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
good intentions and I do think it's
 
01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:42.390 align:start position:0%
good intentions and I do think it's
tangible

01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
tangible
 
01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
progress thank you I'd like to have
 
01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
represent Mooney uh you had a a point
 
01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
you wanted to mention uh then I'd like
 
01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
to get on to number three
 
01:00:54.670 --> 01:00:54.680 align:start position:0%
here thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:00:57.589 --> 01:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
both for being here I can understand the
 
01:00:59.910 --> 01:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
preference to have direct contact with
 
01:01:01.470 --> 01:01:01.480 align:start position:0%
high school students but I feel like I
 
01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
have to interject the role of the
 
01:01:06.270 --> 01:01:06.280 align:start position:0%
guidance counselor and uh hear why
 
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
that's unsatisfactory in terms of a
 
01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
preference is it because they're too
 
01:01:12.829 --> 01:01:12.839 align:start position:0%
much is expected of them these days
 
01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with all sorts of things
 
01:01:19.230 --> 01:01:19.240 align:start position:0%
other than guiding careers and college
 
01:01:22.829 --> 01:01:22.839 align:start position:0%
choices or perhaps something else thank
 
01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:26.559 align:start position:0%
you I I think representative um you
 
01:01:28.309 --> 01:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
you've hit it right on the head that
 
01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
that guidance counselors with with um
 
01:01:33.789 --> 01:01:33.799 align:start position:0%
mental health issues behavioral health
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
issues in the schools the the supports
 
01:01:38.789 --> 01:01:38.799 align:start position:0%
that students need now that maybe they
 
01:01:41.549 --> 01:01:41.559 align:start position:0%
didn't need 20 years ago our guidance
 
01:01:44.029 --> 01:01:44.039 align:start position:0%
counselors are spending a lot more time
 
01:01:47.069 --> 01:01:47.079 align:start position:0%
supporting students in that in that way
 
01:01:49.109 --> 01:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
and and I don't I'm painting a broad
 
01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
brush but then maybe they did again 20
 
01:01:55.589 --> 01:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
years ago with career advising so to put
 
01:01:57.710 --> 01:01:57.720 align:start position:0%
that another here's another thing for
 
01:01:59.670 --> 01:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
you to do guidance counselors make sure
 
01:02:03.069 --> 01:02:03.079 align:start position:0%
everybody gets one of these cards um I I
 
01:02:05.549 --> 01:02:05.559 align:start position:0%
think is well and I will I will also say
 
01:02:05.559 --> 01:02:06.430 align:start position:0%
think is well and I will I will also say
from

01:02:06.430 --> 01:02:06.440 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:02:09.269 --> 01:02:09.279 align:start position:0%
a uh maybe marketing is not the right
 
01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:13.240 align:start position:0%
term but to get communication from the
 
01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
community college system or the
 
01:02:17.269 --> 01:02:17.279 align:start position:0%
university system
 
01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:19.240 align:start position:0%
congratulations you're accepted and
 
01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
there are so many options for you in our
 
01:02:25.269 --> 01:02:25.279 align:start position:0%
state to further your education you know
 
01:02:27.309 --> 01:02:27.319 align:start position:0%
call here or text here for more
 
01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
information is is you know maybe
 
01:02:31.549 --> 01:02:31.559 align:start position:0%
beneficial for those students and put a
 
01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
little wind in their
 
01:02:35.630 --> 01:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
sales I concur with you on that direct
 
01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:37.720 align:start position:0%
communication to that family to that
 
01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
student to the parents
 
01:02:42.670 --> 01:02:42.680 align:start position:0%
congratulations you've accomplish that
 
01:02:44.589 --> 01:02:44.599 align:start position:0%
rather than having to go through that
 
01:02:47.269 --> 01:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
third party I think there's really a
 
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
benefit to what we're trying to address
 
01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
here and I think this is something the
 
01:02:53.230 --> 01:02:53.240 align:start position:0%
legislature needs to look at in terms of
 
01:02:56.309 --> 01:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
you're having access to that data that
 
01:02:58.710 --> 01:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
you need in order to facilitate this
 
01:03:01.829 --> 01:03:01.839 align:start position:0%
activity of Direct Communications with
 
01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:04.559 align:start position:0%
the student and maybe we need to work
 
01:03:06.510 --> 01:03:06.520 align:start position:0%
with you Steve on that one yeah I have
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
reached out to director Davis um
 
01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
regarding the data piece so more to come
 
01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
on that and I just want also
 
01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative Moody brought up a great
 
01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
point because we talked about this
 
01:03:16.990 --> 01:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
during the task force meeting that
 
01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
guidance counselors what we all grew up
 
01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
with don't exist anymore they're school
 
01:03:24.029 --> 01:03:24.039 align:start position:0%
counselors first of all uh a national
 
01:03:25.829 --> 01:03:25.839 align:start position:0%
study was just completed in the last
 
01:03:27.630 --> 01:03:27.640 align:start position:0%
several months that showed that on
 
01:03:29.829 --> 01:03:29.839 align:start position:0%
average a school counselor or guidance
 
01:03:32.109 --> 01:03:32.119 align:start position:0%
counselor depending on the state spends
 
01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
in excess of 80% of their time on mental
 
01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:36.109 align:start position:0%
in excess of 80% of their time on mental
health

01:03:36.109 --> 01:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
health
 
01:03:39.589 --> 01:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
issues which conversely means 20% or
 
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
less on guidance and and postsecondary
 
01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:45.880 align:start position:0%
Futures so I think and there's been a
 
01:03:47.549 --> 01:03:47.559 align:start position:0%
movement at the national level one of my
 
01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:49.480 align:start position:0%
programs representing money is uh
 
01:03:53.269 --> 01:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
licensing K12 Educators including school
 
01:03:54.549 --> 01:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
counselors and there's been a real
 
01:03:56.230 --> 01:03:56.240 align:start position:0%
movement at the national level
 
01:03:58.430 --> 01:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
over the last few decades to reposition
 
01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:00.520 align:start position:0%
counselors more in the mental health
 
01:04:02.109 --> 01:04:02.119 align:start position:0%
side than in the guidance so the
 
01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
national standards have even shifted and
 
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
I think that's in recognition of what's
 
01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:09.400 align:start position:0%
happening in the schools so uh and
 
01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
during our task force meetings we um
 
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
took some some information from granted
 
01:04:15.029 --> 01:04:15.039 align:start position:0%
Advance because they do a lot of
 
01:04:17.950 --> 01:04:17.960 align:start position:0%
Outreach in the schools and
 
01:04:20.430 --> 01:04:20.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately relying on another entity
 
01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:22.559 align:start position:0%
to come in and do that counseling
 
01:04:24.990 --> 01:04:25.000 align:start position:0%
because the schools can't get can't get
 
01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
to it um so we we brought them in and
 
01:04:29.069 --> 01:04:29.079 align:start position:0%
they were uh quite helpful with some of
 
01:04:29.079 --> 01:04:29.829 align:start position:0%
they were uh quite helpful with some of
their

01:04:29.829 --> 01:04:29.839 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
information so thank
 
01:04:36.670 --> 01:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
you just real quick Mr chair thanks so
 
01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
um I recall a few years ago this
 
01:04:43.870 --> 01:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
committee um worked on a bill and I
 
01:04:46.309 --> 01:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
don't recall the bill number but uh but
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
I think it modified it amended RSA
 
01:04:57.390 --> 01:04:57.400 align:start position:0%
193c colon 12 and it was direct to um to
 
01:04:59.950 --> 01:04:59.960 align:start position:0%
the department and reading from the the
 
01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:01.640 align:start position:0%
statute the department May collect and
 
01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
the district shall provide student
 
01:05:05.829 --> 01:05:05.839 align:start position:0%
address information uh from the
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
individual school districts and uh and
 
01:05:10.269 --> 01:05:10.279 align:start position:0%
it and it does say solely for the
 
01:05:12.269 --> 01:05:12.279 align:start position:0%
purpose of effectuating the distribution
 
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
of assessment results and comparative
 
01:05:17.029 --> 01:05:17.039 align:start position:0%
data is provided in this section but it
 
01:05:18.789 --> 01:05:18.799 align:start position:0%
goes on to say the report shall be
 
01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:20.559 align:start position:0%
provided to parents in an informative
 
01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
and instructional manner to help
 
01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
children meet challenging State academic
 
01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
standards and advanced student learning
 
01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:29.720 align:start position:0%
and I was wondering how is the
 
01:05:33.150 --> 01:05:33.160 align:start position:0%
department um I guess
 
01:05:37.069 --> 01:05:37.079 align:start position:0%
um utilizing this um this relatively new
 
01:05:40.109 --> 01:05:40.119 align:start position:0%
section of law that came into effect on
 
01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
um 20 in
 
01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
2021 that that was put I remember doing
 
01:05:48.510 --> 01:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
that and it was for the purpose of
 
01:05:53.789 --> 01:05:53.799 align:start position:0%
having the results of the SAT by the uh
 
01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
which the College Board had to direct
 
01:05:59.589 --> 01:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
mail that to the address of the student
 
01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
right rather than to the school to
 
01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:05.640 align:start position:0%
facilitate timeliness um my my question
 
01:06:07.470 --> 01:06:07.480 align:start position:0%
would be why can't we do the same thing
 
01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
for the Department to you know get this
 
01:06:13.950 --> 01:06:13.960 align:start position:0%
information so they can be sending that
 
01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
congratulations hello you now have
 
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
earned this um I think it we go along
 
01:06:21.470 --> 01:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
way let's go on to number three here and
 
01:06:22.829 --> 01:06:22.839 align:start position:0%
we'll get back to this you know with
 
01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:25.640 align:start position:0%
some of our concluding remarks but
 
01:06:28.069 --> 01:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
number three deals with the basically
 
01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:36.109 --> 01:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
credentials it in it includes those as
 
01:06:38.670 --> 01:06:38.680 align:start position:0%
well as traditional courses we have a
 
01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
platform that we'll be implementing that
 
01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
allows us to capture all of that and
 
01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
again for working adults in particular
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
those with military service where the
 
01:06:48.510 --> 01:06:48.520 align:start position:0%
government has made significant
 
01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
investments in their Education and
 
01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
Training the opportunity to incorporate
 
01:06:55.109 --> 01:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
that into the structure of a degree or
 
01:06:59.109 --> 01:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
certific program is time sensible cost
 
01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
effective and again for those those
 
01:07:03.390 --> 01:07:03.400 align:start position:0%
adult Learners who did not necessarily
 
01:07:05.309 --> 01:07:05.319 align:start position:0%
meet great success in high school and
 
01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
are not confident of their potential to
 
01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
realize that that is in fact success
 
01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
with college level learning we we think
 
01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
it's an encouraging uh way of helping
 
01:07:17.630 --> 01:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
students recognize that I don't have a
 
01:07:19.829 --> 01:07:19.839 align:start position:0%
long road in front of me to complete a
 
01:07:21.269 --> 01:07:21.279 align:start position:0%
degree in fact I've already got the
 
01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
foundation for a degree or certificate
 
01:07:25.230 --> 01:07:25.240 align:start position:0%
based on what I've already accomplished
 
01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
and by helping students see those
 
01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
shorter paths those clearer paths that
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
are built on a foundation of their own
 
01:07:33.190 --> 01:07:33.200 align:start position:0%
success we think that that helps bring
 
01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
more people into the workforce more
 
01:07:36.990 --> 01:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
people into opportunity so in your
 
01:07:39.269 --> 01:07:39.279 align:start position:0%
report here you talk about the Nashville
 
01:07:43.829 --> 01:07:43.839 align:start position:0%
Community College uh having using tests
 
01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
to facilitate this how's that program
 
01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
working there so that that's still in
 
01:07:51.950 --> 01:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
the pilot stage U they're working with
 
01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
college for professional studies at unh
 
01:07:57.470 --> 01:07:57.480 align:start position:0%
was the the nucleus the old granted
 
01:08:00.549 --> 01:08:00.559 align:start position:0%
State College and I've recently met with
 
01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
Dean Dell and uh I think uh one two of
 
01:08:08.349 --> 01:08:08.359 align:start position:0%
his colleagues who are instrumental in
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
that partnership with nashille about
 
01:08:12.309 --> 01:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
extending that across all seven of our
 
01:08:14.190 --> 01:08:14.200 align:start position:0%
colleges so although still in the pilot
 
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
stage as we begin to implement we think
 
01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
we can grow that relatively
 
01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:21.640 align:start position:0%
quickly any other questions on that's
 
01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
the University of Maryland when I was in
 
01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
the service in the 70s was giving credit
 
01:08:29.550 --> 01:08:29.560 align:start position:0%
for things I had taken biological you
 
01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
know studies which I had done with the
 
01:08:33.269 --> 01:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
chemical core and others I was getting
 
01:08:35.789 --> 01:08:35.799 align:start position:0%
credit for that stuff even for physical
 
01:08:38.229 --> 01:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
education um so there's nothing new
 
01:08:38.239 --> 01:08:39.349 align:start position:0%
education um so there's nothing new
about

01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:08:42.030 --> 01:08:42.040 align:start position:0%
this there's nothing new about this part
 
01:08:45.669 --> 01:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
of it is our Collective recognition that
 
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
the learning outcomes that can be
 
01:08:49.829 --> 01:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
documented actually align in many cases
 
01:08:51.709 --> 01:08:51.719 align:start position:0%
with curriculum that we offer if there's
 
01:08:54.390 --> 01:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
a a way for us to capture that
 
01:08:56.349 --> 01:08:56.359 align:start position:0%
information document it appropriately
 
01:08:58.990 --> 01:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
and incorporate it into degrees I I
 
01:09:01.269 --> 01:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
cited CPS former of Granton State
 
01:09:04.269 --> 01:09:04.279 align:start position:0%
College under their accreditation with
 
01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
New England Commission on higher
 
01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
education up to 60 credits toward a
 
01:09:09.789 --> 01:09:09.799 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree could come from pla
 
01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:11.759 align:start position:0%
this workplace based or experiential
 
01:09:13.789 --> 01:09:13.799 align:start position:0%
learning that's appropriately documented
 
01:09:15.709 --> 01:09:15.719 align:start position:0%
and although I don't know that all of
 
01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
our institutions will move to that level
 
01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
of of uh acceptance of pla I I think we
 
01:09:25.030 --> 01:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
can make significant progress in helping
 
01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
students find onramps into our programs
 
01:09:30.189 --> 01:09:30.199 align:start position:0%
particularly from some of our own
 
01:09:32.829 --> 01:09:32.839 align:start position:0%
certificate programs our boot camps you
 
01:09:35.070 --> 01:09:35.080 align:start position:0%
may be familiar with a microelectronics
 
01:09:37.070 --> 01:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
boot camp program that Nashville has
 
01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:39.319 align:start position:0%
worked on in partnership with BAE
 
01:09:43.390 --> 01:09:43.400 align:start position:0%
systems since 2017 over 300 graduates
 
01:09:46.269 --> 01:09:46.279 align:start position:0%
foundational learning that can flow into
 
01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
technology or management degrees that
 
01:09:51.309 --> 01:09:51.319 align:start position:0%
allow for career progression and and
 
01:09:54.910 --> 01:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
career longevity uh so again not just
 
01:09:56.790 --> 01:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
things people bring from the outside but
 
01:09:59.229 --> 01:09:59.239 align:start position:0%
some of our own uh short-term training
 
01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
programs that give people more immediate
 
01:10:04.510 --> 01:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
access to skills that are in demand in
 
01:10:06.030 --> 01:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
the workforce but then serve as the
 
01:10:09.630 --> 01:10:09.640 align:start position:0%
foundation for growth over time thank
 
01:10:12.870 --> 01:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
you anything else in item number three
 
01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
here okay number four is one that I've
 
01:10:18.750 --> 01:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
had some discussions with you uh last
 
01:10:21.709 --> 01:10:21.719 align:start position:0%
week even on uh Early College dual
 
01:10:24.270 --> 01:10:24.280 align:start position:0%
enrollment where are we going with this
 
01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
this a program for everybody that we've
 
01:10:28.709 --> 01:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
been allocating dollars yeah
 
01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
appropriating what 3 million two two two
 
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
and a half two and a half I know the
 
01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
request was for three and a quarter but
 
01:10:40.669 --> 01:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
um so for the purpose of early college
 
01:10:43.470 --> 01:10:43.480 align:start position:0%
and and um a lot of good things are
 
01:10:46.110 --> 01:10:46.120 align:start position:0%
happening there you know and can you
 
01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
just give us an overview of this uh I
 
01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
think that one of the things we wanted
 
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
to do is capture more students that are
 
01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
leaving our state and going College
 
01:10:59.149 --> 01:10:59.159 align:start position:0%
elsewhere I see this as a key to
 
01:11:02.669 --> 01:11:02.679 align:start position:0%
capturing them early on when they're in
 
01:11:07.950 --> 01:11:07.960 align:start position:0%
high school um I I do too sir we we have
 
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
data we looked at students who
 
01:11:11.310 --> 01:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
participated in our Early College
 
01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
Programs between 2016 and 2022 and the
 
01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
reason we stopped at that point was just
 
01:11:18.189 --> 01:11:18.199 align:start position:0%
to be able to see what happened for the
 
01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
more recent High School completers in
 
01:11:23.229 --> 01:11:23.239 align:start position:0%
the years that followed of that group
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
83% went on to post secondary education
 
01:11:29.229 --> 01:11:29.239 align:start position:0%
out of that roughly 35,000 students we
 
01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
had over 28,000 who went to college of
 
01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:34.950 align:start position:0%
had over 28,000 who went to college of
that

01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
group about 80% went to four-year
 
01:11:39.950 --> 01:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
institutions rather than 2-year
 
01:11:44.229 --> 01:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
institutions and 55% left the state to
 
01:11:47.669 --> 01:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
do that about 11,000 stayed in New
 
01:11:49.950 --> 01:11:49.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire again started with 35,000
 
01:11:52.110 --> 01:11:52.120 align:start position:0%
students about 28,000 went to
 
01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
postsecondary education 11,000 went went
 
01:11:57.070 --> 01:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
to fouryear institutions in New
 
01:11:59.510 --> 01:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and of that group 6,600 ended
 
01:12:01.910 --> 01:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
up in the University system during that
 
01:12:04.629 --> 01:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
period of time about 6,000 of those
 
01:12:06.189 --> 01:12:06.199 align:start position:0%
students ended up with a community
 
01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
college system what what that tells us
 
01:12:10.350 --> 01:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
is that students who are currently
 
01:12:12.590 --> 01:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
participating in early college courses
 
01:12:15.950 --> 01:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
Early College opportunities are are
 
01:12:18.149 --> 01:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
probably already the students who know
 
01:12:19.870 --> 01:12:19.880 align:start position:0%
and anticipate that they're going to
 
01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
college and based on their preference
 
01:12:24.149 --> 01:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
for fouryear institutions their
 
01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
preference for out of State we know that
 
01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
this is a group of students who may
 
01:12:30.270 --> 01:12:30.280 align:start position:0%
already have certain advantages if we're
 
01:12:34.270 --> 01:12:34.280 align:start position:0%
going to expand opportunity and also do
 
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
more to keep these students in New
 
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire what we need to be able to do
 
01:12:40.110 --> 01:12:40.120 align:start position:0%
is build capacity not just make this
 
01:12:42.430 --> 01:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
available to top tiers of students but
 
01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
make this Avail to a wider group of
 
01:12:46.990 --> 01:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
students who have potential but may not
 
01:12:51.070 --> 01:12:51.080 align:start position:0%
have quite as much access to these these
 
01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
high uh more challenging opportunities
 
01:12:57.229 --> 01:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:59.110 --> 01:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
schools without getting into the
 
01:13:01.470 --> 01:13:01.480 align:start position:0%
mechanics of how we would propose to do
 
01:13:05.229 --> 01:13:05.239 align:start position:0%
that what I would tell you is that if we
 
01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
can make this work with House Bill 1530
 
01:13:11.149 --> 01:13:11.159 align:start position:0%
tie these to the courses that are part
 
01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
of the pathways that help students find
 
01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
their way from the community college
 
01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
system to the university system we can
 
01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
increase the likelihood that these
 
01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
students when they're ready to enroll in
 
01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
college will stay in state will stay if
 
01:13:25.870 --> 01:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
not the community college system and the
 
01:13:27.390 --> 01:13:27.400 align:start position:0%
university system because they've
 
01:13:29.590 --> 01:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
already got a foundation and it's not
 
01:13:31.310 --> 01:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
just the courses but if we use the
 
01:13:32.750 --> 01:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity while these students are
 
01:13:34.629 --> 01:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
taking these courses to introduce them
 
01:13:36.990 --> 01:13:37.000 align:start position:0%
to our campuses ours and the University
 
01:13:39.470 --> 01:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
Systems so that the students recognize
 
01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
the opportunities connect with our
 
01:13:43.550 --> 01:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
faculty see our facilities I think we
 
01:13:45.629 --> 01:13:45.639 align:start position:0%
can begin to bend this curve that has
 
01:13:48.189 --> 01:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
had so many students leaving the state
 
01:13:49.669 --> 01:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
the other piece that's just the most
 
01:13:52.390 --> 01:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
fundamental part of this is the cost
 
01:13:55.390 --> 01:13:55.400 align:start position:0%
piece of this the state's investment
 
01:13:58.030 --> 01:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
about $2.5 million in each year of the
 
01:13:58.040 --> 01:13:59.390 align:start position:0%
about $2.5 million in each year of the
current

01:13:59.390 --> 01:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
bium the return on value if the students
 
01:14:05.229 --> 01:14:05.239 align:start position:0%
enrolled to let to say this differently
 
01:14:08.189 --> 01:14:08.199 align:start position:0%
students took over 54,000 credits
 
01:14:11.629 --> 01:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
through Early College this past year at
 
01:14:13.669 --> 01:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
our current rate of
 
01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
$215 per credit plus a a registration
 
01:14:20.470 --> 01:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
fee of $25 per credit those students at
 
01:14:23.070 --> 01:14:23.080 align:start position:0%
our rate saved over $10 million they and
 
01:14:24.390 --> 01:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
their families if they went to the
 
01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
university syst on a per credit basis
 
01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
rather than paying for a semester you're
 
01:14:32.310 --> 01:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
you're almost talking double that amount
 
01:14:34.629 --> 01:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
so the the savings to families is
 
01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
measurable but the problem and Senator
 
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
delandro touched on this with his
 
01:14:41.149 --> 01:14:41.159 align:start position:0%
grandson University of Utah nine credits
 
01:14:43.149 --> 01:14:43.159 align:start position:0%
may not materialize to much savings
 
01:14:44.629 --> 01:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
because instead of taking this course
 
01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
you take that course but you still have
 
01:14:48.709 --> 01:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
four years of college to complete but if
 
01:14:51.390 --> 01:14:51.400 align:start position:0%
we can help students complete a semester
 
01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:53.800 align:start position:0%
or a year of college level learning
 
01:14:56.709 --> 01:14:56.719 align:start position:0%
without the cost associated with it not
 
01:14:58.149 --> 01:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
only are we saving them a year of
 
01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
tuition and perhaps room and board at a
 
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
residential campus but we're giving them
 
01:15:03.950 --> 01:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
the opportunity if they're motivated
 
01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
either to pursue a master's degree or or
 
01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
to get into the workforce a year earlier
 
01:15:11.149 --> 01:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
now for our students who tend to be
 
01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
part-time students it's a little bit
 
01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
more difficult to to say oh it's going
 
01:15:17.350 --> 01:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
to save them a year but in it maybe more
 
01:15:18.669 --> 01:15:18.679 align:start position:0%
importantly for our students who are
 
01:15:20.629 --> 01:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
often taking one or two courses at a
 
01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:23.320 align:start position:0%
time the more Foundation we can give
 
01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
them while they're still in high school
 
01:15:26.669 --> 01:15:26.679 align:start position:0%
when can take these opportunities
 
01:15:29.870 --> 01:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps in larger strides we're saving
 
01:15:32.270 --> 01:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
them significant time on the other end
 
01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
and again if we tie these courses not
 
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
just to our degree programs but
 
01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
incorporate industry recognized
 
01:15:40.189 --> 01:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
credentials help them be better prepared
 
01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
to hit the workforce in in demand with
 
01:15:46.030 --> 01:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
skills that employers value we we give
 
01:15:47.950 --> 01:15:47.960 align:start position:0%
them a lot of advantages that again
 
01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
strengthen the the workforce by bringing
 
01:15:53.149 --> 01:15:53.159 align:start position:0%
talent and potential to the four not
 
01:15:59.149 --> 01:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:01.550 --> 01:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
any questions on that
 
01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:03.709 align:start position:0%
any questions on that
one

01:16:03.709 --> 01:16:03.719 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:16:07.070 --> 01:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
um we have this program available now to
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
students that are in grades 10 11 and
 
01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
12 and we allocated 2.5 million per year
 
01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:21.310 --> 01:16:21.320 align:start position:0%
bium due to the level of
 
01:16:24.430 --> 01:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
funding is it possible for a student to
 
01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
take the the maximum of four courses or
 
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
how's that working out now in terms of
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
the student who's really challenging
 
01:16:36.750 --> 01:16:36.760 align:start position:0%
this thing and would like to do you know
 
01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
take more than is there a limit have we
 
01:16:42.910 --> 01:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
C it or something on a practical level
 
01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:45.400 align:start position:0%
we've said to students we can offer two
 
01:16:47.709 --> 01:16:47.719 align:start position:0%
courses with this scholarship because
 
01:16:49.830 --> 01:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
otherwise we run the risk of exhausting
 
01:16:52.149 --> 01:16:52.159 align:start position:0%
the funds without equitably allocating
 
01:16:54.229 --> 01:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for students and
 
01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
families who have their own resources
 
01:16:58.709 --> 01:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
and want to uh increment that they
 
01:17:01.110 --> 01:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
certainly can do that but we don't
 
01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
currently have adequate funding to be
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
able to make this available for up to
 
01:17:09.709 --> 01:17:09.719 align:start position:0%
four courses as as written in statute a
 
01:17:12.709 --> 01:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
a as we've discussed I I do think that
 
01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
there are different models that we could
 
01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
look at for how we could make this more
 
01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
widely available that would
 
01:17:22.189 --> 01:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
be cost effective for the state sensible
 
01:17:25.990 --> 01:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
for us more importantly and value for
 
01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
students and families uh but again did
 
01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
not want to necessarily go into the to
 
01:17:34.390 --> 01:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
the Weeds on that because there's a lot
 
01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
of a lot of detail that could become
 
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
confusing without some handouts and some
 
01:17:42.189 --> 01:17:42.199 align:start position:0%
some charts and graphs just to make it
 
01:17:46.270 --> 01:17:46.280 align:start position:0%
that much more confusing so I I I I I
 
01:17:48.910 --> 01:17:48.920 align:start position:0%
won't go down the weeds either but uh in
 
01:17:51.510 --> 01:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
terms of a student now that's being
 
01:17:53.709 --> 01:17:53.719 align:start position:0%
restricted to two
 
01:17:57.629 --> 01:17:57.639 align:start position:0%
courses uh uh and statute says you can
 
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
take up the four and Beyond four it's on
 
01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
you the student um now if the student
 
01:18:07.709 --> 01:18:07.719 align:start position:0%
once takes three or four is that on the
 
01:18:10.149 --> 01:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
student or according to statute it
 
01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be how are you getting around
 
01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
this we we we've explained that what we
 
01:18:19.709 --> 01:18:19.719 align:start position:0%
have our resources for two and I I would
 
01:18:22.430 --> 01:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
defer to director Doran who's with me
 
01:18:25.070 --> 01:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
today if we have examples where any body
 
01:18:26.790 --> 01:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
has pushed back I think generally
 
01:18:28.709 --> 01:18:28.719 align:start position:0%
speaking people have appreciated that
 
01:18:30.550 --> 01:18:30.560 align:start position:0%
the state has made an investment that
 
01:18:33.550 --> 01:18:33.560 align:start position:0%
it's it's finite and and that we are
 
01:18:35.950 --> 01:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
trying to be evenhanded in in allocating
 
01:18:39.870 --> 01:18:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:42.510 --> 01:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
but no no one's pushed back on that and
 
01:18:44.590 --> 01:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
I think when we interpreted the language
 
01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
we looked at it as students could take
 
01:18:49.550 --> 01:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
up to four if that funding was available
 
01:18:52.870 --> 01:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
but it's not I mean with only not only
 
01:18:55.350 --> 01:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
but 2.5 were very very appreciative that
 
01:18:57.270 --> 01:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't allow us to offer four
 
01:18:59.149 --> 01:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
student four courses per student it only
 
01:19:01.189 --> 01:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
allows us to offer
 
01:19:04.510 --> 01:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
two yeah I can remember that
 
01:19:06.590 --> 01:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
discussion any other further questions
 
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
on the running Start program or dual
 
01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
concurrent sure yeah so um if I was to
 
01:19:18.229 --> 01:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
um if I was a family looking for
 
01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
opportunities for um uh for my sophomore
 
01:19:24.709 --> 01:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
junior senior in uh in high school
 
01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
school and U and and uh just to find out
 
01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
you know what opportunities were there
 
01:19:34.709 --> 01:19:34.719 align:start position:0%
particular particularly in programs like
 
01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
running start that I can take um you
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
know as a high school student and uh and
 
01:19:43.229 --> 01:19:43.239 align:start position:0%
get college credit where would I um
 
01:19:44.990 --> 01:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
where would where would a where would a
 
01:19:49.709 --> 01:19:49.719 align:start position:0%
parent or a student go to find that
 
01:19:51.550 --> 01:19:51.560 align:start position:0%
information wouldn't you go to the
 
01:19:52.910 --> 01:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
counselor in your
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:00.149 align:start position:0%
 
which

01:20:00.149 --> 01:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:20:00.159 --> 01:20:01.709 align:start position:0%
which
website

01:20:01.709 --> 01:20:01.719 align:start position:0%
website
 
01:20:04.750 --> 01:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
okay school programs and parent can
 
01:20:07.070 --> 01:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
click right on that see all the Early
 
01:20:09.910 --> 01:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
College we changed the the terminology
 
01:20:12.270 --> 01:20:12.280 align:start position:0%
of running right to Early College all
 
01:20:14.470 --> 01:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
under the Early College umbrella we have
 
01:20:16.189 --> 01:20:16.199 align:start position:0%
Early College in high school early
 
01:20:19.070 --> 01:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
college online and early college at your
 
01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
campus or on campus so student those
 
01:20:24.229 --> 01:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
three programs are very clearly defined
 
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
and our website but also our early
 
01:20:28.830 --> 01:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
college coordinators visit all the high
 
01:20:30.350 --> 01:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
schools right now they're out there
 
01:20:32.669 --> 01:20:32.679 align:start position:0%
canvasing all the high schools in the
 
01:20:34.590 --> 01:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
courses where we offer in high schools
 
01:20:36.629 --> 01:20:36.639 align:start position:0%
where we offer these courses and they're
 
01:20:38.310 --> 01:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
handing out flyers and giving all the
 
01:20:40.110 --> 01:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
information hopefully it makes it home
 
01:20:43.149 --> 01:20:43.159 align:start position:0%
to parents um not always so that's why
 
01:20:45.189 --> 01:20:45.199 align:start position:0%
we try to have information on our
 
01:20:47.470 --> 01:20:47.480 align:start position:0%
website and also looking at some other
 
01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
marketing strategies to get out to
 
01:20:52.870 --> 01:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
parents uh Beth I have a question for
 
01:20:55.790 --> 01:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
you just ear
 
01:20:59.110 --> 01:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
College available through VX and is the
 
01:21:01.270 --> 01:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
funding for that come through VX or
 
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
through the $2.5 million appropriated to
 
01:21:06.270 --> 01:21:06.280 align:start position:0%
the community college system great
 
01:21:08.870 --> 01:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
question we have a partnership with VX
 
01:21:11.629 --> 01:21:11.639 align:start position:0%
for our Early College online program
 
01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
because that program is taught by our
 
01:21:15.390 --> 01:21:15.400 align:start position:0%
own faculty so the cost is higher than
 
01:21:17.070 --> 01:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
our early college in the high school we
 
01:21:18.229 --> 01:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
obviously don't pay the high school
 
01:21:20.229 --> 01:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
teachers for the early college and high
 
01:21:22.030 --> 01:21:22.040 align:start position:0%
school program so the Early College
 
01:21:24.149 --> 01:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
online program has a higher cost much
 
01:21:26.709 --> 01:21:26.719 align:start position:0%
like our Early College on campus program
 
01:21:29.709 --> 01:21:29.719 align:start position:0%
does so we receive $150 from the
 
01:21:32.030 --> 01:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
scholarship for Early College online we
 
01:21:35.629 --> 01:21:35.639 align:start position:0%
also receive $175 from daac for every
 
01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
enrollment so that total revenue for us
 
01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:39.910 align:start position:0%
enrollment so that total revenue for us
is

01:21:39.910 --> 01:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:21:43.709 --> 01:21:43.719 align:start position:0%
$325 for a Early College online course
 
01:21:45.550 --> 01:21:45.560 align:start position:0%
versus an early college on campus is
 
01:21:50.430 --> 01:21:50.440 align:start position:0%
about $350 or so thank you yeah yeah
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
thank thanks Mr shair I'm just um I'm
 
01:21:56.990 --> 01:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
I'm surprised that the uh that the New
 
01:21:58.590 --> 01:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Education
 
01:22:02.030 --> 01:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
website doesn't um doesn't provide any
 
01:22:04.350 --> 01:22:04.360 align:start position:0%
links to this information as it does
 
01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
provide links um to the education
 
01:22:09.189 --> 01:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
Freedom account program with a direct
 
01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
link to the children's scholarship fund
 
01:22:13.870 --> 01:22:13.880 align:start position:0%
a direct link to tutor.com information
 
01:22:15.790 --> 01:22:15.800 align:start position:0%
on the learn everywhere program these
 
01:22:19.350 --> 01:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
are in the very very first um items on
 
01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:21.880 align:start position:0%
the homepage of the New Hampshire
 
01:22:24.510 --> 01:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Education links to Lexia
 
01:22:26.629 --> 01:22:26.639 align:start position:0%
letters which I think um never ever
 
01:22:31.110 --> 01:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
passed this committee um links to um uh
 
01:22:33.189 --> 01:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
College and Career Readiness that does
 
01:22:36.070 --> 01:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
not contain the information that you
 
01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
were just talking about Beth um and then
 
01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
um and then links to um to I think oped
 
01:22:46.990 --> 01:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
pieces written by the commissioner that
 
01:22:49.110 --> 01:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh that are titled like thank God
 
01:22:50.830 --> 01:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
someone is looking out for our children
 
01:22:53.149 --> 01:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
and we have not served our children well
 
01:22:55.990 --> 01:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
an education choice save Public Schools
 
01:22:58.750 --> 01:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
I'm really surprised that our New
 
01:23:01.149 --> 01:23:01.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire education department doesn't
 
01:23:04.669 --> 01:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
provide links that actually would serve
 
01:23:07.910 --> 01:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
our students and in particular provide
 
01:23:09.950 --> 01:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
them with information about early
 
01:23:14.430 --> 01:23:14.440 align:start position:0%
college and um and um leverage the um
 
01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:15.310 align:start position:0%
college and um and um leverage the um
the

01:23:15.310 --> 01:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:23:19.310 --> 01:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
outstanding um um State schools both
 
01:23:21.790 --> 01:23:21.800 align:start position:0%
Community College and the university
 
01:23:25.390 --> 01:23:25.400 align:start position:0%
system so that's just a comment
 
01:23:26.870 --> 01:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chair it could be also a
 
01:23:28.430 --> 01:23:28.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation that we put forward from
 
01:23:31.110 --> 01:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
the committee I'd love to turn yeah
 
01:23:35.709 --> 01:23:35.719 align:start position:0%
yeah okay um any any others on the Early
 
01:23:37.510 --> 01:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
College side things because we still
 
01:23:39.629 --> 01:23:39.639 align:start position:0%
have a couple areas here which kind of
 
01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
intriguing the next one coming up is
 
01:23:44.830 --> 01:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
number five uh and that's to the
 
01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
university system and we're talking now
 
01:23:49.990 --> 01:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
of what's going on at Plymouth State
 
01:23:51.790 --> 01:23:51.800 align:start position:0%
University in terms of their application
 
01:23:53.350 --> 01:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
for the three-year bachelor's degree you
 
01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
want to take this one y
 
01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:04.229 --> 01:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
State this month late last month no
 
01:24:07.070 --> 01:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
we're in October sorry in September um
 
01:24:08.709 --> 01:24:08.719 align:start position:0%
submitted to Nei which is the New
 
01:24:11.870 --> 01:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
England accrediting body um proposals
 
01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
for five programs for um bachelor's
 
01:24:19.950 --> 01:24:19.960 align:start position:0%
degrees at less than 120 credits so uh
 
01:24:24.390 --> 01:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
you could complete a 96 credit degree in
 
01:24:26.910 --> 01:24:26.920 align:start position:0%
in three years and there are five
 
01:24:31.350 --> 01:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
programs criminal justice robotics cyber
 
01:24:33.229 --> 01:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
security I'm not going to remember the
 
01:24:36.189 --> 01:24:36.199 align:start position:0%
other two you have uh police studies
 
01:24:38.790 --> 01:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
business administration applied robotics
 
01:24:41.470 --> 01:24:41.480 align:start position:0%
cyber security and Outdoor Adventure
 
01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
leadership correct so believe Nei met
 
01:24:48.510 --> 01:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
last week and we're waiting for final
 
01:24:51.629 --> 01:24:51.639 align:start position:0%
word on whether or not the the programs
 
01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
have been approved you I will have the
 
01:24:55.830 --> 01:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
answer for you by the November
 
01:25:00.430 --> 01:25:00.440 align:start position:0%
1st report so th that's done under an
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
Innovations um initiative through nii
 
01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
there are still a lot of questions that
 
01:25:08.830 --> 01:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
uh nii Commissioners are asking and
 
01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
answering relative to you know currently
 
01:25:14.109 --> 01:25:14.119 align:start position:0%
if you once you receive a bachelor's
 
01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
degree you're no longer palale eligible
 
01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
so if a
 
01:25:22.470 --> 01:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
student received um a bachelor's degree
 
01:25:24.990 --> 01:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
for less than 120 credits
 
01:25:27.470 --> 01:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
and then wanted to continue on to a 120
 
01:25:29.669 --> 01:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
credit bachelor degree right now under
 
01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
Federal pel rules that student would not
 
01:25:35.070 --> 01:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
be eligible to get a fourth year
 
01:25:36.550 --> 01:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
bachelor degree if that makes sense so
 
01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
there are lots of questions but other
 
01:25:40.270 --> 01:25:40.280 align:start position:0%
programs I think Marat College may have
 
01:25:42.870 --> 01:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
had a a program or two that was approved
 
01:25:45.390 --> 01:25:45.400 align:start position:0%
earlier so we're moving in this
 
01:25:49.270 --> 01:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
direction um and and nii has been
 
01:25:51.109 --> 01:25:51.119 align:start position:0%
supportive to
 
01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
date now at the trustee meeting I had
 
01:25:56.310 --> 01:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
attended was it last week or the week
 
01:25:58.229 --> 01:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
before I came there everything's couple
 
01:26:01.270 --> 01:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
weeks ago couple weeks ago there is
 
01:26:04.350 --> 01:26:04.360 align:start position:0%
question about Nei and I know that the
 
01:26:07.270 --> 01:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
president of keing state is on that
 
01:26:13.830 --> 01:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
board um but is the staff at Plymouth
 
01:26:17.550 --> 01:26:17.560 align:start position:0%
State according to the president of PSU
 
01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
was very involved in making these
 
01:26:23.229 --> 01:26:23.239 align:start position:0%
recommendations in fact supported by the
 
01:26:25.790 --> 01:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
folks that professional professors and
 
01:26:30.709 --> 01:26:30.719 align:start position:0%
all at Plymouth State then why do we if
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
they see a program that they like to why
 
01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
then does it have to be approved by a
 
01:26:37.550 --> 01:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
time delay when it was the application
 
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
was sent in in what August
 
01:26:42.990 --> 01:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
15th and here we are now going into
 
01:26:46.109 --> 01:26:46.119 align:start position:0%
October and November before Nei gets
 
01:26:49.310 --> 01:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
around saying that's good idea well
 
01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
again the um I'm not here to defend Nei
 
01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
but the the me meeting that was held
 
01:26:58.030 --> 01:26:58.040 align:start position:0%
last week the ne's meeting was probably
 
01:27:01.109 --> 01:27:01.119 align:start position:0%
the first meeting it had since Plymouth
 
01:27:03.790 --> 01:27:03.800 align:start position:0%
submitted its proposal so we should have
 
01:27:05.950 --> 01:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
an answer
 
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
shortly I so I I don't I don't know that
 
01:27:13.070 --> 01:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
the the timing is off I I spoke with Don
 
01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
yesterday president Burks yesterday
 
01:27:18.590 --> 01:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
about this and um if approved they're
 
01:27:20.149 --> 01:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
going to be ready to stand these up next
 
01:27:23.790 --> 01:27:23.800 align:start position:0%
fall that's good any other questions on
 
01:27:25.709 --> 01:27:25.719 align:start position:0%
this one
 
01:27:27.910 --> 01:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
by doing this are they saying you don't
 
01:27:29.870 --> 01:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
need some of that general education you
 
01:27:31.709 --> 01:27:31.719 align:start position:0%
need these specific things related to
 
01:27:35.070 --> 01:27:35.080 align:start position:0%
cyber security or or in the other four
 
01:27:37.070 --> 01:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
topics so is that how they're cutting
 
01:27:38.550 --> 01:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
back and certainly making it more
 
01:27:40.709 --> 01:27:40.719 align:start position:0%
affordable I would say if the
 
01:27:44.470 --> 01:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
committee happy to have um provos Bo
 
01:27:47.470 --> 01:27:47.480 align:start position:0%
bodic come down like their faculty were
 
01:27:49.669 --> 01:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
definitely involved with the
 
01:27:52.189 --> 01:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
Provost happy to have them come down at
 
01:27:54.870 --> 01:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
a at a future meeting of the and talk
 
01:27:58.030 --> 01:27:58.040 align:start position:0%
about because again this is happening
 
01:28:00.790 --> 01:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
around the country so happy to have them
 
01:28:02.790 --> 01:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
come down and talk about the come down
 
01:28:05.430 --> 01:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
some and and talk to us about
 
01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
that uh going on then to number six
 
01:28:13.709 --> 01:28:13.719 align:start position:0%
here and this is one that is is
 
01:28:15.629 --> 01:28:15.639 align:start position:0%
hopefully going to save some dollars
 
01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
here uh shared location of
 
01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.709 align:start position:0%
here uh shared location of
administrative

01:28:19.709 --> 01:28:19.719 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
01:28:24.830 --> 01:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
offices um yes we're both um
 
01:28:26.709 --> 01:28:26.719 align:start position:0%
systems have been working we would
 
01:28:28.910 --> 01:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
expect that we'll be a the university
 
01:28:30.510 --> 01:28:30.520 align:start position:0%
system will be able to move into a
 
01:28:33.750 --> 01:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
building on the nhti campus by May June
 
01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
at the latest we are in the design phase
 
01:28:43.350 --> 01:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
um value engineering or value
 
01:28:45.510 --> 01:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
engineering that's code for getting the
 
01:28:49.990 --> 01:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
cost down um and a building on the
 
01:28:52.709 --> 01:28:52.719 align:start position:0%
campus was identified that um it needs
 
01:28:54.790 --> 01:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
some work so we're
 
01:28:57.870 --> 01:28:57.880 align:start position:0%
sharing in the cost of the there's
 
01:29:00.629 --> 01:29:00.639 align:start position:0%
deferred maintenance but um anyway so
 
01:29:03.189 --> 01:29:03.199 align:start position:0%
yes we would expect that we'll be in the
 
01:29:08.149 --> 01:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
building by um late spring early summer
 
01:29:11.310 --> 01:29:11.320 align:start position:0%
it will save the university system about
 
01:29:14.709 --> 01:29:14.719 align:start position:0%
$250,000 a year in rent and we will
 
01:29:17.709 --> 01:29:17.719 align:start position:0%
provide um you know a rental income
 
01:29:20.189 --> 01:29:20.199 align:start position:0%
stream to the community college system
 
01:29:22.229 --> 01:29:22.239 align:start position:0%
and then I'll be right in Mark's back
 
01:29:22.239 --> 01:29:24.709 align:start position:0%
and then I'll be right in Mark's back
backyard

01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
backyard
 
01:29:27.350 --> 01:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
literally literally so you really talk
 
01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
farum Hall which is the building right
 
01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.709 align:start position:0%
farum Hall which is the building right
behind

01:29:32.709 --> 01:29:32.719 align:start position:0%
behind
 
01:29:34.790 --> 01:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
yours that's a good move because we're
 
01:29:36.629 --> 01:29:36.639 align:start position:0%
going to save save money there by taking
 
01:29:39.229 --> 01:29:39.239 align:start position:0%
them from down the other side of conquer
 
01:29:43.390 --> 01:29:43.400 align:start position:0%
here was it Chanel not Chanel yeah yeah
 
01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:46.189 align:start position:0%
here was it Chanel not Chanel yeah yeah
Chanel

01:29:46.189 --> 01:29:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:50.590 --> 01:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
drive any questions regarding that it's
 
01:29:53.030 --> 01:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
I think that's a real positive stroke
 
01:29:54.550 --> 01:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
01:29:56.870 --> 01:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
and the item number seven which you had
 
01:29:58.790 --> 01:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
here in the report to us is dealing with
 
01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:01.550 align:start position:0%
here in the report to us is dealing with
unified

01:30:01.550 --> 01:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:04.149 --> 01:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
accreditation work work in progress
 
01:30:06.350 --> 01:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
we're currently engaging with the
 
01:30:08.030 --> 01:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
national Center for higher education
 
01:30:10.990 --> 01:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
Management Systems which is a group
 
01:30:13.310 --> 01:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
that's been working across the country
 
01:30:16.189 --> 01:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
for the last 50 years very data oriented
 
01:30:20.149 --> 01:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
policy and strategy oriented uh they've
 
01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
been Gathering both our internal data as
 
01:30:25.669 --> 01:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
well as labor market data other data
 
01:30:28.990 --> 01:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
from from federal and and other sources
 
01:30:30.590 --> 01:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
they're going to be here in New
 
01:30:33.229 --> 01:30:33.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire across the state visiting
 
01:30:35.790 --> 01:30:35.800 align:start position:0%
stakeholders on our campuses well as
 
01:30:37.709 --> 01:30:37.719 align:start position:0%
legislators other other stakeholders
 
01:30:40.390 --> 01:30:40.400 align:start position:0%
throughout New Hampshire week of October
 
01:30:44.229 --> 01:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
1st 21st to the 25th and we expect
 
01:30:46.189 --> 01:30:46.199 align:start position:0%
recommendations I should say a set of
 
01:30:48.109 --> 01:30:48.119 align:start position:0%
alternatives for the board Board of
 
01:30:49.870 --> 01:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
Trustees consideration perhaps some
 
01:30:52.709 --> 01:30:52.719 align:start position:0%
recommendations among those Alternatives
 
01:30:55.790 --> 01:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
by late January early February our board
 
01:30:59.030 --> 01:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
will have an opportunity to consider
 
01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
those later the ne next spring and and
 
01:31:04.910 --> 01:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
may take may choose to take action in
 
01:31:07.350 --> 01:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
the coming year whether the decision is
 
01:31:09.870 --> 01:31:09.880 align:start position:0%
to move towards single accreditation as
 
01:31:12.669 --> 01:31:12.679 align:start position:0%
a a Statewide singly accredited
 
01:31:15.830 --> 01:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
institution um is an open question but
 
01:31:17.709 --> 01:31:17.719 align:start position:0%
we're continuing to work on
 
01:31:19.870 --> 01:31:19.880 align:start position:0%
administrative redesign ways in which
 
01:31:22.750 --> 01:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
seven colleges can work better together
 
01:31:25.709 --> 01:31:25.719 align:start position:0%
for if efficiencies primarily to be able
 
01:31:27.629 --> 01:31:27.639 align:start position:0%
to reinvest in things that we know we
 
01:31:30.109 --> 01:31:30.119 align:start position:0%
need to be able to do but also to create
 
01:31:32.350 --> 01:31:32.360 align:start position:0%
more seamless experiences for students
 
01:31:33.750 --> 01:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
so they don't have to learn to be a
 
01:31:35.669 --> 01:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
student at multiple campuses that do
 
01:31:38.669 --> 01:31:38.679 align:start position:0%
things different ways so would expect to
 
01:31:41.709 --> 01:31:41.719 align:start position:0%
have more concrete information on this
 
01:31:45.310 --> 01:31:45.320 align:start position:0%
one sometime in the in the
 
01:31:50.149 --> 01:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:53.910 --> 01:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
committee not see any there uh last
 
01:31:55.590 --> 01:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
number eight that you had down in this
 
01:31:57.310 --> 01:31:57.320 align:start position:0%
report of areas that you're working
 
01:31:59.149 --> 01:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
towards Implement a common enterprise
 
01:32:02.510 --> 01:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
resource planning Erp
 
01:32:06.270 --> 01:32:06.280 align:start position:0%
platform so the university system has
 
01:32:10.910 --> 01:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
been oh we're 18 to 24 months into
 
01:32:14.270 --> 01:32:14.280 align:start position:0%
implementation of a new Erp
 
01:32:16.830 --> 01:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
Enterprise res resource plan it's all of
 
01:32:19.229 --> 01:32:19.239 align:start position:0%
HR all of Finance all of student and
 
01:32:20.990 --> 01:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
we're going
 
01:32:24.550 --> 01:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
Live December 21st with with HR and
 
01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
finance this is a multi-year TENS of
 
01:32:32.030 --> 01:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars project our old
 
01:32:37.790 --> 01:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
Erp was 30 years old it's
 
01:32:40.109 --> 01:32:40.119 align:start position:0%
um what we're what we currently are
 
01:32:42.229 --> 01:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
using is highly inefficient we probably
 
01:32:44.229 --> 01:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
have 75
 
01:32:47.189 --> 01:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
bolt-on pieces of Technology on that Erp
 
01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
so we're going to
 
01:32:53.950 --> 01:32:53.960 align:start position:0%
workday um the student part of workday
 
01:32:56.270 --> 01:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
again across our institutions each
 
01:32:58.350 --> 01:32:58.360 align:start position:0%
institution has its own student system
 
01:32:59.750 --> 01:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to
 
01:33:05.709 --> 01:33:05.719 align:start position:0%
one workday student system go live is
 
01:33:10.590 --> 01:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
27 I cannot overstate the amount of
 
01:33:14.149 --> 01:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
work the investment something like this
 
01:33:17.590 --> 01:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
requires so um it would be terrific for
 
01:33:19.390 --> 01:33:19.400 align:start position:0%
the two systems to be on the same
 
01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
platform but again I cannot it's it's a
 
01:33:24.990 --> 01:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
enormous investment
 
01:33:27.870 --> 01:33:27.880 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm confident it is going to
 
01:33:30.109 --> 01:33:30.119 align:start position:0%
result in enormous benefit for the
 
01:33:35.070 --> 01:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
University system um but that is would
 
01:33:37.790 --> 01:33:37.800 align:start position:0%
that's a heavy lift with intensive
 
01:33:40.390 --> 01:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
investment in my opinion we need to
 
01:33:43.590 --> 01:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
continue to work together I will say one
 
01:33:46.590 --> 01:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
um even on smaller pieces of of
 
01:33:49.149 --> 01:33:49.159 align:start position:0%
Technology we're I spoke with my chief
 
01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
procurement officer not too long ago
 
01:33:52.990 --> 01:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
when we're going to get some seats for
 
01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
the Community College system in our
 
01:33:58.510 --> 01:33:58.520 align:start position:0%
procurement platform so we could start
 
01:34:02.990 --> 01:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
leveraging more scale um but but this is
 
01:34:06.669 --> 01:34:06.679 align:start position:0%
um let me just number
 
01:34:10.510 --> 01:34:10.520 align:start position:0%
eight is nowhere near the
 
01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:18.510 --> 01:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
six um so I I'll I'll leave we're
 
01:34:19.910 --> 01:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
thrilled about what we're doing at the
 
01:34:22.350 --> 01:34:22.360 align:start position:0%
University system but the work that has
 
01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
been involved and can it
 
01:34:25.510 --> 01:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
and we are
 
01:34:27.910 --> 01:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
not we won't be finished with student
 
01:34:31.109 --> 01:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:34.149 --> 01:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
27 okay those are the eight topical
 
01:34:36.830 --> 01:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
areas that you have you've you selected
 
01:34:40.030 --> 01:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
to share with us right now are there any
 
01:34:42.149 --> 01:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
other there's there's a number of
 
01:34:45.070 --> 01:34:45.080 align:start position:0%
short-term objectives and
 
01:34:47.790 --> 01:34:47.800 align:start position:0%
long-term can you speak to any of those
 
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
which are you know not listed here that
 
01:34:55.470 --> 01:34:55.480 align:start position:0%
the task force also came up with these
 
01:34:59.870 --> 01:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
um areas so yeah Mr chair yes just I I
 
01:35:02.070 --> 01:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
had a quick question on the Erp okay if
 
01:35:05.149 --> 01:35:05.159 align:start position:0%
we we could just do that thanks so when
 
01:35:07.189 --> 01:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
did when did you say the Erp was going
 
01:35:11.669 --> 01:35:11.679 align:start position:0%
to go live HR and finance yeah December
 
01:35:14.430 --> 01:35:14.440 align:start position:0%
of this year okay okay
 
01:35:19.750 --> 01:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
student is TW calendar 27 I believe okay
 
01:35:23.229 --> 01:35:23.239 align:start position:0%
and and as far as HR and finance and and
 
01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:25.360 align:start position:0%
going live
 
01:35:28.590 --> 01:35:28.600 align:start position:0%
um and and I'm just asking the question
 
01:35:31.669 --> 01:35:31.679 align:start position:0%
from an oversight um uh thing but but
 
01:35:34.590 --> 01:35:34.600 align:start position:0%
how do you know when the um when the
 
01:35:39.149 --> 01:35:39.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:42.629 --> 01:35:42.639 align:start position:0%
live how how do well we're working up to
 
01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
it right now that's
 
01:35:47.910 --> 01:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
what I I guess what
 
01:35:51.030 --> 01:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
um what I'm what I'm trying to get at is
 
01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
is obviously it's a it's a very it's a
 
01:35:57.590 --> 01:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
critical system for for the the
 
01:36:00.550 --> 01:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
university system and and wanting to
 
01:36:03.189 --> 01:36:03.199 align:start position:0%
make sure that that late in the year
 
01:36:04.430 --> 01:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
that when you're when you're ready to
 
01:36:07.310 --> 01:36:07.320 align:start position:0%
cut over live and you know all companies
 
01:36:10.030 --> 01:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
do these things too in terms of making
 
01:36:12.430 --> 01:36:12.440 align:start position:0%
sure of the reliability and I'm just I
 
01:36:16.669 --> 01:36:16.679 align:start position:0%
just want to want to know that that's um
 
01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
going on we are testing
 
01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:22.390 align:start position:0%
going on we are testing
247

01:36:22.390 --> 01:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
247
 
01:36:28.669 --> 01:36:28.679 align:start position:0%
and the the payroll is number one and
 
01:36:31.709 --> 01:36:31.719 align:start position:0%
that all the tests believe me we test
 
01:36:34.229 --> 01:36:34.239 align:start position:0%
and retest and retest there are hundreds
 
01:36:37.430 --> 01:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
of people working on this okay fantastic
 
01:36:40.870 --> 01:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
um almost Around the Clock okay so
 
01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
believe me if it's not going to work
 
01:36:45.390 --> 01:36:45.400 align:start position:0%
we're not going live but there are no
 
01:36:48.030 --> 01:36:48.040 align:start position:0%
indications as I sit here right now that
 
01:36:50.189 --> 01:36:50.199 align:start position:0%
that we won't go live on December okay
 
01:36:52.149 --> 01:36:52.159 align:start position:0%
that's that's great to hear so thanks
 
01:36:55.790 --> 01:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
Kathy Kathy before we we adjourn here um
 
01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
I'd like to ask one other question which
 
01:37:01.750 --> 01:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
is more of a short as well as long term
 
01:37:03.910 --> 01:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
where are we on the issue of
 
01:37:06.590 --> 01:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
affordability for students and the
 
01:37:09.910 --> 01:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
efficiency of tuition
 
01:37:14.830 --> 01:37:14.840 align:start position:0%
freezing uh we have Frozen the the
 
01:37:17.229 --> 01:37:17.239 align:start position:0%
tuition rate
 
01:37:20.709 --> 01:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
here with this shrinking
 
01:37:24.070 --> 01:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
demographic and tuition being primary
 
01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
source of
 
01:37:28.629 --> 01:37:28.639 align:start position:0%
Revenue how how are you going to make
 
01:37:31.870 --> 01:37:31.880 align:start position:0%
this thing work um and that it's an
 
01:37:34.830 --> 01:37:34.840 align:start position:0%
important issue so the affordability
 
01:37:37.990 --> 01:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
issue for students is huge that's why we
 
01:37:40.750 --> 01:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
see them going to Utah or to Georgia or
 
01:37:42.910 --> 01:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
some other place because it's probably
 
01:37:45.669 --> 01:37:45.679 align:start position:0%
getting a Best Buy
 
01:37:48.189 --> 01:37:48.199 align:start position:0%
um how do we address this issue of
 
01:37:50.750 --> 01:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
tuition free is that going to continue
 
01:37:54.270 --> 01:37:54.280 align:start position:0%
or or
 
01:37:56.149 --> 01:37:56.159 align:start position:0%
the margin must be getting very very
 
01:37:59.750 --> 01:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
close here as far as six years yeah yes
 
01:38:03.629 --> 01:38:03.639 align:start position:0%
is it six years now yes six years this
 
01:38:06.589 --> 01:38:06.599 align:start position:0%
is this is um year
 
01:38:10.149 --> 01:38:10.159 align:start position:0%
six um I representative Vlad
 
01:38:13.830 --> 01:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
I the board will be voting on that this
 
01:38:16.390 --> 01:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
month I know
 
01:38:19.790 --> 01:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
it it's it's increasingly difficult and
 
01:38:22.750 --> 01:38:22.760 align:start position:0%
believe me you know representative lad
 
01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:24.189 align:start position:0%
believe me you know representative lad
um

01:38:24.189 --> 01:38:24.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:24.199 --> 01:38:26.870 align:start position:0%
um
we

01:38:26.870 --> 01:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:30.390 --> 01:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
are there's a lot of work going on to
 
01:38:34.470 --> 01:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
contain costs and as inflation has has
 
01:38:36.790 --> 01:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
been at high levels over the past five
 
01:38:40.310 --> 01:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
or six years we have kept tuition flat
 
01:38:44.470 --> 01:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
um at the same time need increases
 
01:38:46.189 --> 01:38:46.199 align:start position:0%
Financial need
 
01:38:50.109 --> 01:38:50.119 align:start position:0%
increases which puts more pressure on
 
01:38:52.470 --> 01:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
the bottom line we've done a lot to
 
01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
contain costs
 
01:38:59.589 --> 01:38:59.599 align:start position:0%
but at some point um we our board and
 
01:39:01.270 --> 01:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
our presidents are not going to run in
 
01:39:06.510 --> 01:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
the red as a system that's not prudent
 
01:39:08.990 --> 01:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
um for the the future health of our
 
01:39:12.589 --> 01:39:12.599 align:start position:0%
University system so
 
01:39:15.510 --> 01:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what will happen next
 
01:39:19.030 --> 01:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
academic year but the it the pressure is
 
01:39:23.470 --> 01:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
mounting um as our margins
 
01:39:25.070 --> 01:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
slim so are we going to follow the lead
 
01:39:27.109 --> 01:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
of Vermont where 80% of their kids are
 
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
out of state students and where we here
 
01:39:31.830 --> 01:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
is that where we're going to seek
 
01:39:35.470 --> 01:39:35.480 align:start position:0%
further revenue from out ofate students
 
01:39:37.709 --> 01:39:37.719 align:start position:0%
well all New Hampshire students who are
 
01:39:39.430 --> 01:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
eligible which
 
01:39:43.750 --> 01:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
are many are accepted to the university
 
01:39:45.310 --> 01:39:45.320 align:start position:0%
and Plymouth and
 
01:39:48.270 --> 01:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
Keane so
 
01:39:50.629 --> 01:39:50.639 align:start position:0%
um as you said at the beginning of the
 
01:39:52.830 --> 01:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
meeting that in a Wall Street Journal
 
01:39:54.430 --> 01:39:54.440 align:start position:0%
article that you recently read that this
 
01:39:57.669 --> 01:39:57.679 align:start position:0%
is not a New Hampshire issue it's New
 
01:40:00.390 --> 01:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
England students are leaving New England
 
01:40:03.350 --> 01:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
for for higher
 
01:40:07.990 --> 01:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
education um so I that's why we have to
 
01:40:09.790 --> 01:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
continue to provide a lot of
 
01:40:12.990 --> 01:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
opportunities frankly I think we need to
 
01:40:14.669 --> 01:40:14.679 align:start position:0%
collectively as
 
01:40:17.790 --> 01:40:17.800 align:start position:0%
a market them better and maybe think of
 
01:40:21.790 --> 01:40:21.800 align:start position:0%
a system of public
 
01:40:25.109 --> 01:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
education not public higher
 
01:40:28.030 --> 01:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
education you Senator when you Senator
 
01:40:30.270 --> 01:40:30.280 align:start position:0%
deler when you talk about the the
 
01:40:32.870 --> 01:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
students in man I still think the the
 
01:40:34.390 --> 01:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
our opportunities here as our
 
01:40:36.350 --> 01:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
demographics decline are those students
 
01:40:38.030 --> 01:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
who never even have a twinkle in their
 
01:40:40.350 --> 01:40:40.360 align:start position:0%
eye that they can go to college whether
 
01:40:42.870 --> 01:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
it be Community College or any in any
 
01:40:45.270 --> 01:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
way further their education but how do
 
01:40:47.589 --> 01:40:47.599 align:start position:0%
we get to those students and I don't
 
01:40:50.629 --> 01:40:50.639 align:start position:0%
think we can wait until high
 
01:40:54.350 --> 01:40:54.360 align:start position:0%
school but then we have to think of
 
01:40:58.070 --> 01:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
the system of Education right so anyway
 
01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I just went off on so correct
 
01:41:04.510 --> 01:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
me if I'm wrong but I can remember I
 
01:41:06.589 --> 01:41:06.599 align:start position:0%
thought Melinda was saying that first
 
01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
generation students at Keen is higher
 
01:41:12.870 --> 01:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
now than it's ever been Plymouth also
 
01:41:15.629 --> 01:41:15.639 align:start position:0%
Plymouth so how do we replicate that
 
01:41:18.629 --> 01:41:18.639 align:start position:0%
model throughout the whole system well
 
01:41:21.030 --> 01:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
part of that is granted
 
01:41:23.910 --> 01:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
guarantee um and that is another
 
01:41:25.669 --> 01:41:25.679 align:start position:0%
question that you know how long can we
 
01:41:27.350 --> 01:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
sustain granted
 
01:41:30.669 --> 01:41:30.679 align:start position:0%
guarantee so you know if your pel
 
01:41:32.109 --> 01:41:32.119 align:start position:0%
eligible in Hampshire resident you have
 
01:41:32.119 --> 01:41:33.990 align:start position:0%
eligible in Hampshire resident you have
free

01:41:33.990 --> 01:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
free
 
01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.750 align:start position:0%
free
tuition

01:41:35.750 --> 01:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
tuition
 
01:41:38.750 --> 01:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
funded from from the University system
 
01:41:43.470 --> 01:41:43.480 align:start position:0%
so these are these are all the the
 
01:41:46.470 --> 01:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
um pressures and opportunities we need
 
01:41:51.629 --> 01:41:51.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:54.189 --> 01:41:54.199 align:start position:0%
future is there any any other other
 
01:41:54.199 --> 01:41:55.229 align:start position:0%
future is there any any other other
questions

01:41:55.229 --> 01:41:55.239 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:41:57.430 --> 01:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
are sounds like the university and
 
01:41:58.830 --> 01:41:58.840 align:start position:0%
community colleges are trying to chew
 
01:42:00.910 --> 01:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
and walk at the same
 
01:42:03.510 --> 01:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
time talk we can chew and walk at the
 
01:42:05.750 --> 01:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
same time Mr
 
01:42:09.229 --> 01:42:09.239 align:start position:0%
chair but it's uh yes represent Mooney
 
01:42:10.510 --> 01:42:10.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you both
 
01:42:13.030 --> 01:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
for being here you've done a tremendous
 
01:42:14.870 --> 01:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
job and I know the goal is to make this
 
01:42:16.830 --> 01:42:16.840 align:start position:0%
seamless in terms of transferring
 
01:42:18.750 --> 01:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
credits and doing everything you can
 
01:42:20.669 --> 01:42:20.679 align:start position:0%
internally and you have a real good
 
01:42:24.030 --> 01:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
grasp on that but I have to ask about
 
01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
things that you can't control that are
 
01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
necessary to make this work for example
 
01:42:34.390 --> 01:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
internships externships clinicals hours
 
01:42:36.750 --> 01:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
matching up students finding
 
01:42:38.390 --> 01:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
availability there hasn't been any
 
01:42:40.910 --> 01:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
mention of that today as far as I know
 
01:42:43.550 --> 01:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
and my question to you is how is that
 
01:42:45.870 --> 01:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
going are there any glitches there are
 
01:42:47.669 --> 01:42:47.679 align:start position:0%
there any holdups there to make this
 
01:42:49.510 --> 01:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
work are there any adjustments that
 
01:42:53.390 --> 01:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
needed to be made there thank you
 
01:42:55.709 --> 01:42:55.719 align:start position:0%
so so representative Mooney I think
 
01:42:57.589 --> 01:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
that's a you could have another whole
 
01:43:01.709 --> 01:43:01.719 align:start position:0%
meeting on internships apprenticeships
 
01:43:03.910 --> 01:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
externships both at the community
 
01:43:06.030 --> 01:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
college system and at the University
 
01:43:09.030 --> 01:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
system as far as I know we're not that
 
01:43:11.870 --> 01:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
that wasn't a topic for the task force
 
01:43:14.350 --> 01:43:14.360 align:start position:0%
even though I know there's tremendous
 
01:43:18.830 --> 01:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
work happening in both systems we know
 
01:43:21.310 --> 01:43:21.320 align:start position:0%
um there are more internship
 
01:43:23.430 --> 01:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
opportunities than there are students
 
01:43:26.109 --> 01:43:26.119 align:start position:0%
students and we also know that students
 
01:43:29.390 --> 01:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
who participate in at the University
 
01:43:31.950 --> 01:43:31.960 align:start position:0%
participate in an internship from out of
 
01:43:33.310 --> 01:43:33.320 align:start position:0%
if they're out of state students they're
 
01:43:35.149 --> 01:43:35.159 align:start position:0%
twice as likely to stay and work here in
 
01:43:38.430 --> 01:43:38.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that is a huge effort
 
01:43:42.189 --> 01:43:42.199 align:start position:0%
happening um the univ University of New
 
01:43:45.189 --> 01:43:45.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire invested heavily in
 
01:43:49.070 --> 01:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
that I want to say maybe five or six
 
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
years ago and it's paid off but again
 
01:43:56.350 --> 01:43:56.360 align:start position:0%
that's that's an investment you need to
 
01:43:59.109 --> 01:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
stand that up connect businesses and and
 
01:44:01.390 --> 01:44:01.400 align:start position:0%
nonprofits with students make sure that
 
01:44:03.790 --> 01:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
they're having an experience
 
01:44:07.550 --> 01:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
that's um you know worthy of earning
 
01:44:09.870 --> 01:44:09.880 align:start position:0%
credits but that that's I think that'd
 
01:44:13.310 --> 01:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
be another whole meeting on that on that
 
01:44:17.109 --> 01:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
topic if I may I'd like to blend
 
01:44:18.709 --> 01:44:18.719 align:start position:0%
represent Mooney's question with the
 
01:44:21.310 --> 01:44:21.320 align:start position:0%
discussion representative lad was
 
01:44:23.390 --> 01:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
bringing regarding tuition for community
 
01:44:25.709 --> 01:44:25.719 align:start position:0%
college system also 6 years but only one
 
01:44:28.990 --> 01:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
tuition increase $5 over the last 13
 
01:44:32.830 --> 01:44:32.840 align:start position:0%
years so we've been effectively flat and
 
01:44:35.310 --> 01:44:35.320 align:start position:0%
relative to inflation have effectively
 
01:44:38.510 --> 01:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
given up about 40% of the buying power
 
01:44:40.910 --> 01:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
of of the dollar during that time we've
 
01:44:42.510 --> 01:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
only been able to do it because of the
 
01:44:45.350 --> 01:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
state's continued investment in our work
 
01:44:47.350 --> 01:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
and the reason it becomes increasingly
 
01:44:49.870 --> 01:44:49.880 align:start position:0%
critical is that our program mix has
 
01:44:52.030 --> 01:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
become increasingly concentrated in
 
01:44:54.030 --> 01:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
areas that are abs absolutely vital for
 
01:44:57.149 --> 01:44:57.159 align:start position:0%
the state our nursing programs we're
 
01:45:00.149 --> 01:45:00.159 align:start position:0%
preparing over 250 graduates each year
 
01:45:02.870 --> 01:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
but collectively the tuition and fees
 
01:45:04.790 --> 01:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
relative to the expense of delivering
 
01:45:07.510 --> 01:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
those programs those seven colleges
 
01:45:11.870 --> 01:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
absorb about $3.3 million in in net cost
 
01:45:14.030 --> 01:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
each year and look at our automated
 
01:45:16.109 --> 01:45:16.119 align:start position:0%
manufacturing look at some Automotive
 
01:45:18.589 --> 01:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
programs other technology programs those
 
01:45:20.910 --> 01:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
are expensive programs to offer and as
 
01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
we see less students interest in liberal
 
01:45:26.149 --> 01:45:26.159 align:start position:0%
arts and business things that tend to be
 
01:45:28.149 --> 01:45:28.159 align:start position:0%
more affordable to offer and in fact as
 
01:45:30.350 --> 01:45:30.360 align:start position:0%
we make it more accessible through Early
 
01:45:33.310 --> 01:45:33.320 align:start position:0%
College we are left with a portfolio of
 
01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
programs that are vital to the state's
 
01:45:37.709 --> 01:45:37.719 align:start position:0%
future but increasingly expensive to
 
01:45:40.430 --> 01:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
offer and with less way of less ways of
 
01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:42.430 align:start position:0%
offer and with less way of less ways of
internally

01:45:42.430 --> 01:45:42.440 align:start position:0%
internally
 
01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
subsidizing one answer is that we
 
01:45:46.990 --> 01:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
increase tuition but the risk is that we
 
01:45:49.149 --> 01:45:49.159 align:start position:0%
actually create one more barrier that
 
01:45:51.510 --> 01:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
causes students not to be able to pursue
 
01:45:53.350 --> 01:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
those opportunities
 
01:45:55.430 --> 01:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
and so trying to strike a balance that
 
01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
ensures that we have adequate resources
 
01:45:59.470 --> 01:45:59.480 align:start position:0%
to invest in the quality of programs
 
01:46:01.470 --> 01:46:01.480 align:start position:0%
keeping them sufficiently affordable for
 
01:46:03.790 --> 01:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
students to keep the demand up so that
 
01:46:05.990 --> 01:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
we can produce the number of graduates
 
01:46:08.070 --> 01:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
that the state needs in critical
 
01:46:11.189 --> 01:46:11.199 align:start position:0%
Fields this is really delicate
 
01:46:13.550 --> 01:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
choreography and I I don't know that
 
01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
it's necessarily science it's a balance
 
01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
of science and art and we're
 
01:46:20.229 --> 01:46:20.239 align:start position:0%
continuously working on it and and the
 
01:46:22.189 --> 01:46:22.199 align:start position:0%
legislature and the next Governor will
 
01:46:23.990 --> 01:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
have a significant voice in our ability
 
01:46:26.189 --> 01:46:26.199 align:start position:0%
to maintain this this delicate
 
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
equilibrium that we've been pursuing um
 
01:46:32.790 --> 01:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
so again it's it it's vital that we not
 
01:46:35.109 --> 01:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
allow the program quality to suffer by
 
01:46:35.119 --> 01:46:37.260 align:start position:0%
allow the program quality to suffer by
underinvestigated

01:46:37.260 --> 01:46:37.270 align:start position:0%
underinvestigated
 
01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:44.950 align:start position:0%
underinvestigated
[Music]

01:46:44.950 --> 01:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:52.950 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:46:52.950 --> 01:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:55.350 --> 01:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
portion of working adults the ability to
 
01:46:57.550 --> 01:46:57.560 align:start position:0%
offer both access from an affordability
 
01:46:59.629 --> 01:46:59.639 align:start position:0%
perspective but also convenience
 
01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
regionally distributed so that they can
 
01:47:03.790 --> 01:47:03.800 align:start position:0%
participate in education while they're
 
01:47:05.430 --> 01:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
living their lives working raising
 
01:47:08.070 --> 01:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
families and all the rest that adults do
 
01:47:14.189 --> 01:47:14.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:16.990 --> 01:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
choreography yeah it's not an easy thing
 
01:47:19.870 --> 01:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
to deal with here I'm looking at what
 
01:47:21.830 --> 01:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
what is the percentage that your
 
01:47:23.470 --> 01:47:23.480 align:start position:0%
appropriation from the state is how much
 
01:47:27.629 --> 01:47:27.639 align:start position:0%
of your revenues 60% close to 60% 60%
 
01:47:30.109 --> 01:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
and you you uh
 
01:47:32.750 --> 01:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
Catherine for our total budget it's
 
01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:33.589 align:start position:0%
Catherine for our total budget it's
about

01:47:33.589 --> 01:47:33.599 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:47:36.109 --> 01:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
10% but our total
 
01:47:39.709 --> 01:47:39.719 align:start position:0%
budget you know includes room uh
 
01:47:45.990 --> 01:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
yeah rooms meals that's about 10%
 
01:47:48.950 --> 01:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
W anything else from the higher educ
 
01:47:50.910 --> 01:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
study I appreciate the reports you've
 
01:47:52.830 --> 01:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
submitted to us and looks like you're
 
01:47:55.070 --> 01:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
really on the road to following up what
 
01:47:57.629 --> 01:47:57.639 align:start position:0%
the task force has recommended and I
 
01:47:59.950 --> 01:47:59.960 align:start position:0%
certainly appreciate it and I know it's
 
01:48:01.990 --> 01:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of work and I I've met often
 
01:48:03.870 --> 01:48:03.880 align:start position:0%
with you and it's I I see what's going
 
01:48:07.229 --> 01:48:07.239 align:start position:0%
on it's uh some you wonder if it's even
 
01:48:09.229 --> 01:48:09.239 align:start position:0%
humanly possible but you're you're
 
01:48:11.629 --> 01:48:11.639 align:start position:0%
you're doing it and I appreciate it any
 
01:48:13.669 --> 01:48:13.679 align:start position:0%
other last thoughts or comments from the
 
01:48:16.390 --> 01:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
committee I I have one last thought for
 
01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:17.589 align:start position:0%
committee I I have one last thought for
Senator

01:48:17.589 --> 01:48:17.599 align:start position:0%
Senator
 
01:48:21.189 --> 01:48:21.199 align:start position:0%
alesandro I I just want to say that
 
01:48:24.270 --> 01:48:24.280 align:start position:0%
we've come a long long way since 30
 
01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
years ago so I don't when you when you
 
01:48:29.510 --> 01:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
worked with Governor Peterson so I don't
 
01:48:31.310 --> 01:48:31.320 align:start position:0%
want you to leave here thinking that the
 
01:48:33.910 --> 01:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
problem is still as bad as it was then
 
01:48:36.629 --> 01:48:36.639 align:start position:0%
we're both both systems are very
 
01:48:39.750 --> 01:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
committed to to the work going forward I
 
01:48:41.149 --> 01:48:41.159 align:start position:0%
know working with the
 
01:48:43.470 --> 01:48:43.480 align:start position:0%
provos and we initially were looking at
 
01:48:46.910 --> 01:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
30 Pathways and now we're close to a 100
 
01:48:49.470 --> 01:48:49.480 align:start position:0%
that are uniformed from the community
 
01:48:52.030 --> 01:48:52.040 align:start position:0%
college up through so that is a that's a
 
01:48:54.629 --> 01:48:54.639 align:start position:0%
huge taking and worked with the the
 
01:48:57.270 --> 01:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
provos and professors in the in the in
 
01:49:00.470 --> 01:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
the systems I I think that's really a
 
01:49:03.629 --> 01:49:03.639 align:start position:0%
good step forward and u i congratulate
 
01:49:04.750 --> 01:49:04.760 align:start position:0%
you on
 
01:49:07.830 --> 01:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
that anything else not we're going to
 
01:49:09.990 --> 01:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
anything from the the public which is
 
01:49:14.109 --> 01:49:14.119 align:start position:0%
Shannon and Beth and Jen not seeing
 
01:49:15.750 --> 01:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
anything thank you very much we're going
 
01:49:19.870 --> 01:49:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:23.149 --> 01:49:23.159 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so now get the report but you
 
01:49:27.430 --> 01:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
have yeah yeah yeah but I don't have all
 
01:49:30.229 --> 01:49:30.239 align:start position:0%
pages I just got I I think you got
 
01:49:33.870 --> 01:49:33.880 align:start position:0%
them me did we get
