00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
good morning everybody uh we have a work
 
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
session here and time is
 
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 align:start position:0%
valuable and so we we need to get on so
 
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
if we could find our seats we can get
 
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
going with this uh you'll also notice
 
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
that uh I had put together just a very
 
00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199 align:start position:0%
short packet today and everybody should
 
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 align:start position:0%
have this it's some information on there
 
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 align:start position:0%
which might help us with some factual
 
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
information of where we are on terms
 
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
with certain IEPs uh it it also looks at
 
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 align:start position:0%
some information that very narrowly
 
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 align:start position:0%
Scopes some of the the issues associated
 
00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:56.759 align:start position:0%
with um special education Aid and um the
 
00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 align:start position:0%
other material is kind of U just there
 
00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 align:start position:0%
for you your
 
00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 align:start position:0%
interest so I'd like to get going on
 
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 align:start position:0%
this and I'd like to keep this is the
 
00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
first time we've had a workshop dealing
 
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
with special education in terms of two
 
00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 align:start position:0%
areas the differentiate Aid component
 
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280 align:start position:0%
and the special education Aid component
 
00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
which is we previously probably unwisely
 
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
still call catastrophic Aid and because
 
00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 align:start position:0%
it causes a lot of
 
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
confusion uh I'm interested in in
 
00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:28.599 align:start position:0%
dealing with some of the issues of where
 
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
we're really growing
 
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 align:start position:0%
uh how we get a hold of information
 
00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
relative to costing which is of the uh
 
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
special education Aid in terms of
 
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
specific District
 
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:45.560 align:start position:0%
costs um and and and costs relative to
 
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
the state costs relative to the local
 
00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
and the that ratio and is it is it
 
00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
similar throughout uh these districts we
 
00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
don't have that information and but it's
 
00:06:59.670 --> 00:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
worthy of our discussion the account
 
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.270 align:start position:0%
worthy of our discussion the account
ability

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
ability
 
00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
for how we I know how we identify and I
 
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
don't want to get into the idea how
 
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
we're required to do it I'm concerned
 
00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
primarily who's delivering these
 
00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:15.199 align:start position:0%
Services is it coming from the SAU level
 
00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
is coming internally within District to
 
00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:19.400 align:start position:0%
this District Contracting Services I
 
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.080 align:start position:0%
know that's a local decision but the
 
00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
costs go up in in certain formulas and
 
00:07:26.869 --> 00:07:26.879 align:start position:0%
so and if you have questions what we're
 
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
going to do is when we record our
 
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
discussion here
 
00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative Brown is going to be
 
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:34.280 align:start position:0%
underlining questions which come out of
 
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:36.560 align:start position:0%
the discussion which we'll put on a
 
00:07:38.309 --> 00:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
master sheet and pass that out to
 
00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:40.199 align:start position:0%
everybody so we can get that information
 
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:43.400 align:start position:0%
either from the Department or elsewhere
 
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh before we have to be making some of
 
00:07:47.869 --> 00:07:47.879 align:start position:0%
these decisions on all these bills which
 
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
we have and there's more bills
 
00:07:52.749 --> 00:07:52.759 align:start position:0%
addressing this through the a
 
00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
comprehensive look at our whole funding
 
00:07:58.469 --> 00:07:58.479 align:start position:0%
picture of education then these just
 
00:07:59.469 --> 00:07:59.479 align:start position:0%
four that we're going to be disc
 
00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:01.759 align:start position:0%
discussing today so the the the
 
00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:03.560 align:start position:0%
discussion today can be broader than
 
00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
just you know specifically to that bill
 
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
it's our discussion today is
 
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
to special education as we cost out
 
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
these services and how they relate to
 
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
the policies that are are between them
 
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
there's also some confusion I know
 
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
between where's cat special education
 
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
Aid starting stop and where's
 
00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:25.639 align:start position:0%
differentiate what was the purpose of
 
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
that there is a specific purpose for
 
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid and if somebody has
 
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
that we can answer that one so I'd like
 
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
to open it up to discussion right now um
 
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
maybe the first one I'm going to and
 
00:08:40.709 --> 00:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
Brian I'm glad to see you here um and
 
00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
and I see the director back there in the
 
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
far left corner behind Becky
 
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
Wilson um catastrophic Aid I know is
 
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:52.760 align:start position:0%
going to be uh special education Aid
 
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
excuse me it's going to be a a a a heady
 
00:08:58.750 --> 00:08:58.760 align:start position:0%
topic here for us we see that it's
 
00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.030 align:start position:0%
topic here for us we see that it's
costing

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
costing
 
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of funds and we also see the
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
districts are not coming being
 
00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursed at what their actuals are is
 
00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
at a prated amount and it's the amount
 
00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:12.959 align:start position:0%
that we have to cough up is more than
 
00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
what we
 
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
appropriated and so Becky could you come
 
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
forward please and Brian why don't you
 
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:21.160 align:start position:0%
to sit down you know together I maybe we
 
00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:23.000 align:start position:0%
ought to pull up two other chairs other
 
00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:29.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:30.509 --> 00:09:30.519 align:start position:0%
yeah I
 
00:09:30.519 --> 00:09:32.430 align:start position:0%
yeah I
know

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.949 align:start position:0%
know
okay

00:09:33.949 --> 00:09:33.959 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:09:39.069 --> 00:09:39.079 align:start position:0%
okay so uh maybe I'll start it out on on
 
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
the sheets which we've had here folks uh
 
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
the first sheet is this sheet right here
 
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:48.040 align:start position:0%
with the IEP
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
categories is there are you've seen this
 
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
of course do you need a copy of it um if
 
00:09:55.269 --> 00:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
you're going to ask specific questions
 
00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:56.720 align:start position:0%
about some of the numbers I might need a
 
00:09:58.829 --> 00:09:58.839 align:start position:0%
copy but I know what the we do the sheet
 
00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
every year so know what it is so is
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
there an extra one around over there um
 
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:06.680 align:start position:0%
maybe a lighter question which we could
 
00:10:09.949 --> 00:10:09.959 align:start position:0%
ask right now we see some categories
 
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:13.480 align:start position:0%
which are growing uh more so than in
 
00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
previous years and
 
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
growing even more so back prior to covid
 
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:23.480 align:start position:0%
and in relation to the total population
 
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
which we have our enrollment which is
 
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
decreasing since those early years so
 
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
there's our en going down but those
 
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
categories on on a relationship to the
 
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
total are
 
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
increasing do you have some answers for
 
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:40.720 align:start position:0%
us in terms of why they're
 
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
increasing uh thank you for the question
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
chairman lad um just for the record I'm
 
00:10:46.829 --> 00:10:46.839 align:start position:0%
Becky fad I'm the state director special
 
00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:50.120 align:start position:0%
ed if you haven't met me oh here is that
 
00:10:55.629 --> 00:10:55.639 align:start position:0%
better yeah okay um so I think that the
 
00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
categories have not changed in a a very
 
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
long time as you can see was um a
 
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
discontinuation of the the category for
 
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
Deaf deafness um it's now deaf in heart
 
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
of hearing but autism has definitely
 
00:11:10.829 --> 00:11:10.839 align:start position:0%
increased I think it's more and that it
 
00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:12.680 align:start position:0%
is increased in general um there's more
 
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
identification in for even students
 
00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
without disabilities there's more
 
00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:19.160 align:start position:0%
identification of autism um the other
 
00:11:21.069 --> 00:11:21.079 align:start position:0%
category is developmental delay
 
00:11:23.389 --> 00:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
developmental delay is for students that
 
00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
are um under the age of 10 so it only
 
00:11:28.829 --> 00:11:28.839 align:start position:0%
goes up to 10 and it may be students
 
00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:31.160 align:start position:0%
that um you're not quite sure what their
 
00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
disability is they have a lot of
 
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:34.240 align:start position:0%
different things going on and so they
 
00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:35.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes will choose developmental
 
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
delay and then um once they get to 10
 
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
they've had time to work with the child
 
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
they had have had time to do things with
 
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
the child so then they have to pick one
 
00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:46.600 align:start position:0%
of the other categories so that is um
 
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:48.760 align:start position:0%
that is I I would say the developmental
 
00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
delay is indicative of younger students
 
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
being identified more more ear more
 
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
early sorry bad English early in the
 
00:11:59.910 --> 00:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
morning um earlier on um
 
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:02.600 align:start position:0%
the other ones it it diff it varies um I
 
00:12:04.269 --> 00:12:04.279 align:start position:0%
think that you may have found that some
 
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
of the students who were identified
 
00:12:07.949 --> 00:12:07.959 align:start position:0%
speech and language are now identified
 
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
as autistic because they had pragmatic
 
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:11.720 align:start position:0%
difficulties or they had other issues
 
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
that might have fallen under that
 
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
category I think it's kind of shifted in
 
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
how people look at the definition how
 
00:12:19.629 --> 00:12:19.639 align:start position:0%
people understand um disabilities how
 
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
they look how they put it together and
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
then make those diagnoses so I think
 
00:12:25.949 --> 00:12:25.959 align:start position:0%
that's why you don't see a shift in the
 
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
total number but you shift in the way
 
00:12:29.829 --> 00:12:29.839 align:start position:0%
people um as we learned more about these
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
different disabilities a different
 
00:12:33.069 --> 00:12:33.079 align:start position:0%
understanding of what those disabilities
 
00:12:33.079 --> 00:12:34.990 align:start position:0%
understanding of what those disabilities
may

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:35.000 align:start position:0%
may
 
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
be rep Luna thanks very much Mr chair
 
00:12:40.829 --> 00:12:40.839 align:start position:0%
and thanks very much for uh for joining
 
00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:43.839 align:start position:0%
us this morning so so um this is
 
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
probably the first time I've seen this
 
00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
this chart it's very very interesting
 
00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:51.160 align:start position:0%
and and when I when I look at it it um
 
00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
it also it covers the years 2007 through
 
00:12:57.509 --> 00:12:57.519 align:start position:0%
2019 when I when I served on the
 
00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
hopkington school board and um and as as
 
00:13:04.189 --> 00:13:04.199 align:start position:0%
I sort of move towards the right on um
 
00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:05.800 align:start position:0%
you know into the into the different
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
columns you can you can see how um how
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
the um the number of like autism or or
 
00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:17.519 align:start position:0%
developmental delay um diagnosis have
 
00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:20.680 align:start position:0%
have grown over the years and then the
 
00:13:23.829 --> 00:13:23.839 align:start position:0%
um in the specific learning disability
 
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
that has uh decreased generally speaking
 
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
um over the years have have
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
what what have what have been I guess
 
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
been the the have there been changes in
 
00:13:40.509 --> 00:13:40.519 align:start position:0%
diagnostic um uh capability that has
 
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
allowed I I guess practitioners to to
 
00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:46.839 align:start position:0%
become more specific in terms of their
 
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
so for autism I definitely think that
 
00:13:50.749 --> 00:13:50.759 align:start position:0%
would be I I'm I'm just speaking
 
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
hypothetically because I don't have yeah
 
00:13:54.189 --> 00:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
um but I would say that definitely that
 
00:13:56.189 --> 00:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
is um why there's an increase in in the
 
00:13:58.590 --> 00:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
autism it's a more understanding of that
 
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
disability more understanding of the
 
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
different pieces that might be part of
 
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
that disability um and being a and um
 
00:14:07.749 --> 00:14:07.759 align:start position:0%
being able to narrow it down to yes they
 
00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:09.240 align:start position:0%
might have a speech issue but it's
 
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
really not because of a speech
 
00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
disability it's because of their autism
 
00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:15.560 align:start position:0%
or um so I think that the autism is
 
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
definitely something that has become
 
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
more understood in the last you know 23
 
00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:23.320 align:start position:0%
years according to this document um okay
 
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
and then a followup Mr chair so um and I
 
00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:27.560 align:start position:0%
don't know how do you want to do you
 
00:14:29.949 --> 00:14:29.959 align:start position:0%
want to work do the work session
 
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
is you know sort of locked down the way
 
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
we do hearings or more free form yeah I
 
00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:37.480 align:start position:0%
want to I want to flow over this I don't
 
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
want somebody grabbing the whole
 
00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
conversation but uh uh this is a work
 
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
session and in the past I've had work
 
00:14:45.069 --> 00:14:45.079 align:start position:0%
sessions where we've been able to just
 
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
you know ask these questions and I like
 
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
to recognize those no absolutely so so
 
00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
so uh so Becky where where somebody back
 
00:14:59.710 --> 00:14:59.720 align:start position:0%
in in um let's say 2002 was was maybe
 
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
diagnosed or or I don't know if
 
00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
diagnosed is the right term but but
 
00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:07.240 align:start position:0%
identified as having a a specific
 
00:15:09.629 --> 00:15:09.639 align:start position:0%
learning disability so in the sld
 
00:15:14.509 --> 00:15:14.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
2022 a a a student you know maybe from
 
00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
that category maybe from a different
 
00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:23.240 align:start position:0%
category but was was was then um more
 
00:15:26.629 --> 00:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
more accurately diagnosed in the autism
 
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
uh or developmental delay category or
 
00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:31.240 align:start position:0%
one the other categories but would that
 
00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:36.680 align:start position:0%
change how the students IEP um plan
 
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
um would would would be no um it it
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
really wouldn't um it might it might
 
00:15:44.189 --> 00:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
give them more information as to how to
 
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
support that student within with the
 
00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
within the school but really the IEP is
 
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
developed individually for each child
 
00:15:53.069 --> 00:15:53.079 align:start position:0%
and so so whatever evaluations they've
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
done they're taking those those areas of
 
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
need and those strengths and putting it
 
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
into the IEP so regardless of the
 
00:16:00.269 --> 00:16:00.279 align:start position:0%
definition I mean it does give the
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
practitioner more information about the
 
00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
disability and may provide them with
 
00:16:06.389 --> 00:16:06.399 align:start position:0%
more ways to support those students but
 
00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:07.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's not going to change the IEP
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
because the IEP is built off this off of
 
00:16:12.749 --> 00:16:12.759 align:start position:0%
the student's needs this child needs XYZ
 
00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
and how are we going to provide XYZ to
 
00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
this child okay so shifting column
 
00:16:20.829 --> 00:16:20.839 align:start position:0%
shifts over time don't really change the
 
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
the the the services provided through
 
00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
through schools I mean they may
 
00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:28.120 align:start position:0%
understanding the disability it may even
 
00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:29.720 align:start position:0%
provide them with more because they
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
understand more what the child may need
 
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
um you know if you're sld you may not
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
get speech and you may not get some of
 
00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:36.680 align:start position:0%
the other pieces whereas you fall under
 
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
the autism category you might they might
 
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
be like oh we know that with this
 
00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:43.079 align:start position:0%
disability you may need more but it all
 
00:16:44.949 --> 00:16:44.959 align:start position:0%
falls back but it all falls back to
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
those need no but that's really what my
 
00:16:47.949 --> 00:16:47.959 align:start position:0%
what my point was that so it could
 
00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
change the the CH it could change
 
00:16:52.389 --> 00:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
slightly yes okay that's really all I
 
00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:55.880 align:start position:0%
was tring the the development delay has
 
00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.189 align:start position:0%
was tring the the development delay has
jumped

00:16:57.189 --> 00:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
jumped
 
00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
significantly uh from when I came on
 
00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
board here about 210,000 kids now we're
 
00:17:03.309 --> 00:17:03.319 align:start position:0%
down to you know how many kids we have
 
00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:06.079 align:start position:0%
in you know let's say 160,000 kids
 
00:17:07.909 --> 00:17:07.919 align:start position:0%
that's a significant drop and I look at
 
00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:10.280 align:start position:0%
the costs or the number of kids that are
 
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
qualifying on DD and then where they are
 
00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:15.839 align:start position:0%
right now are we
 
00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:18.839 align:start position:0%
identifying early early early on now for
 
00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:22.280 align:start position:0%
those that are 10 years and younger um
 
00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:25.079 align:start position:0%
is it necessary to intervene is that a
 
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
maturation issue that's going to by the
 
00:17:29.789 --> 00:17:29.799 align:start position:0%
third grade it's going to be better
 
00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:31.880 align:start position:0%
um what's going on here because that's
 
00:17:33.789 --> 00:17:33.799 align:start position:0%
obviously in a significant
 
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
cost um I think that that it's it's it
 
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
go I would attribute that to that shift
 
00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
um they're not picking a specific
 
00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:42.280 align:start position:0%
disability some of the younger kids they
 
00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:43.960 align:start position:0%
have a lot of things going on they have
 
00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of different difficulties and it
 
00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
may be well we think they might be
 
00:17:48.789 --> 00:17:48.799 align:start position:0%
speech or they might be here and they're
 
00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
showing difficulties here and so this is
 
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
a it's a broader term to be able to say
 
00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to provide them with
 
00:17:56.789 --> 00:17:56.799 align:start position:0%
supports and I would I I mean and then
 
00:17:58.270 --> 00:17:58.280 align:start position:0%
this is all hypothetical I would say
 
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:01.480 align:start position:0%
that the SL dropping may have may be
 
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
because the DD increased because some
 
00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
many of those students are going to then
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
be identified as a specific learning
 
00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
disability but they could also go to
 
00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
other categories like I think it it's a
 
00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:13.919 align:start position:0%
just I really don't think that it's a
 
00:18:13.919 --> 00:18:15.549 align:start position:0%
just I really don't think that it's a
change

00:18:15.549 --> 00:18:15.559 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:18.440 align:start position:0%
in because the numbers are pretty static
 
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:20.200 align:start position:0%
I it's just a change in understanding
 
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
the disabilities and where we are
 
00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
putting students as their
 
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
identified is it the kids are changing
 
00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
or is it that when we're trying to
 
00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
identif ify we're identifying more or
 
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
it's what we've been told to do by our
 
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
training our background
 
00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
um is is this change supported
 
00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
by solid research so are I'm just trying
 
00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
to find out it's it's a cost our our
 
00:18:49.669 --> 00:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
numbers now at the other side there are
 
00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:54.280 align:start position:0%
32,000 kids in this program and back in
 
00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
we're starting up at 30,000 with a whole
 
00:18:59.669 --> 00:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
lot more enrolled kids yeah what's
 
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
causing this this number has
 
00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
changed um I would I do not have any
 
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
data that tells me why it has changed I
 
00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:10.799 align:start position:0%
can tell you that we are are yes they
 
00:19:12.549 --> 00:19:12.559 align:start position:0%
are identifying more students I think it
 
00:19:14.149 --> 00:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
goes back to understanding more about
 
00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:16.600 align:start position:0%
different disabilities um under
 
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
identifying students earlier on than we
 
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
than we had been but I don't have any
 
00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
unfortunately repent McGuire and then
 
00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um you mentioned
 
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
uh the total number of students has
 
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
declined over this period how much how
 
00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
many students were there in alog
 
00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:43.039 align:start position:0%
together in 2000 versus recently um I
 
00:19:44.669 --> 00:19:44.679 align:start position:0%
only have the numbers no this is the
 
00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
number of of students with disabilities
 
00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
disability I mean all of them right I
 
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
don't have that number I don't know if I
 
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
can try and pull yes I can try and pull
 
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
it up real quick for
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you and um May follow up
 
00:20:01.149 --> 00:20:01.159 align:start position:0%
yeah so there are three category three
 
00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:03.080 align:start position:0%
of these big categories that have
 
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
increased autism uh developmental delay
 
00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
and other and then there are three kind
 
00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
of big categories that have declined um
 
00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.029 align:start position:0%
of big categories that have declined um
emotional

00:20:16.029 --> 00:20:16.039 align:start position:0%
emotional
 
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:20.559 align:start position:0%
disturbance um looks like uh SD what's
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
that specific learning and um speech
 
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
speech and language impairment so is it
 
00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:31.000 align:start position:0%
possible that just the methods of of
 
00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
diagnosing have kind of moved somebody
 
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
used to be in speech impairment is now
 
00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
uh you know developmental delay or
 
00:20:41.789 --> 00:20:41.799 align:start position:0%
something like that yes so other health
 
00:20:44.029 --> 00:20:44.039 align:start position:0%
impaired um I I can speak to that one
 
00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:45.919 align:start position:0%
other health impaired encompassed any
 
00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
diagnosis that you might have gotten
 
00:20:49.149 --> 00:20:49.159 align:start position:0%
from a medical doctor so it could be
 
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:52.280 align:start position:0%
ADHD it could have been um anxiety it
 
00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
could have been some of those students
 
00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
that we now identify as um having autism
 
00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
so it that that one is all encompassing
 
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
so it could have moved because so that
 
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
category could easily have moved into a
 
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
more specific diagnosis because it's a
 
00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
very broad category got um and as I said
 
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:11.480 align:start position:0%
the other ones it could be a shift in in
 
00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:13.400 align:start position:0%
how we look at the definitions of and
 
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
how people interpret the definitions of
 
00:21:17.669 --> 00:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
each disability thank you y
 
00:21:19.789 --> 00:21:19.799 align:start position:0%
representative pich and representative
 
00:21:22.269 --> 00:21:22.279 align:start position:0%
Damon is next thank you Mr chair and
 
00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
again thank you for being here and uh
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
helping us in this work you were just
 
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
saying earlier that uh the department
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
does not have any data on the reasons
 
00:21:33.789 --> 00:21:33.799 align:start position:0%
for the shifts in numbers and frankly
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
the right side column seems to be quite
 
00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
static but when considered across the
 
00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:42.200 align:start position:0%
you know drop in overall student
 
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
population it does represent a
 
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
significant percentage increase
 
00:21:49.269 --> 00:21:49.279 align:start position:0%
so given all this I understand that you
 
00:21:51.149 --> 00:21:51.159 align:start position:0%
don't have the data today do you think
 
00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:55.240 align:start position:0%
the department should try to get some
 
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
insight into what is driving this to
 
00:22:00.789 --> 00:22:00.799 align:start position:0%
better inform policy and if so what kind
 
00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:03.320 align:start position:0%
of you know guidance do you need from us
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
as legislators to do it because I
 
00:22:07.549 --> 00:22:07.559 align:start position:0%
remember that you guys can only gather
 
00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
data that we ask you to gather so if you
 
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
feel that there is data that could
 
00:22:15.149 --> 00:22:15.159 align:start position:0%
inform the policy please let us know and
 
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
we'll be happy to tell you to gather it
 
00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:19.640 align:start position:0%
to give you the authority to do so but
 
00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:21.400 align:start position:0%
what are your thoughts on this I'm just
 
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
again we need better data right
 
00:22:25.029 --> 00:22:25.039 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you for the question um
 
00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
that is definitely on our um long list
 
00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
of things that we need to do um I will
 
00:22:32.549 --> 00:22:32.559 align:start position:0%
tell you that we um currently recently
 
00:22:36.669 --> 00:22:36.679 align:start position:0%
hired a new um a new data manager for
 
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
our office and so that should be helping
 
00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:40.360 align:start position:0%
us with doing some of these data pieces
 
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
that we have not been able to do um in
 
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
the past but it is something that we
 
00:22:45.789 --> 00:22:45.799 align:start position:0%
want to do and that we are planning to
 
00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:47.919 align:start position:0%
put into into practice we have all of
 
00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:49.039 align:start position:0%
the data it's just we haven't had
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
somebody who can analyze it and do that
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
until until next
 
00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
Friday no can we represent Damon is is
 
00:22:59.870 --> 00:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for being here to
 
00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:00.669 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for being here to
help

00:23:00.669 --> 00:23:00.679 align:start position:0%
help
 
00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:04.600 align:start position:0%
us so are these
 
00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
categories um standard categories maybe
 
00:23:10.669 --> 00:23:10.679 align:start position:0%
from federal are they the same across
 
00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:13.480 align:start position:0%
all states so the only two that um are
 
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
different to New Hampshire is that
 
00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
states do not have to do devel
 
00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:18.200 align:start position:0%
developmental delay they can choose not
 
00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
to do that um but they do have to Define
 
00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
it if they do it and then we also have
 
00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:25.750 align:start position:0%
it if they do it and then we also have
um

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:28.149 --> 00:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
um acquired brain injury that falls
 
00:23:30.669 --> 00:23:30.679 align:start position:0%
under traumatic brain injury so um we
 
00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
did while it all falls under this TBI
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
category we do have the two pieces in
 
00:23:36.029 --> 00:23:36.039 align:start position:0%
there where we say that it could be a
 
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
traumatic brain injury or an acquired
 
00:23:39.549 --> 00:23:39.559 align:start position:0%
brain injury but but all of these are
 
00:23:41.149 --> 00:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
allowed by federal language and all of
 
00:23:42.909 --> 00:23:42.919 align:start position:0%
these are def defined by federal
 
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
language except for acquired brain
 
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
injury so and following up on
 
00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:50.799 align:start position:0%
representative Luna's remarks a moment
 
00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
ago and your helpful explanation of
 
00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:55.039 align:start position:0%
other health impairment that that's
 
00:23:55.039 --> 00:23:56.470 align:start position:0%
other health impairment that that's
medical

00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
medical
 
00:23:59.149 --> 00:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
diagnosis how are children children
 
00:24:01.269 --> 00:24:01.279 align:start position:0%
recognized as belonging in one of these
 
00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:03.400 align:start position:0%
categories what's the sure
 
00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:05.240 align:start position:0%
identification process so there's a
 
00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
there is a um criteria for assessments
 
00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
that you must do for each of these
 
00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
evaluations I I'll take specific
 
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
learning disability for an example so
 
00:24:14.909 --> 00:24:14.919 align:start position:0%
for that category you would need to do
 
00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
an academic assessment you need to do an
 
00:24:19.149 --> 00:24:19.159 align:start position:0%
intellectual assessment you need to per
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh perform an observation of the child
 
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
within the class and you need to do a
 
00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
hearing hearing and vision screening to
 
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
rule those out as possible um issues
 
00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
with the student so in order to
 
00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
qualify in that category those are the
 
00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:32.200 align:start position:0%
assessments and then each of these
 
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
categories has similar requirements to
 
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
be able to determine if they um if they
 
00:24:39.389 --> 00:24:39.399 align:start position:0%
fall into one of these categories one
 
00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:41.720 align:start position:0%
last short very
 
00:24:44.669 --> 00:24:44.679 align:start position:0%
short so do all children have some form
 
00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:47.720 align:start position:0%
of screening or if not what initiates
 
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
them going through the process you just
 
00:24:51.269 --> 00:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
described and thank you so they are
 
00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
required to go through the eligibility
 
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
process so they're required to have an
 
00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
evaluation and required to have those
 
00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
assessments that I just mentioned for to
 
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
be in special
 
00:25:04.269 --> 00:25:04.279 align:start position:0%
education representative
 
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
fellows just can you give me a little
 
00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:10.360 align:start position:0%
more um description of what
 
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
um special learning disability is a
 
00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
specific learning disability is that um
 
00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:18.440 align:start position:0%
like dyslexia and it could be that
 
00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:20.440 align:start position:0%
there's a re reading disability it could
 
00:25:22.149 --> 00:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
be a math disability it could fall into
 
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
any of those categories where they they
 
00:25:25.549 --> 00:25:25.559 align:start position:0%
have some difficulty with their their
 
00:25:27.789 --> 00:25:27.799 align:start position:0%
ability to learn and so we would assist
 
00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:29.039 align:start position:0%
they would be assisted that way
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
typically reading our math is is where
 
00:25:34.269 --> 00:25:34.279 align:start position:0%
we find those yes y just to follow up on
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
um the question for representative
 
00:25:38.029 --> 00:25:38.039 align:start position:0%
Maguire sure thank you yeah I just
 
00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
looked back at 2000 where this chart
 
00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:42.760 align:start position:0%
starts in 2023 so 2023 I looked at
 
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
public enrollments it was about 167,000
 
00:25:47.909 --> 00:25:47.919 align:start position:0%
back in 2000 it was chairman lad
 
00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned about 210,000 so I quickly did
 
00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:53.240 align:start position:0%
the math about a 25 or 24% decrease from
 
00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:55.240 align:start position:0%
2000 to 2023 in terms of public
 
00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
enrollment just to give perspective on
 
00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:00.110 align:start position:0%
enrollment just to give perspective on
that

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
so so I'll go down to the the end here
 
00:26:06.389 --> 00:26:06.399 align:start position:0%
and then flop back and forth here thank
 
00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:07.880 align:start position:0%
you um just to follow up on
 
00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
representative Damon's question um what
 
00:26:14.389 --> 00:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
triggers that process so the assessment
 
00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
process for a student so um anybody can
 
00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:19.640 align:start position:0%
refer a child for special education so
 
00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
it could be that their parent refers
 
00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:22.360 align:start position:0%
them it could be the classroom teacher
 
00:26:24.909 --> 00:26:24.919 align:start position:0%
refers them um the doctor could say you
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
want to go in and refer your child and
 
00:26:29.029 --> 00:26:29.039 align:start position:0%
then um once the referral you could come
 
00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:30.799 align:start position:0%
in and say my child needs help and and
 
00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
that would be a referral um and within
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
15 days of that referral the district
 
00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
must have a meeting to um disposition
 
00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
the referral to either say yes we see
 
00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:40.360 align:start position:0%
what you're what you're saying we're
 
00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
going to evaluate the child or no we
 
00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:43.480 align:start position:0%
don't think that there's enough
 
00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
information to be able to evaluate the
 
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
child and we have services within the
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
school that we can that are not special
 
00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
ed that we can provide to the child so
 
00:26:52.389 --> 00:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
it goes through the a whole referral
 
00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
process and everything has a timeline
 
00:26:55.549 --> 00:26:55.559 align:start position:0%
once once that happens there's a
 
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
okay you see that was there we're here
 
00:27:08.029 --> 00:27:08.039 align:start position:0%
uh represent copal thank you Mr chairman
 
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
uh thanks for taking my question so um
 
00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
the numbers that jump off the page
 
00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:15.320 align:start position:0%
really are the the First Column autism
 
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
and um understanding that autism is
 
00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
recognized as a spectrum and
 
00:27:22.389 --> 00:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
understanding that people along
 
00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:23.919 align:start position:0%
different points of that Spectrum have
 
00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:26.360 align:start position:0%
very very different needs um do we have
 
00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
any data that would sort of shed light
 
00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:32.200 align:start position:0%
on the distribution along that spectrum
 
00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
and potentially even the change in
 
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
distribution along that Spectrum over
 
00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
time and some of that obviously may be
 
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
um some of that may be related to
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
propensity to to identify that as autism
 
00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
spectrum disorder but I'm just curious
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
whether we have any of that data so that
 
00:27:53.669 --> 00:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
would not be data that we would collect
 
00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
um the only data that might be in um our
 
00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
system the new the uh special education
 
00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
information system might be the results
 
00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
of the evaluation one those evaluations
 
00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:04.360 align:start position:0%
for that child um they might have put in
 
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
that there was a doctor note that said
 
00:28:08.509 --> 00:28:08.519 align:start position:0%
XYZ but we don't have anything that
 
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
would distinguish um the different and
 
00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
you're right it is a broad broad
 
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
spectrum um but we don't have anything
 
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
that would identify where they are in
 
00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:16.830 align:start position:0%
that would identify where they are in
that

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:21.029 --> 00:28:21.039 align:start position:0%
Spectrum follow up yes um so is there is
 
00:28:24.389 --> 00:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
there any quantitative element of that
 
00:28:26.909 --> 00:28:26.919 align:start position:0%
evaluation that could help shed light on
 
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
that if it were uh collected and and
 
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
collated for autism probably not um I
 
00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to remember exactly but I
 
00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
believe for autism it's a doctor a note
 
00:28:41.269 --> 00:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
from your U medical provider and then um
 
00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
an academic evaluation and I know
 
00:28:44.909 --> 00:28:44.919 align:start position:0%
there's and I think it's adaptive
 
00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:46.360 align:start position:0%
Behavior I just can't remember off the
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
top of my head um so there wouldn't be
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
anything that would give us that
 
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
qualitative information you're looking
 
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
for sorry uh going across no there were
 
00:28:55.509 --> 00:28:55.519 align:start position:0%
some hands
 
00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
up representa Ames and then repres
 
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
Burton and then we'll come
 
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
back thank you um so in any given year
 
00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
when I look at this chart going
 
00:29:12.549 --> 00:29:12.559 align:start position:0%
across for the through the multiple
 
00:29:15.669 --> 00:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
categories that are there um one child
 
00:29:17.789 --> 00:29:17.799 align:start position:0%
is only going to show up in one of those
 
00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
categories is that right correct this is
 
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
so a child may have more than one um
 
00:29:23.909 --> 00:29:23.919 align:start position:0%
identified disability but this is their
 
00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:25.960 align:start position:0%
primary disability this is the first one
 
00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:28.120 align:start position:0%
that's listed so you could have a child
 
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
that has multiple disabilities and then
 
00:29:31.789 --> 00:29:31.799 align:start position:0%
their secondary could be speech and
 
00:29:33.269 --> 00:29:33.279 align:start position:0%
language but on this chart we've only
 
00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
done their their primary one so you
 
00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:37.240 align:start position:0%
would only have them on here once well
 
00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
when I think about I've had some
 
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
experience with this as appointed
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
councel for seriously disabled
 
00:29:49.549 --> 00:29:49.559 align:start position:0%
children and um and my time started back
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
in the early time of these numbers um
 
00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:58.120 align:start position:0%
and an autistic child um at that time
 
00:30:00.669 --> 00:30:00.679 align:start position:0%
that I was involved in would have had
 
00:30:03.509 --> 00:30:03.519 align:start position:0%
five or six of these disabilities to the
 
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
right and I'm wondering how the primary
 
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
disability is picked out of the crowd so
 
00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
to speak as and identified as the
 
00:30:15.909 --> 00:30:15.919 align:start position:0%
primary disability sure thank you for
 
00:30:17.669 --> 00:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
the question um that would be the
 
00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
determination of the IEP team or the the
 
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
um eligibility team they would review
 
00:30:24.509 --> 00:30:24.519 align:start position:0%
the evaluations in that meeting and then
 
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
based on the needs and strengths of the
 
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
child they would determine which one is
 
00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
more pervasive for each child so they
 
00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:32.120 align:start position:0%
may say that because of these
 
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
evaluations or what we found we we
 
00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
determined that um your primary
 
00:30:38.669 --> 00:30:38.679 align:start position:0%
disability is specific learning
 
00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
disability um so it's based off of those
 
00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
evaluations and and that IEP team makes
 
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
that determination just a followup uh is
 
00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:48.440 align:start position:0%
that a box that they check off the team
 
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
checks off um kind of primary disability
 
00:30:54.669 --> 00:30:54.679 align:start position:0%
so when you put it into the system you
 
00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
have a drop down it says primary
 
00:30:57.470 --> 00:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
disability and then you have a drop down
 
00:30:59.310 --> 00:30:59.320 align:start position:0%
and you put it in in there so it's kind
 
00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
of a box there's there's more to it
 
00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
though that's a lead into to where it's
 
00:31:06.789 --> 00:31:06.799 align:start position:0%
a great lead in when they have five or
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
six disabilities here IEP categories or
 
00:31:14.149 --> 00:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
that be start dropping down into the
 
00:31:16.629 --> 00:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
special education Aid now how does this
 
00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
relate to catastrophic Aid and then the
 
00:31:23.389 --> 00:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
cost who were those so yeah we we'll get
 
00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:24.760 align:start position:0%
to that because we're GNA cat AIDS
 
00:31:27.149 --> 00:31:27.159 align:start position:0%
coming up but let's I might just comment
 
00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
on that my guess is that uh the mere
 
00:31:34.669 --> 00:31:34.679 align:start position:0%
fact that somebody let's say has an
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
autistic ID does not correlate with any
 
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
particular cost because you got a high
 
00:31:45.549 --> 00:31:45.559 align:start position:0%
level fun high functioning individual
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
who may not have any of the other
 
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
disabilities but is identified over here
 
00:31:53.509 --> 00:31:53.519 align:start position:0%
and another one who has every disability
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
you could think of um and is very high
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
cost and the service are greater exactly
 
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh who was the next one was it represent
 
00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.909 align:start position:0%
uh who was the next one was it represent
Burton

00:32:04.909 --> 00:32:04.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
next yes go go ahead yes
 
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman is this is
 
00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
this being
 
00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:14.799 align:start position:0%
recorded okay I some personal
 
00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:17.240 align:start position:0%
information I won't want to divulge on
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh on camera um I was the chairman of
 
00:32:22.909 --> 00:32:22.919 align:start position:0%
the Community College Consortium on
 
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
autism and
 
00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
individual disabilities nationally uh
 
00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
because the students with autism were
 
00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
showing up at community colleges all
 
00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
over the country and we needed to do
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
something about it there was a hearing
 
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
in Washington called by Senator har uh
 
00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:41.720 align:start position:0%
Harkin of Iowa and they had the Surgeon
 
00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
General of the United States ask asked
 
00:32:47.149 --> 00:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
the question what is autism he didn't
 
00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:50.039 align:start position:0%
know but they know it when they see it
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh I work with Dr
 
00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:54.350 align:start position:0%
uh I work with Dr
uh

00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:58.430 --> 00:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
um from wethy Dr Dan Rosen
 
00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:01.000 align:start position:0%
who was the former president of of
 
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.110 align:start position:0%
who was the former president of of
children's

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:02.120 align:start position:0%
children's
 
00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
hospital he's the formost expert on
 
00:33:07.389 --> 00:33:07.399 align:start position:0%
autism because my faculty at Northshore
 
00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
Community College were having a very
 
00:33:11.549 --> 00:33:11.559 align:start position:0%
hard time with students with
 
00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:14.200 align:start position:0%
autism and he told me it comes in many
 
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
flavors but you know it when you see it
 
00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
because they tend to be asocial uh they
 
00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:21.880 align:start position:0%
tend to have no
 
00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
empathy uh they random range from
 
00:33:29.149 --> 00:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
Aspergers to non functioning people some
 
00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
are not athletic some are it it is a
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
broad category as a representative said
 
00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
but we did a we did two days of training
 
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
for our faculty because they were
 
00:33:42.149 --> 00:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
showing up in great numbers in in
 
00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:45.320 align:start position:0%
classrooms and so it it's not your fault
 
00:33:48.669 --> 00:33:48.679 align:start position:0%
that you don't know what it is but you
 
00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
probably know it when you see it and um
 
00:33:54.789 --> 00:33:54.799 align:start position:0%
there are tests and we use some of them
 
00:33:57.909 --> 00:33:57.919 align:start position:0%
where students were given to do diet
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
Rams and and he showed me the ones from
 
00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
the autistic students and the ones that
 
00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
weren't and and you could tell tell the
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
difference thank you thank you let's go
 
00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
over to representa spillsbury
 
00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
now thank you so I find this census um
 
00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
very interesting and I think it's
 
00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:19.399 align:start position:0%
intriguing that there's been a lot of
 
00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
reclassification and that seems
 
00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
according to what you said to account
 
00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
for the primary uh declines and
 
00:34:28.669 --> 00:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
increases in individual categories
 
00:34:33.069 --> 00:34:33.079 align:start position:0%
what I'm wondering is in respect to the
 
00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
topic this committee has to decide and
 
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
that is how to uh provide State
 
00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
assistance to the districts for the cost
 
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
of of handling a special
 
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
education we we have at least one
 
00:34:50.069 --> 00:34:50.079 align:start position:0%
formulation in front of us that suggests
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
categorization based on time in
 
00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:55.240 align:start position:0%
classroom or time out of
 
00:34:59.230 --> 00:34:59.240 align:start position:0%
District does this kind of
 
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
categorization or some maybe somewhat
 
00:35:04.829 --> 00:35:04.839 align:start position:0%
simplified version of
 
00:35:09.349 --> 00:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
it offer us any kind of a reasonable way
 
00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:13.400 align:start position:0%
of uh assigning tiers of cost or is
 
00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
there so much variation say within
 
00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:19.880 align:start position:0%
individual autism cases or or you know
 
00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:22.280 align:start position:0%
the needs that there's not a sufficient
 
00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:24.520 align:start position:0%
correlation to make that generalization
 
00:35:26.829 --> 00:35:26.839 align:start position:0%
and to assign cost to it in any reliable
 
00:35:29.589 --> 00:35:29.599 align:start position:0%
way is useful or not thank you for the
 
00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:31.839 align:start position:0%
question um this was actually a question
 
00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:33.400 align:start position:0%
representative lad asked me I think two
 
00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:36.280 align:start position:0%
years ago and um it it is hard it would
 
00:35:38.829 --> 00:35:38.839 align:start position:0%
be hard to use this to determine Aid
 
00:35:41.109 --> 00:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
because as we said about autism there is
 
00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:42.680 align:start position:0%
a broad spectrum but there's also a
 
00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:44.680 align:start position:0%
broad spectrum of students with speech
 
00:35:47.589 --> 00:35:47.599 align:start position:0%
um speech impairments they may only need
 
00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:49.400 align:start position:0%
a session a week whereas other people
 
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
are are learning to speak so it's it's
 
00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
hard to go by a disability because all
 
00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
of these disabilities have a broad
 
00:35:58.950 --> 00:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
spectrum from very mild to more severe
 
00:36:00.309 --> 00:36:00.319 align:start position:0%
so it would be harder to do it with
 
00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
these categories so you're confirming
 
00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:05.960 align:start position:0%
what I suspected um we're trying we need
 
00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
to find a way to make a correlation to
 
00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:13.000 align:start position:0%
cost and service intensity and this
 
00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:16.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't get us there
 
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a good thought to keep
 
00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:21.560 align:start position:0%
too uh representa
 
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:25.720 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you so I have the first
 
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
question is really easy um you said that
 
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
what we see on this sheet is their
 
00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:36.200 align:start position:0%
primary uh diagnosis but in the data
 
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
that you collect do you also have a
 
00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
second you know the other second and and
 
00:36:46.589 --> 00:36:46.599 align:start position:0%
the bigger part of your question is when
 
00:36:49.349 --> 00:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
the data you collect does it tell us
 
00:36:52.829 --> 00:36:52.839 align:start position:0%
anything in terms of services that are
 
00:36:55.589 --> 00:36:55.599 align:start position:0%
required by the IEP and do those have
 
00:36:58.270 --> 00:36:58.280 align:start position:0%
standard kind of category
 
00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:00.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so um for the
 
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
first question yes so we have um I I'll
 
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
go back just a little because it will
 
00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
help answer your question work
 
00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:07.160 align:start position:0%
thoroughly we have a New Hampshire
 
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
special education information system and
 
00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
each district is required to put every
 
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
one of these 32,000 students into that
 
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
system and within that system um there
 
00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:18.200 align:start position:0%
are certain pieces they're not required
 
00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
to use it for their IEP but but all but
 
00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
six districts do use it for their IEP
 
00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:23.480 align:start position:0%
and then the other six districts have
 
00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
data points that they must put in there
 
00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:27.640 align:start position:0%
so disabil all of them have to have the
 
00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
disabilities in there so whether it's
 
00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:31.880 align:start position:0%
primary secondary or um tertiary they
 
00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:33.560 align:start position:0%
would have those disabilities in there
 
00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
and then they have to have the services
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
page which provides those services that
 
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
are provided to them so whether it's
 
00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
specially designed instruction speech OT
 
00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:43.720 align:start position:0%
PT it would have all of those on the
 
00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:45.720 align:start position:0%
services page so you would see how many
 
00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:47.720 align:start position:0%
services there are it also tells you if
 
00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
they're in a placement so if they're in
 
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
a separate school or they're in a
 
00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
residential placement it would also tell
 
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
you that those are all required pieces
 
00:37:56.309 --> 00:37:56.319 align:start position:0%
within that system that they must report
 
00:37:59.430 --> 00:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
to us
 
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
so you said something about all except
 
00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
for six districts so as I said we um the
 
00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:07.160 align:start position:0%
system is meant so that you can use it
 
00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:10.040 align:start position:0%
as to develop the IEP and we will print
 
00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:12.200 align:start position:0%
out the IEP in pieces like that there
 
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
are six districts that don't don't take
 
00:38:15.829 --> 00:38:15.839 align:start position:0%
advantage of that they you they put in
 
00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
the data that is supposed to be in there
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
but they don't use it as their IEP
 
00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:21.560 align:start position:0%
system they use another system to write
 
00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:24.079 align:start position:0%
the IEP and then they put the data into
 
00:38:28.349 --> 00:38:28.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
yes all of them have those pieces in
 
00:38:32.589 --> 00:38:32.599 align:start position:0%
there yes we went through that question
 
00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
last year um uh so then in follow up to
 
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
where representative fellows is and
 
00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
going in where spillsbury were um the
 
00:38:44.309 --> 00:38:44.319 align:start position:0%
Bureau of special education support here
 
00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
there's a data fact sheet which we have
 
00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
it's the individuals with disabilities
 
00:38:52.349 --> 00:38:52.359 align:start position:0%
Education Act ID Part B indicator five
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
which is that material that you are
 
00:38:58.910 --> 00:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
required to submit this is time in
 
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
certain category is time served by
 
00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:04.520 align:start position:0%
special education is this
 
00:39:07.589 --> 00:39:07.599 align:start position:0%
required of all the districts and is it
 
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
also required from the Department of
 
00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:11.800 align:start position:0%
Education on the federal level thank you
 
00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
for the question um yes so this is
 
00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:15.800 align:start position:0%
indicator five and there are 18
 
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
indicators that we must report to the
 
00:39:19.589 --> 00:39:19.599 align:start position:0%
federal government annually um and this
 
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
is just one of them we collect all of
 
00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
this for this indicator specifically we
 
00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
collect this data from the special
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
education information system because it
 
00:39:30.349 --> 00:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
ties to that placement and that Services
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
page so it tells us how much they
 
00:39:34.069 --> 00:39:34.079 align:start position:0%
because they have to choose a setting so
 
00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:35.480 align:start position:0%
they may choose a regular education
 
00:39:37.109 --> 00:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
setting or they may choose a special
 
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
education setting so then that tells us
 
00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
how tells us these categories that are
 
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
listed here on the data fact sheet and I
 
00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
I'll just follow quickly because I I
 
00:39:48.109 --> 00:39:48.119 align:start position:0%
need this answer we represent Ames just
 
00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:50.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned well a kid could have all
 
00:39:54.349 --> 00:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
these IEP categories and be in and we
 
00:39:56.829 --> 00:39:56.839 align:start position:0%
put it down underneath this category but
 
00:39:58.870 --> 00:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
is the purpose behind the federal
 
00:40:01.309 --> 00:40:01.319 align:start position:0%
government asking for this information
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
from you and you from the
 
00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
schools is is it related directly to
 
00:40:10.309 --> 00:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
costing of special education for certain
 
00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:13.720 align:start position:0%
students it's Rel um their request of
 
00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
this is to ensure that the students are
 
00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
in the least restrictive environment um
 
00:40:19.309 --> 00:40:19.319 align:start position:0%
available to them so that it's
 
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
calculating um it calculates how many
 
00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:24.200 align:start position:0%
students are in the regular education
 
00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:25.480 align:start position:0%
classroom how many students are in a
 
00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:27.640 align:start position:0%
special education classroom and it's and
 
00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:29.560 align:start position:0%
it makes us aware of their least
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
restrictive environment are are you
 
00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
putting students in a more restrictive
 
00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:35.800 align:start position:0%
environment or are you putting are you
 
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
or is it not are you putting them in a
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
less restrictive environment least
 
00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
restrictive environment is really fuzzy
 
00:40:43.589 --> 00:40:43.599 align:start position:0%
term for me and I was in the business of
 
00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
that and I think it's misinterpreted in
 
00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:47.640 align:start position:0%
many places least restrictive
 
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
environment I want my kid in the
 
00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:51.400 align:start position:0%
classroom all day long it's least
 
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
restrictive environment more aligned
 
00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:54.750 align:start position:0%
restrictive environment more aligned
with

00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:54.760 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:57.640 align:start position:0%
the objectives and the goals of the
 
00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:59.670 align:start position:0%
the objectives and the goals of the
individual

00:40:59.670 --> 00:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
IEP that should
 
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
dictate you know the other social
 
00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:05.800 align:start position:0%
experience I understand and in support
 
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
and recognize but on the other side in
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
the academics this least restrictive
 
00:41:14.309 --> 00:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
environment May hinder a child from
 
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
really gaining the education they need
 
00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
to receive correct and it and it is
 
00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
specific to each child you're providing
 
00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
them with the least restrictive
 
00:41:24.349 --> 00:41:24.359 align:start position:0%
environment for the dis their disability
 
00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
and the needs that they have so each of
 
00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:28.280 align:start position:0%
it should be IND idual eyes to each
 
00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:29.720 align:start position:0%
child to ensure that they're in the
 
00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:31.480 align:start position:0%
least restrictive environment based on
 
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
the knowledge you have of the child
 
00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:36.280 align:start position:0%
thank you go back to questions from the
 
00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
group I think represent Damon and then
 
00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:42.520 align:start position:0%
rep simple I may have Miss wait repr
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
Damon first then
 
00:41:46.349 --> 00:41:46.359 align:start position:0%
you really simple the numbers you gave
 
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
us for total enrollment does that
 
00:41:50.069 --> 00:41:50.079 align:start position:0%
include charter school students or not
 
00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:51.800 align:start position:0%
yes thank you that would include public
 
00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:54.680 align:start position:0%
districts public Charters and uh the
 
00:41:58.870 --> 00:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
cies um so pres Mountain so it's all all
 
00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
public en yes y represent Myan I'm sorry
 
00:42:06.069 --> 00:42:06.079 align:start position:0%
I interrupted um is is there any reason
 
00:42:08.309 --> 00:42:08.319 align:start position:0%
why ADHD is not included on this list of
 
00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
disabilities so ADHD would fall under
 
00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:13.160 align:start position:0%
the other health impairment category so
 
00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
it is it is but it's not been sort of
 
00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
like it's not a it's not a it's not one
 
00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
of the categories provided to us by the
 
00:42:20.349 --> 00:42:20.359 align:start position:0%
federal government but it is recognized
 
00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
under the other health impairment
 
00:42:24.349 --> 00:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
category can I have one one more
 
00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
question I just have one other question
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
with the database that you guys is it
 
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
actually possible to look at the cost
 
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
per student and and make an estimate for
 
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
the districts so um the only cost that
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
we currently have in the system are the
 
00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:38.200 align:start position:0%
costs that they submit for special
 
00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
education Aid we do not have we do not
 
00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
keep track of um costs in general we
 
00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
only keep track of what they submit to
 
00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
us so that they can ask for special
 
00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:51.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:58.030 --> 00:42:58.040 align:start position:0%
year yes represent bricky so uh um so we
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
collect indicator 5 we collect that
 
00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
information on indicator 5 so by
 
00:43:08.309 --> 00:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
District so we would know if we we would
 
00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
know in terms of C cost um indicator 5A
 
00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:18.040 align:start position:0%
would probably be less than 5B less than
 
00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:22.640 align:start position:0%
5 C on average so if we were looking to
 
00:43:26.109 --> 00:43:26.119 align:start position:0%
tier it could we
 
00:43:29.829 --> 00:43:29.839 align:start position:0%
then use these
 
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
indicators that is in one of the bills
 
00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
uh it's just then how much do you cost
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
those tiers out as is the issue is it
 
00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
within differentiated Aid and it's under
 
00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:43.960 align:start position:0%
the indicator 58 I'm sorry
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
I so we it's not this bill though okay
 
00:43:49.109 --> 00:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
yeah so we do collect that data actually
 
00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
at the student level so we have to
 
00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
report how many students are in each of
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
these categories so I could tell you
 
00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
Sally Smith H is in such and such a
 
00:43:59.349 --> 00:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
category but we then we disagre it to to
 
00:44:01.829 --> 00:44:01.839 align:start position:0%
district and then State okay
 
00:44:04.589 --> 00:44:04.599 align:start position:0%
thanks there was a sheet that you
 
00:44:14.109 --> 00:44:14.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
from which which that that sheet was
 
00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:19.640 align:start position:0%
used when we were trying to come up with
 
00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
this in a previous year so it's dated by
 
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
year but it's very similar to what it is
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
now it breaks down the number of
 
00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
students in C a b and c it's it's a
 
00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
information where are the questions
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
right now represent
 
00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:39.720 align:start position:0%
luno thanks very much Mr chair so um so
 
00:44:41.549 --> 00:44:41.559 align:start position:0%
you you just brought up um special
 
00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
education Aid what do what did districts
 
00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
provide um the department uh in order to
 
00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
um put in their requests for sure so
 
00:44:54.109 --> 00:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
during the year um they have to put in
 
00:44:56.309 --> 00:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
invoices into the system and then tell
 
00:44:59.309 --> 00:44:59.319 align:start position:0%
us um and and tell us what services it
 
00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
was for so if the student received
 
00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
speech and language Services they they
 
00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
put that in and then they they say that
 
00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
they they put a sorry they give us a um
 
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
a invoice for those services and then
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
when we get those so they put all those
 
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
in and we keep track until and the
 
00:45:17.829 --> 00:45:17.839 align:start position:0%
system will tell us when they get to cap
 
00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
so right now it's three and a half time
 
00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
so once it gets to cap then beyond that
 
00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:24.280 align:start position:0%
it will we we know these 10 students it
 
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
says they have reached cap but in July
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
through December we take all of those
 
00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
invoices and then we compare them to the
 
00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
students IEP and we say you provided
 
00:45:35.069 --> 00:45:35.079 align:start position:0%
them three speech units each week but in
 
00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
their IEP it only says they receive two
 
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
speech units so we correlate that and
 
00:45:40.109 --> 00:45:40.119 align:start position:0%
say well then we're only going to pay
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
you for the two speech units because
 
00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:43.720 align:start position:0%
that's when then it's in their IEP but
 
00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
they do have to provide us with the
 
00:45:47.349 --> 00:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
actual invoice that they paid for that
 
00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
service that correlates to the the
 
00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:51.400 align:start position:0%
students IEP okay and so just to make
 
00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
sure I under I I heard what you said y
 
00:45:57.829 --> 00:45:57.839 align:start position:0%
um it's a it's an invoice for service
 
00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
connected to a student so with a assd or
 
00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
something like that and and then and
 
00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's entered in at the at the
 
00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:09.640 align:start position:0%
department and then the the district can
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
enters that in say that again the
 
00:46:13.549 --> 00:46:13.559 align:start position:0%
district ENT the district entri enters
 
00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
that in to to the system yeah to your
 
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
system and and uh and then and then and
 
00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:23.800 align:start position:0%
then the department Compares all of
 
00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
these against the IEP to make sure that
 
00:46:29.109 --> 00:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
that these were all you know Services
 
00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
consistent with with the IEP and is
 
00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:37.720 align:start position:0%
there is there any does I guess does the
 
00:46:42.349 --> 00:46:42.359 align:start position:0%
department critique the IEP at all or
 
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
critique a cost for a for a service for
 
00:46:48.109 --> 00:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
and and I'm just saying for example for
 
00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:51.880 align:start position:0%
example the um the department of U New
 
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's insurance department keeps
 
00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
uh keeps track of all the cost of all
 
00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:57.349 align:start position:0%
uh keeps track of all the cost of all
procedures

00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
00:46:59.109 --> 00:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
and and it can calculate the average
 
00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:01.880 align:start position:0%
cost of all procedures and that database
 
00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
is used by insurance carriers to you
 
00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
know when they negotiate you know you
 
00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:09.800 align:start position:0%
know with with service providers and
 
00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
things like that so so would you does
 
00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
the department also know what the cost
 
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
procedures for procedure is and what the
 
00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:19.640 align:start position:0%
average cost and what the extremes are
 
00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:21.800 align:start position:0%
stuff like that so we wouldn't um we
 
00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
have the data we have not disaggregated
 
00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
it to be able to tell you um the
 
00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:27.800 align:start position:0%
different pieces um we do look at look
 
00:47:29.109 --> 00:47:29.119 align:start position:0%
at everything and make sure that it's
 
00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
allowable so while we also say does it
 
00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
correlate to two Services three services
 
00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:35.720 align:start position:0%
we also um ensure that this is something
 
00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:37.480 align:start position:0%
that you can pay for with your federal
 
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
Ida funds or your state funds and it
 
00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
meets federal and state regulations if
 
00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
you put something in there that um you
 
00:47:45.309 --> 00:47:45.319 align:start position:0%
know we're going to pay for you know a
 
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
bike trip across the United States we'd
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
be like that's that's not an allowable
 
00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
expense that's great that you wanted to
 
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
put it in the students IEP you're trying
 
00:47:53.549 --> 00:47:53.559 align:start position:0%
to support them but it's not an
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
allowable expense so we ALS so while we
 
00:47:57.710 --> 00:47:57.720 align:start position:0%
ALS make sure that it align the IEP we
 
00:48:00.589 --> 00:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
also make sure that it's an allowable
 
00:48:02.829 --> 00:48:02.839 align:start position:0%
expense does that answer your question
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
okay thank I thought you're going to go
 
00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
further with that if I may yeah actually
 
00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
I I was I didn't the cost per
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
service may be in his district or her
 
00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
District very very different yes does
 
00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
the cost per service do you give any
 
00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:24.440 align:start position:0%
information out to them where say you're
 
00:48:27.069 --> 00:48:27.079 align:start position:0%
this is too expensive for delivery of
 
00:48:29.790 --> 00:48:29.800 align:start position:0%
speech two times a week or whatever it
 
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
might be uh do you have anything that
 
00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:36.200 align:start position:0%
this is what we you know see as maybe an
 
00:48:39.589 --> 00:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
average cost or are we having to deliver
 
00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:42.440 align:start position:0%
these services in colbrook at a higher
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
cost than we are in
 
00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
Rochester so while I will tell you we
 
00:48:48.349 --> 00:48:48.359 align:start position:0%
notice that there is a large difference
 
00:48:50.589 --> 00:48:50.599 align:start position:0%
between some costs we do not currently
 
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
um disaggregate that data and and then
 
00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:54.520 align:start position:0%
report to districts this is higher than
 
00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
what you should be paying or what lower
 
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
than what you should be paying
 
00:49:00.069 --> 00:49:00.079 align:start position:0%
so we do not currently do that so
 
00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
where's the oversight come then to
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
determine whether this is an appropriate
 
00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
cost that you're being asked to
 
00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
reimburse this for so it goes back to is
 
00:49:11.109 --> 00:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
it allowable and is it um it does it
 
00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
align to the IEP is it an allowable
 
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
expense according to Ida is this
 
00:49:16.309 --> 00:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
something that you can provide to the
 
00:49:19.069 --> 00:49:19.079 align:start position:0%
child and then does it align to the IEP
 
00:49:21.069 --> 00:49:21.079 align:start position:0%
but we don't have anything where we say
 
00:49:23.109 --> 00:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
the cost is too high or too low or we
 
00:49:25.150 --> 00:49:25.160 align:start position:0%
don't and we don't average the cost we
 
00:49:29.589 --> 00:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
don't do any of that so so Mr chair yes
 
00:49:32.109 --> 00:49:32.119 align:start position:0%
yeah him first and then you yeah so
 
00:49:34.829 --> 00:49:34.839 align:start position:0%
thanks for that was the the question
 
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
that that I think made a lot of sense to
 
00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
ask right there and um and I it sounds
 
00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:43.640 align:start position:0%
like you're you're creating a little
 
00:49:47.069 --> 00:49:47.079 align:start position:0%
maybe u u uh a parking lot or or a
 
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
bucket of of potential things we want to
 
00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:53.720 align:start position:0%
want to dig into but with something like
 
00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
what the insurance department has I
 
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
think they call it the claims data base
 
00:49:59.789 --> 00:49:59.799 align:start position:0%
would that be something that that could
 
00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
be useful for for the Department um down
 
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
the road in terms of being able to to
 
00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
look at how these costs are and how
 
00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
these services are delivered yes it
 
00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
would be useful I would most likely need
 
00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
more staff to be able to do that though
 
00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
so y because the data is there it's just
 
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't have the staff or the
 
00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
capacity to be able to say this is the
 
00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:22.280 align:start position:0%
average cost this is the high this is
 
00:50:24.349 --> 00:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
the low it's but it's let me clarify
 
00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
it's only there for special education
 
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
Aid and is not there if you don't submit
 
00:50:31.870 --> 00:50:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:35.950 --> 00:50:35.960 align:start position:0%
Aid represent thank you um so along
 
00:50:37.950 --> 00:50:37.960 align:start position:0%
these lines if a school district uh
 
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:39.720 align:start position:0%
rents a building for alternative for an
 
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
alternative program for a group of their
 
00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
special education students are they
 
00:50:45.789 --> 00:50:45.799 align:start position:0%
allowed to include the rental the rent
 
00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:47.240 align:start position:0%
that they have to pay for that
 
00:50:50.069 --> 00:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
Alternative Program classroom um and
 
00:50:51.549 --> 00:50:51.559 align:start position:0%
divide it out by the number of students
 
00:50:53.589 --> 00:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
that's there to submit in so an
 
00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:55.400 align:start position:0%
alternative program would be a regular
 
00:50:58.789 --> 00:50:58.799 align:start position:0%
education um f um placement because
 
00:51:00.309 --> 00:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
alternative programs are not special
 
00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:01.480 align:start position:0%
education they're under regular
 
00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
education and no they would not be able
 
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
to put their rent it has to tied
 
00:51:07.109 --> 00:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
directly to the services in the IEP for
 
00:51:09.549 --> 00:51:09.559 align:start position:0%
the child what happens if it's King
 
00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:11.839 align:start position:0%
Street King Street is a is an
 
00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:13.480 align:start position:0%
alternative program with an approved
 
00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
special education program within it so
 
00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:18.200 align:start position:0%
they have to so so they they have an
 
00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
alternative program they take any kids
 
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
in that program and then we have we have
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
gone in and said yes you can have
 
00:51:25.470 --> 00:51:25.480 align:start position:0%
special education students within that
 
00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
program can you tell me because I
 
00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
believe Hillsboro Dearing is in the
 
00:51:31.589 --> 00:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
alternative program and I believe they
 
00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
have that running through special
 
00:51:35.589 --> 00:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
education so um according to state law
 
00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:37.880 align:start position:0%
they must be must submit an alternative
 
00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
plan to the um the school approval
 
00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:42.760 align:start position:0%
office and has to be approved by their
 
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
school board and then once they have an
 
00:51:46.589 --> 00:51:46.599 align:start position:0%
alternative program we can approve a
 
00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
special education program within that
 
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
alternative program but alternative
 
00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
programs don't live in my office they're
 
00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
not just for special education students
 
00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
one more yes so given the they've been
 
00:51:58.470 --> 00:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
approved and it's been a program that
 
00:52:00.109 --> 00:52:00.119 align:start position:0%
has been approved can they then take
 
00:52:01.789 --> 00:52:01.799 align:start position:0%
that rent and divide it by the number of
 
00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
students that are in that program for
 
00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:05.480 align:start position:0%
that location no because it doesn't tie
 
00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:06.760 align:start position:0%
back to the services that are in the
 
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
students IEP thank
 
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
you represent representa am and
 
00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:13.109 align:start position:0%
you represent representa am and
representative

00:52:13.109 --> 00:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:17.240 align:start position:0%
Fells or is yours tied to this or which
 
00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
is the better go
 
00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
first pardon
 
00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
me I can't hear it I can't hear you it's
 
00:52:27.069 --> 00:52:27.079 align:start position:0%
a tiny question I just wanted to to know
 
00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
so we know that the cost related to
 
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
students that are not going to apply for
 
00:52:36.829 --> 00:52:36.839 align:start position:0%
special education Aid are generally not
 
00:52:39.549 --> 00:52:39.559 align:start position:0%
in there but do do we have things that
 
00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
say like speech speech and language
 
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
pathology for two hours a week do we
 
00:52:48.109 --> 00:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
have all the the services are in there

32,000 kids are in in the system
representes

00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
representes
 
00:52:59.430 --> 00:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
yeah um this is about the costs
 
00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:01.880 align:start position:0%
disapproved because they're not in the
 
00:53:04.789 --> 00:53:04.799 align:start position:0%
IEP um can you give us a sense of the
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
magnit relative magnitude of uh the
 
00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:09.640 align:start position:0%
disapprovals you know relative to the
 
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
total it's asked
 
00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
for I I don't have the chart in front of
 
00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
me but it it's it is small it's not I
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
would say that it's a very small
 
00:53:20.109 --> 00:53:20.119 align:start position:0%
percentage of the the what we approve
 
00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
and what we provide to to um to the
 
00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
districts it was in the presentation
 
00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
that I had done for um um the
 
00:53:29.349 --> 00:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
legislature at the department and I
 
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
could try to pull that up at some point
 
00:53:31.829 --> 00:53:31.839 align:start position:0%
for you but I don't have the numbers
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
right in front of me right now but it is
 
00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
percentage can I follow up to represent
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
Ames repres Ames if I'm in a district
 
00:53:44.789 --> 00:53:44.799 align:start position:0%
that's a rural district and I cannot
 
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
find a speech
 
00:53:51.549 --> 00:53:51.559 align:start position:0%
pathologist and and the only place I can
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
find one is a contracted service out of
 
00:53:58.470 --> 00:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
conquer is the transportation for that
 
00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
person to get to and from my school
 
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
district part of the reimbursement that
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
they're going to get if it's going to
 
00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
add up into this special education Aid
 
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
category it would the only and I'll go
 
00:54:13.349 --> 00:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
back to if if it's not in the students
 
00:54:15.309 --> 00:54:15.319 align:start position:0%
IEP then it's not paid for we will only
 
00:54:16.990 --> 00:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
pay for the speech and language services
 
00:54:19.309 --> 00:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
that are provided to the child which are
 
00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
from a person which we can hire in
 
00:54:23.549 --> 00:54:23.559 align:start position:0%
conquered years ago you used to
 
00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:25.839 align:start position:0%
reimburse us for that you're not doing
 
00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
that anymore we will only reimburse you
 
00:54:29.069 --> 00:54:29.079 align:start position:0%
for something that is tied to the
 
00:54:29.079 --> 00:54:29.990 align:start position:0%
for something that is tied to the
child's

00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
child's
 
00:54:32.349 --> 00:54:32.359 align:start position:0%
IEP would the
 
00:54:35.230 --> 00:54:35.240 align:start position:0%
transort but you're not so let me
 
00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
clarify are you talking about the
 
00:54:37.789 --> 00:54:37.799 align:start position:0%
transportation for the speech
 
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
pathologist or the transportation for
 
00:54:42.069 --> 00:54:42.079 align:start position:0%
the student the the charge I'm going to
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
get from the speech well the child's
 
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
going to stay at school right so there's
 
00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
no Transportation there other than what
 
00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:48.920 align:start position:0%
we provide by the school bus to and
 
00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
throw in the morning or afternoon it's
 
00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
for that therapist the one with the the
 
00:54:59.030 --> 00:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
Seas to come up to wherever you're
 
00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:03.200 align:start position:0%
going it's just the what's in the
 
00:55:06.430 --> 00:55:06.440 align:start position:0%
IEP so what if the contracted service is
 
00:55:08.549 --> 00:55:08.559 align:start position:0%
building that cost in are you going to
 
00:55:11.829 --> 00:55:11.839 align:start position:0%
approve that on the invoice we send you
 
00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:14.440 align:start position:0%
for reimbursement if they've built it in
 
00:55:17.109 --> 00:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
um it would say that the unit this unit
 
00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:19.720 align:start position:0%
cost $150 for the unit they may have
 
00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:21.640 align:start position:0%
built in the transportation cost but we
 
00:55:23.349 --> 00:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
wouldn't pay for it separately it would
 
00:55:24.589 --> 00:55:24.599 align:start position:0%
have to be part of the cost that's
 
00:55:29.950 --> 00:55:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:32.069 --> 00:55:32.079 align:start position:0%
I I'm I'm a little bit lost here on this
 
00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
because I heard I heard dick or
 
00:55:36.029 --> 00:55:36.039 align:start position:0%
represent Ames over here just mentioned
 
00:55:38.309 --> 00:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
so it's got to be in the I AP but how do
 
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
you know it's going to be in the IP when
 
00:55:41.789 --> 00:55:41.799 align:start position:0%
you're writing this at the IP meeting
 
00:55:43.390 --> 00:55:43.400 align:start position:0%
you're you're you're saying this child
 
00:55:47.109 --> 00:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
needs Speech Pathology yep where you get
 
00:55:50.069 --> 00:55:50.079 align:start position:0%
it you might get it online from
 
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
California uh so I'm concerned that you
 
00:55:57.069 --> 00:55:57.079 align:start position:0%
know it's it's a cost which the school
 
00:55:59.950 --> 00:55:59.960 align:start position:0%
district ends up having a cough up for
 
00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:01.190 align:start position:0%
district ends up having a cough up for
the

00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:56:04.829 --> 00:56:04.839 align:start position:0%
service uh if it gets into this well for
 
00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
reimbursement and Cat Aid
 
00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
it's I I don't know if you have an
 
00:56:12.069 --> 00:56:12.079 align:start position:0%
answer for that
 
00:56:14.710 --> 00:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
but the IEP is not supposed to be based
 
00:56:16.109 --> 00:56:16.119 align:start position:0%
on how much it's going to cost it's
 
00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
supposed to be based on the students
 
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
needs and so that IEP team is looking at
 
00:56:21.029 --> 00:56:21.039 align:start position:0%
what does this child need they need
 
00:56:23.829 --> 00:56:23.839 align:start position:0%
speech path Speech Pathology and then
 
00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
the district has to determine how
 
00:56:26.349 --> 00:56:26.359 align:start position:0%
they're going to get that speech
 
00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
pathology so you wouldn't discuss those
 
00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
financial pieces within that IEP team
 
00:56:32.630 --> 00:56:32.640 align:start position:0%
meeting and yes it we are finding that
 
00:56:34.270 --> 00:56:34.280 align:start position:0%
districts are paying for somebody to
 
00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
come from conquered to to come north or
 
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
paying for different things because they
 
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
are having difficulty finding that but
 
00:56:41.309 --> 00:56:41.319 align:start position:0%
that's not a discussion that you have in
 
00:56:42.990 --> 00:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
the IEP meeting because you're just
 
00:56:45.029 --> 00:56:45.039 align:start position:0%
determining they need this many speech
 
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
units well when I have an i AP meeting
 
00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm Des deciding this child needs a
 
00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
48 week delivery of services I'm going
 
00:56:54.990 --> 00:56:55.000 align:start position:0%
into the summer months so that means
 
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
there's going to have to be labor for
 
00:56:59.910 --> 00:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
for that program mhm and the and the
 
00:57:01.950 --> 00:57:01.960 align:start position:0%
district has to pay for that
 
00:57:04.069 --> 00:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
MH I don't understand why they wouldn't
 
00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
pay for the transportation then from
 
00:57:07.589 --> 00:57:07.599 align:start position:0%
conquered up to you know as part of this
 
00:57:07.599 --> 00:57:09.630 align:start position:0%
conquered up to you know as part of this
program

00:57:09.630 --> 00:57:09.640 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
I it doesn't connect with me Mr chairman
 
00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
yes so I would guess if you're a speech
 
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
pathologist in conquered and you're
 
00:57:19.230 --> 00:57:19.240 align:start position:0%
giving somebody an hour's worth of
 
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
treatment that you charge say $100 right
 
00:57:24.549 --> 00:57:24.559 align:start position:0%
but if you're if the treatment is in
 
00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
Plymouth and and I have and the
 
00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:28.760 align:start position:0%
pathologist has to drive then they would
 
00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
say okay that's $200 you see what I mean
 
00:57:33.630 --> 00:57:33.640 align:start position:0%
and the bill would be for $200 and they
 
00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
would pay the $200 right so it' be built
 
00:57:39.029 --> 00:57:39.039 align:start position:0%
into the bill of the person of the
 
00:57:40.750 --> 00:57:40.760 align:start position:0%
provider who's traveling probably it
 
00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:43.480 align:start position:0%
just made my case that there the the
 
00:57:45.950 --> 00:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for that particular
 
00:57:48.190 --> 00:57:48.200 align:start position:0%
service is going to be different from
 
00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
District to diff District absolutely yes
 
00:57:57.630 --> 00:57:57.640 align:start position:0%
and we're not doing that we're not no
 
00:58:00.829 --> 00:58:00.839 align:start position:0%
well we're paying it yes we're not
 
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
tracking it but we are paying it yeah
 
00:58:05.029 --> 00:58:05.039 align:start position:0%
yeah M Mr chair just on on that exact
 
00:58:07.470 --> 00:58:07.480 align:start position:0%
same line though if the if the if the
 
00:58:09.309 --> 00:58:09.319 align:start position:0%
bill for service from the speech
 
00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:12.280 align:start position:0%
pathologist contained two line items
 
00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
Speech Pathology you know one hour
 
00:58:17.069 --> 00:58:17.079 align:start position:0%
session with the with the student uh and
 
00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:20.440 align:start position:0%
then line two Transportation one hour
 
00:58:23.109 --> 00:58:23.119 align:start position:0%
for a total of $200 you know $100 each
 
00:58:26.270 --> 00:58:26.280 align:start position:0%
line would you pay the would you would
 
00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:28.520 align:start position:0%
you approve the $200 or would you
 
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
exclude the um the line two if it's
 
00:58:33.309 --> 00:58:33.319 align:start position:0%
listed separately from the hourly rate
 
00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
for the Speech Pathology it would not be
 
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
paid it would only be paid for this for
 
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:38.960 align:start position:0%

00:59:19.549 --> 00:59:19.559 align:start position:0%
to clarify some of these questions
 
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
around the speech and language cost
 
00:59:24.670 --> 00:59:24.680 align:start position:0%
specifically or other related Services
 
00:59:28.349 --> 00:59:28.359 align:start position:0%
the school as Miss fet said the IEP team
 
00:59:30.029 --> 00:59:30.039 align:start position:0%
is supposed to make decisions based on
 
00:59:33.029 --> 00:59:33.039 align:start position:0%
the student without to some extent
 
00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
consideration for the financial impact
 
00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
to the district that is the base of
 
00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
creating an IEP that is individualized
 
00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:40.670 align:start position:0%
creating an IEP that is individualized
for

00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
students the district then as Miss fet
 
00:59:45.349 --> 00:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
said has to figure out how to provide
 
00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
those Services where to provide them Etc
 
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
if the district cannot doesn't have a
 
00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
district employee for example like a
 
00:59:53.230 --> 00:59:53.240 align:start position:0%
speech and language pathologist I'll
 
00:59:54.710 --> 00:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
stick with that example because it's
 
00:59:57.029 --> 00:59:57.039 align:start position:0%
very accurate and
 
00:59:59.349 --> 00:59:59.359 align:start position:0%
the district has to seek out somebody to
 
01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
provide those services that meets the
 
01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
qualifications that are needed for that
 
01:00:04.789 --> 01:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
service that may mean that the district
 
01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
has a contract with an outside provider
 
01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
which I think is what many of you are
 
01:00:10.109 --> 01:00:10.119 align:start position:0%
talking about that is a contract that is
 
01:00:11.549 --> 01:00:11.559 align:start position:0%
between the school district the school
 
01:00:14.190 --> 01:00:14.200 align:start position:0%
board and the provider those contracts
 
01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
look very different depending on the
 
01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
types of Provider if it is a tella
 
01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
health model or a person that's driving
 
01:00:23.349 --> 01:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
from you know a different state or a
 
01:00:25.390 --> 01:00:25.400 align:start position:0%
different town to come to provide those
 
01:00:27.829 --> 01:00:27.839 align:start position:0%
services the only services that the
 
01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
department is counting towards the cap
 
01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
for special education aid for example
 
01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
are the is the hourly rate for that
 
01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
person for example that is providing
 
01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
whatever is in that student's IEP some
 
01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
contracts between districts may say
 
01:00:44.029 --> 01:00:44.039 align:start position:0%
we're going to roll all of this Contra
 
01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
contracted provids costs into an hourly
 
01:00:48.829 --> 01:00:48.839 align:start position:0%
rate and that's the hourly rate some
 
01:00:51.630 --> 01:00:51.640 align:start position:0%
contracts have travel expenses separated
 
01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:53.359 align:start position:0%
out from their hourly rate for Direct
 
01:00:56.029 --> 01:00:56.039 align:start position:0%
Services it just depends on the contract
 
01:00:57.349 --> 01:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
but the only thing the district is
 
01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
getting to count towards the cap is the
 
01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
Direct Services that are called out in
 
01:01:05.789 --> 01:01:05.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
IEP yes yes represent
 
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.990 align:start position:0%
IEP yes yes represent
Damon

01:01:10.990 --> 01:01:11.000 align:start position:0%
Damon
 
01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
yeah all of you so then Can a
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
district uh
 
01:01:21.549 --> 01:01:21.559 align:start position:0%
ethically say to a contracted provider
 
01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:25.240 align:start position:0%
who is billing for their services with
 
01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
transportation build
 
01:01:30.549 --> 01:01:30.559 align:start position:0%
separately can they say if you put this
 
01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
as one bundled rate we will get better
 
01:01:36.029 --> 01:01:36.039 align:start position:0%
reimbursement thank you for the question
 
01:01:37.390 --> 01:01:37.400 align:start position:0%
representative the provider didn't
 
01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
figure it out themselves
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
I there are lots of different providers
 
01:01:46.309 --> 01:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
currently for related services that
 
01:01:48.670 --> 01:01:48.680 align:start position:0%
includes OT PT nursing speech and
 
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
language Transportation all kinds of
 
01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
contracts that your districts are trying
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
to coordinate I don't
 
01:02:00.829 --> 01:02:00.839 align:start position:0%
know many contracted providers whose um
 
01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
primary goal is to ensure that districts
 
01:02:04.990 --> 01:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
are getting the best reimbursement rate
 
01:02:07.829 --> 01:02:07.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:12.269 --> 01:02:12.279 align:start position:0%
Aid one more yes thank you and for any
 
01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
of you what happens if a district simply
 
01:02:21.069 --> 01:02:21.079 align:start position:0%
cannot find a provider contracted or in
 
01:02:24.309 --> 01:02:24.319 align:start position:0%
house to provide a service that is
 
01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
needed and is in the child's EP thank
 
01:02:29.309 --> 01:02:29.319 align:start position:0%
you for the question
 
01:02:32.029 --> 01:02:32.039 align:start position:0%
um the district is obligated to provide
 
01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
that service there are times where that
 
01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
is just not something that can happen in
 
01:02:38.309 --> 01:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
that moment because maybe there are not
 
01:02:40.750 --> 01:02:40.760 align:start position:0%
providers exam for example uh the
 
01:02:42.549 --> 01:02:42.559 align:start position:0%
district would then be responsible for
 
01:02:45.069 --> 01:02:45.079 align:start position:0%
compensatory Services down the road when
 
01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
they can find those or to somehow work
 
01:02:49.990 --> 01:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
with the family to figure out a way to
 
01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
reimburse the family to go get those
 
01:02:52.990 --> 01:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
Services if there was some other way to
 
01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
do that that's an agreement between the
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
district and the family about how those
 
01:02:59.029 --> 01:02:59.039 align:start position:0%
services are going to be provided at
 
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
some point they are on the hook for
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:05.549 --> 01:03:05.559 align:start position:0%
regardless okay I'm going to go to
 
01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:07.880 align:start position:0%
representative papovich over there then
 
01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
then I'm going to try to start shifting
 
01:03:11.549 --> 01:03:11.559 align:start position:0%
us to a little bit more on the special
 
01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
education a yes and this is just a
 
01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
clarification question thank you Mr
 
01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
chairman and again thank you for for
 
01:03:21.069 --> 01:03:21.079 align:start position:0%
being here I just want to confirm that I
 
01:03:22.750 --> 01:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
understood correctly that when we are
 
01:03:24.349 --> 01:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
talking about the actual cost of
 
01:03:24.359 --> 01:03:26.190 align:start position:0%
talking about the actual cost of
services

01:03:26.190 --> 01:03:26.200 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
assuming that there is an itemized
 
01:03:30.190 --> 01:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
invoice the department would only
 
01:03:32.109 --> 01:03:32.119 align:start position:0%
consider the actual cost of services to
 
01:03:35.069 --> 01:03:35.079 align:start position:0%
be allowable while if the same provider
 
01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:37.160 align:start position:0%
would choose to Bill to include their
 
01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
travel costs into their hourly rate per
 
01:03:41.950 --> 01:03:41.960 align:start position:0%
Services then that would lead to the
 
01:03:44.069 --> 01:03:44.079 align:start position:0%
department having to consider that
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
allowable because they don't necessarily
 
01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
know that it includes travel costs I
 
01:03:49.510 --> 01:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure I understand the
 
01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
status quo yes that is correct because
 
01:03:53.549 --> 01:03:53.559 align:start position:0%
we do not have the contract that they
 
01:03:55.109 --> 01:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
may have may have made with that service
 
01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
provider so if they made a contract with
 
01:03:58.750 --> 01:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
a speech pathologist and they said we're
 
01:04:00.190 --> 01:04:00.200 align:start position:0%
going to put it all into that hourly
 
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
rate we don't have that contract to be
 
01:04:03.549 --> 01:04:03.559 align:start position:0%
able to look at that but the in we only
 
01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:06.520 align:start position:0%
get the invoice that shows us what um
 
01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
what what was paid for thank you so much
 
01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:11.400 align:start position:0%
okay one question here and then we will
 
01:04:14.309 --> 01:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
move in a different direction or similar
 
01:04:16.670 --> 01:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
Direction similar so thank you thank you
 
01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:18.069 align:start position:0%
Direction similar so thank you thank you
uh

01:04:18.069 --> 01:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:21.400 align:start position:0%
so this is sort of for both of you um or
 
01:04:25.390 --> 01:04:25.400 align:start position:0%
all three of you um if you couldn't get
 
01:04:28.109 --> 01:04:28.119 align:start position:0%
if the district couldn't get services
 
01:04:31.589 --> 01:04:31.599 align:start position:0%
and they had to reimburse the family
 
01:04:34.829 --> 01:04:34.839 align:start position:0%
would that count would you would the
 
01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
state then reimburse the district for
 
01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:40.640 align:start position:0%
reimbursing the family if they had the
 
01:04:42.789 --> 01:04:42.799 align:start position:0%
documentation of it it would definitely
 
01:04:45.230 --> 01:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
be several conversations and um
 
01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
providing documentation so that we could
 
01:04:48.390 --> 01:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
say yes we understand why you had to do
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
it this way um and then we would yes
 
01:04:52.990 --> 01:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
reimburse them but it would it wouldn't
 
01:04:54.829 --> 01:04:54.839 align:start position:0%
just be oh yeah yeah we'll do that it
 
01:04:56.870 --> 01:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
would be would be several conversations
 
01:04:58.950 --> 01:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
and then some docu lots of documentation
 
01:05:03.230 --> 01:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
to show why it was like that thank you I
 
01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
also just want to clarify that when
 
01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:07.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking about reimbursing the
 
01:05:10.029 --> 01:05:10.039 align:start position:0%
district all that the costs that are
 
01:05:12.549 --> 01:05:12.559 align:start position:0%
being confirmed by the department are
 
01:05:14.829 --> 01:05:14.839 align:start position:0%
really to try to look at whether or not
 
01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
that particular case meets the cap for
 
01:05:19.069 --> 01:05:19.079 align:start position:0%
special ed Aid it's not about
 
01:05:21.990 --> 01:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
reimbursing for Individual Services it's
 
01:05:24.549 --> 01:05:24.559 align:start position:0%
about what number you're putting into
 
01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
the pot to see what whether or not the
 
01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
case hits the cap of the three and a
 
01:05:29.309 --> 01:05:29.319 align:start position:0%
half or the 10
 
01:05:31.710 --> 01:05:31.720 align:start position:0%
times so the service that you're looking
 
01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:33.839 align:start position:0%
at you know let's say it's an $80,000
 
01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
cost to the district well you're going
 
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
to pay the $770,000 then you take the
 
01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
remaining 10 and take 20% of that that
 
01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:45.839 align:start position:0%
you're accountable for and the rest so
 
01:05:47.309 --> 01:05:47.319 align:start position:0%
basically it's all being coughed up by
 
01:05:48.910 --> 01:05:48.920 align:start position:0%
the local
 
01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
right the next thing which I'd like to
 
01:05:53.789 --> 01:05:53.799 align:start position:0%
do though Brian Eaton is here with us uh
 
01:05:56.190 --> 01:05:56.200 align:start position:0%
he's an analyst with them over there in
 
01:05:58.430 --> 01:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
the department did I hand this sheet out
 
01:06:01.069 --> 01:06:01.079 align:start position:0%
to people prior to it's not in that
 
01:06:02.589 --> 01:06:02.599 align:start position:0%
packet I don't know if I hand it out at
 
01:06:02.599 --> 01:06:03.670 align:start position:0%
packet I don't know if I hand it out at
another

01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:06.680 align:start position:0%
meeting yesterday any anybody that
 
01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:11.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
here why you for those that don't for
 
01:06:15.870 --> 01:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
those don't have a copy why don't you
 
01:06:19.150 --> 01:06:19.160 align:start position:0%
just take one of these that's coming
 
01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:22.029 align:start position:0%
just take one of these that's coming
around

01:06:22.029 --> 01:06:22.039 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:06:25.109 --> 01:06:25.119 align:start position:0%
around there is another sheet which you
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
have there there and it's it's a it's a
 
01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:29.950 align:start position:0%
have there there and it's it's a it's a
very

01:06:29.950 --> 01:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:06:33.870 --> 01:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
incomplete just like you know very very
 
01:06:36.349 --> 01:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
incomplete um and it basically says
 
01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
count of school year 2024 for students
 
01:06:42.309 --> 01:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
eligible for special education Aid and
 
01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
the numbers which we requested these are
 
01:06:47.069 --> 01:06:47.079 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities this this sheet looks
 
01:06:52.549 --> 01:06:52.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:55.589 --> 01:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
this and you can see there's two
 
01:07:00.349 --> 01:07:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:03.670 --> 01:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
100K so that would be the bracket in
 
01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
which you know the the the state would
 
01:07:08.910 --> 01:07:08.920 align:start position:0%
help do some supporting because we've
 
01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
gone over the 70,000 threshold is that
 
01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:13.069 align:start position:0%
gone over the 70,000 threshold is that
correct

01:07:13.069 --> 01:07:13.079 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
Brian I'm sorry could you repeat the
 
01:07:19.109 --> 01:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
question okay the you on on this sheet
 
01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
you have all those categories by
 
01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
$100,000 correct brackets on this sheet
 
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
right here I don't know if you have this
 
01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
right there with you this only takes
 
01:07:31.029 --> 01:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
care of two of those brackets right
 
01:07:36.269 --> 01:07:36.279 align:start position:0%
there from 0 to 100 and 100 to 200 and
 
01:07:38.829 --> 01:07:38.839 align:start position:0%
list the number of kids qualifying in
 
01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
each of those
 
01:07:42.829 --> 01:07:42.839 align:start position:0%
brackets I'm assuming that when the one
 
01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
that's a 0 to
 
01:07:47.589 --> 01:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
100K that's after the local district has
 
01:07:49.870 --> 01:07:49.880 align:start position:0%
paid off everything there responsible
 
01:07:52.670 --> 01:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
for the $70,000 three and a half times
 
01:07:55.069 --> 01:07:55.079 align:start position:0%
these costs are the total cost submitted
 
01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
to the department for sped Aid so it
 
01:07:59.470 --> 01:07:59.480 align:start position:0%
include all the costs that they're
 
01:08:02.269 --> 01:08:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:05.549 --> 01:08:05.559 align:start position:0%
reimbursement yeah and so of that zero
 
01:08:07.549 --> 01:08:07.559 align:start position:0%
to 100 then the locals going to be
 
01:08:10.829 --> 01:08:10.839 align:start position:0%
paying $770,000 of that correct yeah
 
01:08:13.069 --> 01:08:13.079 align:start position:0%
yeah exactly okay so there's only
 
01:08:17.630 --> 01:08:17.640 align:start position:0%
$30,000 there then that okay so we know
 
01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:19.480 align:start position:0%
then that there's a number of kids in
 
01:08:22.030 --> 01:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
that first bracket from Bedford for
 
01:08:25.829 --> 01:08:25.839 align:start position:0%
example there's 33 kids that that's what
 
01:08:27.630 --> 01:08:27.640 align:start position:0%
we were
 
01:08:32.430 --> 01:08:32.440 align:start position:0%
given how much how much of that then is
 
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
local how much of that is
 
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
state it might vary by student because
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
they might have different costs so we
 
01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:40.600 align:start position:0%
could break that down further but just
 
01:08:41.829 --> 01:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
showing here wouldn't tell you that
 
01:08:43.189 --> 01:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
answer unfortunately just looking at
 
01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
this year I think we're getting into a
 
01:08:46.749 --> 01:08:46.759 align:start position:0%
question representa F has on that do you
 
01:08:48.669 --> 01:08:48.679 align:start position:0%
have anything on that it's breaking this
 
01:08:54.149 --> 01:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:56.829 --> 01:08:56.839 align:start position:0%
pupil so what the department said they
 
01:09:00.990 --> 01:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
could provide to me in time to us is the
 
01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
other chart you have that you were
 
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
showing on earlier that that's pretty
 
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
much blank because
 
01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
they consolidation of that so this one
 
01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
you understand that they cannot report
 
01:09:12.669 --> 01:09:12.679 align:start position:0%
numbers that are 10 or fewer does
 
01:09:14.590 --> 01:09:14.600 align:start position:0%
everybody get that so these blanks
 
01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean zero it means 10 or fewer
 
01:09:17.829 --> 01:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
they didn't get that sheet I just
 
01:09:19.390 --> 01:09:19.400 align:start position:0%
Consolidated all because all the others
 
01:09:20.789 --> 01:09:20.799 align:start position:0%
are zeros but this is true of this one
 
01:09:22.229 --> 01:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
too that you handed out yeah yeah yeah
 
01:09:24.110 --> 01:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
okay so what they said they could get
 
01:09:26.950 --> 01:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
for me is a yeah so so the blanks in
 
01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
there does not mean zero it means
 
01:09:33.829 --> 01:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
somewhere between Z and 10 okay so the
 
01:09:35.470 --> 01:09:35.480 align:start position:0%
the state has provided this same
 
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
document for every District looks a lot
 
01:09:38.749 --> 01:09:38.759 align:start position:0%
like this except with a lot more zeros
 
01:09:41.149 --> 01:09:41.159 align:start position:0%
in it a lot more blanks in it and it's
 
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
not very useful what they did say they
 
01:09:44.110 --> 01:09:44.120 align:start position:0%
can provide which they're going to
 
01:09:47.189 --> 01:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
provide is instead of blanks and instead
 
01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
of Counting kids putting in the total
 
01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
dollar amount per district and I think
 
01:09:53.070 --> 01:09:53.080 align:start position:0%
that's what we're trying to get to here
 
01:09:54.750 --> 01:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
if I'm not mistaken yeah that's exactly
 
01:09:56.709 --> 01:09:56.719 align:start position:0%
right okay I had finished that yesterday
 
01:09:57.669 --> 01:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
afternoon and send it to our
 
01:09:58.950 --> 01:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner it must have not made it
 
01:10:00.430 --> 01:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
through the chain in time I do have it
 
01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
on my screen here that's not any help to
 
01:10:04.270 --> 01:10:04.280 align:start position:0%
you right now but um you can email it I
 
01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
could yeah y we could definitely push it
 
01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
through the chain U the our commissioner
 
01:10:10.830 --> 01:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:13.390 --> 01:10:13.400 align:start position:0%
um so that's for all the school
 
01:10:15.790 --> 01:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
districts yes yes I have it by for
 
01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
special education Aid and it goes up
 
01:10:19.229 --> 01:10:19.239 align:start position:0%
beyond the just these two categories
 
01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
goes to all the categories correct every
 
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
student accounted for additionally on
 
01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
the right I have total enrollment for
 
01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
that District as well as total special
 
01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
education enrollment to put it into
 
01:10:30.669 --> 01:10:30.679 align:start position:0%
perspective as well again also um
 
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
redacting anything less than 10 so okay
 
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
representa papovich thank you just a
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
very quick clarification questions at
 
01:10:38.030 --> 01:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
the very beginning you said that this
 
01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
include all the cost submitted to the
 
01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
department I want understand if you are
 
01:10:44.229 --> 01:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
referring to all cost submitted or to
 
01:10:47.229 --> 01:10:47.239 align:start position:0%
all cost submitted and deemed valid
 
01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
deemed valid yes deemed valid thank
 
01:10:54.030 --> 01:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
you represent Luna thanks very much so
 
01:10:56.430 --> 01:10:56.440 align:start position:0%
so we're still talking about um special
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
education Aid so the formerly
 
01:11:02.590 --> 01:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid so in the obviously in
 
01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
in in the current budget that that we're
 
01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
2425 uh budget um in for FY 25 the the
 
01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
the appropriated amount came up $17
 
01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
million short I mean I think that's 34
 
01:11:19.709 --> 01:11:19.719 align:start position:0%
to 51 point something right well went
 
01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
from about 16 almost 17 say 17 yeah yeah
 
01:11:28.149 --> 01:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
yeah so so so I guess um a couple
 
01:11:31.709 --> 01:11:31.719 align:start position:0%
questions here what was what what was
 
01:11:34.910 --> 01:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
the source of the estimate uh for the
 
01:11:38.229 --> 01:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the FY 24 and fy2 uh
 
01:11:40.110 --> 01:11:40.120 align:start position:0%
budget Appropriations what was the
 
01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
source for that estimate and was that
 
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
estimate sufficient for the claims
 
01:11:49.870 --> 01:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
submitted by school districts for fy2 24
 
01:11:51.709 --> 01:11:51.719 align:start position:0%
because I don't recall us having this
 
01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:53.719 align:start position:0%
same conversation a year ago it seemed
 
01:11:56.709 --> 01:11:56.719 align:start position:0%
to be I think that conversation's ever
 
01:11:58.470 --> 01:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
come to the education committee no but
 
01:11:59.950 --> 01:11:59.960 align:start position:0%
I'm just like I don't think it was a
 
01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
problem last year I well it has been in
 
01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
previous year so it went back to 2013
 
01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
the pration amount was very equal to
 
01:12:08.709 --> 01:12:08.719 align:start position:0%
what we're having this year around
 
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
67% so last year the pration was in the
 
01:12:15.870 --> 01:12:15.880 align:start position:0%
80 80s okay and we we have prated um and
 
01:12:17.390 --> 01:12:17.400 align:start position:0%
like I said that presentation I gave to
 
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
the legislature it is in there but we
 
01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
have prated since um the since the
 
01:12:23.709 --> 01:12:23.719 align:start position:0%
pandemic and then we went all the way
 
01:12:26.030 --> 01:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
back to I think 20
 
01:12:27.870 --> 01:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
2017 and that was the last time we were
 
01:12:31.229 --> 01:12:31.239 align:start position:0%
at 100% um so it's been pro-rated sorry
 
01:12:33.790 --> 01:12:33.800 align:start position:0%
so I guess the question is what what was
 
01:12:35.950 --> 01:12:35.960 align:start position:0%
2022 well that during the pandemic we
 
01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
were at 100% but I think it goes back to
 
01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
20 2013 that was the last time we were
 
01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
at 100% every year has been PR rated at
 
01:12:44.830 --> 01:12:44.840 align:start position:0%
some percent this is the lowest we've
 
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
been in several years that's why it was
 
01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
such an impact okay so so the yeah so so
 
01:12:51.189 --> 01:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
it goes back to that that first qu that
 
01:12:53.070 --> 01:12:53.080 align:start position:0%
primary question what was the source of
 
01:12:56.590 --> 01:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
the estimate used for the uh the the FY
 
01:12:59.110 --> 01:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
24 fy2 budget
 
01:13:00.830 --> 01:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
appropriation I did not do the
 
01:13:02.270 --> 01:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
appropriation so I would have to find
 
01:13:03.629 --> 01:13:03.639 align:start position:0%
that out for
 
01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
you I I think that would be helpful well
 
01:13:10.669 --> 01:13:10.679 align:start position:0%
it's been an issue because in 2013 fy13
 
01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
we had an we were short like we are now
 
01:13:16.030 --> 01:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
uh then it
 
01:13:18.030 --> 01:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
improved uh with there's been ups and
 
01:13:21.149 --> 01:13:21.159 align:start position:0%
downs uh but it's this is significant
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
this is uh a human cry coming out of the
 
01:13:27.390 --> 01:13:27.400 align:start position:0%
school district right now uh having to
 
01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
look back and say how do we do this um
 
01:13:33.070 --> 01:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
and how can we more accurately uh
 
01:13:36.110 --> 01:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate the necessary dollars in our
 
01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
forecast for the you
 
01:13:40.510 --> 01:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
know so so would it would it be helpful
 
01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
also to get a I mean similar to the the
 
01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
the chart you've got here 2000 through
 
01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
2023 uh like a pration um I have that
 
01:13:54.510 --> 01:13:54.520 align:start position:0%
and that y would that be helpful Mr yeah
 
01:13:56.830 --> 01:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
I think that's have that that would be a
 
01:13:59.110 --> 01:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
good question further questions
 
01:14:02.189 --> 01:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
regarding the the special education Aid
 
01:14:04.750 --> 01:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
here yes rson
 
01:14:08.709 --> 01:14:08.719 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you so on the page listing
 
01:14:12.910 --> 01:14:12.920 align:start position:0%
students the complete one as it was
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
described what is the
 
01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
number in the
 
01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:19.030 align:start position:0%
number in the
second

01:14:19.030 --> 01:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
horizontal uh where it says Z to 100K
 
01:14:24.629 --> 01:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
dot dot do 289 and then 100 to 200k dot
 
01:14:27.390 --> 01:14:27.400 align:start position:0%
dot dot 492 what's the 289 and the 492 I
 
01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:29.709 align:start position:0%
dot dot 492 what's the 289 and the 492 I
don't

01:14:29.709 --> 01:14:29.719 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:14:29.719 --> 01:14:31.470 align:start position:0%
don't
understand

01:14:31.470 --> 01:14:31.480 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:14:34.390 --> 01:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
yeah that seems very unlikely total
 
01:14:38.229 --> 01:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
number of students so I am so that's the
 
01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
total number of students in that
 
01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
category there's only 289 across the
 
01:14:44.669 --> 01:14:44.679 align:start position:0%
entire state in Z to 100,000 I did you
 
01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
did create this that doesn't seem
 
01:14:50.229 --> 01:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
credible sorry if that's the case it
 
01:14:52.750 --> 01:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't balance with it doesn't balance
 
01:14:56.750 --> 01:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
with this chart if that's the case
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
CU this chart says
 
01:15:00.990 --> 01:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
275 sorry one second just pulling up
 
01:15:08.110 --> 01:15:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:11.189 --> 01:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
you well the the numbers are very close
 
01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
here there's some moving Parts obviously
 
01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
because if you look at that second
 
01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
category here it says 492 there it says
 
01:15:20.030 --> 01:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
495 right well for Budget purposes we're
 
01:15:22.669 --> 01:15:22.679 align:start position:0%
certainly in the ballpark right um and
 
01:15:24.430 --> 01:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
same thing with the other which going
 
01:15:28.750 --> 01:15:28.760 align:start position:0%
from 289 to 275 it's yeah that's correct
 
01:15:30.510 --> 01:15:30.520 align:start position:0%
so I just double checked so it just
 
01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't show the full uh all the
 
01:15:33.629 --> 01:15:33.639 align:start position:0%
brackets but yes that is correct that
 
01:15:35.950 --> 01:15:35.960 align:start position:0%
there were 289 students uh submitting
 
01:15:37.070 --> 01:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
for reimbursing through special
 
01:15:39.790 --> 01:15:39.800 align:start position:0%
education Aid in the 0 to 100,000 uh
 
01:15:42.030 --> 01:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
cost category and so forth for 492 to
 
01:15:45.510 --> 01:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
the other bracket it what up to the 800
 
01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
800 count figure there's only 800
 
01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
students in special education Aid so
 
01:15:51.870 --> 01:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
that that's how that works out there's
 
01:15:53.709 --> 01:15:53.719 align:start position:0%
four other categories that are on this
 
01:15:53.719 --> 01:15:55.510 align:start position:0%
four other categories that are on this
paper

01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
paper
 
01:15:59.669 --> 01:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
got it thank you uh represent Maguire
 
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman is it possible the
 
01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
difference between 289 and 280 275 one
 
01:16:07.470 --> 01:16:07.480 align:start position:0%
is the number that submitted and one is
 
01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
the number that were actually eligible
 
01:16:11.229 --> 01:16:11.239 align:start position:0%
because they reached the
 
01:16:11.239 --> 01:16:14.229 align:start position:0%
because they reached the
$7,000

01:16:14.229 --> 01:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
$7,000
 
01:16:16.950 --> 01:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
threshold sorry could you repeat that
 
01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
well you said that 289 was the number
 
01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
that submitted right but it's possible
 
01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
that 275 was the actual number that
 
01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
turned out to be eligible because a few
 
01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
of them submitted but they didn't they
 
01:16:33.669 --> 01:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
didn't reach the threshold of $70,000
 
01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
right this
 
01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
is right they're eligible because they
 
01:16:39.790 --> 01:16:39.800 align:start position:0%
reached that threshold you see what I
 
01:16:42.110 --> 01:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
mean we're not sure where 275 figures
 
01:16:44.910 --> 01:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
from which which one I referen it for
 
01:16:47.709 --> 01:16:47.719 align:start position:0%
that okay oh so that's a good point
 
01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
Thank you for pointing that out so uh
 
01:16:51.149 --> 01:16:51.159 align:start position:0%
when I had broken down by District um
 
01:16:52.510 --> 01:16:52.520 align:start position:0%
there are students that are dual
 
01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
District that so this C so there this um
 
01:16:57.709 --> 01:16:57.719 align:start position:0%
chart here uh this one does have a su
 
01:16:59.189 --> 01:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
duplication it's not many it's I think
 
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
it's a dozen or so students that do
 
01:17:02.430 --> 01:17:02.440 align:start position:0%
claim for two different districts split
 
01:17:04.510 --> 01:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
District services so there are there
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
might be a student uh that's in one
 
01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
District as well as another County in
 
01:17:09.870 --> 01:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
both those they moved during the school
 
01:17:11.470 --> 01:17:11.480 align:start position:0%
year and so that's why they would be in
 
01:17:13.470 --> 01:17:13.480 align:start position:0%
two different districts gotcha may I
 
01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
follow up yes so so a couple of towns
 
01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
here sort of jump off the chart
 
01:17:22.990 --> 01:17:23.000 align:start position:0%
specifically Derry and over as compared
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
to Manchester right VAR and over what
 
01:17:29.070 --> 01:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
are they have a third the size of
 
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
population compared to Manchester and
 
01:17:37.470 --> 01:17:37.480 align:start position:0%
yet they have as many or more in these
 
01:17:40.110 --> 01:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
categories than Manchester does so
 
01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that tell you that
 
01:17:47.590 --> 01:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
maybe they need more instruction or
 
01:17:51.030 --> 01:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
whatever in terms of how they're coding
 
01:17:53.790 --> 01:17:53.800 align:start position:0%
people because they're somehow overdoing
 
01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:55.629 align:start position:0%
people because they're somehow overdoing
it

01:17:55.629 --> 01:17:55.639 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:17:58.149 --> 01:17:58.159 align:start position:0%
I think the numbers are more correlate
 
01:18:00.830 --> 01:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
to um if they've kept track of the
 
01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
student cost and then submitted to us
 
01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
for special education Aid so there may
 
01:18:08.189 --> 01:18:08.199 align:start position:0%
be that they they are doing very well at
 
01:18:09.790 --> 01:18:09.800 align:start position:0%
tracking students and very well at
 
01:18:11.950 --> 01:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
applying for special education Aid and
 
01:18:13.950 --> 01:18:13.960 align:start position:0%
they that would I would attribute it to
 
01:18:15.870 --> 01:18:15.880 align:start position:0%
that because it is we don't determine
 
01:18:17.470 --> 01:18:17.480 align:start position:0%
which students get submitted for special
 
01:18:19.470 --> 01:18:19.480 align:start position:0%
education Aid it is up to the district
 
01:18:21.070 --> 01:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
to determine who they're going to submit
 
01:18:23.709 --> 01:18:23.719 align:start position:0%
to us for special education Aid they can
 
01:18:25.550 --> 01:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
decide that we're only going to put in
 
01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
um invoices for these you know 16
 
01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
students and they don't put in for
 
01:18:34.149 --> 01:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
anybody else I follow yes so I would
 
01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
think the districts are are very
 
01:18:38.590 --> 01:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
unlikely to leave money on the table you
 
01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
know what I mean so that if somebody
 
01:18:45.270 --> 01:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
qualifies is close to $70,000 or more
 
01:18:46.910 --> 01:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
they would know it and they would they
 
01:18:48.830 --> 01:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
would submit as much as they can for
 
01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
them right I would hope so yes and I
 
01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
would assume Manchester in particular
 
01:18:56.110 --> 01:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
does that pretty well because they're so
 
01:18:57.790 --> 01:18:57.800 align:start position:0%
large right they must have a lot of
 
01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
employees that do this kind of thing and
 
01:19:02.030 --> 01:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
and that sort of thing so I would think
 
01:19:03.709 --> 01:19:03.719 align:start position:0%
Manchester would be sort of the average
 
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
and would would kind
 
01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
of you know do you see what I mean and
 
01:19:12.709 --> 01:19:12.719 align:start position:0%
so and there's clearly differences right
 
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
there's clearly some areas that have way
 
01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
higher populations of special ed in
 
01:19:21.629 --> 01:19:21.639 align:start position:0%
these high categories than others and
 
01:19:23.629 --> 01:19:23.639 align:start position:0%
and you you know you could think it's
 
01:19:25.310 --> 01:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
Maybe random but
 
01:19:27.910 --> 01:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
you know they're just so much higher
 
01:19:30.430 --> 01:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
that you think maybe it's a choice right
 
01:19:32.910 --> 01:19:32.920 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a decision they're making
 
01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
kind of and that would go back to we
 
01:19:36.550 --> 01:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
need to be able to analyze the data to
 
01:19:39.870 --> 01:19:39.880 align:start position:0%
determine you know are you outplaced
 
01:19:41.590 --> 01:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
than you know what's your percentage of
 
01:19:43.310 --> 01:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
it goes back to representative poic's
 
01:19:45.310 --> 01:19:45.320 align:start position:0%
question about analyzing the data and
 
01:19:47.070 --> 01:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
determining you know where that money is
 
01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
going so we I would not be able to give
 
01:19:51.669 --> 01:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
you that answer to tell you if you know
 
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
if they are if they are out placing
 
01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
students in um residential or um outof
 
01:19:58.910 --> 01:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
District facilities which is typically
 
01:20:00.709 --> 01:20:00.719 align:start position:0%
where the high costs come from more
 
01:20:02.590 --> 01:20:02.600 align:start position:0%
frequently than other
 
01:20:05.550 --> 01:20:05.560 align:start position:0%
districts may I ask one more just go
 
01:20:07.149 --> 01:20:07.159 align:start position:0%
ahead and follow it up then
 
01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
representative bricky but I I want to
 
01:20:10.189 --> 01:20:10.199 align:start position:0%
follow up one thing then we'll go
 
01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
representative bricky and then did you
 
01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
have your end up so for such districts
 
01:20:18.070 --> 01:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
like like the ones we pointed out here
 
01:20:19.870 --> 01:20:19.880 align:start position:0%
if we gave you more
 
01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
employees could you do some auditing
 
01:20:24.110 --> 01:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
could you have someone sort of go to
 
01:20:27.390 --> 01:20:27.400 align:start position:0%
those District s look at specific
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
IEPs and and think and and and and look
 
01:20:34.110 --> 01:20:34.120 align:start position:0%
at the data on those students and and
 
01:20:36.350 --> 01:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
see whether they sort of fall in line
 
01:20:39.070 --> 01:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
with General accepted practice because
 
01:20:40.750 --> 01:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming you don't do any of that
 
01:20:43.310 --> 01:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
right you're looking in detail I got a I
 
01:20:46.669 --> 01:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
got an invoice I got an i AP they match
 
01:20:49.550 --> 01:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
good right but you're not really looking
 
01:20:52.590 --> 01:20:52.600 align:start position:0%
at how the IEP was was created in the
 
01:20:55.590 --> 01:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
first place right so while
 
01:20:57.070 --> 01:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question while I can
 
01:20:59.830 --> 01:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
look at um I I can't question the
 
01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
determination of an IEP team to place a
 
01:21:03.990 --> 01:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
child but I can look at the broader
 
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
picture of what percentage of students
 
01:21:08.149 --> 01:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
are you placing in an a of District
 
01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
placement or or pieces like that but I
 
01:21:12.669 --> 01:21:12.679 align:start position:0%
I'm I can't question the determination
 
01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
of an IEP team they have made that
 
01:21:16.709 --> 01:21:16.719 align:start position:0%
decision I can't go against that I can't
 
01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
say no your decision was wrong um but we
 
01:21:21.310 --> 01:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
can look at it and say you're you're
 
01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
you're outplacement more frequently than
 
01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
other districts your percentage is
 
01:21:26.990 --> 01:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
higher um and and we could do that and
 
01:21:28.430 --> 01:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't even have to go to districts
 
01:21:29.669 --> 01:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
because we would be able to look at
 
01:21:31.990 --> 01:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
those IEPs in the special education
 
01:21:33.470 --> 01:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
information system but I would need
 
01:21:34.629 --> 01:21:34.639 align:start position:0%
people to do
 
01:21:36.790 --> 01:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
that and just quickly and then we'll go
 
01:21:39.629 --> 01:21:39.639 align:start position:0%
to represent bricky then represent L
 
01:21:44.229 --> 01:21:44.239 align:start position:0%
um we at least in my experience in
 
01:21:47.189 --> 01:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
education there are what we call magnet
 
01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
schools school districts which have a
 
01:21:53.870 --> 01:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
wonderful special education program or
 
01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
have the
 
01:21:58.510 --> 01:21:58.520 align:start position:0%
the the wherewithal to provide these
 
01:22:00.910 --> 01:22:00.920 align:start position:0%
Services whereas District over here
 
01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't and we have a high movement of
 
01:22:06.350 --> 01:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
students naturally we're a moving
 
01:22:08.430 --> 01:22:08.440 align:start position:0%
society and you don't know what's coming
 
01:22:11.709 --> 01:22:11.719 align:start position:0%
at you we also have though these schools
 
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
which have these services so sometimes
 
01:22:16.669 --> 01:22:16.679 align:start position:0%
parents will look not sometimes quite
 
01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
often they'll look where is my child
 
01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
going to get those services so is that
 
01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
does that contribute
 
01:22:26.350 --> 01:22:26.360 align:start position:0%
to certain districts having higher cost
 
01:22:31.510 --> 01:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
of this and with that contribution Is it
 
01:22:34.910 --> 01:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
wise for us to be allocating dollars in
 
01:22:37.629 --> 01:22:37.639 align:start position:0%
on an average to all districts or to
 
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
look more closely at those districts
 
01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
which have this higher number of
 
01:22:44.950 --> 01:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
students qualifying for this type of
 
01:22:47.270 --> 01:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
service so that we don't have to start
 
01:22:49.070 --> 01:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
providing those Services which are
 
01:22:51.910 --> 01:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
provided there necessarily or maybe we
 
01:22:53.590 --> 01:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
can do it through some transportation of
 
01:22:55.669 --> 01:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
services to a small school district that
 
01:22:58.229 --> 01:22:58.239 align:start position:0%
may only have 80 kids in that district
 
01:23:00.110 --> 01:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
and we have some like that in fact I'm
 
01:23:02.149 --> 01:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
talking about one Pont had two of these
 
01:23:04.669 --> 01:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
kids move in in one year all those both
 
01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
those kids were well over $20 something
 
01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
thousand a piece totally
 
01:23:12.350 --> 01:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
unplanned uh how do we Rectify that type
 
01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
of situation from
 
01:23:16.350 --> 01:23:16.360 align:start position:0%
occurring I I don't think you can
 
01:23:18.629 --> 01:23:18.639 align:start position:0%
Rectify that situation I think that yes
 
01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
there are times that districts have a um
 
01:23:23.110 --> 01:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
that people will move to a district
 
01:23:24.550 --> 01:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
because it's a good school system or
 
01:23:26.149 --> 01:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
they know hear that special education is
 
01:23:28.750 --> 01:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
done well there but I that you can't
 
01:23:30.990 --> 01:23:31.000 align:start position:0%
predict that I can't predict I I I can't
 
01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
predict that two people be allocating
 
01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
our resources though to those districts
 
01:23:37.590 --> 01:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
which have a higher higher number of
 
01:23:39.990 --> 01:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
kids needing that type of service from
 
01:23:41.790 --> 01:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
our from our history that we
 
01:23:44.149 --> 01:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
see rather than saying well we're going
 
01:23:46.229 --> 01:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
to fund X number dollars to every
 
01:23:50.149 --> 01:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
student or you know to every district
 
01:23:52.990 --> 01:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
for in our differentiated Aid
 
01:23:56.990 --> 01:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
category um differentiated Aid sorry I
 
01:23:58.430 --> 01:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
thought we were talking about special
 
01:24:00.110 --> 01:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
going back and forth here because the
 
01:24:01.430 --> 01:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
money's got to come from somewhere
 
01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
supposedly and I know that's not
 
01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
directed to special education I
 
01:24:06.149 --> 01:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
understand the reasons why we have
 
01:24:11.110 --> 01:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:13.350 --> 01:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
$2,100 you know we've got to help out
 
01:24:16.870 --> 01:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
these districts at that all districts
 
01:24:20.110 --> 01:24:20.120 align:start position:0%
somehow with our with those costs I
 
01:24:21.750 --> 01:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
think it's I I think it's a
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
determination that you as a committee
 
01:24:25.470 --> 01:24:25.480 align:start position:0%
need to make I I yeah I think that we
 
01:24:28.270 --> 01:24:28.280 align:start position:0%
need to you can look at the how much is
 
01:24:29.910 --> 01:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
being spent on each child you can look
 
01:24:32.189 --> 01:24:32.199 align:start position:0%
at you know those categories um I will
 
01:24:33.669 --> 01:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
tell you that if you do look at those
 
01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
categories on our end federally we need
 
01:24:37.310 --> 01:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
to have policies and procedures that
 
01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
ensure that um fape is not being uh it
 
01:24:41.109 --> 01:24:41.119 align:start position:0%
was a concern that was brought up
 
01:24:42.669 --> 01:24:42.679 align:start position:0%
yesterday in the conversations that fape
 
01:24:44.709 --> 01:24:44.719 align:start position:0%
is not being um hindered and that
 
01:24:45.950 --> 01:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
students aren't being placed in more
 
01:24:47.430 --> 01:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
restrictive environments just so they
 
01:24:50.790 --> 01:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
can get that extra funding so um I I
 
01:24:52.229 --> 01:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
think it does we do need to look at it
 
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
more clearly but it's hard to say
 
01:24:56.990 --> 01:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
whether you should do by category or if
 
01:24:59.709 --> 01:24:59.719 align:start position:0%
you need to look at cost it any of those
 
01:25:00.629 --> 01:25:00.639 align:start position:0%
are going
 
01:25:03.310 --> 01:25:03.320 align:start position:0%
to be helpful represent bricky you had
 
01:25:04.990 --> 01:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
your hand
 
01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
up it goes back to
 
01:25:11.470 --> 01:25:11.480 align:start position:0%
um the question about the disparity
 
01:25:14.030 --> 01:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
between the numbers in the columns could
 
01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
it also be because these are only the
 
01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:18.030 align:start position:0%
it also be because these are only the
first

01:25:18.030 --> 01:25:18.040 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:25:21.030 --> 01:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
two categories and we're missing the top
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
four categories so these are the those
 
01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
are the largest just two categories the
 
01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
other categories have much smaller
 
01:25:29.550 --> 01:25:29.560 align:start position:0%
numbers right they are I mean I can see
 
01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
that here on this chart but do you do
 
01:25:36.109 --> 01:25:36.119 align:start position:0%
you think that like the question was
 
01:25:39.510 --> 01:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
about the disparity between um what was
 
01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
it Manchester
 
01:25:45.669 --> 01:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
and I don't recall now Derry and Derry
 
01:25:48.070 --> 01:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
and um do you think that that's the the
 
01:25:49.830 --> 01:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
reason that it looks like the way that
 
01:25:52.149 --> 01:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
it does they those districts may have
 
01:25:54.669 --> 01:25:54.679 align:start position:0%
more in the upper categories then in the
 
01:25:57.669 --> 01:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
lower categories or anything I would be
 
01:26:00.350 --> 01:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
speculation I I I can't say see that n
 
01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
number 10 or less or less we're using
 
01:26:05.790 --> 01:26:05.800 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at four and 10
 
01:26:08.350 --> 01:26:08.360 align:start position:0%
students on the top two categories there
 
01:26:10.189 --> 01:26:10.199 align:start position:0%
we're not going to get that information
 
01:26:14.550 --> 01:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
no and we shouldn't yeah um no it was uh
 
01:26:17.430 --> 01:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
je was just going around represent luno
 
01:26:19.629 --> 01:26:19.639 align:start position:0%
yes yes I knew there was somebody there
 
01:26:23.070 --> 01:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
thanks very much Mr chair um so when
 
01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
when when you take a look at these um
 
01:26:28.350 --> 01:26:28.360 align:start position:0%
these these these costs by students and
 
01:26:30.510 --> 01:26:30.520 align:start position:0%
in these in these fairly High you know
 
01:26:32.229 --> 01:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
100,000 you know
 
01:26:35.550 --> 01:26:35.560 align:start position:0%
categories um are there are there any
 
01:26:39.149 --> 01:26:39.159 align:start position:0%
sort of um trend's not the right number
 
01:26:44.229 --> 01:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
but are there you know is there any um
 
01:26:47.149 --> 01:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
um you know any information like by you
 
01:26:49.109 --> 01:26:49.119 align:start position:0%
know how old the student is like are
 
01:26:54.550 --> 01:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
there would there be more um 18y olds in
 
01:26:56.830 --> 01:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
high cost situations than eight-year
 
01:26:59.950 --> 01:26:59.960 align:start position:0%
olds or anything like that I don't they
 
01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
don't necess I wouldn't say they
 
01:27:02.790 --> 01:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily correlate to age but they
 
01:27:04.669 --> 01:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
would correlate to um where they're
 
01:27:06.550 --> 01:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
receiving their services typically um if
 
01:27:08.629 --> 01:27:08.639 align:start position:0%
a student is out of District in a
 
01:27:10.270 --> 01:27:10.280 align:start position:0%
private provider in New Hampshire or out
 
01:27:11.990 --> 01:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
of state that's when those costs are
 
01:27:13.510 --> 01:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
going to hit those higher numbers it's
 
01:27:17.149 --> 01:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
not typically by age okay so so the
 
01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
incidence of these high cost situations
 
01:27:21.669 --> 01:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
would would are sort probably spread
 
01:27:24.830 --> 01:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
fairly evenly across AG across all the
 
01:27:27.510 --> 01:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
age groups I I would say so yeah so so
 
01:27:29.790 --> 01:27:29.800 align:start position:0%
the the and the reason I asked that is
 
01:27:33.390 --> 01:27:33.400 align:start position:0%
is I think just just a few years ago we
 
01:27:37.750 --> 01:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
um we we changed the we increased the um
 
01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:39.830 align:start position:0%
um we we changed the we increased the um
the

01:27:39.830 --> 01:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:27:43.350 --> 01:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
the the the age range of when when
 
01:27:45.070 --> 01:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
school districts have to provide
 
01:27:48.390 --> 01:27:48.400 align:start position:0%
services to students from 21 to
 
01:27:52.270 --> 01:27:52.280 align:start position:0%
22 and and and the word inclusive was
 
01:27:54.910 --> 01:27:54.920 align:start position:0%
used too so I don't know if if if if
 
01:27:58.629 --> 01:27:58.639 align:start position:0%
that is aged 20 as soon as they turn 22
 
01:28:00.669 --> 01:28:00.679 align:start position:0%
they they that that districts
 
01:28:03.669 --> 01:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
discontinue or as soon as they're 22 and
 
01:28:06.109 --> 01:28:06.119 align:start position:0%
the end of the school year coincides or
 
01:28:08.270 --> 01:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
when they turn 23 I'm not sure but did
 
01:28:10.629 --> 01:28:10.639 align:start position:0%
any of that contribute to the um you
 
01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
know what we've seen in the the numbers
 
01:28:15.189 --> 01:28:15.199 align:start position:0%
so it um the the language is 21
 
01:28:17.550 --> 01:28:17.560 align:start position:0%
inclusive so it goes up to their 22nd
 
01:28:19.790 --> 01:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
birthday and then um districts are not
 
01:28:21.870 --> 01:28:21.880 align:start position:0%
required to provide services from once
 
01:28:24.350 --> 01:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
they turn 22 some districts do they'll
 
01:28:26.229 --> 01:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
let them go out the rest of the year but
 
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
um typically it ends at their 20 just
 
01:28:30.430 --> 01:28:30.440 align:start position:0%
the day before their 22nd birthday we
 
01:28:34.350 --> 01:28:34.360 align:start position:0%
did put out um and Brian has the number
 
01:28:36.229 --> 01:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
so I'm gonna let Brian talk to you sure
 
01:28:37.910 --> 01:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question U so that's a
 
01:28:39.229 --> 01:28:39.239 align:start position:0%
question that we definitely wanted to
 
01:28:41.629 --> 01:28:41.639 align:start position:0%
try and answer uh I think it was
 
01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
November December I believe and that
 
01:28:45.550 --> 01:28:45.560 align:start position:0%
there was a press release on it uh so
 
01:28:47.310 --> 01:28:47.320 align:start position:0%
what I had looked at was the count of
 
01:28:49.350 --> 01:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
students in special education Aid being
 
01:28:51.109 --> 01:28:51.119 align:start position:0%
submitted as well as the average cost I
 
01:28:52.950 --> 01:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
saw that both of them increased and I
 
01:28:54.550 --> 01:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
looked at that back
 
01:28:57.310 --> 01:28:57.320 align:start position:0%
to 2017 and it kind of fluctuated back
 
01:28:58.470 --> 01:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
and forth whether it was more students
 
01:29:00.510 --> 01:29:00.520 align:start position:0%
being submitted or the average cost was
 
01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
increasing so it was it's been very
 
01:29:05.149 --> 01:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
variable since 2017 but for 2024 we did
 
01:29:07.870 --> 01:29:07.880 align:start position:0%
see that there was um the cost was
 
01:29:09.109 --> 01:29:09.119 align:start position:0%
attributed to both average cost
 
01:29:10.350 --> 01:29:10.360 align:start position:0%
increasing and the amount of students
 
01:29:12.590 --> 01:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
being increased than previously and the
 
01:29:15.189 --> 01:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
amount of students because of the the
 
01:29:18.910 --> 01:29:18.920 align:start position:0%
the the 22 I I thought my head it wasn't
 
01:29:21.629 --> 01:29:21.639 align:start position:0%
um it wasn't major from the from the
 
01:29:23.629 --> 01:29:23.639 align:start position:0%
additional age uh being included it was
 
01:29:25.189 --> 01:29:25.199 align:start position:0%
across the board but I can look back and
 
01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
get more specific on that okay before we
 
01:29:29.709 --> 01:29:29.719 align:start position:0%
go with some other questions right now
 
01:29:33.189 --> 01:29:33.199 align:start position:0%
um if if we need questions re uh
 
01:29:35.270 --> 01:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
reference these stats right here
 
01:29:38.109 --> 01:29:38.119 align:start position:0%
statistics here but what we need to do
 
01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
is get down a little bit what would
 
01:29:44.070 --> 01:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
happen if we start reducing the
 
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the local from 3 and
 
01:29:53.390 --> 01:29:53.400 align:start position:0%
A2 to three to 2 and 1/2 to whatever uh
 
01:29:55.149 --> 01:29:55.159 align:start position:0%
represents SP he does have a question
 
01:29:57.390 --> 01:29:57.400 align:start position:0%
regard that sort of refocuses a little
 
01:29:58.910 --> 01:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
bit and go in a direction some of these
 
01:30:01.270 --> 01:30:01.280 align:start position:0%
bills which we have in front of us so
 
01:30:02.990 --> 01:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
are there any more questions on where we
 
01:30:05.910 --> 01:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
are right now before he tries to
 
01:30:07.830 --> 01:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
redirect the conversation in that
 
01:30:10.750 --> 01:30:10.760 align:start position:0%
direction uh represent Burton and and
 
01:30:12.550 --> 01:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
just a quick quick observation the
 
01:30:14.669 --> 01:30:14.679 align:start position:0%
Oyster River is a magnet we spend $8
 
01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
million on special ed and we get 150,000
 
01:30:21.870 --> 01:30:21.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:25.070 --> 01:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
us represent papovich thank you Mr thank
 
01:30:27.310 --> 01:30:27.320 align:start position:0%
you well thank you Mr chair and again
 
01:30:29.030 --> 01:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here it's a
 
01:30:31.430 --> 01:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
clarification question on something that
 
01:30:34.470 --> 01:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
remark from the chairman brought up we
 
01:30:37.070 --> 01:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
have these students that are at the far
 
01:30:39.270 --> 01:30:39.280 align:start position:0%
out end of the level of services they
 
01:30:41.910 --> 01:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
need and we have that call it a 70k more
 
01:30:46.070 --> 01:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
or less cap what happens to a student
 
01:30:48.790 --> 01:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
who is uh you know costing whose support
 
01:30:51.669 --> 01:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
will be 100,000 a year that moves in
 
01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
halfway through the school year from one
 
01:30:55.709 --> 01:30:55.719 align:start position:0%
District to another each district
 
01:30:58.750 --> 01:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
reaches 50k so does that mean that
 
01:31:01.590 --> 01:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
neither District reaches the cap even
 
01:31:04.149 --> 01:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
though the student was above the cap as
 
01:31:05.870 --> 01:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
a student but it was split between
 
01:31:07.990 --> 01:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
different schools we would take that
 
01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
into thank you for the question we would
 
01:31:10.910 --> 01:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
take that into consideration and the
 
01:31:12.830 --> 01:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
calc and we determin how long the child
 
01:31:14.550 --> 01:31:14.560 align:start position:0%
was in each of the districts and so how
 
01:31:15.910 --> 01:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
much cap each of the districts would
 
01:31:17.470 --> 01:31:17.480 align:start position:0%
need to pay based on how long the child
 
01:31:18.990 --> 01:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
was in so you would look at the student
 
01:31:21.590 --> 01:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
as a whole notice that they exceed the
 
01:31:23.310 --> 01:31:23.320 align:start position:0%
cap and then a portion whatever
 
01:31:25.310 --> 01:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
reimbursement based on you know your
 
01:31:27.109 --> 01:31:27.119 align:start position:0%
best estimate of how it's appropriate
 
01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you that's one thing we'll one
 
01:31:30.950 --> 01:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
last thing we need to fix I appreciate
 
01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
it thank
 
01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
you represent PHS one and then in
 
01:31:38.189 --> 01:31:38.199 align:start position:0%
represent spillsbury so I would wonder
 
01:31:41.030 --> 01:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
if you can use your database to tell us
 
01:31:44.550 --> 01:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
where those high cost students are are
 
01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
going if there are any places in the
 
01:31:50.709 --> 01:31:50.719 align:start position:0%
state that they're that they're going
 
01:31:53.149 --> 01:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
that um maybe we could look at those
 
01:31:55.669 --> 01:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
programs for particularly a district
 
01:31:59.189 --> 01:31:59.199 align:start position:0%
that's sending those kids to um another
 
01:32:02.189 --> 01:32:02.199 align:start position:0%
district for some kind of program so we
 
01:32:05.430 --> 01:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
can see if there's any cost efficiency
 
01:32:08.189 --> 01:32:08.199 align:start position:0%
there that we could support somehow so
 
01:32:10.189 --> 01:32:10.199 align:start position:0%
in my presentation to the legislature
 
01:32:12.070 --> 01:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
where the prime and it was a very rough
 
01:32:14.430 --> 01:32:14.440 align:start position:0%
estimate I will clarify that again where
 
01:32:15.990 --> 01:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
most of the costs were were in our New
 
01:32:17.470 --> 01:32:17.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire private providers of special
 
01:32:19.590 --> 01:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
education those are approved programs
 
01:32:22.030 --> 01:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
that we approve and we set their rates
 
01:32:24.350 --> 01:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
so they don't um randomly set rates it
 
01:32:26.870 --> 01:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
is it's a rate they submit for each year
 
01:32:28.669 --> 01:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
and we analyze their costs and provide
 
01:32:30.590 --> 01:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
them with a rate each year the cost that
 
01:32:32.149 --> 01:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
we don't have control over would be if
 
01:32:34.590 --> 01:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
the student went out of state um and
 
01:32:36.390 --> 01:32:36.400 align:start position:0%
they went to a a provider out of state
 
01:32:37.629 --> 01:32:37.639 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be able to control that but
 
01:32:39.310 --> 01:32:39.320 align:start position:0%
any of those approved providers in New
 
01:32:42.189 --> 01:32:42.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um we do approve that rate for
 
01:32:45.030 --> 01:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
them does that include another school
 
01:32:47.149 --> 01:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
district no it does
 
01:32:49.590 --> 01:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
not represent spillsbury
 
01:32:53.149 --> 01:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I just want to
 
01:32:56.350 --> 01:32:56.360 align:start position:0%
make sure a couple of these uh data
 
01:32:59.310 --> 01:32:59.320 align:start position:0%
points correct before I POS the question
 
01:33:02.229 --> 01:33:02.239 align:start position:0%
so in the chart that we have in front of
 
01:33:08.109 --> 01:33:08.119 align:start position:0%
us the uh the lowcost high census
 
01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
category of 0 to 100 I see on the next
 
01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
page in another chart that same group of
 
01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
200 that same cohort of
 
01:33:20.910 --> 01:33:20.920 align:start position:0%
275 uh individuals is labeled as 50 to
 
01:33:23.229 --> 01:33:23.239 align:start position:0%
100 uh so in my mind I'm already
 
01:33:25.590 --> 01:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
relabeling chart one is 5050 to 100
 
01:33:26.950 --> 01:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
right they're all they're all contained
 
01:33:28.709 --> 01:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
within that upper
 
01:33:31.430 --> 01:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
half and and I assume in fact that
 
01:33:34.470 --> 01:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
they're virtually all really 70 to
 
01:33:37.590 --> 01:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
100 right they wouldn't be submitted for
 
01:33:40.590 --> 01:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
special education s until they so really
 
01:33:42.229 --> 01:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
what we're measuring here is anybody
 
01:33:45.629 --> 01:33:45.639 align:start position:0%
who's eligible based on having exceeded
 
01:33:48.070 --> 01:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
the cost of three and a half times the
 
01:33:50.590 --> 01:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
okay correct so I'm just going to
 
01:33:55.470 --> 01:33:55.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:55.480 --> 01:33:57.910 align:start position:0%
 
now

01:33:57.910 --> 01:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:34:03.149 --> 01:34:03.159 align:start position:0%
um as we bring the threshold down
 
01:34:06.990 --> 01:34:07.000 align:start position:0%
hypothetically um we're going to be
 
01:34:08.910 --> 01:34:08.920 align:start position:0%
looking at lower costs per student but
 
01:34:11.229 --> 01:34:11.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to have an increasing Census
 
01:34:14.510 --> 01:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
count at each lower threshold I think
 
01:34:17.790 --> 01:34:17.800 align:start position:0%
that's very hard for us to uh project
 
01:34:19.310 --> 01:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering whether you could
 
01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
model what it would look like for the
 
01:34:25.990 --> 01:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
state in terms of cost per student total
 
01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
number of students total cost of the
 
01:34:32.149 --> 01:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
state at each um half multiplier
 
01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
threshold in other words taking it down
 
01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
assum the average student is 20 the
 
01:34:40.709 --> 01:34:40.719 align:start position:0%
threshold is 70 where would we be at
 
01:34:42.669 --> 01:34:42.679 align:start position:0%
three times two and a half times two
 
01:34:45.629 --> 01:34:45.639 align:start position:0%
times one and a half times can we do
 
01:34:47.390 --> 01:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
that that would be a very valuable thing
 
01:34:48.629 --> 01:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
I think for the next time we get
 
01:34:50.830 --> 01:34:50.840 align:start position:0%
together on this
 
01:34:53.310 --> 01:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
subject so data wise we would not have
 
01:34:55.870 --> 01:34:55.880 align:start position:0%
the data for anybody that is below 30
 
01:34:58.310 --> 01:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
below the cap below that 70,000 we would
 
01:34:59.870 --> 01:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
not have them because they don't submit
 
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
to us for it so if they know they're if
 
01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
they have a student that is not going to
 
01:35:05.790 --> 01:35:05.800 align:start position:0%
meet cap we don't have that data so you
 
01:35:09.870 --> 01:35:09.880 align:start position:0%
have other data that you can interpolate
 
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
from thank you for the question I don't
 
01:35:14.750 --> 01:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
believe we have any data that wouldn't
 
01:35:18.350 --> 01:35:18.360 align:start position:0%
be that would be able to be addition in
 
01:35:20.229 --> 01:35:20.239 align:start position:0%
addition to what's in sped Aid the only
 
01:35:22.990 --> 01:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
other U metric we could pull is from the
 
01:35:24.870 --> 01:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
due2 the annual financial report
 
01:35:27.790 --> 01:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
District submit and base that off of uh
 
01:35:29.070 --> 01:35:29.080 align:start position:0%
the amount of services that or the
 
01:35:30.350 --> 01:35:30.360 align:start position:0%
amount of students that receive Services
 
01:35:31.790 --> 01:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
by that District but we haven't done
 
01:35:33.109 --> 01:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
that analysis ourselves we're not sure
 
01:35:34.750 --> 01:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
how how complete would be able to be
 
01:35:37.270 --> 01:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
done so I can't think of another way we
 
01:35:39.430 --> 01:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
could estimate the amount of students
 
01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
that would be in those half multipliers
 
01:35:43.830 --> 01:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
based on the data that we have
 
01:35:45.669 --> 01:35:45.679 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that's that's quite a
 
01:35:48.109 --> 01:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
conundrum for us as makers that is a
 
01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
real conundrum uh seeing that there are
 
01:35:55.470 --> 01:35:55.480 align:start position:0%
states that are we know of one state
 
01:35:58.750 --> 01:35:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:03.030 --> 01:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
$115,000 and then from 15 to
 
01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
65 the spa the state then pays that
 
01:36:11.229 --> 01:36:11.239 align:start position:0%
amount from 15 to 65 from 65 on onwards
 
01:36:13.229 --> 01:36:13.239 align:start position:0%
to get into formula similar to what we
 
01:36:14.950 --> 01:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
have when we get three and a half to 10
 
01:36:18.590 --> 01:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
times so how are we going to be able
 
01:36:22.270 --> 01:36:22.280 align:start position:0%
to help on this situation if we are
 
01:36:24.870 --> 01:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
unable to identify what those numbers
 
01:36:26.709 --> 01:36:26.719 align:start position:0%
you know if we just point blank pick a
 
01:36:29.149 --> 01:36:29.159 align:start position:0%
number let's say we pick 15,000 like
 
01:36:31.950 --> 01:36:31.960 align:start position:0%
that other state does
 
01:36:34.350 --> 01:36:34.360 align:start position:0%
um how are we going to transition to a
 
01:36:37.070 --> 01:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
that the only data that we could look at
 
01:36:40.910 --> 01:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
is that those students that were
 
01:36:42.550 --> 01:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
submitted for special education Aid and
 
01:36:45.109 --> 01:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
tell you the impact based on just those
 
01:36:46.669 --> 01:36:46.679 align:start position:0%
students so we had
 
01:36:49.390 --> 01:36:49.400 align:start position:0%
800 students we could say if the cap
 
01:36:50.550 --> 01:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
went down how much it would have
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
increased for those 800 students but we
 
01:36:55.070 --> 01:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
they we just don't have the other data
 
01:36:56.790 --> 01:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
you don't have invoices you know you
 
01:36:58.870 --> 01:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
have invoices to come to you right for
 
01:37:03.189 --> 01:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
if identified this the district has
 
01:37:05.910 --> 01:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
appropriately spent this $70,000 but
 
01:37:08.030 --> 01:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
they need this additional and so they're
 
01:37:09.270 --> 01:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
now they're getting into special
 
01:37:11.870 --> 01:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
education Aid so don't we have some kind
 
01:37:15.229 --> 01:37:15.239 align:start position:0%
of uh material from the the the local
 
01:37:17.070 --> 01:37:17.080 align:start position:0%
districts on these
 
01:37:19.669 --> 01:37:19.679 align:start position:0%
children of their cost of the program
 
01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
they're currently providing that they're
 
01:37:24.790 --> 01:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
not getting any reur from the state on
 
01:37:26.550 --> 01:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
specifically just sped Aid submitting
 
01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
reim submitting
 
01:37:30.870 --> 01:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
invoices I can't think of anything that
 
01:37:32.550 --> 01:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
we would but we can follow up definitely
 
01:37:33.709 --> 01:37:33.719 align:start position:0%
I can't think of anything on top my head
 
01:37:35.470 --> 01:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
that we have additional data on in terms
 
01:37:37.350 --> 01:37:37.360 align:start position:0%
of costs per special education student
 
01:37:40.709 --> 01:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
except if you were to take the total um
 
01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
special education expenditures from the
 
01:37:45.709 --> 01:37:45.719 align:start position:0%
du2 and divide how we got to the 29,000
 
01:37:47.550 --> 01:37:47.560 align:start position:0%
average uh cost per special education
 
01:37:50.830 --> 01:37:50.840 align:start position:0%
student um but you can't drill we don't
 
01:37:52.030 --> 01:37:52.040 align:start position:0%
have any we don't have any more
 
01:37:53.790 --> 01:37:53.800 align:start position:0%
additional drill down information to to
 
01:37:56.350 --> 01:37:56.360 align:start position:0%
the student level just by District or by
 
01:38:01.070 --> 01:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
you so okay further questions represent
 
01:38:03.070 --> 01:38:03.080 align:start position:0%
Damon just want to make sure I
 
01:38:05.589 --> 01:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
understand what you've just um
 
01:38:08.830 --> 01:38:08.840 align:start position:0%
acknowledged so if the student has an
 
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
IEP and the cost of providing the
 
01:38:14.109 --> 01:38:14.119 align:start position:0%
services in the I is less than
 
01:38:17.070 --> 01:38:17.080 align:start position:0%
$70,000 they're not submitting any data
 
01:38:20.229 --> 01:38:20.239 align:start position:0%
to you and so we can't track how many
 
01:38:23.910 --> 01:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
kids are at 60 to 70,000 or 50 to 70
 
01:38:25.550 --> 01:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
correct correct the only data that they
 
01:38:27.510 --> 01:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
would submit is on the doe 25 how much
 
01:38:30.750 --> 01:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
they spent on spent on special education
 
01:38:32.709 --> 01:38:32.719 align:start position:0%
but we do not collect invoices or any
 
01:38:34.310 --> 01:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
data within the special education
 
01:38:36.430 --> 01:38:36.440 align:start position:0%
information system if because they don't
 
01:38:37.870 --> 01:38:37.880 align:start position:0%
submit it to us if they're not
 
01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
submitting for special education
 
01:38:43.709 --> 01:38:43.719 align:start position:0%
Aid well F and on the
 
01:38:46.830 --> 01:38:46.840 align:start position:0%
doe2 that is not a per student number
 
01:38:49.870 --> 01:38:49.880 align:start position:0%
that is a district number I agree thank
 
01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
you further question repres
 
01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
luno so of the data that that that you
 
01:38:57.669 --> 01:38:57.679 align:start position:0%
have collected through these through the
 
01:39:00.750 --> 01:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
the the special education Aid um app you
 
01:39:03.870 --> 01:39:03.880 align:start position:0%
know data collection are
 
01:39:07.629 --> 01:39:07.639 align:start position:0%
there is there is there any sort of you
 
01:39:12.629 --> 01:39:12.639 align:start position:0%
know trend line of um of of of spending
 
01:39:14.830 --> 01:39:14.840 align:start position:0%
that creates some sort of curve that
 
01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
that you might be able to um to
 
01:39:21.870 --> 01:39:21.880 align:start position:0%
project what you know what spending
 
01:39:24.629 --> 01:39:24.639 align:start position:0%
might be or what cost might be like at
 
01:39:27.870 --> 01:39:27.880 align:start position:0%
some of these levels below three and a
 
01:39:30.830 --> 01:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
half um and I guess this question myself
 
01:39:32.350 --> 01:39:32.360 align:start position:0%
for Becky um unless there's students
 
01:39:33.550 --> 01:39:33.560 align:start position:0%
unless there's invoices that are
 
01:39:36.229 --> 01:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
submitted into nessus for students who
 
01:39:38.709 --> 01:39:38.719 align:start position:0%
don't make it to that 70,000 cap is that
 
01:39:41.310 --> 01:39:41.320 align:start position:0%
the case I think but let me just clarify
 
01:39:42.589 --> 01:39:42.599 align:start position:0%
I think what you're asking is with the
 
01:39:44.870 --> 01:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
data we do have which is the 800 some
 
01:39:46.750 --> 01:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
odd students you're asking if there's a
 
01:39:48.589 --> 01:39:48.599 align:start position:0%
trend line within what they spent their
 
01:39:51.030 --> 01:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
funding on per child and the number of
 
01:39:52.510 --> 01:39:52.520 align:start position:0%
students and the number of students if
 
01:39:54.510 --> 01:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
we would be able to figure out and he's
 
01:39:55.870 --> 01:39:55.880 align:start position:0%
the money person I'm just interpreting
 
01:39:58.229 --> 01:39:58.239 align:start position:0%
what you said um if we would be able to
 
01:40:00.030 --> 01:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
figure out kind of a trend of what it
 
01:40:01.870 --> 01:40:01.880 align:start position:0%
might look like with more students it's
 
01:40:04.229 --> 01:40:04.239 align:start position:0%
a it's a it's a projection as an as an
 
01:40:07.229 --> 01:40:07.239 align:start position:0%
estimate so absent absent any data
 
01:40:10.189 --> 01:40:10.199 align:start position:0%
absent any data in that range um can we
 
01:40:13.310 --> 01:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
take the data we do have and somehow and
 
01:40:17.870 --> 01:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
somehow develop a a best guas projection
 
01:40:19.990 --> 01:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
we can certainly try uh I will go back
 
01:40:21.589 --> 01:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
to my to my team and see what we can
 
01:40:22.990 --> 01:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
come up with off top of my head I'm not
 
01:40:24.629 --> 01:40:24.639 align:start position:0%
too sure sure I can't speak to that but
 
01:40:25.830 --> 01:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
we can definitely that's that's a very
 
01:40:26.910 --> 01:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
high priority that's something that we
 
01:40:29.149 --> 01:40:29.159 align:start position:0%
would definitely try to move towards
 
01:40:30.830 --> 01:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I think I think a best guest
 
01:40:33.189 --> 01:40:33.199 align:start position:0%
would be helpful yeah if you could bring
 
01:40:35.629 --> 01:40:35.639 align:start position:0%
that we'd provide Donuts at the next
 
01:40:35.639 --> 01:40:39.310 align:start position:0%
that we'd provide Donuts at the next
meeting

01:40:39.310 --> 01:40:39.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:42.109 --> 01:40:42.119 align:start position:0%
yeah represent papovich thank you I'm
 
01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
just trying to build on what the
 
01:40:45.910 --> 01:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
representative luno is saying
 
01:40:48.229 --> 01:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
um completely acknowledge that you guys
 
01:40:50.790 --> 01:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
don't have the data for people under
 
01:40:54.470 --> 01:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
70k would it be useful if you identified
 
01:40:57.470 --> 01:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
maybe other states that have that data
 
01:40:59.870 --> 01:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
data available and look at their
 
01:41:01.550 --> 01:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
distribution in the coost Stranges
 
01:41:02.990 --> 01:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
obviously it's very hard to adjust for
 
01:41:05.149 --> 01:41:05.159 align:start position:0%
because they're highly Regional I'm sure
 
01:41:06.870 --> 01:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
that what they do in the South or the
 
01:41:09.750 --> 01:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
Northwest doesn't quite match to us but
 
01:41:11.470 --> 01:41:11.480 align:start position:0%
would that at least give you an idea of
 
01:41:14.589 --> 01:41:14.599 align:start position:0%
how you know those students would be
 
01:41:17.270 --> 01:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
distributed in the various categories
 
01:41:19.550 --> 01:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
just offering a thought if you find it
 
01:41:21.830 --> 01:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
useful I couldn't tell you for a fact
 
01:41:23.790 --> 01:41:23.800 align:start position:0%
that it will be useful but just
 
01:41:25.189 --> 01:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
kind of brainstorming you know work
 
01:41:27.669 --> 01:41:27.679 align:start position:0%
session you know so thank you yes that
 
01:41:30.550 --> 01:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
is worth pursuing so thank you there's
 
01:41:32.109 --> 01:41:32.119 align:start position:0%
other ways of addressing this issue if
 
01:41:34.669 --> 01:41:34.679 align:start position:0%
we don't get that data you know it the
 
01:41:37.990 --> 01:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
2080 ratio uh from six and a half or
 
01:41:39.790 --> 01:41:39.800 align:start position:0%
from three and a half up to 10 or the
 
01:41:42.669 --> 01:41:42.679 align:start position:0%
pration amount you can't prate anything
 
01:41:46.870 --> 01:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
less than x number percentage
 
01:41:49.470 --> 01:41:49.480 align:start position:0%
um CH
 
01:41:53.430 --> 01:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
GP so yeah that's an interesting yeah
 
01:41:55.270 --> 01:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
represent fellows yeah so if you're
 
01:41:57.550 --> 01:41:57.560 align:start position:0%
going to dig into the data I would think
 
01:42:00.990 --> 01:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
that it might be useful to separate out
 
01:42:03.310 --> 01:42:03.320 align:start position:0%
transportation from other services
 
01:42:05.070 --> 01:42:05.080 align:start position:0%
because we know that's a really huge
 
01:42:08.950 --> 01:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
chunk of money so and from the um when I
 
01:42:10.990 --> 01:42:11.000 align:start position:0%
looked at the information and just did a
 
01:42:13.270 --> 01:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
cursory it was about 12% of what we paid
 
01:42:16.470 --> 01:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:18.830 align:start position:0%
 
Aid

01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
Aid
 
01:42:21.870 --> 01:42:21.880 align:start position:0%
yes okay are there any other questions
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh at this point in time we're going to
 
01:42:25.629 --> 01:42:25.639 align:start position:0%
have another work session we're just
 
01:42:27.189 --> 01:42:27.199 align:start position:0%
wearing to I have a meeting I got to be
 
01:42:28.189 --> 01:42:28.199 align:start position:0%
at at 12
 
01:42:30.109 --> 01:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
o'clock um so we're going to have to
 
01:42:32.430 --> 01:42:32.440 align:start position:0%
quit here in 15 minutes or so but is
 
01:42:34.310 --> 01:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
there anything else we need to drive at
 
01:42:36.229 --> 01:42:36.239 align:start position:0%
or request of information from the
 
01:42:38.430 --> 01:42:38.440 align:start position:0%
Department so when we do have a next
 
01:42:43.189 --> 01:42:43.199 align:start position:0%
work session on special education Aid
 
01:42:45.510 --> 01:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
um yes re
 
01:42:48.310 --> 01:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
bilbury I'd like to just throw out two
 
01:42:51.470 --> 01:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
thoughts uh that we can all noodle on no
 
01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:53.679 align:start position:0%
specific proposal today but just the
 
01:42:56.070 --> 01:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
kinds of things I'm asking
 
01:42:59.830 --> 01:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
myself first of all I I view this whole
 
01:43:03.189 --> 01:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
Enterprise of how you gauge the way in
 
01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
which and the amount in which the state
 
01:43:07.669 --> 01:43:07.679 align:start position:0%
is going to support special ed education
 
01:43:10.430 --> 01:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
as like an insurance policy problem
 
01:43:12.950 --> 01:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
right and insurance policies are often a
 
01:43:17.189 --> 01:43:17.199 align:start position:0%
complicated mix of uh um co-pay and
 
01:43:19.589 --> 01:43:19.599 align:start position:0%
deductible and and in percentage of
 
01:43:22.189 --> 01:43:22.199 align:start position:0%
sharing and I'm sure that was what was
 
01:43:24.310 --> 01:43:24.320 align:start position:0%
the driving thought process when when
 
01:43:28.550 --> 01:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
all of this was first evolving so think
 
01:43:31.070 --> 01:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
like an insurance company does how do
 
01:43:34.550 --> 01:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
you take all of those moving parts and
 
01:43:37.070 --> 01:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
and shift them around um because it
 
01:43:39.070 --> 01:43:39.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily have to follow the
 
01:43:41.310 --> 01:43:41.320 align:start position:0%
construct that's in the law today there
 
01:43:44.149 --> 01:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
may be better more effective ways for
 
01:43:47.350 --> 01:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
the state to uh to shoulder its
 
01:43:49.510 --> 01:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
burden one of the things I'm thinking
 
01:43:53.870 --> 01:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
about for example is
 
01:43:55.790 --> 01:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
why don't we leave
 
01:44:00.589 --> 01:44:00.599 align:start position:0%
adequacy to focus on that um standard
 
01:44:03.669 --> 01:44:03.679 align:start position:0%
per student base
 
01:44:06.030 --> 01:44:06.040 align:start position:0%
adequacy maybe with adjustments for
 
01:44:10.430 --> 01:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
poverty and and uh in the poor towns but
 
01:44:13.550 --> 01:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
but not mix special education into
 
01:44:17.189 --> 01:44:17.199 align:start position:0%
that and then take the special education
 
01:44:21.430 --> 01:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
issue holistically on its own and ask
 
01:44:24.910 --> 01:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
ourselves what if if the basis of the
 
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
cad Aid is more like an insurance policy
 
01:44:30.109 --> 01:44:30.119 align:start position:0%
in the multiplier what if hypothetically
 
01:44:32.430 --> 01:44:32.440 align:start position:0%
we brought that multiplier all the way
 
01:44:36.070 --> 01:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
down to one and a half or two so now
 
01:44:38.430 --> 01:44:38.440 align:start position:0%
you're saying okay the district has to
 
01:44:40.470 --> 01:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
pay the first
 
01:44:42.750 --> 01:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
20,000 uh which is what it's paying for
 
01:44:45.430 --> 01:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
every student it's going to get the base
 
01:44:47.870 --> 01:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
adequacy for every student regardless of
 
01:44:49.470 --> 01:44:49.480 align:start position:0%
whether it's a special ed or
 
01:44:53.470 --> 01:44:53.480 align:start position:0%
not but with the special ed the State
 
01:44:57.550 --> 01:44:57.560 align:start position:0%
share is it 100% is it 8020 you know
 
01:44:59.910 --> 01:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
does that change in categories kicks in
 
01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:01.310 align:start position:0%
does that change in categories kicks in
much

01:45:01.310 --> 01:45:01.320 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
earlier so just food for thought these
 
01:45:06.790 --> 01:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
are the kinds of variables I'm trying to
 
01:45:10.910 --> 01:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
think and I'm not sure that uh that just
 
01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
amending the several laws we have by
 
01:45:14.990 --> 01:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
Shifting the numbers is really the right
 
01:45:16.950 --> 01:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
way to get to the best
 
01:45:21.070 --> 01:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
result thank you represent Burton yeah
 
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
when the augen committee which I was on
 
01:45:27.990 --> 01:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
co-chaired um we came up with 1.5 so in
 
01:45:32.229 --> 01:45:32.239 align:start position:0%
the augen bck formula the town got 1.5
 
01:45:35.189 --> 01:45:35.199 align:start position:0%
of the average cost for every special ed
 
01:45:39.350 --> 01:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
student and that's how we took care of
 
01:45:42.470 --> 01:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
special ed now it that was
 
01:45:44.870 --> 01:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
1985 but it was simple it worked and it
 
01:45:46.550 --> 01:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
was applied to every single town the
 
01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:51.070 align:start position:0%
was applied to every single town the
same

01:45:51.070 --> 01:45:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:53.870 --> 01:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
way okay so
 
01:45:56.229 --> 01:45:56.239 align:start position:0%
I want to thank
 
01:46:01.270 --> 01:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
uh Becky fet and Becky Wilson and and
 
01:46:04.830 --> 01:46:04.840 align:start position:0%
Brian Eaton here for coming today uh we
 
01:46:07.390 --> 01:46:07.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to we've taken notes here
 
01:46:09.310 --> 01:46:09.320 align:start position:0%
and we have some areas which we see
 
01:46:12.149 --> 01:46:12.159 align:start position:0%
there were questions and Concepts and
 
01:46:14.030 --> 01:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
elements that we want to pursue we're
 
01:46:15.750 --> 01:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
going to try to synthesize it down to
 
01:46:19.390 --> 01:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
that and then we'll share it with you
 
01:46:22.109 --> 01:46:22.119 align:start position:0%
and then uh hopefully we can get it get
 
01:46:23.790 --> 01:46:23.800 align:start position:0%
together again we we have to make some
 
01:46:27.870 --> 01:46:27.880 align:start position:0%
decisions on this in in short time by by
 
01:46:31.109 --> 01:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
the first week of March and so uh we
 
01:46:32.470 --> 01:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
have to March and we have a number of
 
01:46:34.950 --> 01:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
bills this is critical to both our
 
01:46:38.030 --> 01:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
funding formula and to the special
 
01:46:41.350 --> 01:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
education formula as well so thank you
 
01:46:44.550 --> 01:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
very much for coming today and have a
 
01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
good afternoon so
