00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 align:start position:0%
okay good morning
 
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 align:start position:0%
uh welcome to Edna this is a work
 
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 274 where we're
 
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 align:start position:0%
going to take a look and see what
 
00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 align:start position:0%
actions we need to take over the summer
 
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 align:start position:0%
the sponsor can't be here today she has
 
00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 align:start position:0%
a funeral so we're going to be um
 
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 align:start position:0%
just scoping out what is necessary here
 
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
and thanks to all the members of the
 
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
committee that showed up I'm
 
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
okay so any
 
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 align:start position:0%
do any members of the committee have
 
00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Schmidt I'm
 
00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 align:start position:0%
I just assume everybody pays attention
 
00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 align:start position:0%
yes representative Barona so my comments
 
00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 align:start position:0%
would be that the there needs to be
 
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 align:start position:0%
significant work on this bill
 
00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
and I believe that we would need to work
 
00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.449 align:start position:0%
with the
um

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 align:start position:0%
yes exactly thank you being this is my
 
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 align:start position:0%
first year on The Joint legislative
 
00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 align:start position:0%
committee on administrative rules and I
 
00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 align:start position:0%
see the importance that they put the
 
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 align:start position:0%
role that they play
 
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 align:start position:0%
and I think that the premise of gel car
 
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 align:start position:0%
is to
 
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 align:start position:0%
put together that represent the
 
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 align:start position:0%
legislative intent of the statute and it
 
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 align:start position:0%
is not for the interest of one party
 
00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 align:start position:0%
over the other and I just want to make
 
00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
sure that any type of
 
00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 align:start position:0%
um bias that we put that we don't put
 
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
well one one thing that we would
 
00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.789 align:start position:0%
well one one thing that we would
um

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 align:start position:0%
that I that was brought out by the staff
 
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
during the comment period was that the
 
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.469 align:start position:0%
during the comment period was that the
um

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
the proposed blocking by of a rule by a
 
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 align:start position:0%
committee rather than the Full House is
 
00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:40.969 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 align:start position:0%
if that's the concern then obviously
 
00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:49.259 align:start position:0%
we're not going to pass an
 
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional bill
 
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.129 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional bill
um

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
representative blackis just um what's
 
00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
the actual site for the part of the
 
00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
Constitution that applies to that I just
 
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question we'll have
 
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
to find that out
 
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.030 align:start position:0%
to find that out
um

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 align:start position:0%
uh Mr director Morrow has an answer for
 
00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
Madam chair uh for those of you who
 
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 align:start position:0%
don't know me I'm the director of the
 
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
administrative rules unit within the
 
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 align:start position:0%
office of legislative Services
 
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 align:start position:0%
I've worked for a gel car for 30 years
 
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 align:start position:0%
the sections of the constitution in
 
00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 align:start position:0%
question are 13 14 16 and 17. uh
 
00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
in 1981 the legislature was looking at
 
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
for control better oversight of
 
00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 align:start position:0%
administrative rules and it posed some
 
00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.539 align:start position:0%
questions to the Supreme Court about how
 
00:05:59.629 --> 00:05:59.639 align:start position:0%
they could do that and one of the
 
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 align:start position:0%
questions was whether they could have a
 
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 align:start position:0%
single committee whether it would be
 
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
delcar which didn't exist then or a
 
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 align:start position:0%
policy committee whether that committee
 
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 align:start position:0%
could simply deny the rule in other
 
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
words kill the rule right there and the
 
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.100 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court said no the entire
 
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 align:start position:0%
legislature had given agencies
 
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 align:start position:0%
rulemaking Authority and a single
 
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660 align:start position:0%
committee could not take that away it
 
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
would have to be an action of the entire
 
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.220 align:start position:0%
legislature which they have right now
 
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 align:start position:0%
through the joint resolution process
 
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.150 align:start position:0%
through the joint resolution process
okay

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
if I could
 
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
spoken like us yes
 
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:41.220 align:start position:0%

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair
 
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure we've all seen the letters
 
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
from various groupings that I contained
 
00:07:52.189 --> 00:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative schuette I'm
 
00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:53.340 align:start position:0%
sorry are you talking about the
 
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
constitutionality issue no I'm talking
 
00:07:58.909 --> 00:07:58.919 align:start position:0%
about the component units in in this in
 
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:00.660 align:start position:0%
that case representative Schmidt did you
 
00:08:02.689 --> 00:08:02.699 align:start position:0%
have a comment next
 
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
well I mean the the thing is I'm I look
 
00:08:08.809 --> 00:08:08.819 align:start position:0%
at as I look at at the bill
 
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
um I I see in early on uh either the
 
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
statements are made that uh just repeat
 
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
standing practice long time uh structure
 
00:08:25.369 --> 00:08:25.379 align:start position:0%
and so forth and so on uh I guess
 
00:08:27.409 --> 00:08:27.419 align:start position:0%
there's no harm in that it's kind of
 
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
like hammering on a nail that's already
 
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
flat but
 
00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.449 align:start position:0%
flat but
um

00:08:32.449 --> 00:08:32.459 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
but item four Roman four which is early
 
00:08:38.449 --> 00:08:38.459 align:start position:0%
on says the standing legislative policy
 
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:40.380 align:start position:0%
committee that originally passed the
 
00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:42.500 align:start position:0%
underlying statute
 
00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
should be given the opportunity to
 
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:46.860 align:start position:0%
review when he proposed rules to ensure
 
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:49.380 align:start position:0%
they do not exceed the original intent
 
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
and scope of the legislation and do not
 
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
impose excessive operational or
 
00:08:56.829 --> 00:08:56.839 align:start position:0%
financial burdens
 
00:08:58.850 --> 00:08:58.860 align:start position:0%
that sounds
 
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
like Common Sense except uh in my view
 
00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
that is completely unworkable uh because
 
00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:11.480 align:start position:0%
it is workable we have this year
 
00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
required the rulemaking register be sent
 
00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:17.100 align:start position:0%
to every member of the legislature and
 
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
if the committee's on policy when they
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
get the notice in the register that
 
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
rules are being written don't take any
 
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
action to review those rules it's not
 
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:28.980 align:start position:0%
the problem is with them and not with
 
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
the pers the procedures I think that
 
00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:33.660 align:start position:0%
observation is completely germane the
 
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
the point I'm raising is uh that the
 
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
legislature is basically only working
 
00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:41.540 align:start position:0%
from January
 
00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
until June in regular uh oversight
 
00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:49.940 align:start position:0%
mode if you will
 
00:09:53.329 --> 00:09:53.339 align:start position:0%
and the the rules are written on an
 
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:56.820 align:start position:0%
ongoing and reviewed and revised and so
 
00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
forth on an ongoing basis 12 months a
 
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
year the gel car meets every month at
 
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:06.180 align:start position:0%
least once and twice if necessary under
 
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
our workload
 
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
and so yeah a rule that's that comes out
 
00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:18.180 align:start position:0%
for review uh in the off months uh the
 
00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:20.700 align:start position:0%
the policy committee is not in session
 
00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:23.220 align:start position:0%
at that particular Point
 
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
um and I think that it's
 
00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:28.980 align:start position:0%
um uh now you're asking the policy
 
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
committee uh in what in whatever
 
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
form it is available at that particular
 
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:39.720 align:start position:0%
time to weigh in on something that the
 
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
whole committee may have had a part of
 
00:10:47.329 --> 00:10:47.339 align:start position:0%
in the January to June period but
 
00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
they're not there in let's say in August
 
00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
and therefore you're having a partial
 
00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:57.660 align:start position:0%
committee or no committee at all to
 
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
review it and the the
 
00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:05.480 align:start position:0%
rule that governs the gel car is that
 
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:09.420 align:start position:0%
they have a schedule a rule has to be
 
00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
taken up at the time that it comes
 
00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:12.980 align:start position:0%
before the jail car
 
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
and if it doesn't the gel car uh is is
 
00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:21.380 align:start position:0%
not able to to review it
 
00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:24.140 align:start position:0%
and then the rule goes into effect
 
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative Schmidt yes
 
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:29.220 align:start position:0%
there it there are difficulties but if
 
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
these if the policy committee
 
00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.470 align:start position:0%
these if the policy committee
okay

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:36.300 align:start position:0%
we all will be getting our emails and
 
00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:38.220 align:start position:0%
reading them over the summer you're
 
00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:40.500 align:start position:0%
talking about a two-month shutdown I
 
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
would expect that the committee chairs
 
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
of other policy committees will also be
 
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
doing that and if they don't if they
 
00:11:50.269 --> 00:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
consider the rules to be so unimportant
 
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
that they can't call a meeting of their
 
00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.170 align:start position:0%
that they can't call a meeting of their
committee

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:54.180 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
in in they can they can ask for
 
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
permission to meet they can do something
 
00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.230 align:start position:0%
permission to meet they can do something
uh

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:06.660 align:start position:0%
have a caucus or whatever
 
00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:08.940 align:start position:0%
and if they have a rule that is that
 
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
important to them that they have to
 
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
approve it more or less then they can
 
00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
get off their duffs and on vacation and
 
00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:19.380 align:start position:0%
schedule something if they uh my belief
 
00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:21.660 align:start position:0%
is that if they pass a law
 
00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:25.860 align:start position:0%
and and and ask for rules to be written
 
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
and then they don't pay any attention to
 
00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
what the agency's doing with the with to
 
00:12:33.949 --> 00:12:33.959 align:start position:0%
implement that law they can't consider
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
it that important
 
00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:39.300 align:start position:0%
yeah I I don't fundamentally disagree
 
00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
with that but the thing is that the
 
00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:46.380 align:start position:0%
current situation
 
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
um you know we have
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
the administrative rules unit which is
 
00:12:53.569 --> 00:12:53.579 align:start position:0%
intensely involved in the process of
 
00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
producing the rules in conjunction with
 
00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:02.820 align:start position:0%
the agency which has the expertise on
 
00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:05.700 align:start position:0%
the subject matter and which comes
 
00:13:08.329 --> 00:13:08.339 align:start position:0%
forward with a proposal and there is
 
00:13:10.009 --> 00:13:10.019 align:start position:0%
kind of a give and take back and forth
 
00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
between between them their rules writers
 
00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
and the administrative rules unit uh
 
00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
with you know as I say a give and take
 
00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:21.300 align:start position:0%
where my understanding is that the
 
00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
ministry of rules unit says well you
 
00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
know this is going to have a problem
 
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
with a gel car for X Y and Z
 
00:13:30.889 --> 00:13:30.899 align:start position:0%
however the
 
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
the rule making register comes out
 
00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
several months in advance of the gel car
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
meeting and the final review of the
 
00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:42.180 align:start position:0%
staff with the preliminary Rule and
 
00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:44.220 align:start position:0%
there is a public hearing after that
 
00:13:47.389 --> 00:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
time that's the time right after the
 
00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:49.980 align:start position:0%
register comes out for any member of the
 
00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:52.200 align:start position:0%
legislature who cares about the subject
 
00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
to read the rule and comment
 
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
goodness wouldn't you agree with that
 
00:13:59.329 --> 00:13:59.339 align:start position:0%
I'd absolutely agree that that is their
 
00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
opportunity well that's that's what
 
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
we've given them the chance we've we're
 
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
sending them in the register if they are
 
00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:07.980 align:start position:0%
choosing to ignore it they're they're
 
00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
saying that it's not worth their bother
 
00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:12.959 align:start position:0%
I think that's a fair interpretation but
 
00:14:15.829 --> 00:14:15.839 align:start position:0%
I think it's also a very effectively a
 
00:14:17.889 --> 00:14:17.899 align:start position:0%
very haphazard
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
situation I'm not saying that it
 
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
couldn't work and you couldn't get a
 
00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:25.260 align:start position:0%
useful input from uh from a member of
 
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
the policy committee correct but on the
 
00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
other hand the actions of the policy
 
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
committee are not set by law but by the
 
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
house rules
 
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
okay and it's up to the
 
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
to the committee chairs and the speaker
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
to determine what the committee is is
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
obligated to do the speaker has told me
 
00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:49.980 align:start position:0%
he intends to have set up a standing
 
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee in every policy committee
 
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
that will review rules and that is
 
00:14:57.889 --> 00:14:57.899 align:start position:0%
entirely within his scope
 
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
you know that the house rules say you
 
00:15:02.509 --> 00:15:02.519 align:start position:0%
you look at the you look at agency rules
 
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:04.740 align:start position:0%
when you're passing the laws to create
 
00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:06.050 align:start position:0%
when you're passing the laws to create
them

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:07.980 align:start position:0%
all right and I think that is the
 
00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:09.860 align:start position:0%
appropriate place to bring that into
 
00:15:12.769 --> 00:15:12.779 align:start position:0%
effect rather than in statute because we
 
00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
don't have to follow statute if we don't
 
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
want to for the most part
 
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
well I'm I I don't disagree with the
 
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
with the fundamental premise but I see
 
00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.530 align:start position:0%
with the fundamental premise but I see
representative

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:23.540 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:15:26.689 --> 00:15:26.699 align:start position:0%
I'll defer to him for the moment
 
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative I would say um you know
 
00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:31.980 align:start position:0%
even if uh representative Schmidt's
 
00:15:33.949 --> 00:15:33.959 align:start position:0%
correct and in most cases the committee
 
00:15:36.829 --> 00:15:36.839 align:start position:0%
won't take advantage the opportunity or
 
00:15:38.569 --> 00:15:38.579 align:start position:0%
exercise the responsibility to review
 
00:15:39.769 --> 00:15:39.779 align:start position:0%
the rules
 
00:15:42.769 --> 00:15:42.779 align:start position:0%
having a process set up where they can
 
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
and maybe be reminded they can I think
 
00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:48.060 align:start position:0%
would be useful even if it's only used
 
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
in extraordinary circumstances where
 
00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:51.660 align:start position:0%
there's something the committee really
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:58.730 --> 00:15:58.740 align:start position:0%
I I agree that the
 
00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:01.380 align:start position:0%
we can't force the legislative
 
00:16:03.949 --> 00:16:03.959 align:start position:0%
committees to take action
 
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm
 
00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
if you know a way to do that I'd love to
 
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
but we don't have that that Authority we
 
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:14.220 align:start position:0%
don't have that power
 
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
so the most we can do is to make sure
 
00:16:18.829 --> 00:16:18.839 align:start position:0%
they know about this stuff
 
00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:20.699 align:start position:0%
and force feeding them of the rule
 
00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
making register every week
 
00:16:26.329 --> 00:16:26.339 align:start position:0%
all right and if people look at it they
 
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
can identify either that their policy
 
00:16:32.269 --> 00:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
areas or things they know about from
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
their previous lives
 
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
which are pro which are probably at
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
least as useful because
 
00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.329 align:start position:0%
least as useful because
um

00:16:41.329 --> 00:16:41.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:43.079 align:start position:0%
you've got to know the context of the
 
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
rule in order to see what's going on
 
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:45.720 align:start position:0%
with it
 
00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:48.300 align:start position:0%
well I we can't force them to work and I
 
00:16:50.329 --> 00:16:50.339 align:start position:0%
agree we should take it out of here it
 
00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't belong in here
 
00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
okay I again I I think it you you get
 
00:17:01.069 --> 00:17:01.079 align:start position:0%
into a situation I mean one of one of
 
00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:03.060 align:start position:0%
the things that some of you know some of
 
00:17:05.329 --> 00:17:05.339 align:start position:0%
you don't know is representative McGuire
 
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
has been on the gel car for what 10 or
 
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
12 14 years I think and I've been on for
 
00:17:16.909 --> 00:17:16.919 align:start position:0%
like 18 years so we know that the rules
 
00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
don't look like statutes
 
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
they just don't
 
00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
um and that that's exactly why the
 
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
administrative rules unit has highly
 
00:17:28.669 --> 00:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
trained and experienced lawyers to
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
review the rules as they are written and
 
00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:34.380 align:start position:0%
whether they properly implement the
 
00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:35.960 align:start position:0%
statutes or
 
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
overreach the statutes and so forth
 
00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
that's their function and that's exactly
 
00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
their expertise now you're asking
 
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
legislators who by and large have no
 
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:47.640 align:start position:0%
experience with the rules to look at
 
00:17:50.029 --> 00:17:50.039 align:start position:0%
them and try and interpret them and so
 
00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
forth I think that's a little bit like
 
00:17:54.409 --> 00:17:54.419 align:start position:0%
having somebody who's looking at their
 
00:17:57.049 --> 00:17:57.059 align:start position:0%
first football game comment on the
 
00:17:59.150 --> 00:17:59.160 align:start position:0%
coach's strategy representative Schmidt
 
00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:01.740 align:start position:0%
the thing is that the rules apply to our
 
00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
citizens if the legislators can't read
 
00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
them and understand them nobody else can
 
00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.409 align:start position:0%
them and understand them nobody else can
either

00:18:09.409 --> 00:18:09.419 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
don't wouldn't you agree that the point
 
00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
of the rules is have something that the
 
00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:21.409 --> 00:18:21.419 align:start position:0%
yes but but they they are the the people
 
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
who are the practitioners of a
 
00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:25.799 align:start position:0%
particular trade or occupation
 
00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:28.700 align:start position:0%
they know and and and
 
00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
not an insignificant number of cases
 
00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:35.220 align:start position:0%
they are involved in the rule writing
 
00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:37.380 align:start position:0%
process because as the rules are written
 
00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:41.460 align:start position:0%
they see what that's going to do to them
 
00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:43.980 align:start position:0%
um and they and they do weigh in yeah
 
00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:46.380 align:start position:0%
and say this is not this is the way to
 
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
get the legislators to weigh in the same
 
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
way that the the affected population
 
00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
does because
 
00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:56.220 align:start position:0%
we may very well be in that affected
 
00:18:59.210 --> 00:18:59.220 align:start position:0%
population there's no reason we can't be
 
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
again I think that you're you're asking
 
00:19:06.049 --> 00:19:06.059 align:start position:0%
for uh legislators to weigh in
 
00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
and if they don't you're you've already
 
00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
comment on the fact that they don't care
 
00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:12.900 align:start position:0%
enough or whatever or they don't see a
 
00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:13.789 align:start position:0%
enough or whatever or they don't see a
problem

00:19:13.789 --> 00:19:13.799 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
they'll be silent and that that's a
 
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
tacit approval but I do think it creates
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
the haphazard situation where uh the
 
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
legislators are
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
um likely to be as not as knowledgeable
 
00:19:33.169 --> 00:19:33.179 align:start position:0%
as the stakeholders and the rural
 
00:19:36.289 --> 00:19:36.299 align:start position:0%
writers we have a haphazard situation
 
00:19:39.049 --> 00:19:39.059 align:start position:0%
now where the stakeholders may or may
 
00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:40.860 align:start position:0%
not notice that the rules are being
 
00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:46.799 align:start position:0%
some of them get very involved some of
 
00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
them get surprised and you've you've
 
00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
been at enough jail car meetings where
 
00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:52.919 align:start position:0%
someone affected by the rule comes in
 
00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure that we're not going to
 
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:02.820 align:start position:0%
we're never going to be able to develop
 
00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
a procedure where that doesn't happen
 
00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:09.289 align:start position:0%
a procedure where that doesn't happen
sometimes

00:20:09.289 --> 00:20:09.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
anyone else yes
 
00:20:15.169 --> 00:20:15.179 align:start position:0%
if the intent of legislation is to get
 
00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
the legislation to get the legislators
 
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
involved I think there's other ways of
 
00:20:21.409 --> 00:20:21.419 align:start position:0%
doing that right without writing law
 
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
yeah well like I said the speaker
 
00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
intends to set up subcommittees on the
 
00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
policy committees
 
00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
to do that which is
 
00:20:33.289 --> 00:20:33.299 align:start position:0%
probably a much more effective approach
 
00:20:36.049 --> 00:20:36.059 align:start position:0%
than just telling people the rules are
 
00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
coming out but
 
00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:41.820 align:start position:0%
that's his authority and not ours
 
00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:48.169 --> 00:20:48.179 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:20:51.669 --> 00:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
I can see the worth of having
 
00:20:54.049 --> 00:20:54.059 align:start position:0%
committees with expertise in various
 
00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
areas looking at rules I believe if I
 
00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
recall correctly
 
00:21:03.049 --> 00:21:03.059 align:start position:0%
an invitation was put out earlier this
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
session for individual legislators who
 
00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
were concerned to look at rules and in
 
00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
the process and as far as I heard hardly
 
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
any responded and I think that's what
 
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to find I think most
 
00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:20.820 align:start position:0%
legislators who serve on other
 
00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:23.820 align:start position:0%
committees are busy with their specific
 
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and are probably just
 
00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:29.940 align:start position:0%
as happy to leave the gel car committee
 
00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:32.580 align:start position:0%
deal with administrative Wellness I
 
00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:34.860 align:start position:0%
believe that's what you'll find that's
 
00:21:36.409 --> 00:21:36.419 align:start position:0%
what I have found is that they don't
 
00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:38.340 align:start position:0%
know they don't care about the rules or
 
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
they don't bother about the rules but
 
00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
that's what the sponsor is concerned
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
with that that
 
00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:47.940 align:start position:0%
there isn't it's oversight and I
 
00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:50.220 align:start position:0%
you know sometimes I agree with that it
 
00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:51.900 align:start position:0%
needs to be done and sometimes I think
 
00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
it's unnecessary but I I believe that
 
00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:56.940 align:start position:0%
all legislators should look at the rules
 
00:22:00.529 --> 00:22:00.539 align:start position:0%
and determine if there's an issue
 
00:22:03.529 --> 00:22:03.539 align:start position:0%
particularly if they've just spent
 
00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:07.140 align:start position:0%
a whole session writing a new law they
 
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
ought to be looking at how it's being
 
00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.250 align:start position:0%
ought to be looking at how it's being
implemented

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
but I can't force them to to do it
 
00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
that's why we've come in further uh you
 
00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:22.980 align:start position:0%
know you and I know from sitting at gel
 
00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:26.940 align:start position:0%
car meetings uh and I've I think I've I
 
00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:29.220 align:start position:0%
missed a couple of hours of one gel car
 
00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
meeting one time about 15 years ago but
 
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
otherwise I'm there at nine o'clock and
 
00:22:36.529 --> 00:22:36.539 align:start position:0%
I'm there until we're done
 
00:22:39.649 --> 00:22:39.659 align:start position:0%
um and and the one thing that I can
 
00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:41.820 align:start position:0%
comment with absolute certainty based on
 
00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
my nearly capitalist attendance is that
 
00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
legislators do not attend the jail care
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
meetings when the specific rule is
 
00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:55.500 align:start position:0%
coming up sometimes for the first time
 
00:22:58.370 --> 00:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
sometimes rules of course they since
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
they only have a 10-year period of
 
00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.169 align:start position:0%
they only have a 10-year period of
validity

00:23:03.169 --> 00:23:03.179 align:start position:0%
validity
 
00:23:07.029 --> 00:23:07.039 align:start position:0%
um the rules get re-adopted all the time
 
00:23:09.529 --> 00:23:09.539 align:start position:0%
in some permanent rules have gotten
 
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
adopted initially and never get looked
 
00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:14.700 align:start position:0%
at again unless unless the stature goes
 
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
out of goes out of the validity itself
 
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
whereas repealed but the bottom line is
 
00:23:24.169 --> 00:23:24.179 align:start position:0%
sometimes these rules are brand new
 
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
because it's a new statute
 
00:23:29.049 --> 00:23:29.059 align:start position:0%
and it's an opportunity for the
 
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
legislators to come in and comment at
 
00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
the very moment when the public is there
 
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
it's their golden opportunity
 
00:23:39.289 --> 00:23:39.299 align:start position:0%
we rarely see any member of the
 
00:23:42.289 --> 00:23:42.299 align:start position:0%
legislature I agree with you that that's
 
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
correct that's true I do think that it's
 
00:23:46.909 --> 00:23:46.919 align:start position:0%
much more effective for the legislators
 
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
in question
 
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
to comment to the rules and
 
00:23:54.649 --> 00:23:54.659 align:start position:0%
be at the public hearing on the
 
00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
preliminary rules because that's while
 
00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
the agency is still obliged to hear the
 
00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:02.149 align:start position:0%
the agency is still obliged to hear the
public

00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
and consider their comments in in
 
00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:07.380 align:start position:0%
adjusting the rules if the rules have
 
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
been so
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
if they've done their Duty can commented
 
00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:13.500 align:start position:0%
on the rules at that point they may be
 
00:24:17.149 --> 00:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
perfectly happy with the final proposal
 
00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:27.049 --> 00:24:27.059 align:start position:0%
I don't disagree with that either I
 
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
wonder I remember being at a board
 
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:33.900 align:start position:0%
meeting one time about a rule that was
 
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
upcoming and so forth
 
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
um that's uh one of the few times that
 
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
I've been there and I'm on the jail car
 
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
so I wonder to the administrator of the
 
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
rules unit who is participating in this
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
how often they see legislators present
 
00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
at those at that initial public hearing
 
00:24:57.649 --> 00:24:57.659 align:start position:0%
and I would ask them to believe that the
 
00:24:59.750 --> 00:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
gel car staff is at the initial public
 
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
hearing are you no they're not there
 
00:25:10.149 --> 00:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
yeah well
 
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
and I know that at least I have been
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
trying to train various groups of
 
00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:19.380 align:start position:0%
legislators how to read the rulemaking
 
00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:22.140 align:start position:0%
register and I know at least one person
 
00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
who read it and decided to comment on on
 
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
one set of rules that he that he knew
 
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
about from his own personal life
 
00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:34.919 align:start position:0%
but you know that's one out of 400.
 
00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:42.049 --> 00:25:42.059 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman RSA 541a right
 
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
now does allow for my office to attend
 
00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:49.380 align:start position:0%
agencies public hearings we haven't done
 
00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:50.940 align:start position:0%
that for some time because of the
 
00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:53.940 align:start position:0%
workload but with the staff now I would
 
00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
like to see us do some of that well
 
00:25:59.570 --> 00:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
particularly where we after looking at
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
to register we feel that it's an issue
 
00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:05.580 align:start position:0%
that may be complicated or contentious
 
00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
excellent I would hope you would use
 
00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.690 align:start position:0%
excellent I would hope you would use
your

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:08.700 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
that Authority and your staff time
 
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
wisely I mean
 
00:26:15.049 --> 00:26:15.059 align:start position:0%
you can't do everything all right anyone
 
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
else representative yeah I I was
 
00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
prepared for another argument looking
 
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
particularly at the elements of the bill
 
00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
itself and I admit that I did not look
 
00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:29.100 align:start position:0%
at it closely earlier in the session
 
00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:31.380 align:start position:0%
because it was stated pretty early on
 
00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
that it was going to be retained but
 
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
seeing the letters that we received
 
00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.470 align:start position:0%
seeing the letters that we received
recently

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
recently
 
00:26:42.529 --> 00:26:42.539 align:start position:0%
pertaining particularly to the repeal of
 
00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
exemptions from writing rules I do have
 
00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
concerns about these component units uh
 
00:26:54.409 --> 00:26:54.419 align:start position:0%
being included now in administrative
 
00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:56.700 align:start position:0%
rules I assume that's what the repeal
 
00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
would do I think as stated in a couple
 
00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
of the letters the
 
00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
legislative intent was clear when these
 
00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.710 align:start position:0%
legislative intent was clear when these
segments

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
segments
 
00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
and I I hesitate to even say of state
 
00:27:13.789 --> 00:27:13.799 align:start position:0%
government because they technically are
 
00:27:17.769 --> 00:27:17.779 align:start position:0%
not state agencies for my understanding
 
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
were Exempted from rules because they
 
00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
are not under the auspices of any of the
 
00:27:27.529 --> 00:27:27.539 align:start position:0%
executive branch or that's not who they
 
00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:32.220 align:start position:0%
report to and I I think that they should
 
00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
probably not be
 
00:27:39.049 --> 00:27:39.059 align:start position:0%
expected to do administrative rules and
 
00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:42.860 align:start position:0%
I'm further going on in those sections
 
00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:47.100 align:start position:0%
I'm curious about why those specific
 
00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:49.400 align:start position:0%
sections from Health and Human Services
 
00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
are also now now going I assume when
 
00:27:54.529 --> 00:27:54.539 align:start position:0%
they were first put in they were
 
00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:01.340 align:start position:0%
Exempted and that's Pages 15 and 16.
 
00:28:06.169 --> 00:28:06.179 align:start position:0%
Romans 19 20 and 21 I'm curious why they
 
00:28:08.769 --> 00:28:08.779 align:start position:0%
were Exempted and why they would now be
 
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
expected to do rules I am afraid I don't
 
00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:16.260 align:start position:0%
have an answer for that my my having
 
00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:24.649 --> 00:28:24.659 align:start position:0%
and I I honestly have to say that most
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
of them and I haven't examined a lot of
 
00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
the rest of the bill but were those
 
00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:32.220 align:start position:0%
concerns were rained raised I'm
 
00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:34.799 align:start position:0%
wondering if there are other sections
 
00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
that are questionable well yeah yeah I
 
00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:39.500 align:start position:0%
mean the
 
00:28:42.289 --> 00:28:42.299 align:start position:0%
adoption of the state fire code and the
 
00:28:45.529 --> 00:28:45.539 align:start position:0%
and the State Building Code
 
00:28:48.169 --> 00:28:48.179 align:start position:0%
I don't believe they go through 541 they
 
00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
they don't they should need to go
 
00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:53.220 align:start position:0%
through 541a and some of the technical
 
00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
ones from the Department of
 
00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.169 align:start position:0%
ones from the Department of
Transportation

00:28:57.169 --> 00:28:57.179 align:start position:0%
Transportation
 
00:28:57.179 --> 00:28:58.970 align:start position:0%
Transportation
um

00:28:58.970 --> 00:28:58.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
State speed zones and excavation permits
 
00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:07.740 align:start position:0%
on the on the highway I mean that's
 
00:29:09.649 --> 00:29:09.659 align:start position:0%
don't need to go through rules for that
 
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:16.669 --> 00:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
so anyway yes I I don't expect
 
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
I will say to everybody that this bill
 
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
is not going to go forward as is written
 
00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:23.340 align:start position:0%
I expect we're going to take a lot of
 
00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:25.620 align:start position:0%
these elements out of it
 
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:33.529 --> 00:29:33.539 align:start position:0%
I want to know which other ones are our
 
00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
issues and these exemptions are all need
 
00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:38.460 align:start position:0%
to be I think would need to be looked at
 
00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
anyone representative Lucas on on this
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
issue I looked through it and well I
 
00:29:50.269 --> 00:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
didn't look at each one of them and see
 
00:29:52.669 --> 00:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
what they all had to do with I did look
 
00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
at at particularly the ones we got email
 
00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:55.909 align:start position:0%
at at particularly the ones we got email
on

00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:30:00.529 --> 00:30:00.539 align:start position:0%
I have kind of a larger question on that
 
00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:03.240 align:start position:0%
we from one of the organizations I said
 
00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:05.100 align:start position:0%
they you know they're not part of the
 
00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
state government they
 
00:30:09.409 --> 00:30:09.419 align:start position:0%
uh State doesn't pay anything they're
 
00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:11.100 align:start position:0%
not part of the pension system all that
 
00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:12.169 align:start position:0%
not part of the pension system all that
stuff

00:30:12.169 --> 00:30:12.179 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
so my question is
 
00:30:16.909 --> 00:30:16.919 align:start position:0%
what is their association with the state
 
00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
why are they
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
why are they not just like any other
 
00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:22.980 align:start position:0%
non-profit registered with the secretary
 
00:30:24.769 --> 00:30:24.779 align:start position:0%
of state and operate independently other
 
00:30:26.029 --> 00:30:26.039 align:start position:0%
than you know whatever those
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
requirements are and and you know if
 
00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
they were doing that then obviously they
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be part of the administrative
 
00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:35.100 align:start position:0%
rule process but since they are somehow
 
00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:37.620 align:start position:0%
affiliated with the state I'd like to at
 
00:30:38.649 --> 00:30:38.659 align:start position:0%
least understand
 
00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:41.340 align:start position:0%
what that why that affiliation is there
 
00:30:43.549 --> 00:30:43.559 align:start position:0%
what is it and then maybe then I could
 
00:30:45.169 --> 00:30:45.179 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not having them part
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
of the rules process made any sense
 
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
excellent question you know why are they
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
in statute if they're not part of state
 
00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:53.389 align:start position:0%
in statute if they're not part of state
government

00:30:53.389 --> 00:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:55.140 align:start position:0%
is there anyone who would be able to
 
00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
answer that question
 
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
please can identify yourself and
 
00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:06.889 --> 00:31:06.899 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair my name is Ben
 
00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
Frost I'm the deputy executive director
 
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
and chief legal officer of the New
 
00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing Finance Authority and
 
00:31:15.649 --> 00:31:15.659 align:start position:0%
we are one of those entities that
 
00:31:18.529 --> 00:31:18.539 align:start position:0%
submitted to you a letter expressing our
 
00:31:21.529 --> 00:31:21.539 align:start position:0%
very serious concerns about the repeal
 
00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:23.820 align:start position:0%
of our rulemaking exemption
 
00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:26.700 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire housing was created by the
 
00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
legislature in 1981 with the passage of
 
00:31:33.769 --> 00:31:33.779 align:start position:0%
RSA chapter 204 C
 
00:31:36.289 --> 00:31:36.299 align:start position:0%
uh and that that accomplished the
 
00:31:39.409 --> 00:31:39.419 align:start position:0%
combination of two pre-existing State
 
00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:41.460 align:start position:0%
entities the New Hampshire Housing
 
00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:43.140 align:start position:0%
Commission and the New Hampshire housing
 
00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:44.389 align:start position:0%
Commission and the New Hampshire housing
agency

00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
agency
 
00:31:48.289 --> 00:31:48.299 align:start position:0%
and this follows a pattern uh employed
 
00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
by many states in fact there are 42
 
00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:55.020 align:start position:0%
similar organizations in other states
 
00:31:57.529 --> 00:31:57.539 align:start position:0%
State Housing Finance agencies or
 
00:31:57.539 --> 00:31:58.850 align:start position:0%
State Housing Finance agencies or
authorities

00:31:58.850 --> 00:31:58.860 align:start position:0%
authorities
 
00:32:02.649 --> 00:32:02.659 align:start position:0%
we were created by the legislature
 
00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:06.440 align:start position:0%
to perform and our statute says
 
00:32:09.889 --> 00:32:09.899 align:start position:0%
essential governmental functions
 
00:32:12.529 --> 00:32:12.539 align:start position:0%
but to operate with a high degree of
 
00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:16.500 align:start position:0%
autonomy from the state so that we can
 
00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:17.510 align:start position:0%
autonomy from the state so that we can
act

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
act
 
00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:21.620 align:start position:0%
in essence as a private Market actor
 
00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
so for example we at New Hampshire
 
00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
housing do single-family mortgage
 
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
lending and we occupy a space of between
 
00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
five and ten percent of the state's
 
00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:34.860 align:start position:0%
mortgage lending
 
00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:38.460 align:start position:0%
our focus is on areas where the private
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
Market itself has some difficulty
 
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
operating and that is with regard to say
 
00:32:45.289 --> 00:32:45.299 align:start position:0%
that the first time home buyer people
 
00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:47.220 align:start position:0%
who don't have
 
00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
um a lot of money to make uh you know a
 
00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:52.860 align:start position:0%
20 down payment and who are you know
 
00:32:54.649 --> 00:32:54.659 align:start position:0%
saddled with lots of other debt like
 
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
student debt but who are in a good
 
00:32:59.750 --> 00:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
financial position and
 
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
um but for the lack of capital in the
 
00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:05.940 align:start position:0%
private Market would be able to buy a
 
00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:08.700 align:start position:0%
home and do because of the products that
 
00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
we're able to offer
 
00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:12.110 align:start position:0%
we're able to offer
um

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:14.389 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:16.260 align:start position:0%
so we've talked about single family
 
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
lending we also administer a variety of
 
00:33:21.289 --> 00:33:21.299 align:start position:0%
federal programs which are uniquely
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
tailored by federal law to be run by
 
00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:28.740 align:start position:0%
state Housing Finance agencies so as a
 
00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:32.460 align:start position:0%
a governmental actor but not strictly
 
00:33:34.909 --> 00:33:34.919 align:start position:0%
speaking part of state government we're
 
00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
not a state agency we're not and the the
 
00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:40.559 align:start position:0%
component units statute which was
 
00:33:43.389 --> 00:33:43.399 align:start position:0%
adopted by the legislature in 2018
 
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:46.559 align:start position:0%
clearly identifies us as
 
00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
part of state government but not part of
 
00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:52.380 align:start position:0%
the Executive Branch the legislative
 
00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
representative so you have a follow-up
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you so
 
00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.730 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you so
um

00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:01.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:04.669 --> 00:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
you know other than you mentioned
 
00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:07.620 align:start position:0%
um some federal programs that you end up
 
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
being involved in I guess administering
 
00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:11.720 align:start position:0%
at the state level
 
00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:14.460 align:start position:0%
what else is it
 
00:34:16.970 --> 00:34:16.980 align:start position:0%
about what you do that would require you
 
00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
to be a creature basically of the state
 
00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
or however you want to put it and rather
 
00:34:24.349 --> 00:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
than just a an independent non-profit or
 
00:34:24.359 --> 00:34:25.149 align:start position:0%
than just a an independent non-profit or
whatever

00:34:25.149 --> 00:34:25.159 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
no that's it's a great question and it
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
is kind of a a legal structure that is
 
00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:35.700 align:start position:0%
required for us to be eligible for a
 
00:34:38.089 --> 00:34:38.099 align:start position:0%
certain funding sources from the federal
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
government so we have uh and and we
 
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
share this New Hampshire housing share
 
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
that shares this with the the business
 
00:34:46.849 --> 00:34:46.859 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority and I'll identify a
 
00:34:48.169 --> 00:34:48.179 align:start position:0%
couple of my colleagues James key
 
00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:50.220 align:start position:0%
Wallace is the executive director of the
 
00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:51.899 align:start position:0%
business Finance Authority he's behind
 
00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:54.060 align:start position:0%
me Bonnie Payette is the executive
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
director of the health and education
 
00:34:57.890 --> 00:34:57.900 align:start position:0%
facilities Authority also here
 
00:35:02.089 --> 00:35:02.099 align:start position:0%
uh we have similar structures with the
 
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
with the business Finance Authority New
 
00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:06.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing shares the state's
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
allocation of tax exempt Municipal
 
00:35:12.589 --> 00:35:12.599 align:start position:0%
bonding Authority uh and that that has
 
00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:14.940 align:start position:0%
to be exercised by a governmental entity
 
00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:17.940 align:start position:0%
and so we we split that Authority and
 
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
the BFA does commercial lending uh and
 
00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire housing does housing
 
00:35:26.329 --> 00:35:26.339 align:start position:0%
lending so with that capacity to do
 
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
tax-exempt bonding we are able to
 
00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
finance the development of affordable
 
00:35:35.089 --> 00:35:35.099 align:start position:0%
rental housing that otherwise would not
 
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
get built follow-up
 
00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
my question my final question is just um
 
00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:42.780 align:start position:0%
so does the New Hampshire Housing
 
00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:44.820 align:start position:0%
Authority Finance Authority receive any
 
00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:45.710 align:start position:0%
Authority Finance Authority receive any
money

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:45.720 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
from the state other than maybe pass
 
00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
through from the federal government
 
00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:54.900 align:start position:0%
we do we do not receive any operating
 
00:35:57.050 --> 00:35:57.060 align:start position:0%
funds from the state
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
so we are entirely funded through the
 
00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:01.980 align:start position:0%
programs that we administer the funding
 
00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:03.900 align:start position:0%
that we have received from the state is
 
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
the state's affordable housing trust
 
00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:06.770 align:start position:0%
the state's affordable housing trust
fund

00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:06.780 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:09.839 align:start position:0%
uh and that is in our Statute in RSA
 
00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
204c and you'll recall in this year's
 
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 there was a 25 million
 
00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:19.140 align:start position:0%
dollar allocation to an appropriation to
 
00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
the affordable housing fund so that is a
 
00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:23.820 align:start position:0%
the state's affordable housing trust
 
00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
fund that we administer on behalf of the
 
00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
state we are by Statute
 
00:36:29.119 --> 00:36:30.650 align:start position:0%
state we are by Statute
authorized

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:30.660 align:start position:0%
authorized
 
00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
to take I think
 
00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
8.3 percent of interest income
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
from that but we have never done that
 
00:36:43.069 --> 00:36:43.079 align:start position:0%
all of the money goes to development all
 
00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
right thank you
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
so if I understand you correctly
 
00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:49.069 align:start position:0%
so if I understand you correctly
your

00:36:49.069 --> 00:36:49.079 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
not quite part of state government
 
00:36:54.109 --> 00:36:54.119 align:start position:0%
structure is primarily to deal with the
 
00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:56.460 align:start position:0%
federal government and their rules and
 
00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:58.510 align:start position:0%
federal government and their rules and
regulations

00:36:58.510 --> 00:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
Computing tax-exempt financing Madam
 
00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
chair that is that is true uh
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
but it also gives us the flexibility to
 
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
do things that
 
00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
um honestly it's difficult for the state
 
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
to do so if there's
 
00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
um I'll give you an example the uh arpa
 
00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:23.700 align:start position:0%
funded invest NH initiative of of the
 
00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
governor I and I know you're shaking
 
00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:26.820 align:start position:0%
your head
 
00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:29.460 align:start position:0%
um uh once that has gone through
 
00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:32.940 align:start position:0%
governor and Council and Joint fiscal
 
00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:34.130 align:start position:0%
governor and Council and Joint fiscal
committee

00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:34.140 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
um then a a contract to us to administer
 
00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
funds doesn't need to go back to GNC for
 
00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:43.140 align:start position:0%
further approval we're able to work with
 
00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:46.980 align:start position:0%
developers very flexibly to come to
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
terms of development that would be
 
00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate for them so that that's an
 
00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
area where a state agency has great
 
00:37:56.089 --> 00:37:56.099 align:start position:0%
difficulty operating
 
00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
but the only reason you're even
 
00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:00.180 align:start position:0%
affiliated with the state rather than
 
00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:01.940 align:start position:0%
being a
 
00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:04.980 align:start position:0%
not-for-profit housing lender is because
 
00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:07.140 align:start position:0%
the federal government requires you you
 
00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
I suppose uh I will concede that point I
 
00:38:15.849 --> 00:38:15.859 align:start position:0%
I think fundamentally and historically
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
that is the basis of our existence okay
 
00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:22.380 align:start position:0%
well I'm we're quite used to seeing
 
00:38:24.589 --> 00:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
Federal red tape and strings attached
 
00:38:26.329 --> 00:38:26.339 align:start position:0%
all over the place this is just yet
 
00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:28.260 align:start position:0%
another example
 
00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:29.820 align:start position:0%
uh there
 
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:39.069 --> 00:38:39.079 align:start position:0%
I guess my question is the main
 
00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
difficulty you have with this particular
 
00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:45.020 align:start position:0%
bill is what they wanted to add where
 
00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:49.020 align:start position:0%
you would have the the money if you
 
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
should fail or something should not work
 
00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:54.900 align:start position:0%
out the state would have to pick up
 
00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
ear debt and that's what we want to get
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
rid of because the state doesn't want
 
00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:02.540 align:start position:0%
that responsibility
 
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
that that's a great Point great question
 
00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
and we do address that in our letter and
 
00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:09.660 align:start position:0%
I think each of the letters from our
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
agencies identifies something similar
 
00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:13.849 align:start position:0%
agencies identifies something similar
um

00:39:13.849 --> 00:39:13.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:16.089 --> 00:39:16.099 align:start position:0%
as things stand
 
00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:17.940 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:21.780 align:start position:0%
clearly legally is not responsible for
 
00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:22.980 align:start position:0%
our debt
 
00:39:26.089 --> 00:39:26.099 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire housing has currently
 
00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
about a half a billion dollars of debt
 
00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:30.780 align:start position:0%
that varies over time depending upon
 
00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:32.820 align:start position:0%
which programs we're using it has been
 
00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
well in excess of a billion dollars at
 
00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:39.180 align:start position:0%
at some times in the past the BFA has
 
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
substantially larger debt as does as
 
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
does the health and education facilities
 
00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.530 align:start position:0%
does the health and education facilities
Authority

00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:48.060 align:start position:0%
um and as things are structured right
 
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
now uh that debt clearly is not legally
 
00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:55.260 align:start position:0%
attributable to the state
 
00:39:58.250 --> 00:39:58.260 align:start position:0%
because of the wall that exists between
 
00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
the state proper and our entities our as
 
00:40:08.089 --> 00:40:08.099 align:start position:0%
uh creatures of statute
 
00:40:10.609 --> 00:40:10.619 align:start position:0%
once that wall starts to be taken down
 
00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:13.980 align:start position:0%
then it is more difficult for the state
 
00:40:17.569 --> 00:40:17.579 align:start position:0%
to disavow that debt
 
00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:20.460 align:start position:0%
that's what I thought okay thank you
 
00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:21.890 align:start position:0%
that's what I thought okay thank you
um

00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:21.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
regarding this debt you say you can
 
00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:26.940 align:start position:0%
issue some portion of state tax exempt
 
00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
debt is is your debt backed by the full
 
00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
faith of the state no
 
00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:34.380 align:start position:0%
okay it is not
 
00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:37.500 align:start position:0%
good otherwise you're wouldn't it would
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
make a difference okay any other
 
00:40:39.359 --> 00:40:40.730 align:start position:0%
make a difference okay any other
questions

00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:40.740 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
comments all right
 
00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair all right thank
 
00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
any other concerns or issues
 
00:40:55.970 --> 00:40:55.980 align:start position:0%
representative blackis yep um one sort
 
00:40:59.630 --> 00:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
of minor knit on page eight
 
00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:02.700 align:start position:0%
uh let me get the line here
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
on page 8 line 31
 
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
um it references subparagraphs to c and
 
00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
e and immediately prior to that it
 
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
actually uh eliminates section e so
 
00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
if we go anywhere with this that's a
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
minor thing that should be fixed
 
00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:20.820 align:start position:0%
oh okay thank you very much and then
 
00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:22.550 align:start position:0%
oh okay thank you very much and then
um

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:25.140 align:start position:0%
sort of a more General thing on page
 
00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:26.450 align:start position:0%
sort of a more General thing on page
seven

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:26.460 align:start position:0%
seven
 
00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:29.460 align:start position:0%
starting line 17 or 18.
 
00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:31.880 align:start position:0%
this is about
 
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
things that are Incorporated by
 
00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:36.540 align:start position:0%
reference and rules
 
00:41:38.329 --> 00:41:38.339 align:start position:0%
um you know the agency has to or the
 
00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
adopting Authority has to explain how
 
00:41:41.569 --> 00:41:41.579 align:start position:0%
the text of the Incorporated document or
 
00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
Internet content can be obtained by the
 
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
public and at what cost
 
00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:47.940 align:start position:0%
and I know this isn't changed as part of
 
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
this bill but um
 
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
the idea that the state's going to
 
00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:54.660 align:start position:0%
promulgate rules that apply to citizens
 
00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
to the state and they're going to have
 
00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
to pay to find out what those rules are
 
00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:00.050 align:start position:0%
to pay to find out what those rules are
is

00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:00.060 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:10.500 align:start position:0%
and then one final one which is the
 
00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:13.260 align:start position:0%
various places here it talks about you
 
00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:19.380 align:start position:0%
um do any retaliation if people object
 
00:42:20.569 --> 00:42:20.579 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
00:42:20.579 --> 00:42:21.410 align:start position:0%
or whatever
um

00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:21.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:23.220 align:start position:0%
on rules and there was actually one bit
 
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
that was already in there but there's at
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
least a couple that are being added I
 
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
guess the general question is um
 
00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
you know if there is an accusation of
 
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
that or someone thinks they've been
 
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
retaliated against what's the process
 
00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:37.500 align:start position:0%
for them to uh seek a remedy what's I
 
00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:38.820 align:start position:0%
mean putting things in where there's no
 
00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:40.069 align:start position:0%
mean putting things in where there's no
enforcement

00:42:40.069 --> 00:42:40.079 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean anything
 
00:42:48.829 --> 00:42:48.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:50.820 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:52.380 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:54.900 align:start position:0%
um so I
 
00:42:58.550 --> 00:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
um I've slightly addressed this uh in
 
00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
some aspect of my earlier remarks but uh
 
00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:06.540 align:start position:0%
one of the proposals in this in this
 
00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:11.540 align:start position:0%
bill is in Roman 3
 
00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
the committee shall hold public hearings
 
00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
on a proposed or previously adopted rule
 
00:43:20.809 --> 00:43:20.819 align:start position:0%
on its own initiative and the change
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
there or the the point there is that the
 
00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
current statute already says the
 
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
committee May hold
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
so now we're going from May to Shell
 
00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:33.900 align:start position:0%
which means that the committee is now
 
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
obligated to hold meetings on
 
00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:40.700 align:start position:0%
proposal previously had
 
00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:44.940 align:start position:0%
I I wonder whether the administrative
 
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
rules unit can tell us about any
 
00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:49.390 align:start position:0%
rules unit can tell us about any
previous

00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:49.400 align:start position:0%
previous
 
00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:52.740 align:start position:0%
iterations of this concept under the
 
00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:55.740 align:start position:0%
existing statute which says they made to
 
00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
do so my my belief would be that that
 
00:44:03.309 --> 00:44:03.319 align:start position:0%
ain't happening ain't never happened
 
00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:07.140 align:start position:0%
with any degree of regularity and now to
 
00:44:09.710 --> 00:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
tell the policy committees that they
 
00:44:11.530 --> 00:44:11.540 align:start position:0%
shall be holding
 
00:44:15.370 --> 00:44:15.380 align:start position:0%
hearings on this is to ask
 
00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:18.300 align:start position:0%
effectively that the Committees lift
 
00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:21.900 align:start position:0%
themselves up by their own bootstraps
 
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
I I tend to agree with you that that
 
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
I've never heard of that that sort of
 
00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.069 align:start position:0%
I've never heard of that that sort of
thing

00:44:28.069 --> 00:44:28.079 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
representative I think it was tried
 
00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:41.809 --> 00:44:41.819 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
um in the past there have been
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
just a handful of instances where a gel
 
00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:51.180 align:start position:0%
car and staff would look at already
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
adopted rules it was a very rare
 
00:44:56.690 --> 00:44:56.700 align:start position:0%
occurrence to require this could be a
 
00:44:58.430 --> 00:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
huge problem it would definitely be a
 
00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
huge undertaking because there are
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
thousands of pages of rules in state in
 
00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
fact Health and Human Services probably
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
has a few thousand by itself because of
 
00:45:08.569 --> 00:45:08.579 align:start position:0%
its relationship with the federal
 
00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
government and Medicare
 
00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:11.990 align:start position:0%
government and Medicare
um

00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
and it would create create a tremendous
 
00:45:18.589 --> 00:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
burden for my office and for gel car to
 
00:45:23.109 --> 00:45:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:25.849 --> 00:45:25.859 align:start position:0%
where the chair's permission well I
 
00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
would ask would you like me to go back
 
00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
over some of the issues that I had
 
00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:37.069 --> 00:45:37.079 align:start position:0%
if I have your comments right here okay
 
00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:39.300 align:start position:0%
um is there any any highlights that you
 
00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:41.700 align:start position:0%
think are
 
00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
that are vital
 
00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
um beside the constitutionality
 
00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:48.170 align:start position:0%
um beside the constitutionality
um

00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:48.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:50.220 align:start position:0%
well there's another constitutional
 
00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:51.309 align:start position:0%
well there's another constitutional
issue

00:45:51.309 --> 00:45:51.319 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
right now under the current law for
 
00:45:57.309 --> 00:45:57.319 align:start position:0%
example for joint resolutions there are
 
00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:00.180 align:start position:0%
requirements that the legislature act on
 
00:46:01.849 --> 00:46:01.859 align:start position:0%
those joint resolutions when the certain
 
00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
time frame
 
00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:06.540 align:start position:0%
that was put into 541a over 20 years ago
 
00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:10.140 align:start position:0%
the reason being is that if gel Carr
 
00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
voted to
 
00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
um for our joint res to make a motion
 
00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:16.260 align:start position:0%
for a joint resolution
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
and then just sat on it or if it was
 
00:46:21.410 --> 00:46:21.420 align:start position:0%
sent to the entire legislature and the
 
00:46:24.109 --> 00:46:24.119 align:start position:0%
legislature sat on it it would actually
 
00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
become a pocket veto of the rule and
 
00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:31.740 align:start position:0%
that would be unconstitutional
 
00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:36.660 align:start position:0%
and this rule um under this uh bill that
 
00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
would be allowed
 
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.309 align:start position:0%
would be allowed
um

00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:41.700 align:start position:0%
there's many places where there's
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
conflicting language that would limit or
 
00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:47.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:48.829 --> 00:46:48.839 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of new terms like
 
00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:51.720 align:start position:0%
substantial operational impact and
 
00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:54.420 align:start position:0%
excessive burdens that aren't clarified
 
00:47:05.329 --> 00:47:05.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
one major factor is that right now gel
 
00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:12.540 align:start position:0%
carb May object when a basis exists and
 
00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:14.940 align:start position:0%
while gel car is an oversight they don't
 
00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
vote on policy but there are times they
 
00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:20.220 align:start position:0%
can still extend practical
 
00:47:23.089 --> 00:47:23.099 align:start position:0%
considerations to a rule there may be a
 
00:47:26.569 --> 00:47:26.579 align:start position:0%
rule that has very minor issue but gel
 
00:47:30.349 --> 00:47:30.359 align:start position:0%
Carr realizes that to object and delay
 
00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:32.940 align:start position:0%
the rule is going to cause more severe
 
00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:35.420 align:start position:0%
problems than to
 
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
if they do enter the objection I
 
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
remember an instance where Environmental
 
00:47:43.309 --> 00:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
Services had to meet a federal deadline
 
00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:45.300 align:start position:0%
or they were going to lose a substantial
 
00:47:47.329 --> 00:47:47.339 align:start position:0%
amount of money there was a minor issue
 
00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:49.380 align:start position:0%
with the rule but the committee chose
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
not to object because of the financial
 
00:47:52.319 --> 00:47:53.950 align:start position:0%
not to object because of the financial
Factor

00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:53.960 align:start position:0%
Factor
 
00:47:57.290 --> 00:47:57.300 align:start position:0%
this would require gel car to object in
 
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
all instances by changing made shell and
 
00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
frankly when we review the rule for the
 
00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:06.540 align:start position:0%
committee it's statutorily required for
 
00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
us to raise any potential basis for
 
00:48:12.109 --> 00:48:12.119 align:start position:0%
objection we know from practice that
 
00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:13.380 align:start position:0%
there are things that the committee
 
00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:15.780 align:start position:0%
would never object to are very unlikely
 
00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
to object to but they would be required
 
00:48:20.569 --> 00:48:20.579 align:start position:0%
to object to it now even if it's
 
00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
editorial punctuation issue or something
 
00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:25.140 align:start position:0%
technically that violates the rulemaking
 
00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:27.900 align:start position:0%
manual violation of the manual violates
 
00:48:30.109 --> 00:48:30.119 align:start position:0%
RSA 541a8
 
00:48:33.829 --> 00:48:33.839 align:start position:0%
so that would create quite a problem Oh
 
00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:35.220 align:start position:0%
I absolutely
 
00:48:37.849 --> 00:48:37.859 align:start position:0%
if nothing else but this year we've
 
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
we've seen that in many many cases where
 
00:48:43.609 --> 00:48:43.619 align:start position:0%
there was a conflict of fee Authority
 
00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
for for licensing agencies and we knew
 
00:48:49.849 --> 00:48:49.859 align:start position:0%
that a legislative
 
00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
fix was in process but it was not yet
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
effective we would not want to object to
 
00:48:58.609 --> 00:48:58.619 align:start position:0%
any of the rules because they were
 
00:49:01.790 --> 00:49:01.800 align:start position:0%
essentially in line with the forward
 
00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
legislative intent
 
00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:06.540 align:start position:0%
unless there were other reasons too of
 
00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:08.210 align:start position:0%
unless there were other reasons too of
course

00:49:08.210 --> 00:49:08.220 align:start position:0%
course
 
00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
one other point that I would raise final
 
00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:11.690 align:start position:0%
one other point that I would raise final
Point

00:49:11.690 --> 00:49:11.700 align:start position:0%
Point
 
00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:12.349 align:start position:0%
Point
um

00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:17.089 --> 00:49:17.099 align:start position:0%
by having the lead gel car or any
 
00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:21.540 align:start position:0%
standing committee look at a policy I
 
00:49:23.569 --> 00:49:23.579 align:start position:0%
mean gel car already looks to see not
 
00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:26.220 align:start position:0%
for policy but to see whether a rule
 
00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:28.260 align:start position:0%
conforms with legislative intent in
 
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
other words with the statute it's rare
 
00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
that it goes beyond that there are
 
00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
instances where we would look up a
 
00:49:38.210 --> 00:49:38.220 align:start position:0%
legislative history to get some language
 
00:49:41.089 --> 00:49:41.099 align:start position:0%
on intent but this would allow for
 
00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:46.260 align:start position:0%
example for a Edna to look at a rule a
 
00:49:48.829 --> 00:49:48.839 align:start position:0%
new uh say an amended rule a rule that's
 
00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
been in existence for 20 years and then
 
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
that committee whether gel car or the
 
00:49:57.109 --> 00:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
standing committee could say no we don't
 
00:49:58.730 --> 00:49:58.740 align:start position:0%
think this conforms with the legislative
 
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
intent well my question would be how
 
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
does the legislative committee today
 
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
determine what the intent of the bill
 
00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
was that came through 20 or 30 years ago
 
00:50:11.329 --> 00:50:11.339 align:start position:0%
that gave the statutory authority to the
 
00:50:11.339 --> 00:50:14.650 align:start position:0%
that gave the statutory authority to the
agency

00:50:14.650 --> 00:50:14.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:24.130 --> 00:50:24.140 align:start position:0%
thank you so it to me the the the
 
00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
fundamental issue here is whether we
 
00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:31.940 align:start position:0%
currently have a situation which is
 
00:50:34.210 --> 00:50:34.220 align:start position:0%
essentially workable
 
00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:40.260 align:start position:0%
it's it's timely uh it it uh it involves
 
00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:44.940 align:start position:0%
people with expertise uh and who are
 
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
um and and who are specifically tasked
 
00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:51.300 align:start position:0%
with looking at the aspect of whether uh
 
00:50:54.349 --> 00:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
the two fundamental pillars of gel cars
 
00:50:58.430 --> 00:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
function namely is a rule excessive does
 
00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
it exceed legislative Authority
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
um and the second main pillar is whether
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
it violates legislative intent uh there
 
00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:08.460 align:start position:0%
are a couple of the other two thing as
 
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
you know there's a financial aspect and
 
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
also public interest but they are
 
00:51:15.370 --> 00:51:15.380 align:start position:0%
narrowly defined
 
00:51:17.530 --> 00:51:17.540 align:start position:0%
ordinarily applicable
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
so do we have an existing situation that
 
00:51:24.970 --> 00:51:24.980 align:start position:0%
works and is functional
 
00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:28.140 align:start position:0%
and and would would that be
 
00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
substantially enhanced by some of these
 
00:51:36.589 --> 00:51:36.599 align:start position:0%
proposed changes uh uh at the expense of
 
00:51:40.069 --> 00:51:40.079 align:start position:0%
workability uh in which case I think
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
that it would not be wise to proceed and
 
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
so I would ask you to to opine on uh
 
00:51:51.170 --> 00:51:51.180 align:start position:0%
whether we whether we do do have such a
 
00:51:53.690 --> 00:51:53.700 align:start position:0%
functional situation at the moment or
 
00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
whether it's
 
00:51:57.950 --> 00:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
sufficiently dysfunctional that we need
 
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
to change it in the matter proposed in
 
00:52:01.609 --> 00:52:01.619 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:03.900 align:start position:0%
thank you I think gel Carr and the
 
00:52:05.569 --> 00:52:05.579 align:start position:0%
administrative procedures Act is
 
00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
functional as it is there's always room
 
00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:10.980 align:start position:0%
for improvement 541a gets amended if not
 
00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
every year then every two or three years
 
00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:16.020 align:start position:0%
to try to improve things it's gotten
 
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
more complex over the years but
 
00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
it used to be more cut and dry if you
 
00:52:22.849 --> 00:52:22.859 align:start position:0%
had an issue then there was going to be
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
an objection the agency would have to go
 
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
back committee the legislature has
 
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
created options so it's become a little
 
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
more complex
 
00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:38.030 align:start position:0%
more complex
um

00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:41.329 --> 00:52:41.339 align:start position:0%
you did mention the I mean I
 
00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:43.740 align:start position:0%
to more directly answer your question I
 
00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:46.380 align:start position:0%
think legislative oversight is a good
 
00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:48.420 align:start position:0%
thing and the more involvement there are
 
00:52:50.690 --> 00:52:50.700 align:start position:0%
there is by the entire legislature the
 
00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:51.430 align:start position:0%
there is by the entire legislature the
better

00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
as representative McGuire said you you
 
00:52:56.930 --> 00:52:56.940 align:start position:0%
know you can lead a horse to water but
 
00:52:59.150 --> 00:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
you can't make them drink if the
 
00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:01.500 align:start position:0%
legislators individual legislators don't
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
want to get involved then that's their
 
00:53:03.599 --> 00:53:04.690 align:start position:0%
want to get involved then that's their
choice

00:53:04.690 --> 00:53:04.700 align:start position:0%
choice
 
00:53:07.069 --> 00:53:07.079 align:start position:0%
you did mention Finance Financial
 
00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:09.720 align:start position:0%
considerations and I do know that this
 
00:53:12.109 --> 00:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
bill does not have a fiscal note and I
 
00:53:14.450 --> 00:53:14.460 align:start position:0%
think they would be very significant uh
 
00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:16.980 align:start position:0%
Financial impacts created
 
00:53:20.089 --> 00:53:20.099 align:start position:0%
okay thank you oh
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
I think that one thing that if anyone in
 
00:53:25.010 --> 00:53:25.020 align:start position:0%
the legislature is concerned about the
 
00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
rules should do first is clean up the
 
00:53:30.910 --> 00:53:30.920 align:start position:0%
rulemaking authority so that it only
 
00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:35.220 align:start position:0%
covers what they want the rules to do as
 
00:53:37.309 --> 00:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
opposed to just saying implement this
 
00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
chapter or whatever we've tried to do
 
00:53:42.589 --> 00:53:42.599 align:start position:0%
that on various occasions but it still
 
00:53:45.970 --> 00:53:45.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:49.790 --> 00:53:49.800 align:start position:0%
an agency is given broad Authority
 
00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:51.049 align:start position:0%
an agency is given broad Authority
and

00:53:51.049 --> 00:53:51.059 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:53:52.849 --> 00:53:52.859 align:start position:0%
and then some people don't like that
 
00:53:55.010 --> 00:53:55.020 align:start position:0%
idea but if you don't if you do give
 
00:53:57.170 --> 00:53:57.180 align:start position:0%
them broad Authority it's very hard to
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult to find that find
 
00:54:06.890 --> 00:54:06.900 align:start position:0%
that fine line between
 
00:54:08.930 --> 00:54:08.940 align:start position:0%
giving them too much Authority and
 
00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
giving them enough of authority to do
 
00:54:12.290 --> 00:54:12.300 align:start position:0%
what they need to do
 
00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:20.700 align:start position:0%
else representative lacas just a thought
 
00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:22.500 align:start position:0%
on that one I mean it might be if there
 
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
was some process to call out or identify
 
00:54:27.049 --> 00:54:27.059 align:start position:0%
easily any bill that's granting
 
00:54:29.089 --> 00:54:29.099 align:start position:0%
rulemaking Authority
 
00:54:29.099 --> 00:54:29.990 align:start position:0%
rulemaking Authority
um

00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
and maybe have some process to
 
00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
review it gel car or somebody and at
 
00:54:36.829 --> 00:54:36.839 align:start position:0%
least point out to the policy committee
 
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
that maybe they might want to tighten it
 
00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:39.710 align:start position:0%
that maybe they might want to tighten it
up

00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:39.720 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact according to house
 
00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
rules the vice chair of the committee is
 
00:54:47.809 --> 00:54:47.819 align:start position:0%
supposed to review rulemaking Authority
 
00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
and make sure it is not excessive
 
00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:52.260 align:start position:0%
that is uh
 
00:54:56.270 --> 00:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
as a vice chair of my acquaintance
 
00:54:58.970 --> 00:54:58.980 align:start position:0%
was surprised when he discovered that
 
00:55:02.329 --> 00:55:02.339 align:start position:0%
was his his duty and said nobody ever
 
00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:05.460 align:start position:0%
told us about this so that is a
 
00:55:10.010 --> 00:55:10.020 align:start position:0%
requirement in house rules that is not
 
00:55:12.349 --> 00:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
always followed as thoroughly as I would
 
00:55:12.359 --> 00:55:14.450 align:start position:0%
always followed as thoroughly as I would
like

00:55:14.450 --> 00:55:14.460 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
but yeah uh for members not familiar
 
00:55:20.089 --> 00:55:20.099 align:start position:0%
with the rule making process I would
 
00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
point out that most of the authority
 
00:55:24.829 --> 00:55:24.839 align:start position:0%
when it when a rule comes before gel car
 
00:55:27.490 --> 00:55:27.500 align:start position:0%
most of the authority has been granted
 
00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh years past and the agencies coming
 
00:55:32.329 --> 00:55:32.339 align:start position:0%
forward to just simply read off the
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
rules or do a tweak with the read option
 
00:55:36.490 --> 00:55:36.500 align:start position:0%
with Amendment
 
00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:39.839 align:start position:0%
obviously each year you do Pass New
 
00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:41.700 align:start position:0%
bills and there is new rulemaking
 
00:55:44.329 --> 00:55:44.339 align:start position:0%
Authority but most of the things before
 
00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:55.849 --> 00:55:55.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:58.309 --> 00:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
okay well we'll we'll keep that in mind
 
00:56:01.010 --> 00:56:01.020 align:start position:0%
because I I know that um
 
00:56:02.990 --> 00:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
in 11.
 
00:56:06.049 --> 00:56:06.059 align:start position:0%
I and a number of rule of agencies spent
 
00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
the summer converting broad rulemaking
 
00:56:10.970 --> 00:56:10.980 align:start position:0%
Authority into specific rule-making
 
00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:12.170 align:start position:0%
Authority into specific rule-making
Authority

00:56:12.170 --> 00:56:12.180 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
00:56:15.829 --> 00:56:15.839 align:start position:0%
and that was a major exercise we didn't
 
00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:18.180 align:start position:0%
catch all of the spots
 
00:56:20.690 --> 00:56:20.700 align:start position:0%
but we did for example put the Medicaid
 
00:56:23.809 --> 00:56:23.819 align:start position:0%
Program into specific rulemaking
 
00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
Authority rather than the commissioner's
 
00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:27.720 align:start position:0%
broad rulemaking Authority which I
 
00:56:30.530 --> 00:56:30.540 align:start position:0%
thought was a worthwhile effort
 
00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
um but something like that needs to be
 
00:56:35.329 --> 00:56:35.339 align:start position:0%
done on a regular basis the same way we
 
00:56:37.609 --> 00:56:37.619 align:start position:0%
look at the Committees and commissions
 
00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
we have you know you've created and
 
00:56:44.329 --> 00:56:44.339 align:start position:0%
you've got to look at it every
 
00:56:46.370 --> 00:56:46.380 align:start position:0%
some number of years and say is this
 
00:56:47.930 --> 00:56:47.940 align:start position:0%
still a good idea
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
well this was one of the things that I
 
00:56:53.089 --> 00:56:53.099 align:start position:0%
well recall when you joined the
 
00:56:55.130 --> 00:56:55.140 align:start position:0%
legislature a few years after I come
 
00:56:58.910 --> 00:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
came on board uh that and it came on on
 
00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:01.980 align:start position:0%
the gel car that you know there was a
 
00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
lot of very broad rule-making Authority
 
00:57:07.970 --> 00:57:07.980 align:start position:0%
granted to Commissioners uh basically
 
00:57:10.849 --> 00:57:10.859 align:start position:0%
said Commissioners shall write rules to
 
00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:13.740 align:start position:0%
implement this statute well
 
00:57:16.970 --> 00:57:16.980 align:start position:0%
that's like sending the the Army off and
 
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
go out there and do something win this
 
00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
war and uh
 
00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:27.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of very significant structures
 
00:57:30.829 --> 00:57:30.839 align:start position:0%
were built on that kind of authority but
 
00:57:33.410 --> 00:57:33.420 align:start position:0%
the agencies actually were not that
 
00:57:37.490 --> 00:57:37.500 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic about it because uh it made
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
them completely responsible for every
 
00:57:42.589 --> 00:57:42.599 align:start position:0%
aspect of it that was on that kind of a
 
00:57:47.089 --> 00:57:47.099 align:start position:0%
basis and they like much more narrowly
 
00:57:49.970 --> 00:57:49.980 align:start position:0%
tailored rule-making Authority that says
 
00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
shall do this about that
 
00:57:55.210 --> 00:57:55.220 align:start position:0%
so yes I know I remember
 
00:57:57.950 --> 00:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
one rule writer bitterly and I'm
 
00:58:00.530 --> 00:58:00.540 align:start position:0%
averting about the uh the sludge rules
 
00:58:05.569 --> 00:58:05.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
yes it representative go forth and do
 
00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:08.569 align:start position:0%
yes it representative go forth and do
well

00:58:08.569 --> 00:58:08.579 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:58:10.970 --> 00:58:10.980 align:start position:0%
um just on that process you're involved
 
00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
in in tightening up the rules was that
 
00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
just a sub uh committee or subcommittee
 
00:58:18.410 --> 00:58:18.420 align:start position:0%
to Edina standing committee that did it
 
00:58:20.030 --> 00:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
there was some process set up to do that
 
00:58:22.990 --> 00:58:23.000 align:start position:0%
or what problem to Bill
 
00:58:26.450 --> 00:58:26.460 align:start position:0%
they a enthusiastic member of the
 
00:58:30.410 --> 00:58:30.420 align:start position:0%
legislature put in a Bill to delete
 
00:58:32.450 --> 00:58:32.460 align:start position:0%
a large number of
 
00:58:37.250 --> 00:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
broad rulemaking Authority statutes and
 
00:58:39.170 --> 00:58:39.180 align:start position:0%
it was retained in committee and we
 
00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:41.640 align:start position:0%
worked out specific requirements for
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
those sections
 
00:58:45.890 --> 00:58:45.900 align:start position:0%
it was a significant effort imagine
 
00:58:51.289 --> 00:58:51.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:52.910 --> 00:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
also have issues
 
00:58:55.309 --> 00:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
okay well
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
all right we I will relate to the
 
00:58:59.329 --> 00:58:59.339 align:start position:0%
sponsor that uh
 
00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to it
 
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
we've got to find out what her real goal
 
00:59:07.309 --> 00:59:07.319 align:start position:0%
is in putting this in other than to get
 
00:59:09.770 --> 00:59:09.780 align:start position:0%
the legislator legislature involved
 
00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
which I am
 
00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:14.700 align:start position:0%
curious how she's going to manage that
 
00:59:16.309 --> 00:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
because I don't believe passing a law
 
00:59:18.530 --> 00:59:18.540 align:start position:0%
will do it
 
00:59:20.569 --> 00:59:20.579 align:start position:0%
all right anyone else
 
00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:22.980 align:start position:0%
that case thank you all for coming and
 
00:59:25.789 --> 00:59:25.799 align:start position:0%
we will this will probably meet on this
 
00:59:28.309 --> 00:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
again in
 
00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
um September
 
00:59:33.530 --> 00:59:33.540 align:start position:0%
I don't expect to need to have
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
um some of these same points brought up
 
00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
again but we'll see
