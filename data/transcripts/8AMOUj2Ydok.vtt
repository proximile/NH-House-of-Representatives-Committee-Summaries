division 3 Finance um today's subject is
 
00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 align:start position:0%
an informational meeting this is meaning
 
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
that uh we've asked the department to
 
00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 align:start position:0%
come in and talk to us about issues uh
 
00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:38.439 align:start position:0%
that are not directly related to the
 
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
budget more like programmatic issues so
 
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
today uh I'll I'll ask the committee
 
00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:48.439 align:start position:0%
members to be careful to to not ask any
 
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
questions related to an answer that may
 
00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 align:start position:0%
require a dollar number we're not doing
 
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
dollars today we're doing programs
 
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
growth of programs plans for programs
 
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness that sort of thing um
 
00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to have uh commissioner
 
00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
Weaver I believe start and and you may
 
00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 align:start position:0%
want some people to join you what
 
00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 align:start position:0%
whatever you uh
 
00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 align:start position:0%
please I I always take the really big
 
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 align:start position:0%
chair I just uh yes yeah yeah I I think
 
00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 align:start position:0%
they caught me on Films standing up and
 
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 align:start position:0%
yeah blame
 
00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 align:start position:0%
me um be before before you get started I
 
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
I I I want to do just a little bit more
 
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
setup on this I I have appreciated uh
 
00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 align:start position:0%
over the last uh four years the last two
 
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
budget Cycles um the honesty and
 
00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 align:start position:0%
transparency that this committee has
 
00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 align:start position:0%
received from every member of U of um
 
00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 align:start position:0%
Service Services uh I am optimistic that
 
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
that transparency and honesty there's no
 
00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 align:start position:0%
reason to doubt that that's going to
 
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
continue um the reason why some may be
 
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 align:start position:0%
concerned about it is uh I think anyone
 
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 align:start position:0%
who's reading the papers understands
 
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a particularly
 
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
difficult budget cycle uh we have
 
00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 align:start position:0%
everyone from the governor to the Dr to
 
00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 align:start position:0%
others uh letting us know that uh our
 
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 align:start position:0%
revenues are probably going to be less
 
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
optimistic than than what we might want
 
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
and uh it is our deep obligation as a
 
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
finance committee to deliver a budget
 
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
that stays within the available revenues
 
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
um it would be nice if we had uh endless
 
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
revenues and we could have uh unlimited
 
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
wants um uh and unlimited needs met but
 
00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
that's not going to be this cycle so uh
 
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
so as we kick off um Commission members
 
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
of DHHS members of the committee uh I I
 
00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919 align:start position:0%
I can anticipate a year in which there's
 
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
going to be frustration uh during the
 
00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:12.199 align:start position:0%
process and I just hope that we can
 
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
continue to main the professionalism um
 
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
W with each other uh throughout the
 
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
course of this so so thank you thank you
 
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080 align:start position:0%
very much thank you representative
 
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
Edwards good morning my name is Lori
 
00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 align:start position:0%
Weaver I'm the commissioner of the
 
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 align:start position:0%
department um today I have my senior
 
00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 align:start position:0%
team with me here uh Nathan white CFO
 
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 align:start position:0%
and other members that you'll meet
 
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
shortly um what representative Edwards
 
00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 align:start position:0%
has just references this is our attempt
 
00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:41.560 align:start position:0%
um and we're grateful to have the
 
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have this conversation
 
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
with you to be able to tell the story of
 
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:47.560 align:start position:0%
the department without having you glaze
 
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
over and us go line by line you're going
 
00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:50.759 align:start position:0%
to have that part when we get to the
 
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
budget for sure but uh really wanted to
 
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
have a chance for you to really
 
00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:55.720 align:start position:0%
understand the functions of the
 
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
department um and we're going to try to
 
00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
do that today this morning at a high
 
00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:01.479 align:start position:0%
level and subsequent presentations we'll
 
00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:03.759 align:start position:0%
do a little bit of a deeper dive so what
 
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
I was really hoping for today is to have
 
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
some time at the end that should you
 
00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:10.199 align:start position:0%
have questions as we go through and you
 
00:07:12.589 --> 00:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
might have a detailed question to sort
 
00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:15.319 align:start position:0%
of jot that down um and at the end I'd
 
00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:17.800 align:start position:0%
like to collect those um to be able to
 
00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
make sure that my team is able to
 
00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:21.160 align:start position:0%
respond in the subsequent presentations
 
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:24.280 align:start position:0%
and weave that uh question that you have
 
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:27.280 align:start position:0%
and to our responses um if if we have
 
00:07:29.309 --> 00:07:29.319 align:start position:0%
time for that at the end we'll make time
 
00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
for for that um so I believe in front of
 
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
you you have a um handout which is a
 
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:38.360 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint looks like this so this will
 
00:07:40.749 --> 00:07:40.759 align:start position:0%
be sort of our uh our guide for for
 
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
today you have a couple things in front
 
00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:44.759 align:start position:0%
of you I um also shared our road mapap
 
00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
which I'll talk about and then there's
 
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
also this one pager which for those of
 
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
you that may not be as familiar with the
 
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:52.280 align:start position:0%
Department it lists obviously our
 
00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:53.639 align:start position:0%
mission and our vision and our
 
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
responsibilities but every division um
 
00:07:57.869 --> 00:07:57.879 align:start position:0%
that the department has in terms of how
 
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:00.280 align:start position:0%
it breaks down and sometimes that's a
 
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
handy reference for when you're looking
 
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
for well where does um something fall
 
00:08:07.469 --> 00:08:07.479 align:start position:0%
you could put it into there um so today
 
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
how we've structured the time with you
 
00:08:12.029 --> 00:08:12.039 align:start position:0%
is really I'd like to go over um some
 
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
facts and figures so a little bit of
 
00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
numbers but just in terms of setting
 
00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:17.039 align:start position:0%
perspective uh talking a little bit
 
00:08:18.909 --> 00:08:18.919 align:start position:0%
about our road map which is really a
 
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
framework from for our priorities so
 
00:08:22.749 --> 00:08:22.759 align:start position:0%
we've been working with a road map now
 
00:08:24.909 --> 00:08:24.919 align:start position:0%
for a couple of years and it's a way for
 
00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879 align:start position:0%
us to lift up the work to be able to say
 
00:08:28.029 --> 00:08:28.039 align:start position:0%
hey this is what we're charged with this
 
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
is what's we're responsible for
 
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:31.720 align:start position:0%
um and this is where uh hopefully when
 
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
you get to budget you'll be able to
 
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
crosswalk and do some um tying in with
 
00:08:38.509 --> 00:08:38.519 align:start position:0%
that uh the the next couple of bullets
 
00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:41.800 align:start position:0%
are really about the the Thematic focus
 
00:08:43.469 --> 00:08:43.479 align:start position:0%
of when we're looking at what is the
 
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
department focused on really efficient
 
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:47.560 align:start position:0%
efficient stewardship and strong
 
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
customer service that is a theme not
 
00:08:51.269 --> 00:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
only throughout our road map but through
 
00:08:52.829 --> 00:08:52.839 align:start position:0%
all of our work that we do and I'll
 
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about that in a little bit
 
00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
more um increase access to prevention
 
00:08:58.990 --> 00:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
and specialized services and why is that
 
00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
important especially when we're thinking
 
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
about cost right we're really talking
 
00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
about keeping people in communities and
 
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
keeping them levels of care that are
 
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate to their need and and budget
 
00:09:11.949 --> 00:09:11.959 align:start position:0%
uh appropriate as well um and then we
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
can't really talk about health and human
 
00:09:16.269 --> 00:09:16.279 align:start position:0%
services without having some uh
 
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
conversation about Medicaid um so we I I
 
00:09:21.389 --> 00:09:21.399 align:start position:0%
think we have a separate Medicaid 101
 
00:09:23.069 --> 00:09:23.079 align:start position:0%
that director Lipman is going to provide
 
00:09:25.069 --> 00:09:25.079 align:start position:0%
that will be a deeper dive but I think
 
00:09:26.829 --> 00:09:26.839 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of today to sort of
 
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:28.600 align:start position:0%
give you the framework of how does
 
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
Medicaid play into all of the programs
 
00:09:33.069 --> 00:09:33.079 align:start position:0%
and policy areas at the department um
 
00:09:35.829 --> 00:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
and then lastly some of those questions
 
00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
so if that sounds good representative I
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
okay so a little bit on the facts and
 
00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:47.240 align:start position:0%
figures I'm sorry I'm just a little slow
 
00:09:49.389 --> 00:09:49.399 align:start position:0%
I I had meant initially to point out
 
00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:51.560 align:start position:0%
that uh representative tersi had let us
 
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
know she's going to be about 15 minutes
 
00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
late so she's on her way and I don't
 
00:09:59.069 --> 00:09:59.079 align:start position:0%
know where representative norvanco is
 
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
but uh he may come in I've got a request
 
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
from representative Daniels to allow him
 
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
to leave at 11:15 I think he want to
 
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
leave at around a little bit before 11
 
00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:12.680 align:start position:0%
so so we'll TR try to keep moving yep
 
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you I believe we'll get there um
 
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
this is sort of a highlevel uh view
 
00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
really you know our vision for the
 
00:10:22.269 --> 00:10:22.279 align:start position:0%
Department is really about our citizens
 
00:10:24.269 --> 00:10:24.279 align:start position:0%
in the state having Optimal Health that
 
00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:25.640 align:start position:0%
that is our goal and the department
 
00:10:27.949 --> 00:10:27.959 align:start position:0%
plays a big role in that um we have
 
00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839 align:start position:0%
three primary responsib posibilities if
 
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
you think about well what does the
 
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:32.680 align:start position:0%
department do it's so large you can
 
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
chunk it out into protection and
 
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
prevention Client Service delivery and
 
00:10:40.629 --> 00:10:40.639 align:start position:0%
Regulatory oversight so as I've
 
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned we have um we have eight
 
00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:45.800 align:start position:0%
divisions six of those are direct policy
 
00:10:47.629 --> 00:10:47.639 align:start position:0%
or programmatic related divisions as
 
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
they're listed there and then we have
 
00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
two which the division for finance which
 
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
Nathan our CFO overseas and then our
 
00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
quality improvement and integrity um
 
00:10:59.910 --> 00:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
unit uh division as well so that's the
 
00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
bulk of of our organization when you
 
00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:06.959 align:start position:0%
look at some numbers um yes for this
 
00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal year we have a $3.6 billion
 
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
budget obviously that's not all General
 
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
funds um we have a lot of federal and
 
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
other Revenue sources so that's a lot of
 
00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:18.680 align:start position:0%
money and we're about
 
00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
53% of the in total uh state budget for
 
00:11:22.079 --> 00:11:22.990 align:start position:0%
53% of the in total uh state budget for
General

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
General
 
00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:26.360 align:start position:0%
funds in our staff represent when you
 
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
think about all of the state positions I
 
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
think there's last I knew there was
 
00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
around 12,000 we're about about a fourth
 
00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:35.800 align:start position:0%
of all state positions but yet when you
 
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
look at our budget our Personnel costs
 
00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
are really less than 11% of our whole
 
00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:42.959 align:start position:0%
budget so I just wanted to point that
 
00:11:45.629 --> 00:11:45.639 align:start position:0%
out that oftentimes when we think about
 
00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:47.240 align:start position:0%
reductions and budgets the first place
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
we go to personnel and for sure and
 
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:50.680 align:start position:0%
that's something we do every single year
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
whether it's a reduction year or not um
 
00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
obviously mindful of that this year
 
00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
there's just recently a hiring freeze um
 
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
which obviously is going to impact um
 
00:12:04.629 --> 00:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
our ability um to hire um but that 11%
 
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
isn't uh necessarily where the money is
 
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
at for a big chunk of reduction there's
 
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
some for
 
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:15.560 align:start position:0%
sure and then sure I I for the folks who
 
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
are new to this this $3.6 billion budget
 
00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
as I understand it is federal state and
 
00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
and other sources of which um uh the
 
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
general funds is is about 1 Point 217
 
00:12:33.949 --> 00:12:33.959 align:start position:0%
billion so so about a third of the total
 
00:12:37.389 --> 00:12:37.399 align:start position:0%
budget I understand is General funds I
 
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
will say in my my commissioner rough
 
00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
estimates yes but Nathan will give you
 
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
the exact yes that's roughly correct all
 
00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
right thank thank you I just wanted
 
00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:48.040 align:start position:0%
people following to see what the numbers
 
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
are uh you're you're
 
00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
over all right welcome I'm glad you're
 
00:12:59.389 --> 00:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
safe you continue so and just uh
 
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:01.240 align:start position:0%
continuing a little bit on the next page
 
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:05.240 align:start position:0%
for Staffing um this is how our position
 
00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:08.519 align:start position:0%
counts break out um so I just want to
 
00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
point out that with the exception of any
 
00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:13.480 align:start position:0%
required legislation the department did
 
00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:16.360 align:start position:0%
not make any new position requests so we
 
00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:18.680 align:start position:0%
go through uh Every Spring being
 
00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
prepared for that we made none except
 
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
for what was legislatively required of
 
00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:26.360 align:start position:0%
us uh 50% of what you're looking at here
 
00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
50% of our Workforce roughly is what we
 
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
call Direct Care so client facing or
 
00:13:33.189 --> 00:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
client serving that's why you'll see
 
00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
larger numbers in DCF or in economic
 
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
stability or at New Hampshire hospital
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
um and then obviously you know you have
 
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
Medicaid to to your point we have a lot
 
00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:45.880 align:start position:0%
of money in our Medicaid service we have
 
00:13:49.189 --> 00:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
about a team of 33 in the Medicaid space
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
um as opposed to some of the other areas
 
00:13:53.189 --> 00:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
so we have a legislative cap of cannot
 
00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
go over
 
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
3,000 um approximately we're about 11
 
00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
shive being at 28 00 filled as of today
 
00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:03.320 align:start position:0%
um I do expect that to change with the
 
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
hiring freeze and attrition will happen
 
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
we do have some car outs for direct care
 
00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
but attrition is constant so I do expect
 
00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
that number to change um in the last two
 
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
years we've reduced our vacancy rate
 
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:20.440 align:start position:0%
quite significantly from 22% to 14% so
 
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of effort that went into
 
00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
that and then trying to retain those
 
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
staff and keep those staff again a
 
00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
hiring freeze I expect to see that
 
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
number start to move again
 
00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
um and and ultimately it matters because
 
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
that's going to really dictate if I
 
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:35.519 align:start position:0%
don't have Workforce there's some things
 
00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
I can do and some things I can't
 
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
do um the next slide is really on our
 
00:14:43.829 --> 00:14:43.839 align:start position:0%
budget complexity and I'm going to let
 
00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
nethan um explain this one but in terms
 
00:14:48.269 --> 00:14:48.279 align:start position:0%
of a little bit about what
 
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards was saying
 
00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:52.600 align:start position:0%
earlier our budget is not uh just one
 
00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:54.680 align:start position:0%
for uh funding source however there's
 
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
lots of other requirements and some
 
00:14:59.230 --> 00:14:59.240 align:start position:0%
complexity to how it all works
 
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
great good morning members of the
 
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
committee Nathan white Chief Financial
 
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
Officer uh good to see some returning
 
00:15:06.509 --> 00:15:06.519 align:start position:0%
members I look forward to working with
 
00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:08.120 align:start position:0%
new members that I haven't yet had an
 
00:15:10.749 --> 00:15:10.759 align:start position:0%
acquaintance with this slide in front of
 
00:15:11.949 --> 00:15:11.959 align:start position:0%
you I know we're not going to be talking
 
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
too much about budget but I don't
 
00:15:14.749 --> 00:15:14.759 align:start position:0%
necessarily think you can talk about the
 
00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
programs of course unbiased without
 
00:15:19.629 --> 00:15:19.639 align:start position:0%
talking about the budget and in front of
 
00:15:22.949 --> 00:15:22.959 align:start position:0%
you this slide it it it presents some of
 
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
the dynamic nature of hhs's budget and
 
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons that some people some
 
00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:31.160 align:start position:0%
S have a challenge understanding why is
 
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:33.720 align:start position:0%
HH budget so complex and and the saying
 
00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
that I always like to say is it's
 
00:15:37.949 --> 00:15:37.959 align:start position:0%
complex but it's all explainable and so
 
00:15:39.749 --> 00:15:39.759 align:start position:0%
if you look at the first Circle there
 
00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:42.680 align:start position:0%
that is the budget and so we prepare our
 
00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:45.079 align:start position:0%
budget the agency budget in August we
 
00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:47.519 align:start position:0%
make certain assumptions we assume we're
 
00:15:49.629 --> 00:15:49.639 align:start position:0%
going to have X amount of vacancies we
 
00:15:52.509 --> 00:15:52.519 align:start position:0%
assume that we're going to have um X
 
00:15:54.269 --> 00:15:54.279 align:start position:0%
percentage of clients for this
 
00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
particular service we we assume these
 
00:15:59.670 --> 00:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
expenditures are going to be X based on
 
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
a certain
 
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
population and then and then we have the
 
00:16:05.069 --> 00:16:05.079 align:start position:0%
actual so once the budget is passed then
 
00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
we actually then we move into the actual
 
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
and then we see what really happens and
 
00:16:10.309 --> 00:16:10.319 align:start position:0%
you you have to remember we prepare our
 
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
budget our agency budget 10 months be
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
before the budget actually goes into
 
00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
effect so because our budget again it's
 
00:16:20.189 --> 00:16:20.199 align:start position:0%
only it's a little over a tenth
 
00:16:22.509 --> 00:16:22.519 align:start position:0%
Personnel most of our budget a lot of
 
00:16:25.069 --> 00:16:25.079 align:start position:0%
our budget is in Medicaid it's in Direct
 
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
Services provided to to Citizens there's
 
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
contracts and we don't necessarily know
 
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
what that spending is going to look like
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
because that spending is going to be
 
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
responsive to the needs of the
 
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
population of the citizens of the state
 
00:16:39.389 --> 00:16:39.399 align:start position:0%
and then there's a there's a third
 
00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
component in you'll see that that bubble
 
00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
on the right cost allocation and so HHS
 
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
we use a cost allocation system um we
 
00:16:52.389 --> 00:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
have a it's called a pay cap a public
 
00:16:54.269 --> 00:16:54.279 align:start position:0%
assistance cost allocation plan it's a
 
00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:55.880 align:start position:0%
several hundred page document I don't
 
00:16:58.189 --> 00:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
recommend reading it but what that does
 
00:17:00.749 --> 00:17:00.759 align:start position:0%
is it basically lays out the framework
 
00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
in which we're able to leverage federal
 
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
funds and we assign those federal funds
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
towards certain efforts so for example
 
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
some of our employees may be paid with a
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
couple of different funding sources it
 
00:17:14.789 --> 00:17:14.799 align:start position:0%
might be tan if dollars it might be
 
00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
44e and they do random time studies
 
00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:19.079 align:start position:0%
during the month and random moment
 
00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
studies and some other methodologies and
 
00:17:23.949 --> 00:17:23.959 align:start position:0%
then we assign okay you worked on title
 
00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
4E projects a certain amount that means
 
00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:29.240 align:start position:0%
you get to earn more 4E and then and we
 
00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:31.480 align:start position:0%
go through a regular process um and we
 
00:17:33.029 --> 00:17:33.039 align:start position:0%
have a team that does this to make sure
 
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
that we can leverage those federal funds
 
00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:37.640 align:start position:0%
and so it's it's these three components
 
00:17:41.549 --> 00:17:41.559 align:start position:0%
that kind of feed into um the HHS budget
 
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
and then on top of that like when you're
 
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
thinking about sort of the middle here
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
there's other complexities on top there
 
00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
where you have maintenance of effort
 
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:51.640 align:start position:0%
requirements so one of the um one of the
 
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
topics that we discussed uh
 
00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
representative or chairman Edwards last
 
00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
time a lot was TANF so we have to spend
 
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:01.240 align:start position:0%
30 $4 million of General funds in order
 
00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
to get or excuse me 32.4 in order to get
 
00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
$38 million of federal funds each year
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
and if we don't spend x amount of
 
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
General funds then the subsequent year
 
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
we have an equal penalty and then we
 
00:18:17.149 --> 00:18:17.159 align:start position:0%
have a reduction and so sometimes when
 
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
you're looking at positions you go to
 
00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
abolish this position well yes but that
 
00:18:24.029 --> 00:18:24.039 align:start position:0%
may impact our ability to spend towards
 
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
that tanif Moe and and I just kind of
 
00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
want to recognize those complexities
 
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:31.480 align:start position:0%
before we start getting into um into
 
00:18:33.909 --> 00:18:33.919 align:start position:0%
some more of the details so that when we
 
00:18:35.789 --> 00:18:35.799 align:start position:0%
say oh well what does that contract do
 
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
that contract does this but you have to
 
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:40.360 align:start position:0%
remember that also helps us meet our our
 
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
Medicaid requirements and and things of
 
00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:46.120 align:start position:0%
that nature so um I'll kind of pause
 
00:18:48.029 --> 00:18:48.039 align:start position:0%
there and hand it back over can I ask
 
00:18:51.149 --> 00:18:51.159 align:start position:0%
you a question then yes so uh so that
 
00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
suggests that uh historically then that
 
00:18:58.350 --> 00:18:58.360 align:start position:0%
you've done an accounting to show how we
 
00:19:01.789 --> 00:19:01.799 align:start position:0%
accum ulated our our tan contribution
 
00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:04.360 align:start position:0%
and that and that uh that that would
 
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
give us some sense of how Divergent
 
00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:11.320 align:start position:0%
those sources of of uh contributions are
 
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
could you is there something simple
 
00:19:15.909 --> 00:19:15.919 align:start position:0%
enough is this like five pages of
 
00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet or is it a 100 or what what
 
00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
what what what what would we be looking
 
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
at if you were to share with us
 
00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:26.799 align:start position:0%
historically looking tanif uh
 
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:29.320 align:start position:0%
contributions um we would probably want
 
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:32.200 align:start position:0%
to simplify what we have internally but
 
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
I could take it back to the team and we
 
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
could see what we could put together to
 
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
kind of demonstrate because that match
 
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
is going to be met by many different
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
positions in many different areas and
 
00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
contracts and other factors but I don't
 
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
want to get too far into the weeds today
 
00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
no I I don't want to either I'm just
 
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
asking if if you could provide it in a
 
00:19:53.149 --> 00:19:53.159 align:start position:0%
way in which we could get a sense of how
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
complex it is that you just described us
 
00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:57.640 align:start position:0%
because I agree with you that it's an
 
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
important factor for us to understand
 
00:20:02.669 --> 00:20:02.679 align:start position:0%
how embedded and intertwined these
 
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
contributions can be we can do that for
 
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
you absolutely thank you and so before
 
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
we leave that I just in terms of
 
00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:11.240 align:start position:0%
positions one thing that we worked out
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
last bium uh budget wise is in terms of
 
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
uh with positions letting the department
 
00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:19.240 align:start position:0%
being able to hit a Target rather than
 
00:20:21.549 --> 00:20:21.559 align:start position:0%
going through and this position and that
 
00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
position knowing the complexity of what
 
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
is behind each position for funding
 
00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
mechanism Okay so moving to uh the next
 
00:20:32.029 --> 00:20:32.039 align:start position:0%
slide so the road map so you have I I
 
00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:33.880 align:start position:0%
shared with each of you a hefty uh
 
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
document it's also available on our
 
00:20:37.909 --> 00:20:37.919 align:start position:0%
website I printed out the color copy
 
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
only special people get the color copy
 
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
um being mindful of resources um our
 
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
road map is really our framework right
 
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
so this is the Department's priorities
 
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
and what I'd like to be able to do today
 
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
as I walk through high level for you is
 
00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
also weave in some of those themes that
 
00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:55.960 align:start position:0%
I was talking about earlier of what
 
00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
we're focusing on here um our road map
 
00:21:01.149 --> 00:21:01.159 align:start position:0%
app was just for brief history uh short
 
00:21:04.029 --> 00:21:04.039 align:start position:0%
mid long-term goals developed internally
 
00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
and with stakeholders so we didn't do it
 
00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:08.039 align:start position:0%
in the vacuum we went and got feedback
 
00:21:10.269 --> 00:21:10.279 align:start position:0%
on it our staff at all levels have
 
00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
participated in working with uh the team
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
to lift this up so that there's
 
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
ownership um and that people understand
 
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
the work so it's not creating new work
 
00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:20.440 align:start position:0%
it's a frame of same work of the work
 
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
and it's a way for us to be able to say
 
00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:24.799 align:start position:0%
when people say what are your priorities
 
00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
Department we're able to sh to point
 
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
them to this document so it breaks down
 
00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
into about three the three different
 
00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
bubbles that you have in there I call it
 
00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
the three C's culture community and
 
00:21:37.789 --> 00:21:37.799 align:start position:0%
customer service so if we look at uh the
 
00:21:40.149 --> 00:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
I'll start with the the um the bubble
 
00:21:41.789 --> 00:21:41.799 align:start position:0%
the purple bubble promote thriving
 
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
communities really this is where a lot
 
00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
of our policy work is this is about uh
 
00:21:47.789 --> 00:21:47.799 align:start position:0%
Client Services the right service at the
 
00:21:49.269 --> 00:21:49.279 align:start position:0%
right time for the right
 
00:21:51.789 --> 00:21:51.799 align:start position:0%
individual when we think about what is
 
00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:53.919 align:start position:0%
uh some of the themes that we're looking
 
00:21:56.029 --> 00:21:56.039 align:start position:0%
at is really access to specialized
 
00:21:57.669 --> 00:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
services so we have a lot of our
 
00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
different programs in here that you're
 
00:22:01.789 --> 00:22:01.799 align:start position:0%
going to hear about um but we have a
 
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
high focus on making sure that there is
 
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
access for people to receive those
 
00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:08.360 align:start position:0%
services that they needed um the bullets
 
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
on beneath it I should put my glasses on
 
00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
um there these are the uh main uh
 
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:17.240 align:start position:0%
initiatives under there I'm not going to
 
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
go through all of them as you're going
 
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
to hear about them I just want to
 
00:22:22.029 --> 00:22:22.039 align:start position:0%
highlight a couple for you um so you
 
00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
some of you may have heard about Mission
 
00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
zero that is one of our uh initiatives
 
00:22:28.789 --> 00:22:28.799 align:start position:0%
and priorities about ending emergenc
 
00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
Department boarding so we've had a
 
00:22:32.549 --> 00:22:32.559 align:start position:0%
concerted effort over two years with our
 
00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
partners internal and external to be
 
00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
able to bring the number down of folks
 
00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
sitting in EDS So when you say what is
 
00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
your priority priority is to make sure
 
00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
right service right person at the right
 
00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
time right that people don't have to go
 
00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
to the highest level of care um if
 
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
they're experiencing a mental health
 
00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
event there may be lower levels of care
 
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
um so that is something that we've had a
 
00:22:56.029 --> 00:22:56.039 align:start position:0%
focus on um as well as quite a lot of
 
00:22:59.230 --> 00:22:59.240 align:start position:0%
success on U moving down sort of in the
 
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
middle of it is improve access to a
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
broad range of communitybased and
 
00:23:05.549 --> 00:23:05.559 align:start position:0%
residential Behavioral Health Services
 
00:23:07.909 --> 00:23:07.919 align:start position:0%
so that's not only for CH children in
 
00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:09.400 align:start position:0%
our system but that's also for our
 
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:11.480 align:start position:0%
adults as well and so you think about
 
00:23:15.029 --> 00:23:15.039 align:start position:0%
inhome care services uh not for some of
 
00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
our seniors and older adults um but also
 
00:23:19.149 --> 00:23:19.159 align:start position:0%
for kids not every kid needs to be in a
 
00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:20.799 align:start position:0%
residential placement what are what is
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
the Continuum spectrum of services that
 
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
they can be receiving to keep them out
 
00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:27.400 align:start position:0%
of res care so that is a priority for
 
00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:29.960 align:start position:0%
the Department is to reduce Reliance on
 
00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
institutional care and to be able to
 
00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
increase community- based care so you'll
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
hear that theme throughout um and that
 
00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
ties in a little bit with our system of
 
00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
care for healthy aging which you'll hear
 
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
more about as well but there's been a
 
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
lot of progress um on that front as well
 
00:23:47.549 --> 00:23:47.559 align:start position:0%
so we have two systems of care we have
 
00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
one for children and we have one for
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
adults um pretty much with primary focus
 
00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:53.720 align:start position:0%
of trying to keep folks in their
 
00:23:56.909 --> 00:23:56.919 align:start position:0%
communities while receiving services so
 
00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
that's the bulk of our work uh the the
 
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
customer service side of it that bubble
 
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
on the bottom there in the middle um
 
00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
that falls into our theme of uh
 
00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:08.120 align:start position:0%
efficient effective use of our resources
 
00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
right are we are we being efficient and
 
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
mindful of what we have how we're
 
00:24:14.269 --> 00:24:14.279 align:start position:0%
spending it and and how it's being
 
00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
utilized and also strong customer
 
00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:18.520 align:start position:0%
service so I'll just highlight a couple
 
00:24:21.269 --> 00:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
for you here in terms of the Contracting
 
00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
experience when you think about the the
 
00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:26.039 align:start position:0%
dollar amounts that we have invested in
 
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
our contracts a lot of that money is
 
00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
given to our providers in state to
 
00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
provide these Services right so whether
 
00:24:36.029 --> 00:24:36.039 align:start position:0%
they're Community Based whether they're
 
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
or more
 
00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
intensive okay I was gonna say it's not
 
00:24:48.789 --> 00:24:48.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:52.029 --> 00:24:52.039 align:start position:0%
okay why talk about sweating
 
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
huh not in California okay
 
00:24:59.549 --> 00:24:59.559 align:start position:0%
um I got to recollect my thoughts there
 
00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh so so my point being is uh for
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
contractor Services a couple of points
 
00:25:07.149 --> 00:25:07.159 align:start position:0%
here so if we have we are responsible to
 
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that we get people served and
 
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
we draw down this money and we have all
 
00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
this money and now we've got to procure
 
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
it we've got to get it out into Services
 
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
which means we've got to work with our
 
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
partner providers in the community so a
 
00:25:20.669 --> 00:25:20.679 align:start position:0%
couple of things here from the external
 
00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
side for the last two years I've focused
 
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
with our Center for nonprofits
 
00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:26.200 align:start position:0%
organization to work with all of our
 
00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
providers to say how can we do this
 
00:25:30.149 --> 00:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
better so we isn't just the department
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
it's obviously the state if you know
 
00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:33.640 align:start position:0%
anyone if you have a colleague anyone
 
00:25:35.149 --> 00:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
that says hey when to do a contract for
 
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
the state they're a great vendor but
 
00:25:39.389 --> 00:25:39.399 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's really hard with a lot of
 
00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic processes and paperwork so
 
00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:43.640 align:start position:0%
we're trying to make that easier at the
 
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
department level and beyond that because
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
we need our provider Partners they carry
 
00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:49.720 align:start position:0%
out this work it's not the department
 
00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:51.640 align:start position:0%
staff that do it so there's that
 
00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
external side to make sure that we get
 
00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
good provider Partners the internal side
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
is our are making sure that we asked and
 
00:26:02.549 --> 00:26:02.559 align:start position:0%
contracted for the right things right
 
00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:04.039 align:start position:0%
what are we investing in what is the
 
00:26:06.029 --> 00:26:06.039 align:start position:0%
outcome what are the deliverables and
 
00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:08.440 align:start position:0%
are we getting it so there's a couple of
 
00:26:10.389 --> 00:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
pieces there there's good contract
 
00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:12.440 align:start position:0%
management writing there's good
 
00:26:16.029 --> 00:26:16.039 align:start position:0%
negotiations with vendors Partners but
 
00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
there's also
 
00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:20.120 align:start position:0%
measuring uh the outcomes as we go along
 
00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
so good active contract management so we
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
as a department are responsible if we're
 
00:26:26.549 --> 00:26:26.559 align:start position:0%
going to take this money and put it out
 
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
there we need to all along the way make
 
00:26:30.909 --> 00:26:30.919 align:start position:0%
sure that it's hitting the mark and if
 
00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
it's not to be able to course correct so
 
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
that we don't get at the end of a 2-year
 
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
contract and say well yeah that didn't
 
00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
work and then we have all that money
 
00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
that didn't get us to where we where we
 
00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:42.440 align:start position:0%
needed to go so that has been a big
 
00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
focus of our road map and that efficient
 
00:26:46.669 --> 00:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
stewardship of our resources that's a
 
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
big big big piece of it um another piece
 
00:26:52.029 --> 00:26:52.039 align:start position:0%
of it is our data driven practices so
 
00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
really trying to um increase our use of
 
00:26:59.430 --> 00:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
data and dashboards to with all of our
 
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:02.200 align:start position:0%
services so that we can look at what is
 
00:27:03.789 --> 00:27:03.799 align:start position:0%
the data telling us for where we need to
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
drive for that service not where we've
 
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
driven for 30 years or where we think we
 
00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
need to go but where the data tells us
 
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
to go so um that's helping with future
 
00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:13.480 align:start position:0%
planning and it's also happening
 
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
happening helps with current management
 
00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
as well so and there's a lot more pieces
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
in customer service I just wanted to
 
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
pull up and highlight um some of those
 
00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:23.320 align:start position:0%
for you here and we're going to talk a
 
00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
little bit about more about some of
 
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
these in the next
 
00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
slide and the last bubble but probably
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
for me one of the most important bubble
 
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
is my Workforce uh if I don't invest in
 
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
people and culture I'm not going to able
 
00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
to do anything else in the other bubbles
 
00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:40.600 align:start position:0%
so I need to have a Workforce that's
 
00:27:43.149 --> 00:27:43.159 align:start position:0%
competent uh that is satisfied with they
 
00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
do um and consistent right so that has
 
00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
been our focus when we're looking at you
 
00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:49.720 align:start position:0%
know when I don't have enough staff this
 
00:27:51.149 --> 00:27:51.159 align:start position:0%
is where we see all of these things
 
00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:53.080 align:start position:0%
start to fall short so I have to have
 
00:27:55.389 --> 00:27:55.399 align:start position:0%
enough staff to be able to maintain the
 
00:27:57.630 --> 00:27:57.640 align:start position:0%
minimum of what we're doing and just in
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
terms of Staffing just as a quick aside
 
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
we we have looked at over the last
 
00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
couple of years other states of a
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
similar size and demographic population
 
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
even with a Medicaid population served
 
00:28:11.149 --> 00:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
and so we know that we're not
 
00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:13.480 align:start position:0%
overstaffed and we know that we're not
 
00:28:15.549 --> 00:28:15.559 align:start position:0%
woefully understaff notice I say
 
00:28:17.909 --> 00:28:17.919 align:start position:0%
woefully right uh we're sort of right in
 
00:28:20.789 --> 00:28:20.799 align:start position:0%
the middle all right so we we have we we
 
00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
can we're making it work with what we
 
00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:25.640 align:start position:0%
have but we I don't want to be woefully
 
00:28:27.549 --> 00:28:27.559 align:start position:0%
underst staffed I guess is is some of
 
00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:29.720 align:start position:0%
the the ask there so just keeping that
 
00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:31.919 align:start position:0%
in mind that we're not overstaffed at
 
00:28:33.549 --> 00:28:33.559 align:start position:0%
this point we're able to carry out our
 
00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
mission so so you're going to hear about
 
00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
uh our road map uh repeatedly throughout
 
00:28:41.509 --> 00:28:41.519 align:start position:0%
budget sessions because it's what our
 
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
staff know as our priorities it's what
 
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
our stakeholders know as our priorities
 
00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:47.240 align:start position:0%
and it's what I want you as our division
 
00:28:48.909 --> 00:28:48.919 align:start position:0%
three budget committee to know as our
 
00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
priorities going
 
00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
through uh you um I I don't know if uh
 
00:28:57.149 --> 00:28:57.159 align:start position:0%
this has been done I I'm not asking for
 
00:28:58.950 --> 00:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
new work but if it's been done I'd like
 
00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
to see it at some point is um I I love
 
00:29:04.149 --> 00:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
the road map I've complimented you every
 
00:29:05.789 --> 00:29:05.799 align:start position:0%
time I've seen the road map this is
 
00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
really excellent strategic work thank
 
00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
you for that um what what would be
 
00:29:14.549 --> 00:29:14.559 align:start position:0%
helpful as we go through this is uh the
 
00:29:18.029 --> 00:29:18.039 align:start position:0%
the budget as it presents in hb1 is a
 
00:29:21.549 --> 00:29:21.559 align:start position:0%
very kind of you know linear uh
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet and uh what would be useful
 
00:29:27.389 --> 00:29:27.399 align:start position:0%
I think as another way to look at this
 
00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
is if almost if there was a a pivot so
 
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
that we could see these line items of
 
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
the Strategic plan and have some sense
 
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
what each of these bullets are are going
 
00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
to uh consume in terms of resources uh
 
00:29:46.789 --> 00:29:46.799 align:start position:0%
financial and Personnel so so this this
 
00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:49.880 align:start position:0%
is the way I I I I think you view your
 
00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
department and leading your department
 
00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
it would be nice if we could see how the
 
00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
resources then kind of pivot up
 
00:30:01.029 --> 00:30:01.039 align:start position:0%
underneath it and support the Strategic
 
00:30:04.149 --> 00:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
plan I I I think Miss Tellus is
 
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
scheduled to come in and and tell us
 
00:30:09.389 --> 00:30:09.399 align:start position:0%
about your road map and the performance
 
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
metrics that you've established for
 
00:30:12.789 --> 00:30:12.799 align:start position:0%
these things at least that's what I
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
think she's going to do if if it happens
 
00:30:18.389 --> 00:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
that we she could maybe oh no it's still
 
00:30:21.029 --> 00:30:21.039 align:start position:0%
too early to talk numbers um but
 
00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:23.320 align:start position:0%
eventually it would be cool if we could
 
00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
get numbers associated with the
 
00:30:27.549 --> 00:30:27.559 align:start position:0%
Strategic plan is it is that hard to do
 
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
do so we're anticipating following a
 
00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
similar presentation style to what we
 
00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
did in the in the prior banum where what
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
we did is we tried to line up all of the
 
00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:43.240 align:start position:0%
accounts and the bureaus and we tried to
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
tie those into a narrative around the
 
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
program so I think what we can do is as
 
00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
we go through that is we can highlight
 
00:30:51.509 --> 00:30:51.519 align:start position:0%
key elements but part of the road map
 
00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
too is prioritizing certain things so
 
00:30:56.629 --> 00:30:56.639 align:start position:0%
there's certain staff that exist today
 
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
they existed before the roadmap started
 
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
that are now prioritizing the road map
 
00:31:03.149 --> 00:31:03.159 align:start position:0%
initiatives maybe over some of the work
 
00:31:04.629 --> 00:31:04.639 align:start position:0%
that they may have done other otherwise
 
00:31:06.789 --> 00:31:06.799 align:start position:0%
or other initiatives so but what we can
 
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
try to do is just highlight that maybe
 
00:31:10.269 --> 00:31:10.279 align:start position:0%
we can use a little identification
 
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
system a little asteris or something
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
along those lines to try to get out what
 
00:31:16.669 --> 00:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
your what you're identifying chairman
 
00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
Edwards so I this this kind of question
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
came up in a previous presentation on
 
00:31:25.269 --> 00:31:25.279 align:start position:0%
Mission zero and Mission zero is this
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
very comprehensive program that brings
 
00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
all the these components together for
 
00:31:31.629 --> 00:31:31.639 align:start position:0%
success and it's beautiful the way
 
00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:34.360 align:start position:0%
that's working uh I think I think I
 
00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
asked at that time if there was a way
 
00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
for us to do a cost estimate of what
 
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
mission zero was costing us from an
 
00:31:43.909 --> 00:31:43.919 align:start position:0%
execution perspective and that sounded
 
00:31:47.789 --> 00:31:47.799 align:start position:0%
like a very tough question
 
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
um well I I think we could speak to the
 
00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
direct cost that the department had with
 
00:31:55.389 --> 00:31:55.399 align:start position:0%
its relation missions ER but when you
 
00:31:57.549 --> 00:31:57.559 align:start position:0%
think about if you're going to quantify
 
00:31:59.269 --> 00:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
all the time of all the external
 
00:32:01.149 --> 00:32:01.159 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and count that as a cost as
 
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
well that might bring a level of
 
00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
complexity to
 
00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:07.240 align:start position:0%
it I think so we can quantify some of
 
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
the costs for that internally for the
 
00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
Department like we stood up positions
 
00:32:12.149 --> 00:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
for one of the initiatives um that we
 
00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:13.919 align:start position:0%
didn't have before to to be able to do
 
00:32:17.149 --> 00:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
that work all right thank
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
you right so at this point I'd like to
 
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
um go to the next Slide the clerk has a
 
00:32:24.909 --> 00:32:24.919 align:start position:0%
question do you have a question chairman
 
00:32:26.909 --> 00:32:26.919 align:start position:0%
may have you may I ask a question I have
 
00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
a quick question
 
00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:32.200 align:start position:0%
uh and looking uh under the mission zero
 
00:32:34.389 --> 00:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
again a quick comment I'm uh
 
00:32:36.909 --> 00:32:36.919 align:start position:0%
representative Rich nenco from chesher
 
00:32:36.919 --> 00:32:37.870 align:start position:0%
representative Rich nenco from chesher
District

00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
District
 
00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
9 uh and the question is under the
 
00:32:43.029 --> 00:32:43.039 align:start position:0%
bullet that says reduce the health
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
impacts from environmental threats what
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
a summary of what's included under
 
00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
environmental threats sure we're going
 
00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
to go through all of those uh detailed
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
questions at subsequent presentations so
 
00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
we will make sure to write that down
 
00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:00.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question thank you um
 
00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:02.799 align:start position:0%
so the uh next slide of efficient
 
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
stewardship of resources and strong
 
00:33:06.269 --> 00:33:06.279 align:start position:0%
customer service that theme that sort of
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
laying out I'm going to ask Dave weers
 
00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
to come up and join Nathan here to walk
 
00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
you through um some of these systems
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
here although we could sit together we
 
00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:29.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:31.720 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is David weeders
 
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
I'm the Chief Operating Officer for the
 
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
for DHHS thank you for having me here um
 
00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
chairman Mr chair and the members of the
 
00:33:38.799 --> 00:33:40.350 align:start position:0%
chairman Mr chair and the members of the
committee

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:40.360 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
so taking off of what um commissioner
 
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
Weaver just indicated in order to
 
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
achieve a lot of these um road map items
 
00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:51.720 align:start position:0%
as well as providing good customer
 
00:33:54.549 --> 00:33:54.559 align:start position:0%
service we really need to have a way in
 
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
which to be efficient with that so it is
 
00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
always historically been the the promise
 
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
of automation the promise of efficiency
 
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
the promise of making it easier or
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
faster to do things our goal is to try
 
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
to do that in concert with the services
 
00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
that we're doing and so the information
 
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
systems that we have here is really that
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
one of the things I've learned over the
 
00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
last six years of work working and
 
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
living in New Hampshire is making sure
 
00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
that we address everything from a
 
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
privacy first perspective and then
 
00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
security and then making making sure at
 
00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:31.240 align:start position:0%
the same time how do we efficiently meet
 
00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:33.919 align:start position:0%
the expectations of our constituency
 
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
meet the expectations of our legislature
 
00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
meet the expectations of our governor's
 
00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:40.919 align:start position:0%
office and really meet the expectations
 
00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:42.919 align:start position:0%
of our commissioner as well to achieve
 
00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:45.320 align:start position:0%
those goals of customer service so we
 
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
currently support a little over 130
 
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
applications in the department across
 
00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
all of the different programs and in the
 
00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:55.240 align:start position:0%
area we partner with Department of
 
00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
Information Technology to be able to
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
support those as well as several
 
00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
contracts um that we work with the
 
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
contracts division to
 
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
do amongst those 130 applications we
 
00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
have really eight key platforms and the
 
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
reason why I call them key platforms is
 
00:35:12.829 --> 00:35:12.839 align:start position:0%
they're really key enablers for us to
 
00:35:15.109 --> 00:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
automate and actually reduce duplicative
 
00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:17.720 align:start position:0%
effort and provide efficiencies where
 
00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:20.920 align:start position:0%
where possible so we're not building
 
00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:23.800 align:start position:0%
multiple different systems to do very
 
00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
similar components so about 6 years ago
 
00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
actually said our applications were
 
00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:31.640 align:start position:0%
closer to 200 applications that we
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
supported so we've actually reduced our
 
00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
application over the last six years
 
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
those platforms include and you'll hear
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
in my presentation tomorrow some more
 
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
details about these but those those
 
00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
application platforms are the Medicaid
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
enterprise system which is really made
 
00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:52.760 align:start position:0%
up of 14 different um systems in itself
 
00:35:54.589 --> 00:35:54.599 align:start position:0%
that are achieving different components
 
00:35:57.870 --> 00:35:57.880 align:start position:0%
of Medicaid uh Solutions then we also
 
00:35:59.109 --> 00:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
have the Enterprise business
 
00:36:01.069 --> 00:36:01.079 align:start position:0%
intelligence system that we will call
 
00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
ebi you'll so I'm going to try to always
 
00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
Define any acronym that I use um I I
 
00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
definitely as an IT person have that
 
00:36:11.589 --> 00:36:11.599 align:start position:0%
challenge and so anytime you have a
 
00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
question feel free to say what is that
 
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
NH here so then the next one NH Care
 
00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:19.400 align:start position:0%
Connections or New Hampshire Care
 
00:36:22.309 --> 00:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
Connections is our system that really
 
00:36:24.829 --> 00:36:24.839 align:start position:0%
focuses on improving our coordination of
 
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
care but also really focusing on
 
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
emission distri transfer shared care
 
00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:31.160 align:start position:0%
insights and Clos Loop referral so
 
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
you'll hear a lot about that You'
 
00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
probably heard a lot about it over the
 
00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:36.040 align:start position:0%
years I know a number of you have been
 
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
in rooms with me talking about Clos Loop
 
00:36:40.109 --> 00:36:40.119 align:start position:0%
referral but it is much more than just
 
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
Clos Loop referral so you'll hear more
 
00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
about that as
 
00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
well and then we have Granite families
 
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
or Bridges so we have a current um
 
00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
comprehensive child welfare information
 
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
system which we call Bridges it's a 20
 
00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
plus year old system that we've been
 
00:36:58.990 --> 00:36:59.000 align:start position:0%
migrating to to what's called Granite
 
00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
families through funding with
 
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
Administration for children um
 
00:37:08.309 --> 00:37:08.319 align:start position:0%
children's and families um support and
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
and then we also have new heights which
 
00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
you'll hear me say New Heights a lot but
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
they'll also be inclusive of New
 
00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire easy so new heights is our
 
00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:18.760 align:start position:0%
integrated eligibility and enrollment
 
00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
system but it's become so much more in
 
00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
the last couple years where it also
 
00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
supports developmental disabilities so
 
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
instead of implementing a whole new
 
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
system um based off of doing rfis and
 
00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:33.400 align:start position:0%
work with different contracted vendors
 
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:36.040 align:start position:0%
we identified a way in which to expand
 
00:37:38.829 --> 00:37:38.839 align:start position:0%
upon the new heights platform to achieve
 
00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
that goal with a with a reduction in
 
00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:44.440 align:start position:0%
cost overall cost and then we have
 
00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:47.240 align:start position:0%
options which is for our aging and adult
 
00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:49.160 align:start position:0%
population um we're still using that
 
00:37:52.109 --> 00:37:52.119 align:start position:0%
system it is a um doit supported
 
00:37:54.069 --> 00:37:54.079 align:start position:0%
application that we're looking to
 
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
replace over the over time and you'll
 
00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
hear more about that and then the last
 
00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:00.440 align:start position:0%
two are Avatar which is an electronic
 
00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:02.079 align:start position:0%
health records or electronic medical
 
00:38:04.589 --> 00:38:04.599 align:start position:0%
record system that we use currently at
 
00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:05.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
hospital and then Salesforce and
 
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
Salesforce as a platform has enabled us
 
00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:13.960 align:start position:0%
to implement dozens of solutions um
 
00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:15.880 align:start position:0%
within our department in a much quicker
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
fashion than in the past um where we
 
00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
would have to go out to RFP Implement a
 
00:38:24.349 --> 00:38:24.359 align:start position:0%
a silo based solution and then take it
 
00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:26.440 align:start position:0%
Forward um for maintenance and
 
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
operations with the Salesforce platform
 
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
we able to in some cases deliver
 
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
Solutions in 3 days during covid we
 
00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
actually implemented Granite trace for
 
00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
case investigation and patient
 
00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:39.839 align:start position:0%
monitoring for covid in three days over
 
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
a weekend to ensure that we could
 
00:38:44.349 --> 00:38:44.359 align:start position:0%
collect that and other systems like our
 
00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
like child care licensing and registry
 
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
solution for child care and how start
 
00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
development as we go through this and
 
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
streamline these Solutions you'll hear
 
00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
more about when I'm what sort of what
 
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
you were asking representative Edwards
 
00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
where we how do we tie it to our road
 
00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:04.280 align:start position:0%
mapap so the tomorrow's slide will go
 
00:39:06.349 --> 00:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
into more detail as to what are the
 
00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
Technologies behind some of these road
 
00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
map initiatives and how what are the
 
00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:13.640 align:start position:0%
where the human resources taking how is
 
00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
the architecture supporting it and how
 
00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
are we moving it and I can I'm probably
 
00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
going to not go into the details of the
 
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
architecture but I certainly will
 
00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
address the different um technologies
 
00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
that are supporting these road map
 
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
components and then going into that
 
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
second column portfolio management is a
 
00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:33.160 align:start position:0%
key component of how organizations
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
really manage their initiatives how they
 
00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
manage the prioritization of their work
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
and how they manage the overall health
 
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
over the past several years we've been
 
00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
standing up the Enterprise portfolio
 
00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:47.480 align:start position:0%
management solution and our goal is to
 
00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:49.480 align:start position:0%
leverage pinok which is project
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
management book of knowledge it's a
 
00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:53.240 align:start position:0%
standard best practice in the United
 
00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:55.720 align:start position:0%
States and agile project management
 
00:39:58.030 --> 00:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
methodologies to really adopt some of
 
00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
those risk risk management issue
 
00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
management scheduling resourcing and
 
00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
then overall health of a project we've
 
00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:09.400 align:start position:0%
been using that to manage an average of
 
00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:11.800 align:start position:0%
200 projects annually and we've really
 
00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:13.720 align:start position:0%
been aggressive at using it for our road
 
00:40:15.829 --> 00:40:15.839 align:start position:0%
map initiatives to ensure that we can
 
00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
see that it's staying on track and how
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
we're moving it
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
forward I'm going to I'm not going to go
 
00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
through every bullet here but we have
 
00:40:25.309 --> 00:40:25.319 align:start position:0%
invested in a lot of training to ensure
 
00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
people have the resources that they need
 
00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
to be able able to adopt these
 
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
methodologies and then using our
 
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
oversight and Leadership we've been able
 
00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
to coach and move a lot of projects
 
00:40:37.589 --> 00:40:37.599 align:start position:0%
forward faster using these Technologies
 
00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:39.400 align:start position:0%
and I'll hand it over to Nathan to go
 
00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
through our Contracting great thank you
 
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
Dave uh at the Department of Health and
 
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
Human Services we have a centralized
 
00:40:48.589 --> 00:40:48.599 align:start position:0%
contracts unit and our Bureau and what
 
00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
that team does is they prepare all of
 
00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
the solicitations so all the rfps and
 
00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:56.680 align:start position:0%
the rfas and the rfbs and they also
 
00:40:58.750 --> 00:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
handle all the contract amendments and
 
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
Grant agreements and our lease
 
00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:03.800 align:start position:0%
agreements and our regular contracts and
 
00:41:06.109 --> 00:41:06.119 align:start position:0%
a whole Sue of Other M Moes
 
00:41:06.119 --> 00:41:07.630 align:start position:0%
a whole Sue of Other M Moes
intergovernmental

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:07.640 align:start position:0%
intergovernmental
 
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
organization um agreements as well and
 
00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:12.079 align:start position:0%
part of the reason that we've
 
00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
centralized that function uh going back
 
00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:16.520 align:start position:0%
to the commissioner's point is to ensure
 
00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
that the contracts are developed in a
 
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
solid way and have meaningful
 
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
performance measures have enforceable
 
00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
provisions and ensure that we're getting
 
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
the things that we want and there's um
 
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
there's standard templates and
 
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
procedures and members that are trained
 
00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:35.560 align:start position:0%
on this regularly and they work with um
 
00:41:38.109 --> 00:41:38.119 align:start position:0%
the program areas and Leadership across
 
00:41:41.069 --> 00:41:41.079 align:start position:0%
the department and they they put through
 
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
a tremendous amount of volume and I
 
00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:43.880 align:start position:0%
think it's important for this Committee
 
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
just to remember that every contract
 
00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
over $10,000 has to go through the
 
00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:51.800 align:start position:0%
executive counsel process and any if you
 
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
change one word in any contract that's
 
00:41:56.109 --> 00:41:56.119 align:start position:0%
been approved by the executive Council
 
00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
that Amendment needs to go go back
 
00:41:59.910 --> 00:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
through the executive Council so this
 
00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:03.400 align:start position:0%
team moves 7 800 and some years even
 
00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
more than that amendments and contracts
 
00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:07.720 align:start position:0%
through that process and they've
 
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
implemented a lean Six Sigma uh demic
 
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
culture and I think that's really
 
00:42:14.069 --> 00:42:14.079 align:start position:0%
important because basically what that
 
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
means is they're constantly measuring
 
00:42:17.589 --> 00:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
what they're doing they're rethinking
 
00:42:18.829 --> 00:42:18.839 align:start position:0%
what they're doing and they're striving
 
00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:21.800 align:start position:0%
to do that faster and more efficient and
 
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
it also what's really important if um if
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
you've uh been involved in lean Six
 
00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
Sigma the the voice of the customer is a
 
00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
very important component here and we've
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
developed this system both for internal
 
00:42:36.829 --> 00:42:36.839 align:start position:0%
customers but Al also the provider
 
00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:38.720 align:start position:0%
community and those individuals in the
 
00:42:40.109 --> 00:42:40.119 align:start position:0%
community that are responding and that
 
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
system's been intentionally built up
 
00:42:44.069 --> 00:42:44.079 align:start position:0%
that way over a period of years to
 
00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
address deficiencies that leadership had
 
00:42:48.589 --> 00:42:48.599 align:start position:0%
identified six seven eight years ago and
 
00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
we've made some really good strides now
 
00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:54.440 align:start position:0%
they also conduct risk assessments so
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
anytime we're giving out money to a
 
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
provider um we conduct a risk assessment
 
00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
we look at the the operational risks and
 
00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
we also look at the financial risks and
 
00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
that's really important because we then
 
00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
set the contract up based on the risks
 
00:43:11.069 --> 00:43:11.079 align:start position:0%
that we've identified and the level of
 
00:43:12.829 --> 00:43:12.839 align:start position:0%
oversight and monitoring and I'm going
 
00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
to kind of switch the budget for just a
 
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
sec but when you look at our budget
 
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
lines we do have hundreds of millions of
 
00:43:21.309 --> 00:43:21.319 align:start position:0%
dollars in our contracts lines and
 
00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
that's why it's so important to make
 
00:43:24.109 --> 00:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
sure that when you're developing that
 
00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
contract you get it right you make sure
 
00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
it's enforcable but and now I'm going to
 
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
switch to Quality and
 
00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:33.160 align:start position:0%
performance but it's also important that
 
00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
you include meaningful performance
 
00:43:37.589 --> 00:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
measures and so Meredith too will be
 
00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
here tomorrow and she'll be talking
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
about some of what her team does and her
 
00:43:43.390 --> 00:43:43.400 align:start position:0%
team is now working with different
 
00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
program areas to try to incorporate
 
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
those Provisions that will make those
 
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
contracts have better outcomes and give
 
00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:51.599 align:start position:0%
us the ability to measure what are the
 
00:43:53.549 --> 00:43:53.559 align:start position:0%
outputs what are the outcomes is that
 
00:43:54.990 --> 00:43:55.000 align:start position:0%
really worth it you know that that's
 
00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
what we want to try to make sure that
 
00:43:59.630 --> 00:43:59.640 align:start position:0%
can do uh she's also going to be talking
 
00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
about um we do audit our providers on a
 
00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
regular basis um when we identify risk
 
00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:06.200 align:start position:0%
there's certain requirements to make
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
sure that those dollars are spent
 
00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
accordingly um we we also actively look
 
00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
at um the financial Integrity of some
 
00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:17.240 align:start position:0%
some of our smaller providers or some of
 
00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
our high-risk providers we look at their
 
00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:21.400 align:start position:0%
financials on a monthly basis to make
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
sure that there's no solvency issues and
 
00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:25.720 align:start position:0%
if we start to see Trends um we do
 
00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:27.160 align:start position:0%
intervene at time and have a
 
00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
conversation to get a better
 
00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
understanding because as the
 
00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner was indicating we do rely
 
00:44:34.549 --> 00:44:34.559 align:start position:0%
on our providers through our contracted
 
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
or through our contracts or our grants
 
00:44:39.069 --> 00:44:39.079 align:start position:0%
to deliver key critical services and so
 
00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
you know we're we're both we're we're
 
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
we're Partners but we're also ensuring
 
00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:44.680 align:start position:0%
that the dollars are being used
 
00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:48.200 align:start position:0%
effectively um and in responsible ways
 
00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:51.400 align:start position:0%
so um Meritus team also has a fraud
 
00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:53.800 align:start position:0%
waste and and uh abuse team that
 
00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
regularly looks at into um suspicions of
 
00:44:58.990 --> 00:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
fraud and she's going to go into a
 
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
little bit more of that tomorrow but I
 
00:45:02.349 --> 00:45:02.359 align:start position:0%
just kind of want to provide sort of a
 
00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
high broad overview of all the different
 
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:07.960 align:start position:0%
activities that um that that the
 
00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
department does relative to ensuring
 
00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
funds are uh are managed appropriately
 
00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
so and with that we can move May oh yes
 
00:45:21.069 --> 00:45:21.079 align:start position:0%
um okay
 
00:45:23.549 --> 00:45:23.559 align:start position:0%
I I have known that you've been
 
00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
improving the contract management since
 
00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
your arrival and it continues to sound
 
00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:31.000 align:start position:0%
like you're reaching a higher level of
 
00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:33.720 align:start position:0%
professionalism the one one thing that
 
00:45:36.109 --> 00:45:36.119 align:start position:0%
uh has caught my ear this time around
 
00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
and the commissioner mentioned it and is
 
00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:41.960 align:start position:0%
I'd like to maybe when you come back to
 
00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
talk about contracts more
 
00:45:47.589 --> 00:45:47.599 align:start position:0%
deeply I'm I'm interested in the the way
 
00:45:49.549 --> 00:45:49.559 align:start position:0%
in which you're interfacing with the
 
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:51.640 align:start position:0%
public because it sounded like you're
 
00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
you've made a point of making our
 
00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
contract availability more known and
 
00:46:00.349 --> 00:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
easier to access so that we can increase
 
00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:03.160 align:start position:0%
bids and interest in public
 
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
participation uh that that that's kind
 
00:46:07.589 --> 00:46:07.599 align:start position:0%
of new to me that that's an area that
 
00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
you've worked on and if if I've heard
 
00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
you right I'd like to just know more
 
00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:13.960 align:start position:0%
about it but but not today absolutely
 
00:46:17.349 --> 00:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
we've provided a presentation um to
 
00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:19.480 align:start position:0%
another committee and and we can uh
 
00:46:21.309 --> 00:46:21.319 align:start position:0%
refurbish that and bring that back so we
 
00:46:23.069 --> 00:46:23.079 align:start position:0%
can give you that information absolutely
 
00:46:24.109 --> 00:46:24.119 align:start position:0%
all right thank
 
00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
you and with that I'm going to hand it
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
Commissioners thank you so much my name
 
00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:47.960 align:start position:0%
is Patricia Tilly I'm an associate
 
00:46:50.589 --> 00:46:50.599 align:start position:0%
commissioner here at the department and
 
00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
I'm Chris santanello I am also an
 
00:46:54.549 --> 00:46:54.559 align:start position:0%
associate commissioner this feels like
 
00:46:57.790 --> 00:46:57.800 align:start position:0%
oversight it does it does indeed um I'm
 
00:46:59.630 --> 00:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
going to start a little at start first
 
00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
and then I'm going to hand it over to
 
00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:01.880 align:start position:0%
Chris we're going to work
 
00:47:04.069 --> 00:47:04.079 align:start position:0%
synergistically together before I get
 
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
started though because we all felt the
 
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
rocking and roll in a few minutes I'll
 
00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
just give you an update it was a 4.1
 
00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:12.040 align:start position:0%
earthquake in Portsmith there are no
 
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
Health needs in the towns or hospitals
 
00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
in the region so there you go that's
 
00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
what we're doing in the back while we're
 
00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
while you all are presenting we're
 
00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
making sure that everything's safe and
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
sound um for um right now the other
 
00:47:26.349 --> 00:47:26.359 align:start position:0%
piece that I'll start and answer before
 
00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
I get into the slide a little bit was
 
00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:29.800 align:start position:0%
the question earlier around
 
00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:31.640 align:start position:0%
environmental threats I can tell you
 
00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
that we'll talk a little bit more you'll
 
00:47:34.589 --> 00:47:34.599 align:start position:0%
hear more about that probably when
 
00:47:37.349 --> 00:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
public health comes and does their um
 
00:47:39.549 --> 00:47:39.559 align:start position:0%
description of their budget but I to
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
answer your quick question what we're
 
00:47:44.670 --> 00:47:44.680 align:start position:0%
very much focusing on is pasas we are
 
00:47:47.549 --> 00:47:47.559 align:start position:0%
focusing on lead lead both in homes lead
 
00:47:50.349 --> 00:47:50.359 align:start position:0%
in water um we're focusing on food
 
00:47:53.549 --> 00:47:53.559 align:start position:0%
safety and contaminants in foods and
 
00:47:55.309 --> 00:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
supporting our health officers in our
 
00:47:57.470 --> 00:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
towns so that you'll hear more about
 
00:47:59.190 --> 00:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
that when when public health comes and
 
00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:02.200 align:start position:0%
presents later on so let me jump in
 
00:48:05.109 --> 00:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
right now for right now um we're going
 
00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
to focus on Thursday Chris and I around
 
00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:09.800 align:start position:0%
the specialized services and the
 
00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:12.079 align:start position:0%
population Health work that we do within
 
00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
the department um and we're going to
 
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
dive in we're going to talk a little bit
 
00:48:17.309 --> 00:48:17.319 align:start position:0%
about youth we're going to talk about
 
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
older adults we're going to talk about
 
00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:21.400 align:start position:0%
the specialized services that they need
 
00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
at a high level we're going to focusing
 
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
on focus on the ways that we streamline
 
00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:27.839 align:start position:0%
Services as a single agency the
 
00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:31.640 align:start position:0%
department creates a more integrated and
 
00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:33.880 align:start position:0%
coordinated system hopefully making it
 
00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:35.960 align:start position:0%
easier for families and individuals to
 
00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
get the care that they need and the
 
00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:42.280 align:start position:0%
services um in a coordinated fashion and
 
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes in one place we believe that
 
00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:48.280 align:start position:0%
this reduces confusion and um the helps
 
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
us prevent the need to multip to
 
00:48:52.349 --> 00:48:52.359 align:start position:0%
navigate multiple
 
00:48:55.109 --> 00:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
bureaucracies um we think that together
 
00:48:57.789 --> 00:48:57.799 align:start position:0%
we are working on efficiency in our
 
00:49:00.069 --> 00:49:00.079 align:start position:0%
resource allocation by having all of
 
00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:03.160 align:start position:0%
these programs under one Ruth you again
 
00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
as a small state we pride ourself on
 
00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:07.400 align:start position:0%
efficiency as we've heard over and over
 
00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:09.880 align:start position:0%
and in this budget season especially and
 
00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:12.559 align:start position:0%
by combining Services Under One Roof um
 
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
it's maximized available funding
 
00:49:17.349 --> 00:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
Staffing and infrastructure and this
 
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
includes some of the things that I know
 
00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
that um representative Edwards is
 
00:49:23.589 --> 00:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
interested in around evaluation and
 
00:49:26.069 --> 00:49:26.079 align:start position:0%
monitoring those many contracts that um
 
00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
Nathan was just describing we're also
 
00:49:29.589 --> 00:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
going to talk a little bit about our
 
00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:32.200 align:start position:0%
data sharing with all the service these
 
00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
Services under one agency there's better
 
00:49:37.069 --> 00:49:37.079 align:start position:0%
potential for appropriate data sharing
 
00:49:38.789 --> 00:49:38.799 align:start position:0%
we have lots of conversations about
 
00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:41.240 align:start position:0%
security and privacy in many of our
 
00:49:43.789 --> 00:49:43.799 align:start position:0%
efforts but by having someone like Dave
 
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
weeders in Charge who has an eye on all
 
00:49:48.309 --> 00:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
of those systems we're able to more
 
00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
efficiently share information and to
 
00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
improve the services that we have and
 
00:49:54.030 --> 00:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
that that really leads to a more
 
00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
holistic approach to Service delivery um
 
00:49:59.349 --> 00:49:59.359 align:start position:0%
many of the individuals and families who
 
00:50:02.069 --> 00:50:02.079 align:start position:0%
use um require services in one part of
 
00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
the department also require services in
 
00:50:05.549 --> 00:50:05.559 align:start position:0%
another department part of the
 
00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
department and that's why working
 
00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
together we are focusing on how to make
 
00:50:12.829 --> 00:50:12.839 align:start position:0%
sure we streamline that along the way so
 
00:50:15.309 --> 00:50:15.319 align:start position:0%
that we get to improved
 
00:50:18.430 --> 00:50:18.440 align:start position:0%
coordination our road map in particular
 
00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:21.720 align:start position:0%
as the commissioner noted focuses on um
 
00:50:24.069 --> 00:50:24.079 align:start position:0%
Mission zero um we're going to dive into
 
00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
that a little bit more on Thursday the
 
00:50:29.069 --> 00:50:29.079 align:start position:0%
spoiler is we did have gotten to zero in
 
00:50:31.309 --> 00:50:31.319 align:start position:0%
the mission zero it's hard to sustain
 
00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
that and that's why you're going to hear
 
00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
about the multiple funding streams to
 
00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:37.480 align:start position:0%
your question earlier representative you
 
00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:39.839 align:start position:0%
know the reason it's hard for us to give
 
00:50:42.349 --> 00:50:42.359 align:start position:0%
you a single answer is because it the
 
00:50:45.789 --> 00:50:45.799 align:start position:0%
foundation is so complex we use Medicaid
 
00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
we use individual grants we use General
 
00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
funds and they're from all different
 
00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
parts all coming together to be able to
 
00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
lift up this initiative so that we can
 
00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
reduce the burden of emergency
 
00:50:59.589 --> 00:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
department boarding for people who are
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
experiencing acute mental health needs
 
00:51:04.990 --> 00:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
we all know that's not that is not what
 
00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:07.480 align:start position:0%
we want and we can you we have used
 
00:51:10.270 --> 00:51:10.280 align:start position:0%
Mission zero to focus energy to use
 
00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
every lever we have to lift that up to
 
00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
make change we're going to focus um as
 
00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:17.000 align:start position:0%
the commissioner also noted on the
 
00:51:19.950 --> 00:51:19.960 align:start position:0%
system of care coordinated systems for
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
children and Behavioral Health there is
 
00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
not one of us who hasn't experienced in
 
00:51:26.589 --> 00:51:26.599 align:start position:0%
our own families or our friends and
 
00:51:28.349 --> 00:51:28.359 align:start position:0%
neighbors the impact of the Mental
 
00:51:30.109 --> 00:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
Health crisis among children in the
 
00:51:33.069 --> 00:51:33.079 align:start position:0%
state and so we are looking to better
 
00:51:36.309 --> 00:51:36.319 align:start position:0%
coordinate that care and make for both
 
00:51:38.309 --> 00:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
the population of kids that we are in
 
00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
charge of that we have care and control
 
00:51:42.549 --> 00:51:42.559 align:start position:0%
of through dcyf as well as for your
 
00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:45.240 align:start position:0%
neighbors and for your constituents and
 
00:51:46.789 --> 00:51:46.799 align:start position:0%
through that we're really looking at
 
00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
aligning or embedding prevention
 
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
everywhere centralizing a place to call
 
00:51:54.990 --> 00:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
for help scaling helpful Services
 
00:51:57.549 --> 00:51:57.559 align:start position:0%
strengthening supports to stay home and
 
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
out of those institutions where possible
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
and coordinating expert care when we
 
00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
need it so um you one a few of the other
 
00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:07.640 align:start position:0%
things we'll poke at on Thursday is
 
00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
really uh focusing on dcyf a little bit
 
00:52:12.789 --> 00:52:12.799 align:start position:0%
you know that's in plays hand inand with
 
00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
our system of of care of Behavioral
 
00:52:16.309 --> 00:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
Health but there are also some
 
00:52:17.789 --> 00:52:17.799 align:start position:0%
particular issues that I know may be
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
interested of this committee around the
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
senu Youth Services Center and that
 
00:52:24.430 --> 00:52:24.440 align:start position:0%
transition to a new facility so we'll
 
00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
dig into that a little bit so I'm going
 
00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
to hand it over to Chris and let you
 
00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:29.960 align:start position:0%
take it from there right thank you could
 
00:52:32.069 --> 00:52:32.079 align:start position:0%
you just give me just one moment I out
 
00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
of respect for the commissioner's time I
 
00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:36.520 align:start position:0%
I think you're getting ready to to leave
 
00:52:38.349 --> 00:52:38.359 align:start position:0%
do you have any final words or thoughts
 
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:44.920 align:start position:0%
you okay all right sorry for the
 
00:52:47.829 --> 00:52:47.839 align:start position:0%
interruption no no no problem um I think
 
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
also what we want to cover on Thursday
 
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
is the system of care for healthy aging
 
00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
and how as an aging State we are working
 
00:52:59.549 --> 00:52:59.559 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with our partners with
 
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
the state Commission on Aging to
 
00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
increase our ability to provide Home and
 
00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
communitybased Services um in um instead
 
00:53:11.789 --> 00:53:11.799 align:start position:0%
of institutional care um we're going to
 
00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
talk about that we're also going to talk
 
00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
a little bit about the preventative
 
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
programs that we have under older
 
00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
Americans act which actually help
 
00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
provide supports to older adults before
 
00:53:27.789 --> 00:53:27.799 align:start position:0%
they need um more more significant level
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
of care before they have Medicaid so
 
00:53:32.549 --> 00:53:32.559 align:start position:0%
something like Meals on Wheels is a
 
00:53:35.789 --> 00:53:35.799 align:start position:0%
really important program because for
 
00:53:38.829 --> 00:53:38.839 align:start position:0%
many people who access it that's the
 
00:53:41.230 --> 00:53:41.240 align:start position:0%
only contact they have with somebody so
 
00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
it provides a lot more um than nutrition
 
00:53:46.430 --> 00:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
um we're going to also talk a little bit
 
00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
about how we're working together um like
 
00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:51.640 align:start position:0%
I said with the state committee on Aging
 
00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:53.720 align:start position:0%
um with some of that work and also Adult
 
00:53:55.630 --> 00:53:55.640 align:start position:0%
Protective Services that is required
 
00:53:57.710 --> 00:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
under state law but what is the
 
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
interface for how we support um
 
00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:03.880 align:start position:0%
vulnerable adults as well as our aging
 
00:54:05.950 --> 00:54:05.960 align:start position:0%
and disability Resource Centers how
 
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
they're um critical as part of the
 
00:54:11.589 --> 00:54:11.599 align:start position:0%
system of care to help increase access
 
00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:13.480 align:start position:0%
the right service at the right time at
 
00:54:16.549 --> 00:54:16.559 align:start position:0%
the right place we'll also spend um a
 
00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
significant amount of time on our
 
00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:22.200 align:start position:0%
developmental Services System um and and
 
00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
how we're strengthening that um and
 
00:54:28.349 --> 00:54:28.359 align:start position:0%
building rate work to help us have
 
00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:30.280 align:start position:0%
predictable um
 
00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
standardized approach to um services
 
00:54:36.910 --> 00:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
using an assessment based approach that
 
00:54:39.870 --> 00:54:39.880 align:start position:0%
will help us over time um to really have
 
00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
but better um budget predictability so I
 
00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
think that's it in the interest of time
 
00:54:51.069 --> 00:54:51.079 align:start position:0%
um I will have an Step Up um may I say
 
00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
something about public health sure um I
 
00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:56.799 align:start position:0%
one of the things I've been thinking
 
00:54:58.470 --> 00:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
about as we're grappling with the
 
00:55:00.829 --> 00:55:00.839 align:start position:0%
challenge of the of the coming budget
 
00:55:05.390 --> 00:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
cycle is that we we just went through an
 
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
enormous change in our Public Health
 
00:55:12.069 --> 00:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
expectations because of covid and so so
 
00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm just wondering at a very simple
 
00:55:18.430 --> 00:55:18.440 align:start position:0%
sophomoric level as I go into this what
 
00:55:23.150 --> 00:55:23.160 align:start position:0%
if we were to take as a baseline
 
00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
2019 and looked at the programs that you
 
00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
want in
 
00:55:32.029 --> 00:55:32.039 align:start position:0%
2025 is being additive to that so that
 
00:55:35.349 --> 00:55:35.359 align:start position:0%
we can understand which ones are driven
 
00:55:37.309 --> 00:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
by the crisis and which ones are just
 
00:55:39.710 --> 00:55:39.720 align:start position:0%
driven by greater public health
 
00:55:42.109 --> 00:55:42.119 align:start position:0%
awareness and and we don't have to do
 
00:55:44.589 --> 00:55:44.599 align:start position:0%
that today but I just wanted to share
 
00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
with you sort of my simple sophomoric
 
00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
view of how to think about your Public
 
00:55:52.190 --> 00:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
Health Mission thank you and and the
 
00:55:53.789 --> 00:55:53.799 align:start position:0%
only respon I think that's great we can
 
00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:55.240 align:start position:0%
talk about that further in the public
 
00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
health um discuss of the budget the
 
00:55:58.910 --> 00:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
thing I would leave you with is that the
 
00:56:01.109 --> 00:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
greatest um there were not many gifts of
 
00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:03.640 align:start position:0%
the pandemic but one of the small gifts
 
00:56:05.470 --> 00:56:05.480 align:start position:0%
was the ability to modernize our data
 
00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:07.720 align:start position:0%
systems and so I don't think of that as
 
00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
additive I think that that it was an
 
00:56:11.549 --> 00:56:11.559 align:start position:0%
opportunity to use an influx of federal
 
00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:13.880 align:start position:0%
funds to get our our Data Systems to the
 
00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:28.829 --> 00:56:28.839 align:start position:0%
be it's so cter intuitive I I just want
 
00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
to um I didn't realize that Croc was
 
00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
wrong so it's actually 10:55 so I I do
 
00:56:37.710 --> 00:56:37.720 align:start position:0%
have to run across the street but um I
 
00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:39.839 align:start position:0%
wanted to um Ann's going to come up and
 
00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:41.240 align:start position:0%
and work the next slide but I just
 
00:56:42.870 --> 00:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to say thank you for the
 
00:56:45.069 --> 00:56:45.079 align:start position:0%
opportunity um and I'm going to pray
 
00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
that it's not a bad Omen that there was
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
an earthquake in the middle of my
 
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
resentation and my chair was shaking so
 
00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
um but Ann you want to come come up and
 
00:56:53.829 --> 00:56:53.839 align:start position:0%
so I think after Ann's piece on the
 
00:56:55.710 --> 00:56:55.720 align:start position:0%
Medicaid if we could just get for from
 
00:56:57.309 --> 00:56:57.319 align:start position:0%
you your thoughts in terms of things
 
00:56:59.109 --> 00:56:59.119 align:start position:0%
that are uh questions you may have had
 
00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:00.200 align:start position:0%
that you want to make sure that we
 
00:57:02.309 --> 00:57:02.319 align:start position:0%
address um in subsequent presentations
 
00:57:08.549 --> 00:57:08.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:10.349 --> 00:57:10.359 align:start position:0%
you good
 
00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:12.920 align:start position:0%

00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
of our associate Commissioners and I'm

the chief medical officer and while you
 
00:57:21.990 --> 00:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
may be surprised that well at least I'm
 
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
here on behalf of Medicaid because
 
00:57:25.789 --> 00:57:25.799 align:start position:0%
you're used to director lipin I'm just
 
00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
going to give you a brief overview of
 
00:57:29.349 --> 00:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
our Medicaid Program and and walk you
 
00:57:32.670 --> 00:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
through some of the um Concepts and and
 
00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
intricacies of the program that Henry
 
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
will will walk us through on Monday or
 
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
next Monday
 
00:57:44.109 --> 00:57:44.119 align:start position:0%
so um here our slide really depicts um
 
00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:46.720 align:start position:0%
how Medicaid funding intersects with all
 
00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:49.640 align:start position:0%
of the different programs um that we
 
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
execute in the Pro in the department and
 
00:57:54.190 --> 00:57:54.200 align:start position:0%
Beyond but really as you know Medicaid
 
00:57:56.789 --> 00:57:56.799 align:start position:0%
is the insurer for our most vul vble
 
00:57:59.710 --> 00:57:59.720 align:start position:0%
residents and citizens um in the state
 
00:58:01.789 --> 00:58:01.799 align:start position:0%
and those with the most complex needs is
 
00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
really is that Lifeline for those
 
00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
individuals who cannot um Access
 
00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
healthcare anywhere else um so clearly a
 
00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:12.200 align:start position:0%
critical program it really covers
 
00:58:14.589 --> 00:58:14.599 align:start position:0%
specific populations it's it's not just
 
00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
anyone who can get Medicaid obviously
 
00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:19.160 align:start position:0%
it's individuals with low incomes
 
00:58:21.549 --> 00:58:21.559 align:start position:0%
whether that's pregnant women children
 
00:58:24.630 --> 00:58:24.640 align:start position:0%
families and a certain um group of
 
00:58:26.910 --> 00:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
adults it's individ idual with
 
00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:29.720 align:start position:0%
disabilities and then elderly
 
00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:33.400 align:start position:0%
individuals um and as we know Medicaid
 
00:58:36.349 --> 00:58:36.359 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid Program really has two um
 
00:58:38.109 --> 00:58:38.119 align:start position:0%
two different components it's it's the
 
00:58:41.109 --> 00:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
required Federal components of Medicaid
 
00:58:42.910 --> 00:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
whether that's impatient and outpatient
 
00:58:45.029 --> 00:58:45.039 align:start position:0%
hospitalization for example and then the
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire approved optional benefits
 
00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
which as you know the most recent is
 
00:58:53.150 --> 00:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
really um Dental um Dental benefit so
 
00:58:56.309 --> 00:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
there's a wide range of of required and
 
00:58:57.990 --> 00:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
then optional benefits that Henry will
 
00:58:59.230 --> 00:58:59.240 align:start position:0%
walk us
 
00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
through we also know that and um that we
 
00:59:05.710 --> 00:59:05.720 align:start position:0%
deliver these Services through a couple
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
of different mechanisms there State
 
00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:09.839 align:start position:0%
there state plan amendments that some of
 
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
our services are covered through and
 
00:59:13.630 --> 00:59:13.640 align:start position:0%
then Federal W federally approved
 
00:59:15.829 --> 00:59:15.839 align:start position:0%
waivers which for example our Managed
 
00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
Care organizations our our Managed Care
 
00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
Program is covered through a waiver so
 
00:59:23.829 --> 00:59:23.839 align:start position:0%
again um on a week from say Henry will
 
00:59:25.710 --> 00:59:25.720 align:start position:0%
really walk you through how what are the
 
00:59:28.109 --> 00:59:28.119 align:start position:0%
differ between services covered by state
 
00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
plan Amendment what are services covered
 
00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
under waivers what are the differences
 
00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
where is our overlap where do we um
 
00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
leverage those different mechanisms to
 
00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
best serve the residents of New
 
00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and how do we hold ourselves
 
00:59:44.109 --> 00:59:44.119 align:start position:0%
accountable which Jonathan will talk a
 
00:59:47.589 --> 00:59:47.599 align:start position:0%
little bit about in a in a minute um and
 
00:59:49.589 --> 00:59:49.599 align:start position:0%
then of course
 
00:59:53.069 --> 00:59:53.079 align:start position:0%
um as as the wheel says like or
 
00:59:56.069 --> 00:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
indicates we have all of these different
 
00:59:58.390 --> 00:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
programs that rely on Medicaid funding
 
00:59:59.750 --> 00:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
so we have our Med our division of
 
01:00:01.789 --> 01:00:01.799 align:start position:0%
Medicaid services but we're just not in
 
01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
a vacuum at the department or in the
 
01:00:05.710 --> 01:00:05.720 align:start position:0%
state we're constantly interacting with
 
01:00:08.069 --> 01:00:08.079 align:start position:0%
Chris's teams and Trisha's teams um we
 
01:00:10.309 --> 01:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
have Jonathan as a Med medical oversight
 
01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
that works really closely with division
 
01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:14.440 align:start position:0%
Youth and Family Services on what those
 
01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
children's needs are so we're not a
 
01:00:19.069 --> 01:00:19.079 align:start position:0%
siloed Division and we're really hand
 
01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
inand with all of the different
 
01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:21.720 align:start position:0%
divisions at the department
 
01:00:22.829 --> 01:00:22.839 align:start position:0%
understanding what those programmatic
 
01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:25.599 align:start position:0%
needs are where the Medicaid funding is
 
01:00:28.349 --> 01:00:28.359 align:start position:0%
I think um what will be really
 
01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:31.240 align:start position:0%
interesting and what you'll be wanting
 
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
to understand next week with Henry is
 
01:00:34.990 --> 01:00:35.000 align:start position:0%
really how does that Federal match work
 
01:00:36.829 --> 01:00:36.839 align:start position:0%
what does that mean what part is the is
 
01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
the state paying versus what the federal
 
01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:42.280 align:start position:0%
um government is paying for our Medicaid
 
01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
Program here in New Hampshire and how
 
01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
that may change depending on different
 
01:00:48.390 --> 01:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
programs and what that match looks like
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to stop there I'm going to
 
01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
ask Jonathan if you have anything sure
 
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
I'd like to mention accountability I
 
01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
mean so of The 100 84,000 individuals
 
01:01:00.069 --> 01:01:00.079 align:start position:0%
that are covered for with Medicaid in
 
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh it's actually a small
 
01:01:05.390 --> 01:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
population in Medicaid terms compared to
 
01:01:07.349 --> 01:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
most States even of states that are
 
01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:09.640 align:start position:0%
comparable of size to New Hampshire
 
01:01:11.029 --> 01:01:11.039 align:start position:0%
that's because New Hampshire is a
 
01:01:13.109 --> 01:01:13.119 align:start position:0%
healthy State you know in the rankings
 
01:01:14.910 --> 01:01:14.920 align:start position:0%
we are among the healthiest states in
 
01:01:17.069 --> 01:01:17.079 align:start position:0%
the country but that's not true among
 
01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
our Medicaid population and so we we
 
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
want to make improvements and continue
 
01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire being the healthiest state
 
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
in the country we really have to be
 
01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:29.640 align:start position:0%
accountable to you and to taxpayers with
 
01:01:32.349 --> 01:01:32.359 align:start position:0%
good stewardship of those funds and so
 
01:01:34.670 --> 01:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
that's why you'll hear from director
 
01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:37.960 align:start position:0%
Meredith tus director Henry Litman in
 
01:01:40.349 --> 01:01:40.359 align:start position:0%
subsequent uh talks about
 
01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
accountability how we do that through
 
01:01:44.950 --> 01:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
contracts and and other mechanisms so
 
01:01:47.029 --> 01:01:47.039 align:start position:0%
there's a real connection between our
 
01:01:50.109 --> 01:01:50.119 align:start position:0%
Medical Services Unit and Medicaid with
 
01:01:52.470 --> 01:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
driving the accountability in those
 
01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
contracts for the good stewardship of
 
01:01:56.549 --> 01:01:56.559 align:start position:0%
those funds don't want to get into the
 
01:01:58.349 --> 01:01:58.359 align:start position:0%
weeds we will in the future but the
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
example is that with the MCO contract we
 
01:02:05.269 --> 01:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we are uh
 
01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
reducing cost and using those funds
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
efficiently and one mechanism that we do
 
01:02:13.470 --> 01:02:13.480 align:start position:0%
that is to have a coordinated system for
 
01:02:14.789 --> 01:02:14.799 align:start position:0%
those individuals that are covered
 
01:02:18.029 --> 01:02:18.039 align:start position:0%
through Medicaid we collect over
 
01:02:23.109 --> 01:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
300 uh U metrics from the mcos on how
 
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
the population is doing from claims data
 
01:02:29.549 --> 01:02:29.559 align:start position:0%
to actual quality data uh for the how
 
01:02:30.829 --> 01:02:30.839 align:start position:0%
healthy people
 
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
are um we one Central One Central metric
 
01:02:38.069 --> 01:02:38.079 align:start position:0%
example is the percentage of patients
 
01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
that have a primary care doctor who see
 
01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:43.000 align:start position:0%
that primary care doctor and have a
 
01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
health physical checkup with their
 
01:02:48.109 --> 01:02:48.119 align:start position:0%
primary care doctor that's an example of
 
01:02:51.789 --> 01:02:51.799 align:start position:0%
a metric that we H use very heavily in
 
01:02:51.799 --> 01:02:52.750 align:start position:0%
a metric that we H use very heavily in
our

01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:02:55.829 --> 01:02:55.839 align:start position:0%
contracts as far as uh assessing
 
01:02:58.549 --> 01:02:58.559 align:start position:0%
liquidated damages to to mcos if the
 
01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
patients do not have that or rewarding
 
01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
them through mechanisms such as
 
01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
performance-based Auto assignment
 
01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
assigning more patients to an MCO who's
 
01:03:11.230 --> 01:03:11.240 align:start position:0%
doing a better job of connecting
 
01:03:13.710 --> 01:03:13.720 align:start position:0%
patients to a primary care doctor the
 
01:03:16.190 --> 01:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
idea here is we're reducing costs by
 
01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
having a coordinated system Primary Care
 
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
is far cheaper than an individual being
 
01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
hospitalized or having a a necessary
 
01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
emergency room visit so that's just a
 
01:03:29.710 --> 01:03:29.720 align:start position:0%
diving into a little bit of a way that
 
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
we want to be accountable and be very
 
01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
mindful that these are taxpayer funds
 
01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
ours thank you Jonathan and just to
 
01:03:42.069 --> 01:03:42.079 align:start position:0%
highlight the number of individuals on
 
01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:44.200 align:start position:0%
Medicaid in the state of New Hampshire J
 
01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:44.910 align:start position:0%
Medicaid in the state of New Hampshire J
about

01:03:44.910 --> 01:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:03:49.309 --> 01:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
185 um 185,000 just just to put that in
 
01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
perspective of almost 990,000 of those
 
01:03:54.349 --> 01:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
are children too so it's important to
 
01:03:58.109 --> 01:03:58.119 align:start position:0%
know that we're really ensuring that our
 
01:04:00.269 --> 01:04:00.279 align:start position:0%
future our children are getting the best
 
01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
health that they can possibly get to
 
01:04:03.789 --> 01:04:03.799 align:start position:0%
ensure that their livelihood and and
 
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
self-sufficiency when they're older is
 
01:04:08.190 --> 01:04:08.200 align:start position:0%
there so I think that's really
 
01:04:11.069 --> 01:04:11.079 align:start position:0%
critical we can stop there we have a
 
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
really detailed presentation I'm
 
01:04:15.789 --> 01:04:15.799 align:start position:0%
prepared for next Monday on Medicaid 101
 
01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
the difference of Medicaid and medic
 
01:04:19.390 --> 01:04:19.400 align:start position:0%
Medicare and all of the different as I
 
01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
said funding component components types
 
01:04:24.549 --> 01:04:24.559 align:start position:0%
of populations covered eligibility
 
01:04:28.349 --> 01:04:28.359 align:start position:0%
process um funing mechanisms um and such
 
01:04:30.190 --> 01:04:30.200 align:start position:0%
so if there's any um additional
 
01:04:31.470 --> 01:04:31.480 align:start position:0%
questions that you would like us to
 
01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
address next Monday we're happy to
 
01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
include that in our presentation I know
 
01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards has has worked
 
01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
with Henry a bit to to provide an
 
01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
outline of what you may expect so we're
 
01:04:45.069 --> 01:04:45.079 align:start position:0%
happy to to add to that as well um or if
 
01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
there are any other questions for any of
 
01:04:50.349 --> 01:04:50.359 align:start position:0%
us um any um I'm I I think you're
 
01:04:52.109 --> 01:04:52.119 align:start position:0%
meaning to open that up to everyone
 
01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
who's spoken so far yeah uh are there
 
01:04:57.829 --> 01:04:57.839 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee uh
 
01:04:57.839 --> 01:04:59.430 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee uh
representative

01:04:59.430 --> 01:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:05:02.269 --> 01:05:02.279 align:start position:0%
Daniels and and just a reminder of how
 
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
we we do uh business I I put it in an
 
01:05:09.309 --> 01:05:09.319 align:start position:0%
email one once I turn the microphone
 
01:05:12.549 --> 01:05:12.559 align:start position:0%
over to one of uh the committee members
 
01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
uh you're you're free to engage in um a
 
01:05:18.670 --> 01:05:18.680 align:start position:0%
natural conversation with the people at
 
01:05:20.670 --> 01:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
the desk you don't need to keep coming
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
back to me to ask for followup and as
 
01:05:26.309 --> 01:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
long as we re maintain
 
01:05:29.390 --> 01:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
a common track uh that that's that's
 
01:05:31.349 --> 01:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
great I think that's a preferable way of
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
going so it's a little different than
 
01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
other committees but go ahead
 
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative Daniels thank you Mr
 
01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I actually have a number of
 
01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
questions some of them are probably
 
01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
short others may be a little longer uh
 
01:05:46.589 --> 01:05:46.599 align:start position:0%
regarding the Staffing we we were given
 
01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
a number uh does that include full-time
 
01:05:52.190 --> 01:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
parttime okay I'm sorry because I can
 
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
see the logistics here right now uh
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to maybe start having uh
 
01:06:00.029 --> 01:06:00.039 align:start position:0%
members of the audience come up there's
 
01:06:02.910 --> 01:06:02.920 align:start position:0%
a bank of microphones along the seats if
 
01:06:05.589 --> 01:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
you get asked to come up just grab one
 
01:06:08.309 --> 01:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
of these side seats and stay there until
 
01:06:08.319 --> 01:06:12.829 align:start position:0%
of these side seats and stay there until
we're

01:06:12.829 --> 01:06:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:15.630 --> 01:06:15.640 align:start position:0%
done right we we we do want to do that
 
01:06:17.069 --> 01:06:17.079 align:start position:0%
but if there's an answer an
 
01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement let's do that too okay
 
01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
uh so yeah I'd be interested in the
 
01:06:25.829 --> 01:06:25.839 align:start position:0%
breakdown uh whether that 3200
 
01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
uh employees uh include full-time
 
01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
part-time Andor Contracting and what
 
01:06:33.309 --> 01:06:33.319 align:start position:0%
what the numbers
 
01:06:37.589 --> 01:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
are um Mr White I have a qu question for
 
01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
him uh in the example he gave on Tanner
 
01:06:43.789 --> 01:06:43.799 align:start position:0%
he said we had to spend 34 million in
 
01:06:46.269 --> 01:06:46.279 align:start position:0%
order to get 38 million but then he
 
01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned something for a about a
 
01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
penalty and I'm wondering if we're if we
 
01:06:53.950 --> 01:06:53.960 align:start position:0%
are penalized for not spending according
 
01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
to Federal expectations
 
01:06:59.549 --> 01:06:59.559 align:start position:0%
I can
 
01:06:59.559 --> 01:07:02.150 align:start position:0%
I can
answer

01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
answer
 
01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
okay ex the Chris Sello associate
 
01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner right now we are not in a
 
01:07:09.349 --> 01:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
penalty phase with tanif but I can have
 
01:07:11.829 --> 01:07:11.839 align:start position:0%
Nathan better explain it because it
 
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
starts a spiral and it's really hard to
 
01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
get out of that spiral once you go down
 
01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
in that but Nathan can be prepared to
 
01:07:21.390 --> 01:07:21.400 align:start position:0%
talk about that and the slide that
 
01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
you're asking about positions those are
 
01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
only full-time authorized reflected on
 
01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
that sheet if you would like something
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
in addition we can ask Nathan to pull
 
01:07:33.029 --> 01:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you and and the uh to
 
01:07:35.549 --> 01:07:35.559 align:start position:0%
just follow up on that the uh fulltime
 
01:07:37.150 --> 01:07:37.160 align:start position:0%
does that include any positions that may
 
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
be vacant right now yes okay thank you
 
01:07:44.950 --> 01:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
um I think I'll I'll wait till Thursday
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
because I've heard heard a lot about uh
 
01:07:48.829 --> 01:07:48.839 align:start position:0%
performance measurements and one of my
 
01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
questions was how how you are measuring
 
01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:52.670 align:start position:0%
questions was how how you are measuring
for

01:07:52.670 --> 01:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:07:55.549 --> 01:07:55.559 align:start position:0%
Success um
 
01:07:58.069 --> 01:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
in uh in one of the earlier slides the
 
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
the commissioner mentioned a culture of
 
01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:03.480 align:start position:0%
belonging and I wonder if somebody could
 
01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
elaborate a little bit more what what a
 
01:08:09.630 --> 01:08:09.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
means uh see Dave said he will address
 
01:08:16.269 --> 01:08:16.279 align:start position:0%
that tomorrow tomorrow okay okay thank
 
01:08:20.189 --> 01:08:20.199 align:start position:0%
you um on the slide that talked about
 
01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
the uh Youth and older adults what is
 
01:08:27.789 --> 01:08:27.799 align:start position:0%
the age range for youth and for older
 
01:08:30.349 --> 01:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
adults that depends on the program but
 
01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
some of our programs go for youth is 0
 
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
to 18 some go up into the 20s depending
 
01:08:38.070 --> 01:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
on their particular needs Chris you
 
01:08:40.990 --> 01:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
could probably have same for um aging
 
01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
and adult Services some start at 18 some
 
01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
start at 60 so I will map that out for
 
01:08:49.269 --> 01:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
you on Thursday okay I appreciate that
 
01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:53.239 align:start position:0%
um there was a mention about uh a PCP
 
01:08:55.950 --> 01:08:55.960 align:start position:0%
visit uh to to kind of
 
01:09:00.110 --> 01:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
keep a benchmark going uh with medic
 
01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
Medicare recipients uh they have an
 
01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
annual Wellness visit which as I
 
01:09:08.789 --> 01:09:08.799 align:start position:0%
understand really doesn't do much except
 
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
Mark something down on paper there's not
 
01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
too much physical examination or
 
01:09:15.269 --> 01:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
anything like that so I curious as to
 
01:09:17.630 --> 01:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
how that fits into the program I can
 
01:09:19.870 --> 01:09:19.880 align:start position:0%
answer that question now so Medicaid
 
01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
does not have a Medicare Wellness visit
 
01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
so what we're really looking at is most
 
01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
for the 90,000 children uh we since the
 
01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
pandemic it's incredibly important for
 
01:09:33.309 --> 01:09:33.319 align:start position:0%
them to have in-person Wellness visits
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
because that's where they get things
 
01:09:38.189 --> 01:09:38.199 align:start position:0%
like lead screening it has to be done in
 
01:09:40.749 --> 01:09:40.759 align:start position:0%
person so they have a depending on the
 
01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
age primarily has a different types of
 
01:09:45.990 --> 01:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
services that are recommended uh for
 
01:09:47.829 --> 01:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
that type of visit but it's not like the
 
01:09:49.709 --> 01:09:49.719 align:start position:0%
Medicare Wellness that don't even
 
01:09:51.630 --> 01:09:51.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't even require a physical exam
 
01:09:55.630 --> 01:09:55.640 align:start position:0%
these require a provider doctor other
 
01:09:57.669 --> 01:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
providers you know physically examining
 
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
the patient and Performing services like
 
01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:02.440 align:start position:0%
screening for elevated lead levels good
 
01:10:05.149 --> 01:10:05.159 align:start position:0%
to know thank you and then my last one
 
01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
has to do with uh long-term care in the
 
01:10:10.149 --> 01:10:10.159 align:start position:0%
in kind of the coordination between
 
01:10:14.149 --> 01:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
programs um about five years ago I
 
01:10:16.830 --> 01:10:16.840 align:start position:0%
assisted my dad going through to to get
 
01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:17.630 align:start position:0%
assisted my dad going through to to get
on

01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:10:20.270 --> 01:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
Medicade and we had a we get into a
 
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
situation where the facility would not
 
01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
accept him until until uh we get the
 
01:10:29.709 --> 01:10:29.719 align:start position:0%
okay from the Department that he was
 
01:10:32.070 --> 01:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
accepted for Medicaid but medic he would
 
01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
they would not accept him for Medicaid
 
01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
until the facility said that they would
 
01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
take him so it wasn't until we got
 
01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
involved in a three-way call and the
 
01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
department says well we also have
 
01:10:45.070 --> 01:10:45.080 align:start position:0%
Senator Daniels on the line and suddenly
 
01:10:47.790 --> 01:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
all the doors opened and everything was
 
01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
okay and came together quickly and I'm
 
01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
wondering you know does that kind of
 
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
situation still exist and if so how do
 
01:10:59.149 --> 01:10:59.159 align:start position:0%
we get past it um I will address that on
 
01:11:01.870 --> 01:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
Thursday as well um when we talk about
 
01:11:03.709 --> 01:11:03.719 align:start position:0%
and some of the work in our system of
 
01:11:06.990 --> 01:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
care for healthy aging actually um
 
01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
altered How We Do eligibility to help
 
01:11:11.590 --> 01:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
get the access at the right time but
 
01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
I'll talk a little bit about the
 
01:11:16.390 --> 01:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
coordination of our financial unit and
 
01:11:18.590 --> 01:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
our medical eligibility unit and how
 
01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
we're working together okay thank you
 
01:11:23.470 --> 01:11:23.480 align:start position:0%
very much thank you Mr chairman uh are
 
01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
there any other questions from the Comm
 
01:11:27.430 --> 01:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
committee I I I have a couple but go
 
01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
ahead I just want to make sure I heard
 
01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
that correctly did I hear correctly that
 
01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
Medicaid does not cover adult wellness
 
01:11:36.430 --> 01:11:36.440 align:start position:0%
and annual adult
 
01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
Wellness Medicare Medicare has a very
 
01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
specific Medicare Wellness visit that is
 
01:11:47.669 --> 01:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
different than a preventive Health visit
 
01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
that would be in Medicaid the Medicare
 
01:11:52.510 --> 01:11:52.520 align:start position:0%
there's two types there's a welcome to
 
01:11:54.030 --> 01:11:54.040 align:start position:0%
Medicare visit and then there's the
 
01:11:58.709 --> 01:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
Medicare annual visit so that's strictly
 
01:12:02.669 --> 01:12:02.679 align:start position:0%
Medicare and the that type of visit that
 
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
representative Daniels talks spoke about
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh is very limited in scope for visits
 
01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
that happen in Medicaid it is a fullon
 
01:12:14.990 --> 01:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
physical exam in addressing the
 
01:12:16.390 --> 01:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
different Health needs of that
 
01:12:18.030 --> 01:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
individual person whether it's a child
 
01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
or adult thanks for the clarification
 
01:12:23.189 --> 01:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
and and of course you want to brag about
 
01:12:25.310 --> 01:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
how in the dental program the adult
 
01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
dental program we included a preventive
 
01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:28.750 align:start position:0%
dental program we included a preventive
uh

01:12:28.750 --> 01:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:30.950 align:start position:0%
uh
component

01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
component
 
01:12:36.709 --> 01:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
absolutely um so the Medicaid population
 
01:12:38.910 --> 01:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to know more about the kids
 
01:12:43.270 --> 01:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
part of this uh later this week um we
 
01:12:46.990 --> 01:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
990,000 approximately of about 185,000
 
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
I'll call that half um are kids I can't
 
01:12:54.629 --> 01:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
imagine that the kids are contributing
 
01:12:57.470 --> 01:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
half of the cost though I got to imagine
 
01:13:01.270 --> 01:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
that the the adult side is relatively
 
01:13:04.030 --> 01:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
more expensive on a per capita basis but
 
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
maybe you could share the those details
 
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
with me later we'll we'll take that down
 
01:13:12.629 --> 01:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards and uh bring that
 
01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
back to you in the next talk but I can
 
01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
tell you though that um many of the
 
01:13:18.030 --> 01:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
individuals that are children that
 
01:13:20.350 --> 01:13:20.360 align:start position:0%
Medicaid covers have very complex
 
01:13:23.470 --> 01:13:23.480 align:start position:0%
medical needs some are very high cost
 
01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
and require specialized services in
 
01:13:27.149 --> 01:13:27.159 align:start position:0%
other states children's hospitals in
 
01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
other states and those bills can run up
 
01:13:31.470 --> 01:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
in the millions or tens of Millions for
 
01:13:35.189 --> 01:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
a child very quickly uh in some very
 
01:13:39.430 --> 01:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
rare situations but uh so I we do need
 
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
to get the exact numbers for you as far
 
01:13:44.149 --> 01:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
as the break thank you so much um and
 
01:13:47.229 --> 01:13:47.239 align:start position:0%
then the other part of it is
 
01:13:49.990 --> 01:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
um I I think it was mention that New
 
01:13:52.510 --> 01:13:52.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a higher percentage or a
 
01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
very high percentage of children in the
 
01:13:58.709 --> 01:13:58.719 align:start position:0%
program relative to other states I I I
 
01:14:02.310 --> 01:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
think that's probably due to um the
 
01:14:05.950 --> 01:14:05.960 align:start position:0%
eligibility guidelines that adults are
 
01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
at about 180
 
01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
185% of poverty level but we allow
 
01:14:15.709 --> 01:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
children up to in the 300s or something
 
01:14:18.189 --> 01:14:18.199 align:start position:0%
a much higher percentage of poverty
 
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
could you could you when you come back
 
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
just make sure uh we understand what
 
01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:28.520 align:start position:0%
that eligibility uh cut off is and and
 
01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
um and if there's any history around
 
01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
when it got extended or contracted u in
 
01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years or something that
 
01:14:39.790 --> 01:14:39.800 align:start position:0%
would be nice context absolutely we
 
01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
we're prepared to talk about the F
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
federal poverty limit with that is for
 
01:14:45.990 --> 01:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
adults which I think is around 138% and
 
01:14:47.709 --> 01:14:47.719 align:start position:0%
and then the children are much higher as
 
01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
you as you mentioned but we'll bring
 
01:14:52.910 --> 01:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
back those exact breakdowns and the
 
01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
history of it and then if you could also
 
01:14:57.790 --> 01:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
thank you could if you could also
 
01:15:00.110 --> 01:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
contextualize that against the other
 
01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
states I mean that's not the only bench
 
01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
mark but it would be just nice to know
 
01:15:07.629 --> 01:15:07.639 align:start position:0%
where where we
 
01:15:11.870 --> 01:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
rank so sure um are there uh
 
01:15:14.149 --> 01:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham yeah I just I
 
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
have a few questions in writing who
 
01:15:17.669 --> 01:15:17.679 align:start position:0%
should I give them to so you can
 
01:15:22.390 --> 01:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
integrate them in or um anybody or yes
 
01:15:24.430 --> 01:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
okay that's all we don't have to I don't
 
01:15:27.870 --> 01:15:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:30.229 --> 01:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
now I'm I'm not seeing any other
 
01:15:33.910 --> 01:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
questions so I I have one for U our new
 
01:15:36.189 --> 01:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
