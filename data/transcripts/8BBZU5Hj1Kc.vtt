to my motion
 
00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 align:start position:0%
um it seemed pretty clear that this is
 
00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 align:start position:0%
correcting an error that the Supreme
 
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 align:start position:0%
Court felt was there but they just
 
00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 align:start position:0%
happened to discover 30 years later
 
00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.850 align:start position:0%
happened to discover 30 years later
um

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 align:start position:0%
I really that's that's all I got but it
 
00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 align:start position:0%
seems like it's necessary
 
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 align:start position:0%
um at this point I do
 
00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 align:start position:0%
overall would say that I feel like there
 
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
are some issues with the whole the whole
 
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 align:start position:0%
system of someone being able to pull
 
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 align:start position:0%
over and possibly not drive because they
 
00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
realize they're intoxicated but that
 
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 align:start position:0%
goes to a different different Bill and a
 
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
whole set of statutes so in the meantime
 
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll um
 
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 align:start position:0%

yes Mr chairman so
 
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
I would like it to be known that I am
 
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
not I'm not making a motion to i.tl this
 
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:46.740 align:start position:0%
bill because I don't think it's
 
00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.050 align:start position:0%
bill because I don't think it's
necessary

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:48.060 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.309 align:start position:0%
necessary
that

00:07:49.309 --> 00:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:51.060 align:start position:0%
the there is a house version of this
 
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
bill that we worked very diligently on
 
00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:55.919 align:start position:0%
with a subcommittee
 
00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:58.380 align:start position:0%
and we had all the stakeholders in the
 
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:00.360 align:start position:0%
room and we actually went as far as to
 
00:08:02.689 --> 00:08:02.699 align:start position:0%
ask how each and every single thing we
 
00:08:04.909 --> 00:08:04.919 align:start position:0%
discussed would be implemented in the
 
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
jail or in the prison with that being
 
00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.110 align:start position:0%
jail or in the prison with that being
said

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:12.060 align:start position:0%
that particular version
 
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:14.340 align:start position:0%
seems to have a lot of support and the
 
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:15.780 align:start position:0%
consensus seems to be that that that
 
00:08:17.689 --> 00:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
bill has stronger language so yesterday
 
00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:19.259 align:start position:0%
while we were sitting here
 
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
I well over an hour looked at every
 
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
single difference on the two and it
 
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
seems to me that
 
00:08:29.029 --> 00:08:29.039 align:start position:0%
to make the changes
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
if we decided to make those changes
 
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
would be a matter of one sentence and
 
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:34.500 align:start position:0%
one word
 
00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
and I actually talked with the sponsor
 
00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:38.940 align:start position:0%
out of respect for all the work that she
 
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
put into that bill
 
00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
and when we we did not put a number this
 
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
is all important bear with me we didn't
 
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
actually put a number when we came to
 
00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:50.220 align:start position:0%
menstrual products because at the time
 
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
we were asked not to and we were told
 
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:52.980 align:start position:0%
that the word sufficient was actually
 
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
going to be better
 
00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:57.300 align:start position:0%
now it seems that it may be better if we
 
00:08:58.970 --> 00:08:58.980 align:start position:0%
do actually have a number in there which
 
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
we're willing to do that we also did not
 
00:09:03.889 --> 00:09:03.899 align:start position:0%
put about Youth Detention Center
 
00:09:03.899 --> 00:09:05.750 align:start position:0%
put about Youth Detention Center
specifically

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
because again at the time we were told
 
00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
that the Youth Detention Center is in a
 
00:09:11.449 --> 00:09:11.459 align:start position:0%
County and in the state so it would
 
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
still already fall under this new RSA
 
00:09:17.449 --> 00:09:17.459 align:start position:0%
however after talking with the sponsor
 
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
she doesn't necessarily have a problem
 
00:09:21.889 --> 00:09:21.899 align:start position:0%
with putting that language in
 
00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:23.220 align:start position:0%
um and that is something I told her I'd
 
00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
be really happy to sit with and work
 
00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
with her on that in the event that
 
00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:27.180 align:start position:0%
that's what we're going to decide to do
 
00:09:29.329 --> 00:09:29.339 align:start position:0%
so for all those reasons I actually
 
00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
think that the house version is done
 
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
I think it is something that we all did
 
00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
together and we're all very very proud
 
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
of it and I think that the Senate
 
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
version needs a lot more work that quite
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
frankly I don't think that we have to do
 
00:09:54.889 --> 00:09:54.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:55.740 align:start position:0%
um would you like to speak to your
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
second representative Stone thank you Mr
 
00:09:59.030 --> 00:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
chair I concur with representative
 
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.449 align:start position:0%
chair I concur with representative
Rhodes

00:10:02.449 --> 00:10:02.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:02.459 --> 00:10:06.730 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:06.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:09.240 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm going to just quickly
 
00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:12.300 align:start position:0%
address address the issue on this
 
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.490 align:start position:0%
address address the issue on this
um

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
we did a lot of of work on this as a
 
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.290 align:start position:0%
we did a lot of of work on this as a
subcommittee

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
um and I feel like
 
00:10:25.009 --> 00:10:25.019 align:start position:0%
our bill was really good we sent it over
 
00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:28.860 align:start position:0%
and passing an identical Bill makes
 
00:10:30.889 --> 00:10:30.899 align:start position:0%
absolutely no sense we have we need one
 
00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:33.620 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation to work with
 
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
and for some strange reason it happens
 
00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:38.940 align:start position:0%
sometimes that we in the house will
 
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
write a bill and somehow inspiration
 
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
strikes someone in the other body to
 
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:45.240 align:start position:0%
write the exact same bill I don't know
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
how that happens but
 
00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:47.810 align:start position:0%
how that happens but
um

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:47.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
one of them need not survive I don't see
 
00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:53.940 align:start position:0%
the sense in passing another one and
 
00:10:56.509 --> 00:10:56.519 align:start position:0%
frankly I think it just um
 
00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
it encourages the same thing to happen
 
00:11:02.449 --> 00:11:02.459 align:start position:0%
we only need one bill so I I would urge
 
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
everyone to earn to vote itl on this
 
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
bill and let's work on the bill that we
 
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
put all the time and effort into
 
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:11:17.389 --> 00:11:17.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:23.329 --> 00:11:23.339 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you in in situations like
 
00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:26.220 align:start position:0%
this I mean we we do have a choice
 
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:29.220 align:start position:0%
um we can itl a bill and get rid of it
 
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
which basically gets rid of the bill
 
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
um we also have the option uh to retain
 
00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:37.860 align:start position:0%
it because we never really have any idea
 
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
what the other body is going to do with
 
00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
the bill when we send it to them
 
00:11:43.009 --> 00:11:43.019 align:start position:0%
um they could turn around and do the
 
00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:44.100 align:start position:0%
same thing
 
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
and I think one of the things
 
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:49.860 align:start position:0%
um I thought that our work on on on on
 
00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
the house bill was you know maybe one of
 
00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
our best moments we really got to the
 
00:11:56.509 --> 00:11:56.519 align:start position:0%
heart of the issue and I think we sent a
 
00:11:58.250 --> 00:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
very good build of the floor and we sent
 
00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
a very good bill uh to the Senate but
 
00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.389 align:start position:0%
a very good bill uh to the Senate but
again

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
we we never quite know what the other
 
00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:07.620 align:start position:0%
body is going to do with a bill and uh
 
00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:09.839 align:start position:0%
by retaining it
 
00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
um if something
 
00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:14.940 align:start position:0%
untoward does happen to the bill we have
 
00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
an option to do something in the second
 
00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
year and and given
 
00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:22.980 align:start position:0%
the severity of of the problem and and I
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
I think we were all in a in a State of
 
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
Shock when we heard the testimony that
 
00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
things like that were actually going on
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
in our state or actually in our County
 
00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:41.700 align:start position:0%
prison system it seems like the state
 
00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:45.060 align:start position:0%
prison uh doesn't really have uh have
 
00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
this issue as much but
 
00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:50.220 align:start position:0%
I I think part of it is just from the
 
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
standpoint of
 
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
looking at um you know the risk of
 
00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
something like this not going through it
 
00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
might be a better option to retain it
 
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Rhodes
 
00:13:03.769 --> 00:13:03.779 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman in
 
00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:05.940 align:start position:0%
I do recognize everything that you're
 
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
that you're you're speaking to
 
00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
stop the earth I agree with you
 
00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:14.940 align:start position:0%
representative Muse
 
00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
and but I think that it's important to
 
00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
understand that after yesterday's
 
00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
hearing and during the hearing
 
00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:24.540 align:start position:0%
it it was made evidently clear
 
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
to a lot of Representatives in this room
 
00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:31.260 align:start position:0%
that the intention was for us to make
 
00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
the Senate version what the house
 
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
version was
 
00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:38.100 align:start position:0%
and respectfully
 
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
we already did this work once it and it
 
00:13:42.829 --> 00:13:42.839 align:start position:0%
really is a really good piece of
 
00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
legislation that I quite frankly never
 
00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:46.740 align:start position:0%
would have thought of I'm glad that it
 
00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
came to us and we did the work
 
00:13:53.389 --> 00:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
that bill is going to the house
 
00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:55.620 align:start position:0%
with crazy support I've never saw
 
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
anything like it to be honest with you
 
00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.610 align:start position:0%
anything like it to be honest with you
and

00:13:58.610 --> 00:13:58.620 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
I don't feel that it's our
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
responsibilities committee to take it
 
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
upon ourselves to make another bill
 
00:14:08.449 --> 00:14:08.459 align:start position:0%
identical that that was not what our job
 
00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:11.100 align:start position:0%
was we did what our job is and we did it
 
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.410 align:start position:0%
was we did what our job is and we did it
well

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:12.420 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:14.690 align:start position:0%
well
yeah

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:14.700 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
okay I don't think anyone's going to uh
 
00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:20.940 align:start position:0%
be swayed on this um so who who's left
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
up representative say like go ahead
 
00:14:25.129 --> 00:14:25.139 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I I just want to say
 
00:14:26.569 --> 00:14:26.579 align:start position:0%
the one
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
the one difference between the two is I
 
00:14:31.009 --> 00:14:31.019 align:start position:0%
believe the Senate version has the FN
 
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
and the version that we sent through I
 
00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:35.820 align:start position:0%
think did not so in terms of supporting
 
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
retaining it my concern is if the Senate
 
00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
should come back and say that there
 
00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:41.100 align:start position:0%
should have been a fiscal note
 
00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
and block it for that reason if we've
 
00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:45.540 align:start position:0%
retained this version we can still it
 
00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:47.220 align:start position:0%
didn't or did they
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
there's not oh I'm sorry I thought there
 
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
was I apologize I withdraw my comments
 
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
no there's uh there's no fiscal mode
 
00:14:54.829 --> 00:14:54.839 align:start position:0%
otherwise it would have been a
 
00:14:58.490 --> 00:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
constitutional violation that's okay
 
00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:02.100 align:start position:0%
um yeah it's I I just um I I hate
 
00:15:04.189 --> 00:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
politics Canadian in the way of politics
 
00:15:07.009 --> 00:15:07.019 align:start position:0%
so uh I'm going to uh ask the clerk to
 
00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
call the rule
 
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
uh who was left if somebody left oh I'm
 
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:12.300 align:start position:0%
sorry I missed uh representative Hill
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um it would seem
 
00:15:17.389 --> 00:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
to me if the house has already made its
 
00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
position known and it wasn't itl'd it
 
00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:23.100 align:start position:0%
was passed then there would be no reason
 
00:15:26.569 --> 00:15:26.579 align:start position:0%
for a if if something untoward happened
 
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
in the Senate there would be no reason
 
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
why the same bill couldn't be filed next
 
00:15:35.389 --> 00:15:35.399 align:start position:0%
year we have a house position so it's
 
00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:38.060 align:start position:0%
only the Senate that uh
 
00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:41.220 align:start position:0%
the house would if the Senate killed our
 
00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:42.350 align:start position:0%
the house would if the Senate killed our
bill

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:15:44.449 --> 00:15:44.459 align:start position:0%
um there would be still no reason why we
 
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
couldn't submit it again for next year
 
00:15:48.769 --> 00:15:48.779 align:start position:0%
so there's nothing to be gained by the
 
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839 align:start position:0%
retain that I can see yeah that's
 
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
correct if if it passes our body we
 
00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:55.740 align:start position:0%
could bring it up again uh just as
 
00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:57.180 align:start position:0%
quickly as we could the retained Bill
 
00:16:00.769 --> 00:16:00.779 align:start position:0%
and frankly there would be no reason for
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
the Senate to kill it if they already
 
00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:05.940 align:start position:0%
passed it or something a little actually
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
not as good as ours so yes
 
00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
representative Bolden
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
I just want to mention that um in my
 
00:16:15.769 --> 00:16:15.779 align:start position:0%
first term I filed a bill that was
 
00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
similar an intent but not wording as a
 
00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:20.220 align:start position:0%
bill filed by a senator
 
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
the chair of the committee in the Senate
 
00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:24.060 align:start position:0%
that my bill went to after passed the
 
00:16:26.689 --> 00:16:26.699 align:start position:0%
house had beef with the senator who'd
 
00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:28.620 align:start position:0%
filed a similar bill
 
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
so they amended my bill to have the
 
00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:33.180 align:start position:0%
Senate wording
 
00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:34.860 align:start position:0%
and then when the Senate bill came and
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
they killed it so you never know the
 
00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.230 align:start position:0%
they killed it so you never know the
Dynamics

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
Dynamics
 
00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
it here or in the senate or what
 
00:16:44.569 --> 00:16:44.579 align:start position:0%
someone's reasoning might be it was a
 
00:16:47.329 --> 00:16:47.339 align:start position:0%
great win for me but I'm sure that the
 
00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
senator got the shaft was pretty
 
00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.650 align:start position:0%
senator got the shaft was pretty
disappointed

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:51.660 align:start position:0%
disappointed
 
00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:54.180 align:start position:0%
um but I think that there's no harm in
 
00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:55.670 align:start position:0%
um but I think that there's no harm in
retaining

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
retaining
 
00:16:57.610 --> 00:16:57.620 align:start position:0%
um because you can always kill something
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
the the harm in retaining is that that
 
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
we already have I think six or seven
 
00:17:04.429 --> 00:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
bills retained that I'd have to assign
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittees to and we have to come up
 
00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:09.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:11.579 align:start position:0%
we've already there's no work left to do
 
00:17:14.449 --> 00:17:14.459 align:start position:0%
on it so the retain would only be a
 
00:17:18.289 --> 00:17:18.299 align:start position:0%
political move and um uh frankly I just
 
00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
like again I don't see the logic behind
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
it we passed it we did the work
 
00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:25.140 align:start position:0%
um and it was made abundantly clear
 
00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:26.579 align:start position:0%
because I agree with you you don't know
 
00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:28.799 align:start position:0%
what could happen or but on this one we
 
00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:31.140 align:start position:0%
do because we were told that the intent
 
00:17:33.409 --> 00:17:33.419 align:start position:0%
was to make the Senate Bill the one and
 
00:17:33.419 --> 00:17:34.490 align:start position:0%
was to make the Senate Bill the one and
frankly

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:34.500 align:start position:0%
frankly
 
00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:36.780 align:start position:0%
um our bills are fired filed much
 
00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
earlier than theirs
 
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
and our bills are not a grocery store
 
00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:43.620 align:start position:0%
just can't go shopping for which one you
 
00:17:46.909 --> 00:17:46.919 align:start position:0%
like and copy it so
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:54.740 align:start position:0%

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
representative Newman no the clerk votes
 
00:18:27.289 --> 00:18:27.299 align:start position:0%
now representative Newell no
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
representative selig
 
00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
no representative wheeler
 
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
reluctantly I vote no
 
00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
uh chairman Roy
 
00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:41.220 align:start position:0%
Cheryl's yes motion is 10 10.
 
00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
may I ask a question of the chair you
 
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:44.270 align:start position:0%
may I ask a question of the chair you
may

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
may
 
00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.070 align:start position:0%
may
so

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:47.340 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if this is a
 
00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:49.620 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry or what but so
 
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
this is going to go to the floor no
 
00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
recommendation if it ends up dying what
 
00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:55.430 align:start position:0%
recommendation if it ends up dying what
happens

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
happens
 
00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:57.660 align:start position:0%
yeah then at that point but what I mean
 
00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:58.370 align:start position:0%
yeah then at that point but what I mean
is

00:18:58.370 --> 00:18:58.380 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:01.140 align:start position:0%
um representative Hill's point that the
 
00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
house position is now and it would not
 
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
be able to be brought back
 
00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
so and well that's what I mean anything
 
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
on that subject matter because the house
 
00:19:12.049 --> 00:19:12.059 align:start position:0%
position and maybe representative Hill
 
00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:13.980 align:start position:0%
knows I know he's really experienced but
 
00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
like is that rule about subject matter
 
00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
not specific legislative wording I see
 
00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:21.780 align:start position:0%
what you're saying uh to be honest with
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
you I'm not sure I would suspect since
 
00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
it's similar
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
um then it would not be representative
 
00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:28.140 align:start position:0%
jambon did you have something after that
 
00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:31.020 align:start position:0%
yeah my favorite one is indefinitely
 
00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:32.580 align:start position:0%
postpone that means the subject matter
 
00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:34.140 align:start position:0%
can't come up again
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:42.169 --> 00:19:42.179 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler Mr chairman I
 
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
wonder if it would be appropriate I I
 
00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
given representative bolden's comments
 
00:19:48.409 --> 00:19:48.419 align:start position:0%
and representatives hell's comments I
 
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
would like to reconsider my vote and I
 
00:19:51.049 --> 00:19:51.059 align:start position:0%
wonder if it would be appropriate to
 
00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:52.919 align:start position:0%
move reconsideration so we may change
 
00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
our vote on on that is there a second
 
00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.409 align:start position:0%
our vote on on that is there a second
second

00:19:57.409 --> 00:19:57.419 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
what second somebody
 
00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:03.780 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I have a question again is the
 
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
intent to that's what I'm concerned
 
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
about I don't know if I was clear before
 
00:20:09.529 --> 00:20:09.539 align:start position:0%
but if if the decision on the house
 
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
floor is itl on this will that
 
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
invalidate the previous ought to pass
 
00:20:15.289 --> 00:20:15.299 align:start position:0%
that passed the house because of the
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
similar subject matter and then do we no
 
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
longer have a solid house position
 
00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:19.620 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm just trying to
 
00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:21.780 align:start position:0%
understand I've never encountered it I'm
 
00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:24.660 align:start position:0%
representative Hill what do you think I
 
00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:25.860 align:start position:0%
don't believe so
 
00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:29.100 align:start position:0%
um I think what would happen is um it's
 
00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
it was the house bill that has the has
 
00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:35.100 align:start position:0%
the ought to pass on it and I believe
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
without putting words in the speaker's
 
00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
mouth but generally what happens is the
 
00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:40.330 align:start position:0%
mouth but generally what happens is the
speaker

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:40.340 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
00:20:43.789 --> 00:20:43.799 align:start position:0%
reviews the house bill and and it would
 
00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
be the speaker to determine whether
 
00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:49.140 align:start position:0%
there is a is a conflict in this but
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
um within the room having not seen all
 
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
I'm saying is if the bill is
 
00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
substantially the same and we did pass
 
00:20:58.850 --> 00:20:58.860 align:start position:0%
the house bill that would be the bill
 
00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:01.140 align:start position:0%
that he would determine that it can come
 
00:21:04.669 --> 00:21:04.679 align:start position:0%
back because the language is is passed
 
00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
at the house level so that would be my
 
00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:13.909 align:start position:0%
 
me

00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so let let me make
 
00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:18.559 align:start position:0%
something very very clear
 
00:21:21.409 --> 00:21:21.419 align:start position:0%
the the changes
 
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
that were requested
 
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
that we make to the to the version we
 
00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:27.900 align:start position:0%
currently have
 
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
been started
 
00:21:31.789 --> 00:21:31.799 align:start position:0%
and when the sponsor who is sitting in
 
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
this room goes to present the bill to
 
00:21:37.549 --> 00:21:37.559 align:start position:0%
the other body
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
that Amendment will be in hand and
 
00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:42.900 align:start position:0%
already sent to them
 
00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
I I certainly cannot predict what
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
they're going to do but based on what we
 
00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
heard yesterday
 
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
that there they're already everything
 
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
that they want is already in there
 
00:21:59.870 --> 00:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
and the couple of things that we were
 
00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:01.980 align:start position:0%
told don't have to be in there we're
 
00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
still going to put in there but with one
 
00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
sentence and one change of a word
 
00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
instead of having to do all of the
 
00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
things that they requested so I I would
 
00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:13.860 align:start position:0%
find it very unlikely that they're not
 
00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
going to pass it okay um representative
 
00:22:18.529 --> 00:22:18.539 align:start position:0%
wheeler go ahead I just want to add for
 
00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:19.980 align:start position:0%
the members of this committee that the
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the house legislation wants
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
us to kill the Senate bill for the
 
00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
reasons outlined yeah uh representative
 
00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:29.810 align:start position:0%
reasons outlined yeah uh representative
um

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:29.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:31.740 align:start position:0%
Harry gathroyd has asked for a short
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:35.519 --> 00:33:40.190 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:44.509 --> 00:33:44.519 align:start position:0%
Senate bill number 209
 
00:33:48.049 --> 00:33:48.059 align:start position:0%
is currently been voted on and the
 
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
result is no recommendation and that's
 
00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:53.640 align:start position:0%
how it's going to stay and we are moving
 
00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.409 align:start position:0%
how it's going to stay and we are moving
on

00:33:56.409 --> 00:33:56.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:59.389 --> 00:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
uh yeah representative I withdraw my
 
00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:03.889 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:34:03.889 --> 00:34:03.899 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:06.049 --> 00:34:06.059 align:start position:0%
yeah she does
 
00:34:09.250 --> 00:34:09.260 align:start position:0%
okay so moving right along
 
00:34:12.829 --> 00:34:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:16.369 --> 00:34:16.379 align:start position:0%
um we're still going to have to file
 
00:34:16.379 --> 00:34:17.510 align:start position:0%
um we're still going to have to file
um

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:19.919 align:start position:0%
reports of the committee for both sides
 
00:34:22.609 --> 00:34:22.619 align:start position:0%
so one is for ITIL what's the other one
 
00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
going to be for one will be out to pass
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
whatever they want you can't make a
 
00:34:34.369 --> 00:34:34.379 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll deal with that um when it
 
00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
comes to time right now it's going to be
 
00:34:42.589 --> 00:34:42.599 align:start position:0%
a there'll be two reports
 
00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
um our side will be itl and the other
 
00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:47.820 align:start position:0%
side has to be a positive motion so it's
 
00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:49.980 align:start position:0%
going to be either off the pass you
 
00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
can't make a motion of retain because it
 
00:34:53.089 --> 00:34:53.099 align:start position:0%
can only be retained in the committee or
 
00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:55.980 align:start position:0%
table that would be it
 
00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:57.290 align:start position:0%
table that would be it
okay

00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:57.300 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:58.730 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:34:58.730 --> 00:34:58.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
all right at this point I'm going to
 
00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:17.640 align:start position:0%
open the executive session again on
 
00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:21.540 align:start position:0%
SB 245 and I'm going to recognize myself
 
00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:25.020 align:start position:0%
to make a motion of
 
00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:26.940 align:start position:0%
ought to pass I'll explain it in a
 
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
second if I can have a second
 
00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:32.940 align:start position:0%
second thank you I'll speak to my motion
 
00:35:34.609 --> 00:35:34.619 align:start position:0%
um we had some discussion about whether
 
00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
or not this was necessary at all in
 
00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:40.980 align:start position:0%
light of the recent Amendment we passed
 
00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:42.660 align:start position:0%
to the Constitution regarding privacy
 
00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:45.900 align:start position:0%
the whole concept of um an entire hotel
 
00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
list guests being available to law
 
00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:51.599 align:start position:0%
enforcement to just look at for any
 
00:35:51.599 --> 00:35:52.670 align:start position:0%
enforcement to just look at for any
reason

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
for no reason
 
00:35:55.970 --> 00:35:55.980 align:start position:0%
um we found a little bit
 
00:35:58.609 --> 00:35:58.619 align:start position:0%
troubling having said that
 
00:35:58.619 --> 00:35:59.270 align:start position:0%
troubling having said that
um

00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
I think that that's something that we
 
00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:02.940 align:start position:0%
can take up or I will take up in the
 
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
fall after I've had a chance to confer
 
00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
with law enforcement and everybody
 
00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:09.660 align:start position:0%
involved rather than just
 
00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:11.700 align:start position:0%
do something else now so I'm going to uh
 
00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:13.380 align:start position:0%
we're just gonna go ahead and pass it as
 
00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:15.900 align:start position:0%
it is if we agree
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman in the underlying bill
 
00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
as it is
 
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
um is simply to just allow them to use
 
00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
Electronics versus having to maintain a
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
paper book
 
00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:28.260 align:start position:0%
um would you like to speak to your
 
00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:30.109 align:start position:0%
um would you like to speak to your
second

00:36:30.109 --> 00:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:31.500 align:start position:0%
you said it very well Mr chairman
 
00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:34.140 align:start position:0%
representative I have an amendment
 
00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:36.780 align:start position:0%
sitting up in community services for
 
00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:39.420 align:start position:0%
this bill what does that Amendment do
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
changes uh
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
it removes the also known as
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
because it requires that the the legal
 
00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
name be present on that list and it
 
00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:51.300 align:start position:0%
opens it for a couple other law
 
00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
in light of um what I said I think that
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
we really need to revisit the entire
 
00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
subject and I'd rather not just I'd
 
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
rather just pass it
 
00:37:13.609 --> 00:37:13.619 align:start position:0%
um and deal with it in a separate bill
 
00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
because I think that we need to really
 
00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:17.820 align:start position:0%
examine whether or not it should be
 
00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:19.140 align:start position:0%
there at all
 
00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:21.660 align:start position:0%
um so I mean
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
given that we're running out of bills
 
00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
that we don't have amendments for I'd
 
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
rather just move along if that's okay
 
00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
with you
 
00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:31.380 align:start position:0%
yes representative I'm sorry thank you
 
00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:33.540 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I just it where
 
00:37:34.849 --> 00:37:34.859 align:start position:0%
it says each guest shall sign their
 
00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say um but I think
 
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
um guests meaning the the guests that
 
00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
actually are the ones
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
signing for the room not the guests of
 
00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:53.569 --> 00:37:53.579 align:start position:0%
concerned because the language does
 
00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:56.820 align:start position:0%
specify each guest so it it just leaves
 
00:37:58.609 --> 00:37:58.619 align:start position:0%
I think the current statute actually
 
00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:00.660 align:start position:0%
says that does it not
 
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
do you have the bill
 
00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
anybody I believe that is the current
 
00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:06.660 align:start position:0%
language yeah the intent is is the
 
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:12.780 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't think that the amen this
 
00:38:14.329 --> 00:38:14.339 align:start position:0%
amendment changes I think it it's
 
00:38:15.829 --> 00:38:15.839 align:start position:0%
already in the law this just says how
 
00:38:17.089 --> 00:38:17.099 align:start position:0%
they have to do it representative um
 
00:38:20.329 --> 00:38:20.339 align:start position:0%
Bolden I'm sorry I thought that the um
 
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
assistant for the senator wanted us to
 
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
pass an amendment that took out the word
 
00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:28.609 align:start position:0%
pass an amendment that took out the word
sign

00:38:28.609 --> 00:38:28.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
but I don't think any of us have drafted
 
00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:33.540 align:start position:0%
it they needed one of us to author it
 
00:38:35.569 --> 00:38:35.579 align:start position:0%
with OLS but they had already
 
00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:37.740 align:start position:0%
written up written it up under the
 
00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:49.740 align:start position:0%

keep up with us on these amendments
 
00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:03.290 align:start position:0%

actually a proposed verbiage for an
 
00:52:13.069 --> 00:52:13.079 align:start position:0%

00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:19.020 align:start position:0%

00:52:21.890 --> 00:52:21.900 align:start position:0%

amended any objection consent see none
 
00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:20.990 --> 00:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
and this point I'm going to open
 
00:55:24.170 --> 00:55:24.180 align:start position:0%
executive session on House Bill 251 and
 
00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:26.940 align:start position:0%
recognize myself to make a motion I move
 
00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:30.540 align:start position:0%
in expedient to legislate on SB 251 can
 
00:55:34.609 --> 00:55:34.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:37.970 --> 00:55:37.980 align:start position:0%
thank you I'll speak to the motion
 
00:55:39.890 --> 00:55:39.900 align:start position:0%
this um
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
this is an important subject and
 
00:55:46.490 --> 00:55:46.500 align:start position:0%
as I said yesterday
 
00:55:49.370 --> 00:55:49.380 align:start position:0%
um we we have
 
00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:51.900 align:start position:0%
this would give us literally just like
 
00:55:54.109 --> 00:55:54.119 align:start position:0%
two months and I don't think this this
 
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
this subject matter is is more important
 
00:56:00.049 --> 00:56:00.059 align:start position:0%
than and deserves more than two months
 
00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
um we'd barely get any any facts and
 
00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
data together by then let alone try to
 
00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
figure out uh something to do this
 
00:56:08.210 --> 00:56:08.220 align:start position:0%
should have been a commission I offered
 
00:56:10.010 --> 00:56:10.020 align:start position:0%
to make it a commission
 
00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
um that wasn't well received this
 
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.069 align:start position:0%
um that wasn't well received this
committee

00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:56:14.930 --> 00:56:14.940 align:start position:0%
um I don't know about anyone in here I'm
 
00:56:17.089 --> 00:56:17.099 align:start position:0%
speaking for myself we've already get a
 
00:56:19.370 --> 00:56:19.380 align:start position:0%
busy summer with um retained bills that
 
00:56:20.990 --> 00:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
we have to come out with new with
 
00:56:23.569 --> 00:56:23.579 align:start position:0%
legislation for October
 
00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
and this would give us until about the
 
00:56:27.410 --> 00:56:27.420 align:start position:0%
same time to study this is you can come
 
00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
up with a good report and recommendation
 
00:56:30.770 --> 00:56:30.780 align:start position:0%
for legislation
 
00:56:34.370 --> 00:56:34.380 align:start position:0%
um I think that if it's if it's worthy
 
00:56:36.530 --> 00:56:36.540 align:start position:0%
of study it can be studied Anytime by
 
00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
anyone interested in making a bill or it
 
00:56:42.049 --> 00:56:42.059 align:start position:0%
could be a commission but frankly to
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
just pass it for the sake of passionate
 
00:56:45.290 --> 00:56:45.300 align:start position:0%
and not do it the service it's due
 
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
there's people that are suffering as we
 
00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:49.609 align:start position:0%
there's people that are suffering as we
heard

00:56:49.609 --> 00:56:49.619 align:start position:0%
heard
 
00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
we heard the member from the ACLU Mr
 
00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
lecase tell us that's an important and
 
00:57:00.109 --> 00:57:00.119 align:start position:0%
in-depth and complicated issue his case
 
00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:03.720 align:start position:0%
alone sounds very complicated so um I
 
00:57:05.569 --> 00:57:05.579 align:start position:0%
just I I think we would be paying lip
 
00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
service to it in Little Else by doing
 
00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:09.290 align:start position:0%
service to it in Little Else by doing
that

00:57:09.290 --> 00:57:09.300 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:10.970 --> 00:57:10.980 align:start position:0%
um so would you like to speak to your
 
00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:12.829 align:start position:0%
um so would you like to speak to your
second

00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:12.839 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:57:18.670 --> 00:57:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:24.410 --> 00:57:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
I'm going to oppose the itl motion
 
00:57:27.599 --> 00:57:29.450 align:start position:0%
I'm going to oppose the itl motion
um

00:57:29.450 --> 00:57:29.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:31.549 --> 00:57:31.559 align:start position:0%
we've had numerous bills over the years
 
00:57:33.589 --> 00:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
that have come to us
 
00:57:36.049 --> 00:57:36.059 align:start position:0%
um either at the behest of the parole
 
00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
board or because of the parole board and
 
00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:43.140 align:start position:0%
things that aren't firing on all
 
00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
cylinders over there
 
00:57:47.329 --> 00:57:47.339 align:start position:0%
back in 2019 the legislative budget
 
00:57:49.130 --> 00:57:49.140 align:start position:0%
assistant actually did a pretty
 
00:57:51.530 --> 00:57:51.540 align:start position:0%
comprehensive Report with a lot of
 
00:57:53.569 --> 00:57:53.579 align:start position:0%
recommendations some of which were acted
 
00:57:56.650 --> 00:57:56.660 align:start position:0%
on but the vast majority of them weren't
 
00:57:59.930 --> 00:57:59.940 align:start position:0%
just because the report came to us at a
 
00:58:01.849 --> 00:58:01.859 align:start position:0%
time when I think we also had just had
 
00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
about 60 bills dumped in our lap so I
 
00:58:09.530 --> 00:58:09.540 align:start position:0%
think representative Roy makes a a
 
00:58:12.290 --> 00:58:12.300 align:start position:0%
really good point when he says we have
 
00:58:13.849 --> 00:58:13.859 align:start position:0%
limited bandwidth and I think that's
 
00:58:17.089 --> 00:58:17.099 align:start position:0%
something we always need to keep in mind
 
00:58:21.170 --> 00:58:21.180 align:start position:0%
um but my impression after after serving
 
00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
on this committee for three terms is
 
00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
that the parole board is is undermanned
 
00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:28.190 align:start position:0%
that the parole board is is undermanned
underfunded

00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:28.200 align:start position:0%
underfunded
 
00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
um behind from a technological
 
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
standpoint and but one of the things
 
00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
that was new to me yesterday
 
00:58:38.690 --> 00:58:38.700 align:start position:0%
um is the fact that
 
00:58:41.930 --> 00:58:41.940 align:start position:0%
um 60 percent of the people in our state
 
00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
prison are there uh in part because of
 
00:58:47.809 --> 00:58:47.819 align:start position:0%
parole violations
 
00:58:51.950 --> 00:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
so in in a state where you know our the
 
00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
main objective of our uh of our prison
 
00:58:58.670 --> 00:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
system is Rehabilitation and punishment
 
00:59:01.490 --> 00:59:01.500 align:start position:0%
is also something we do
 
00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:02.569 align:start position:0%
is also something we do
um

00:59:02.569 --> 00:59:02.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
It just strikes me that there are there
 
00:59:08.210 --> 00:59:08.220 align:start position:0%
are better ways uh and and I think one
 
00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:09.839 align:start position:0%
of the things we've been doing is we've
 
00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
been kind of dealing with some of the
 
00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
deficiencies and issues with the parole
 
00:59:18.650 --> 00:59:18.660 align:start position:0%
system via a bunch of individual bills
 
00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:19.849 align:start position:0%
system via a bunch of individual bills
um

00:59:19.849 --> 00:59:19.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:25.010 --> 00:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
and and I think we can either keep
 
00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:27.720 align:start position:0%
attacking it incrementally and maybe
 
00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:29.460 align:start position:0%
some of those bills are on Target and
 
00:59:31.549 --> 00:59:31.559 align:start position:0%
others are not
 
00:59:33.650 --> 00:59:33.660 align:start position:0%
um but one of the one of the things that
 
00:59:35.870 --> 00:59:35.880 align:start position:0%
actually putting together a group to
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
actually study an issue does is it gives
 
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
you a certain base of knowledge uh and
 
00:59:42.170 --> 00:59:42.180 align:start position:0%
it and if there are changes that are
 
00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
necessary or changes that really become
 
00:59:47.569 --> 00:59:47.579 align:start position:0%
a parent that need to be made then you
 
00:59:50.809 --> 00:59:50.819 align:start position:0%
have a group of built-in co-sponsors
 
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
um and and hopefully smarter legislation
 
00:59:55.970 --> 00:59:55.980 align:start position:0%
so that I mean the reason why we do
 
00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
study committees isn't to annoy each
 
00:59:59.510 --> 00:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
other and and to take away from our
 
01:00:02.030 --> 01:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
beach time in the summer it's because we
 
01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
have important issues like this that we
 
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
can lend our expertise to and and
 
01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:08.940 align:start position:0%
hopefully move forward so
 
01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
um I I would hope that we could uh we
 
01:00:13.490 --> 01:00:13.500 align:start position:0%
could uh
 
01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:15.540 align:start position:0%
reverse the vote thank you
 
01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
and I I thank you for volunteering to
 
01:00:19.609 --> 01:00:19.619 align:start position:0%
chair that committee should that come to
 
01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:30.540 align:start position:0%
um I thank you chair uh I agree with uh
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative Muse and everything he
 
01:00:34.010 --> 01:00:34.020 align:start position:0%
said I think you know at this point we
 
01:00:37.609 --> 01:00:37.619 align:start position:0%
are being asked to act and um it is an
 
01:00:39.650 --> 01:00:39.660 align:start position:0%
urgent matter and so whatever I'll be
 
01:00:42.770 --> 01:00:42.780 align:start position:0%
voting in in against the itl in favor of
 
01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:49.309 --> 01:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
or this guy's representative uh wheeler
 
01:00:51.049 --> 01:00:51.059 align:start position:0%
I just want to say Mr chairman if this
 
01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
comes out 10 10 I'd really appreciate
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:01.549 --> 01:01:01.559 align:start position:0%
um representative Murphy thank you Mr
 
01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:04.260 align:start position:0%
chair I just wonder if the timing is is
 
01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:06.660 align:start position:0%
the is the issue if maybe the effective
 
01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:09.720 align:start position:0%
date could be changed to allow for some
 
01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:12.420 align:start position:0%
more time given that we're at the end of
 
01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:38.809 --> 01:01:38.819 align:start position:0%
okay based on the overwhelming urge of
 
01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
the members to volunteer for this
 
01:01:41.569 --> 01:01:41.579 align:start position:0%
committee I'm going to withdraw my
 
01:01:45.289 --> 01:01:45.299 align:start position:0%
motion of itl would you withdraw your
 
01:01:49.609 --> 01:01:49.619 align:start position:0%
motion of oh yes okay and I recognize
 
01:01:52.970 --> 01:01:52.980 align:start position:0%
representative Muse to make a new motion
 
01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:59.690 --> 01:01:59.700 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Murray
 
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
or did you pretty much cover it
 
01:02:05.569 --> 01:02:05.579 align:start position:0%
I think I covered it and yeah and you
 
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:06.900 align:start position:0%
can't get out of the whole chair thing
 
01:02:09.549 --> 01:02:09.559 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your flexibility
