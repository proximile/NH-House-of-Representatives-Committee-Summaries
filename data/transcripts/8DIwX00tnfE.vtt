have it for exec
 
00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
again this all this does is strike out
 
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
the portion that says that alimony will
 
00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
terminate upon a certain thing happening
 
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
that is only necessary if the previous
 
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.150 align:start position:0%
that is only necessary if the previous
bill

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.990 align:start position:0%
bill
passes

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
passes
 
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
and i'll take any questions
 
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 align:start position:0%
representative ukela
 
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.909 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
some reason why this bill could not just
 
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
be an amendment to the other bill
 
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
um you'd have to ask ols i i asked them
 
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
and they said this is how it had to be
 
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 align:start position:0%
so okay i think if it could be i'd be
 
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
awesome but
 
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 align:start position:0%
thank you representative belangia
 
00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 align:start position:0%

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 align:start position:0%

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
representative may i follow please i
 
00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
think that was the day that you came in
 
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
a little bit later okay yeah so yes
 
00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
follow me
 
00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm just trying to piece this
 
00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479 align:start position:0%
together so unfortunately i wasn't here
 
00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 align:start position:0%
to to hear the bill but um i'll go back
 
00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
and and watch that but
 
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:35.830 align:start position:0%
and and watch that but
basically

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
and i know you said you're working on
 
00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
the amendment but
 
00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:39.759 align:start position:0%
where i'm getting my brain wrapped
 
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
around this
 
00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
is this essentially saying that upon
 
00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:44.469 align:start position:0%
is this essentially saying that upon
remarriage

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:44.479 align:start position:0%
remarriage
 
00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:45.919 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
previously paying party who was paying
 
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.589 align:start position:0%
previously paying party who was paying
alimony

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
alimony
 
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
um is no longer required to pay alimony
 
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
yeah you're gonna make me explain the
 
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
whole last pill so i'll go ahead and do
 
00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
it real quick thank you
 
00:07:00.309 --> 00:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
1278 what it does is it says this
 
00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:04.070 align:start position:0%
1278 what it does is it says this
if

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:06.639 align:start position:0%
one party um we'll make it uh we'll make
 
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
it a female today there was a man last
 
00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
time so i want to be fair a female
 
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
making a lot of money
 
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
a stay-at-home dad
 
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
he's got a disability
 
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
they're in their 50s
 
00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
she meets somebody else says you know
 
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
what i've had enough i want a divorce
 
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
she has no means of income other than
 
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
alimony that's awarded to her by the
 
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.589 align:start position:0%
alimony that's awarded to her by the
court

00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
he remarries
 
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
has a new friend oh she remarries
 
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
remember i switched him now um
 
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
and uh has a new family well the the
 
00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
other party
 
00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
can't remarry
 
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
because they do they lose their alimony
 
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
so if they meet someone who alimony it's
 
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
predicated upon the idea that someone
 
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
being remarried automatically would make
 
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
them unqualified for alimony because
 
00:07:57.749 --> 00:07:57.759 align:start position:0%
their standard of living automatically
 
00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:00.639 align:start position:0%
changes by mere fact that they remarried
 
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
so what i'm trying to do with the bill
 
00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:03.759 align:start position:0%
and this is what came to me from a
 
00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:05.110 align:start position:0%
and this is what came to me from a
constituent

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
constituent
 
00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:06.639 align:start position:0%
so it's a real world
 
00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:07.749 align:start position:0%
so it's a real world
thing

00:08:07.749 --> 00:08:07.759 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
is that if someone
 
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
remarries the court has to at least look
 
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
into the fact that whether or not that
 
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
new marriage
 
00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:18.160 align:start position:0%
elevates the standard of living that was
 
00:08:20.469 --> 00:08:20.479 align:start position:0%
contemplated by the court in the in the
 
00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
order for alimony
 
00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:24.639 align:start position:0%
so the court says okay
 
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
you guys getting divorced you get this
 
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:28.160 align:start position:0%
much alimony that should give you both
 
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
enough to live and maintain as close to
 
00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
a standard of living as you had when you
 
00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
were married
 
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
the other party remarries and she
 
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
remember he remarry somebody who doesn't
 
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
have any more money and he does that
 
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily elevate that so that
 
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
the alimony should go away so all it
 
00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
does is
 
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
all i'm trying to do is make that
 
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
automatic thing that if you remarry you
 
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
lose your alimony or if you uh
 
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
cohabitate you lose your alimony i want
 
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
the court to have to dig a little deeper
 
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it actually
 
00:08:58.949 --> 00:08:58.959 align:start position:0%
affects the the standard of living
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
before it's an automatic cut off so that
 
00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
one person
 
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
isn't trapped being for lack of a better
 
00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
term lonely the rest of their life while
 
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
the other person is free to move on and
 
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
have family and children
 
00:09:11.829 --> 00:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
and the other person can't because they
 
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
would be financially destitute
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
did i recap that the way i did last time
 
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
okay you're welcome
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%

in such a way that it doesn't really
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
change it it just requires a deeper dive
