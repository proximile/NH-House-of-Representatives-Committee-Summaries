incorporate this provision uh and this
 
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
is necessary so Medicaid can be build is
 
00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
essentially it okay committee have any
 
00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 align:start position:0%

what does a doula do that needs training
 
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:04.990 align:start position:0%
what does a doula do that needs training
and

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
certification so I don't have my
 
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 align:start position:0%
licensing person with me uh but my
 
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 align:start position:0%
understanding is a dla is somebody who's
 
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
specifically trained in um providing
 
00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
well so Carol me Carol talked to me
 
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 align:start position:0%
about this because I think this came
 
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
from her committee and she said said
 
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 align:start position:0%
that often um young
 
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 align:start position:0%
mothers sometimes don't have their
 
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 align:start position:0%
mother around or don't have some uh
 
00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 align:start position:0%
experienced woman around to help them uh
 
00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 align:start position:0%
learn how to breastfeed correctly I
 
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
guess and that's what the purpose of
 
00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 align:start position:0%
these people are correct yes it's more
 
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 align:start position:0%

it's in the
 
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.080 align:start position:0%
calar I I'll just mention something
 
00:07:53.149 --> 00:07:53.159 align:start position:0%
about this bill that that sort of bugged
 
00:07:55.869 --> 00:07:55.879 align:start position:0%
me okay since we're sort of on this bill
 
00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
um where is it
 
00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:04.230 align:start position:0%
here maybe it wasn't this
 
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:07.950 align:start position:0%
here maybe it wasn't this
[Music]

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:07.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
one yes so it's line um
 
00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
11 the office shall make every effort to
 
00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
include racially and geographically
 
00:08:21.469 --> 00:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
so this to me reads like it's
 
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.189 align:start position:0%
so this to me reads like it's
unconstitutional

00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:30.680 align:start position:0%
right the one we we're talking about
 
00:08:33.709 --> 00:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
337 duelist yeah the one we already
 
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
decided to pass but this is just the
 
00:08:40.509 --> 00:08:40.519 align:start position:0%
line that bugs me is that um shall
 
00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
include you know they they're supposed
 
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
to use race right but but don't we have
 
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
all kinds of laws and so on that says
 
00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:54.680 align:start position:0%
you can't use race you first stuff
 
00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.910 align:start position:0%
you can't use race you first stuff
exactly

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
so so I'm not comfortable with that but
 
00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:00.829 align:start position:0%
so so I'm not comfortable with that but
I

00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:09:04.509 --> 00:09:04.519 align:start position:0%
don't I just mention it because I don't
 
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
think it's going to make any real
 
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.949 align:start position:0%
think it's going to make any real
difference

00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:08.959 align:start position:0%
difference
 
00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah it's just don't give all my
 
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
amendments for today have to do with
 
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
you yeah I guess could do a floor
 
00:09:24.399 --> 00:09:26.030 align:start position:0%
you yeah I guess could do a floor

good morning members of the committee

executive director
 
00:21:09.149 --> 00:21:09.159 align:start position:0%
oplc um so as as you recall this is uh
 
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
very similar to the bill that you passed
 
00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:14.559 align:start position:0%
last year um which was House Bill 337
 
00:21:17.549 --> 00:21:17.559 align:start position:0%
which the governor vetoed um citing some
 
00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:19.240 align:start position:0%
concerns specifically with
 
00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:21.039 align:start position:0%
administrative burden and deviations
 
00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
from 91a um what we did is we went back
 
00:21:27.789 --> 00:21:27.799 align:start position:0%
uh to the drawing table we made a few
 
00:21:30.909 --> 00:21:30.919 align:start position:0%
changes um and I think it's something
 
00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
that we can all agree um can work and um
 
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:37.640 align:start position:0%
we take no position on the bill but um
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
we're ready to implement it should uh
 
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
should the legislature decide to
 
00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:47.240 align:start position:0%
pass so any questions for Miss Courtney

00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:07.960 align:start position:0%
about this bill but for you thank you Mr
 
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
chair um is a strip down
 
00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
and um stripped down policy-wise and
 
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.670 align:start position:0%
and um stripped down policy-wise and
cost-wise

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:18.680 align:start position:0%
cost-wise
 
00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:21.880 align:start position:0%
version of what was introduced in the
 
00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
Senate it does basically three things it
 
00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:28.520 align:start position:0%
extends the commission on Primary Care
 
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
Workforce which is about to expire it
 
00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
allows more
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
lnas to
 
00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:40.630 align:start position:0%
lnas to
administer

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
administer
 
00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
medication and it sets up a
 
00:41:48.589 --> 00:41:48.599 align:start position:0%
process for voluntary
 
00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
certification of community health
 
00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
workers these um individuals are really
 
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
important to the Health Care
 
00:42:04.829 --> 00:42:04.839 align:start position:0%
System but they are not clinical staff
 
00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
they are uh Personnel who
 
00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:11.800 align:start position:0%
have sort of lived experience with the
 
00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:15.160 align:start position:0%
communities they work in they work in
 
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
community health centers
 
00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:22.640 align:start position:0%
hospitals and um at least in nashwa they
 
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
work in the public health
 
00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
department and what they do do
 
00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
is they they do a lot of the
 
00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
administrative work so that licensed
 
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
Health Care Professionals can actually
 
00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
work to the scope they are licensed for
 
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
so doctors and nurses don't need to be
 
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
arranging transportation to medical
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
appointments or helping with food
 
00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:57.950 align:start position:0%
appointments or helping with food
assistance

00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
00:43:00.549 --> 00:43:00.559 align:start position:0%
that is the job that a community health
 
00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:03.880 align:start position:0%
worker can do so the nurse and the
 
00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:05.800 align:start position:0%
doctor can
 
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
do nursing and
 
00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
Medicine however because they are not
 
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
certified now they are not able to be
 
00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:19.880 align:start position:0%
reimbursed by either Medicaid or
 
00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:21.190 align:start position:0%
reimbursed by either Medicaid or
commercial

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
insurance so by setting up this process
 
00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:27.800 align:start position:0%
they would become
 
00:43:31.069 --> 00:43:31.079 align:start position:0%
able to be reimbursed in the commercial
 
00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
Market of course that would be subject
 
00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:35.800 align:start position:0%
to contract
 
00:43:39.309 --> 00:43:39.319 align:start position:0%
negotiation between a carrier and the
 
00:43:44.109 --> 00:43:44.119 align:start position:0%
employer we also took the
 
00:43:48.589 --> 00:43:48.599 align:start position:0%
appropriation to sustain this important
 
00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
workforce out of the bill because the
 
00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:43:59.109 --> 00:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
already has the money they need from
 
00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
federal grants and in fact last month in
 
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee we
 
00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
transferred just under $2
 
00:44:12.069 --> 00:44:12.079 align:start position:0%
million to support the community health
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
workers so there's no State cost it is
 
00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:21.880 align:start position:0%
not an ongoing solution but the
 
00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
hospitals the Family Resource
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
Centers the community health
 
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:31.720 align:start position:0%
centers think they're a really important
 
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
part of their
 
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
Workforce and would like to be able to
 
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
keep them so that Physicians and nurses
 
00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:43.160 align:start position:0%
can work at the top of their scope thank
 
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:49.549 --> 00:44:49.559 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
walner thank you um Senator
 
00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
rosenal so your your um the bill will be
 
00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:00.440 align:start position:0%
funded through arpa funds that fiscal
 
00:45:04.270 --> 00:45:04.280 align:start position:0%
has already acted on is that correct I
 
00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:07.480 align:start position:0%
don't think it's arpa funds I think it
 
00:45:11.069 --> 00:45:11.079 align:start position:0%
might be a different Federal grant but
 
00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
it will be funded through Federal grant
 
00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:15.640 align:start position:0%
funds that
 
00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
HHS already has that's why there's no
 
00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
appropriation we were able to take it
 
00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:25.720 align:start position:0%
out because the department had the money
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
and we've already
 
00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
transferred most of
 
00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
it um to fund this Workforce for the
 
00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
next year thank
 
00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
you representative wner I said
 
00:45:43.349 --> 00:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
representative Wier excuse me thank you
 
00:45:47.109 --> 00:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh thank you Senator when I
 
00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
first read it it sounds like this is
 
00:45:51.069 --> 00:45:51.079 align:start position:0%
dealing with foreign populations but
 
00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement to be language
 
00:45:58.910 --> 00:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
proficient to get this C ification and
 
00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:02.440 align:start position:0%
do we have that many is there that large
 
00:46:04.829 --> 00:46:04.839 align:start position:0%
a foreign population that can't
 
00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:07.160 align:start position:0%
understand English
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
well 10% of the population of nashwa is
 
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
from India we have also a a large and
 
00:46:23.470 --> 00:46:23.480 align:start position:0%
growing Latino population and we've
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
had I moved to NASA 35 years a ago and
 
00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
there was a significant Brazilian
 
00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
population at the time it it's it's not
 
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
only language-based it's communities of
 
00:46:41.069 --> 00:46:41.079 align:start position:0%
elderly people who are more homebound
 
00:46:44.829 --> 00:46:44.839 align:start position:0%
who are also helped and it's also young
 
00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:50.680 align:start position:0%
families who are more at risk who are
 
00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:54.200 align:start position:0%
um clients let's say of the Family
 
00:46:58.150 --> 00:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
Resource Centers so it
 
00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:01.480 align:start position:0%
it's I think it would be not correct to
 
00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:03.640 align:start position:0%
say we're only talking about people who
 
00:47:06.549 --> 00:47:06.559 align:start position:0%
speak Spanish it's some people who speak
 
00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
Spanish but it's some people who um know
 
00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:13.480 align:start position:0%
that just know the community some people
 
00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:16.079 align:start position:0%
who are good with the elderly or with
 
00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
you right um so Senator do Melissa give
 
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
her the latest fiscal note oh she asked
 
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
okay um so what I'm concerned with is if
 
00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:33.880 align:start position:0%
you look under expenditures on our as
 
00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:35.720 align:start position:0%
amended by the house fiscal note which
 
00:47:41.309 --> 00:47:41.319 align:start position:0%
we just got it says in 2025 4.25 million
 
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
Source federal arpa funds comma state
 
00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
and the way I read this that's an
 
00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:49.950 align:start position:0%
and the way I read this that's an
ongoing

00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:49.960 align:start position:0%
ongoing
 
00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
cost is that
 
00:47:59.829 --> 00:47:59.839 align:start position:0%
right well I it's a subject to a budget
 
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
appropriation like everything else in
 
00:48:07.349 --> 00:48:07.359 align:start position:0%
the next budget so I don't read it that
 
00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
way oh
 
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
so you're thinking that we could pass it
 
00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
now they could work for a year and then
 
00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:17.480 align:start position:0%
we could pull their funding back I mean
 
00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:18.670 align:start position:0%
we could pull their funding back I mean
that

00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:18.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
seems I think we could um you know hope
 
00:48:26.190 --> 00:48:26.200 align:start position:0%
that we continue to get federal grants
 
00:48:30.270 --> 00:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
we could discuss using general funds we
 
00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:34.280 align:start position:0%
have all the options that we always have
 
00:48:35.589 --> 00:48:35.599 align:start position:0%
at our
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
disposal but they uh their grant funding
 
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
that they currently have runs
 
00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
out like next month so this will keep
 
00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:52.670 align:start position:0%
out like next month so this will keep
them

00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:48:56.829 --> 00:48:56.839 align:start position:0%
employed for the next year and then all
 
00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
the options are ours we might decide not
 
00:49:06.829 --> 00:49:06.839 align:start position:0%
to include their funding in the Medicaid
 
00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
budget we might continue to receive
 
00:49:13.309 --> 00:49:13.319 align:start position:0%
Federal grant money I mean I just don't
 
00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
think we can predict
 
00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:19.000 align:start position:0%
that okay represent
 
00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
walner so it sounds to me like from your
 
00:49:25.069 --> 00:49:25.079 align:start position:0%
description of the work that um the
 
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
community health workers do it sounds to
 
00:49:30.069 --> 00:49:30.079 align:start position:0%
me like that actually as far as the
 
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
Medicaid budget goes they're providing
 
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sure at a a less reimbursement than
 
00:49:41.349 --> 00:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
a nurse or a doctor so in a way they are
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
sa they are
 
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
saving Health Care
 
00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
money I think you could look at it that
 
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
way I mean right now they're getting
 
00:49:54.589 --> 00:49:54.599 align:start position:0%
zero reimbursement so um this would
 
00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
allow and we've already train
 
00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
transferred for federal
 
00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
funds to um help sustain this Workforce
 
00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
in the short
 
00:50:08.829 --> 00:50:08.839 align:start position:0%
term by
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
increasing the availability in the
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
primary care setting I think we save
 
00:50:18.589 --> 00:50:18.599 align:start position:0%
money through the entire Health Care
 
00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:23.240 align:start position:0%
system so if doctors and nurses can see
 
00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:27.400 align:start position:0%
more people at a community health center
 
00:50:30.549 --> 00:50:30.559 align:start position:0%
I think we could project I don't have
 
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
the numbers but I think we could guess
 
00:50:36.670 --> 00:50:36.680 align:start position:0%
that might mean fewer emergency
 
00:50:41.230 --> 00:50:41.240 align:start position:0%
department visits fewer hospital
 
00:50:49.309 --> 00:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
assumption what would happen if we
 
00:50:54.670 --> 00:50:54.680 align:start position:0%
delayed this issue till the budget next
 
00:50:56.829 --> 00:50:56.839 align:start position:0%
time where it could be considered by
 
00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:00.760 align:start position:0%
division 3 you know more properly than
 
00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
us well I think that we would lose the
 
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
services of these workers for the next
 
00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal year because we've TR I mean
 
00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
we've made the money available but we
 
00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:17.720 align:start position:0%
haven't started the certification
 
00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:20.680 align:start position:0%
process if we delay it till the next
 
00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:24.040 align:start position:0%
budget it won't just start on July 1st
 
00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:25.150 align:start position:0%
budget it won't just start on July 1st
of

00:51:25.150 --> 00:51:25.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:27.160 align:start position:0%
2025 we'll
 
00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
be 3/4 of the way through the next
 
00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
budget before those rules are written
 
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
and adopted so I think that it makes
 
00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
sense to do this policy piece now
 
00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
knowing that there is not a state cost
 
00:51:49.549 --> 00:51:49.559 align:start position:0%
and we have the
 
00:51:54.270 --> 00:51:54.280 align:start position:0%
option to fund it or not fund it or fund
 
00:52:01.309 --> 00:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
all right um so I uh I prepared an
 
00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
amendment that would thank you thank you
 
00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:10.200 align:start position:0%

asked the senator I would like you to um
 
00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
confirm is it so that there is no
 
00:53:11.349 --> 00:53:11.359 align:start position:0%
General funds in this bill for you know
 
00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:19.400 align:start position:0%
budget that the money has already been
 
00:53:21.630 --> 00:53:21.640 align:start position:0%
provided by the fiscal committee or or
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
is from internal money that you already
 
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
have extra there's no addition oh sorry
 
00:53:28.789 --> 00:53:28.799 align:start position:0%
I didn't realize how loud that would be
 
00:53:31.950 --> 00:53:31.960 align:start position:0%
um the the current funding is is already
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
appropriated within contracts um and uh
 
00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
through fiscal year
 
00:53:39.829 --> 00:53:39.839 align:start position:0%
25 so through the end of the current
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
budget yes yeah okay and what would be
 
00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
the consequence of delaying the
 
00:53:48.190 --> 00:53:48.200 align:start position:0%
certification to the next budget putting
 
00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
essentially putting this language in the
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
next house build too the certification
 
00:53:56.589 --> 00:53:56.599 align:start position:0%
piece from from my knowledge um has has
 
00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
been an ongoing work um that has been um
 
00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
something that we've really tried to
 
00:54:06.109 --> 00:54:06.119 align:start position:0%
look at happening um but it's a way for
 
00:54:08.349 --> 00:54:08.359 align:start position:0%
reimbursing for services and not being
 
00:54:11.789 --> 00:54:11.799 align:start position:0%
solely um relying on grant funding uh
 
00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
this would allow some Medicaid
 
00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursement it's not going to cover
 
00:54:18.309 --> 00:54:18.319 align:start position:0%
all of the FTE or the the the um the
 
00:54:19.789 --> 00:54:19.799 align:start position:0%
full salary for a community health
 
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
worker but it'll at least help to um for
 
00:54:25.150 --> 00:54:25.160 align:start position:0%
these agencies like community health
 
00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
centers and Family Resource Centers to
 
00:54:28.349 --> 00:54:28.359 align:start position:0%
be able to start planning some other
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
sources of funding this will definitely
 
00:54:32.430 --> 00:54:32.440 align:start position:0%
help to reimburse for some of those
 
00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
Services ongoing so it kind of sets us
 
00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:43.390 --> 00:54:43.400 align:start position:0%
planning represent wner yeah so
 
00:54:48.069 --> 00:54:48.079 align:start position:0%
presently if these um Community Health
 
00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
Providers are not um
 
00:54:52.510 --> 00:54:52.520 align:start position:0%
certified they're not eligible for
 
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
Medicaid reimbursement so we do not
 
00:54:57.670 --> 00:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
receive the federal share
 
00:54:59.789 --> 00:54:59.799 align:start position:0%
uh currently there there is no
 
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
certification but in the future it's
 
00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:05.480 align:start position:0%
totally voluntary so so if a chw does
 
00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
not go through the process they would
 
00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:09.400 align:start position:0%
not be eligible for Medicaid
 
00:55:11.069 --> 00:55:11.079 align:start position:0%
reimbursement and so the Medicaid
 
00:55:13.109 --> 00:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
reimbursement does allow for some
 
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
guidelines um that could be monitored
 
00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
okay and so just so I'm clear in order
 
00:55:23.109 --> 00:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
for a community health worker to be
 
00:55:26.349 --> 00:55:26.359 align:start position:0%
reimbursed with Medicaid funds they have
 
00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
have to be certified is that right this
 
00:55:30.069 --> 00:55:30.079 align:start position:0%
would be the process yes and this is the
 
00:55:33.349 --> 00:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
process yes thank you
 
00:55:36.309 --> 00:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
yeah who's who's providing the grants
 
00:55:37.789 --> 00:55:37.799 align:start position:0%
that are paying them
 
00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
now there there are a variety of Grants
 
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
um some from the center from for Disease
 
00:55:45.309 --> 00:55:45.319 align:start position:0%
Control um Health disparities Grant some
 
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
are um epidemiology and and capacity
 
00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:50.680 align:start position:0%
building um I didn't write all the
 
00:55:52.789 --> 00:55:52.799 align:start position:0%
grants down but um there are various
 
00:55:55.029 --> 00:55:55.039 align:start position:0%
federal grants that also come to a close
 
00:55:57.510 --> 00:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
and so um we are interested in
 
00:55:59.510 --> 00:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
sustainability of the
 
00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
workforce so so you don't expect to get
 
00:56:05.630 --> 00:56:05.640 align:start position:0%
these grants continuing no and that's
 
00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
why you want to move these people onto
 
00:56:09.870 --> 00:56:09.880 align:start position:0%
being paid by Medicaid yeah these grants
 
00:56:12.510 --> 00:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
are all coming to a close um right now
 
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
we're in a um we've we've had approval
 
00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
for a no cost extension for a couple of
 
00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
them um so so they'll they'll
 
00:56:24.349 --> 00:56:24.359 align:start position:0%
end okay so is it fair to say we're
 
00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
making a decision here as to whether if
 
00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:29.640 align:start position:0%
we continue this
 
00:56:32.349 --> 00:56:32.359 align:start position:0%
Workforce the state will end up paying
 
00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
half because we pay half of
 
00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid versus right now the state's
 
00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
this so in our fiscal note it actually
 
00:56:49.230 --> 00:56:49.240 align:start position:0%
states that the 4.2 million that are
 
00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
currently being used is a mix of federal
 
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
and general funds so right now some
 
00:56:56.910 --> 00:56:56.920 align:start position:0%
general funds are being used
 
00:57:01.789 --> 00:57:01.799 align:start position:0%
us that were in the budget or yes oh
 
00:57:04.349 --> 00:57:04.359 align:start position:0%
okay I
 
00:57:07.150 --> 00:57:07.160 align:start position:0%
see just to clarify the general funds or
 
00:57:08.349 --> 00:57:08.359 align:start position:0%
some of the funds that are that go to
 
00:57:10.789 --> 00:57:10.799 align:start position:0%
Family Resource Centers which supports a
 
00:57:12.990 --> 00:57:13.000 align:start position:0%
variety of their infrastructure some of
 
00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
those are are if they need coverage for
 
00:57:18.029 --> 00:57:18.039 align:start position:0%
those positions for the chw positions is
 
00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
that about half of these costs or is it
 
00:57:23.829 --> 00:57:23.839 align:start position:0%
a little less or no it's it's a lot less
 
00:57:28.789 --> 00:57:28.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
all right any other
 
00:57:33.069 --> 00:57:33.079 align:start position:0%
questions no anyone else here like to
 
00:57:45.950 --> 00:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:48.670 --> 00:57:48.680 align:start position:0%
ladies uh good morning Mr chairman I'm
 
00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
Jim Monahan with the dunk group and I'm
 
00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:51.710 align:start position:0%
Jim Monahan with the dunk group and I'm
here

00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:57:54.789 --> 00:57:54.799 align:start position:0%
today um on behalf of a number of
 
00:57:56.829 --> 00:57:56.839 align:start position:0%
community providers we have a Coalition
 
00:57:59.029 --> 00:57:59.039 align:start position:0%
that's been working on this uh subject
 
00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
matter in bill for a couple of his
 
00:58:03.309 --> 00:58:03.319 align:start position:0%
sessions um so I don't want to lean in
 
00:58:05.309 --> 00:58:05.319 align:start position:0%
heavily on the on the policy because I
 
00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
know you're looking at the fal impact
 
00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
but so let me um try to convince you not
 
00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
to move forward with your Amendment
 
00:58:13.829 --> 00:58:13.839 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire um um
 
00:58:15.710 --> 00:58:15.720 align:start position:0%
particularly how it will affect the
 
00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
community uh Mental Health Centers and
 
00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
the community uh Health Centers the
 
00:58:22.589 --> 00:58:22.599 align:start position:0%
federally qualified Health Centers um
 
00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:24.920 align:start position:0%
they employ lots of community health
 
00:58:28.069 --> 00:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
workers um it Exel cerate a lot uh as a
 
00:58:30.789 --> 00:58:30.799 align:start position:0%
consequence of the uh healthc care work
 
00:58:32.910 --> 00:58:32.920 align:start position:0%
short Workforce shortage that we've had
 
00:58:35.109 --> 00:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
as representative I'm sorry Senator
 
00:58:37.349 --> 00:58:37.359 align:start position:0%
rosenell indicated with the right
 
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
balance of community health workers
 
00:58:41.390 --> 00:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
you're able to free up clinical staff to
 
00:58:44.190 --> 00:58:44.200 align:start position:0%
have more direct contract with folks so
 
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh today those those um community health
 
00:58:51.829 --> 00:58:51.839 align:start position:0%
workers because they don't have um a
 
00:58:54.109 --> 00:58:54.119 align:start position:0%
certification they cannot be
 
00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
credentialed by commercial insures and
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
so the uh their activity at the
 
00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:02.440 align:start position:0%
community health center or Community
 
00:59:04.910 --> 00:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Center uh is totally paid
 
00:59:08.069 --> 00:59:08.079 align:start position:0%
for with uh the center's bake sale funds
 
00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
I know that's not a fair way to describe
 
00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:11.960 align:start position:0%
it but there there's no commercial or
 
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
Medicaid reimbursement for that activity
 
00:59:18.190 --> 00:59:18.200 align:start position:0%
um so uh
 
00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
uh that is among the there's certainly
 
00:59:23.470 --> 00:59:23.480 align:start position:0%
other reasons around the professionalism
 
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
of the of the workforce that they stick
 
00:59:27.150 --> 00:59:27.160 align:start position:0%
around and they become part of they work
 
00:59:30.430 --> 00:59:30.440 align:start position:0%
their way through it so uh the concern
 
00:59:32.910 --> 00:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
we have and as the finance committee is
 
00:59:35.349 --> 00:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
well aware is that there is a a
 
00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
significant challenge to operate the
 
00:59:39.390 --> 00:59:39.400 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Centers and the
 
00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:40.520 align:start position:0%
community health center so this is going
 
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
to help both from the professionalism of
 
00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:45.480 align:start position:0%
that Workforce but frankly with regard
 
00:59:48.029 --> 00:59:48.039 align:start position:0%
to reimbursement I don't think we'll be
 
00:59:51.349 --> 00:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
in a situation where if uh we don't move
 
00:59:53.109 --> 00:59:53.119 align:start position:0%
forward with this we'll just eliminate
 
00:59:55.109 --> 00:59:55.119 align:start position:0%
that work for Force what we're really
 
00:59:57.349 --> 00:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
doing is just leaving money on the table
 
00:59:59.349 --> 00:59:59.359 align:start position:0%
whether it be for commercial
 
01:00:02.349 --> 01:00:02.359 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for Medicare or Medicaid
 
01:00:04.029 --> 01:00:04.039 align:start position:0%
without the certification so we try to
 
01:00:06.430 --> 01:00:06.440 align:start position:0%
work this through the system uh it is a
 
01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
voluntary certification so we're we're
 
01:00:12.589 --> 01:00:12.599 align:start position:0%
trying to be mindful of not ex expanding
 
01:00:15.029 --> 01:00:15.039 align:start position:0%
uh regulated health professionals uh if
 
01:00:16.589 --> 01:00:16.599 align:start position:0%
we don't have to but it really gets into
 
01:00:19.150 --> 01:00:19.160 align:start position:0%
this odd mix of the rules of the road
 
01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
for reimbursement so are the skill
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
levels of this group less than an LNA
 
01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
um yeah I want to be respectful of the
 
01:00:29.549 --> 01:00:29.559 align:start position:0%
profession but yes I mean they don't
 
01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
they're not so someone from this group
 
01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:34.760 align:start position:0%
might future move up by becoming an LNA

01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:04.559 align:start position:0%
so good morning I'm Adam Schmidt I'm
 
01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
lobbyist here in cochard we represent
 
01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:07.960 align:start position:0%
the new hampsh Association Realtors and
 
01:03:09.710 --> 01:03:09.720 align:start position:0%
as I'm looking at this it says exactly
 
01:03:12.029 --> 01:03:12.039 align:start position:0%
what I hoped it would say which is there
 
01:03:14.269 --> 01:03:14.279 align:start position:0%
is no fiscal impact at the policy
 
01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
committee there was a provision that
 
01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
talked about allocating funds to oplc
 
01:03:20.309 --> 01:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
for additional staff that section was
 
01:03:23.710 --> 01:03:23.720 align:start position:0%
removed in Edna so the portion of the
 
01:03:25.309 --> 01:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
bill that actually spent money was
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
removed all that's left are policy
 
01:03:29.470 --> 01:03:29.480 align:start position:0%
Provisions that are very technical and
 
01:03:31.390 --> 01:03:31.400 align:start position:0%
deal with the real estate practice which
 
01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
would just be very boring to have me
 
01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
listen I try to explain but for this
 
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
committee's purposes the portion that
 
01:03:40.990 --> 01:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
did allocate money was removed from the
 
01:03:43.230 --> 01:03:43.240 align:start position:0%
bill as introduced all that was passed
 
01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
on to you were again some more technical
 
01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
Corrections for the real estate Practice
 
01:03:49.349 --> 01:03:49.359 align:start position:0%
Act thank you any questions from the
 
01:03:52.510 --> 01:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
committee representative Griffin well I
 
01:03:56.069 --> 01:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
I kind of want to offer that uh I have
 
01:03:58.950 --> 01:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
had a real estate or I had a real estate
 
01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
license from age
 
01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
19 and uh so I looked at this bill
 
01:04:08.109 --> 01:04:08.119 align:start position:0%
pretty carefully it it it makes some
 
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
positive changes it
 
01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
appears it appears
 
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
um it appears that it eliminates the
 
01:04:21.789 --> 01:04:21.799 align:start position:0%
need to maintain an office and a bond if
 
01:04:21.799 --> 01:04:23.549 align:start position:0%
need to maintain an office and a bond if
you're

01:04:23.549 --> 01:04:23.559 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
inactive uh if it also states that if
 
01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:30.760 align:start position:0%
while you were in while you were active
 
01:04:34.349 --> 01:04:34.359 align:start position:0%
if you uh earned a commission that that
 
01:04:38.109 --> 01:04:38.119 align:start position:0%
can be paid if you become
 
01:04:41.109 --> 01:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
inactive well it the commission for the
 
01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
time you were active can be paid and uh
 
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
other than that basically it's it
 
01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
appears to me be a lot of the things
 
01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:56.319 align:start position:0%
that existed already and uh I would move
 
01:04:59.870 --> 01:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
it uh representative Griffin has moved
 
01:05:04.109 --> 01:05:04.119 align:start position:0%
out to pass seconded by representative
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%

whole context out of which this bill
 
01:21:40.950 --> 01:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
came absolutely um it comes out of um a
 
01:21:43.830 --> 01:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
series of meetings dealing with ground
 
01:21:45.750 --> 01:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
ambulance services and it's their

ambulance Summit and uh we had a lot of

representation from ambulance providers
 
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
from hospitals consumers and health
 
01:22:09.310 --> 01:22:09.320 align:start position:0%
carriers to deal with two main issues um
 
01:22:12.669 --> 01:22:12.679 align:start position:0%
one is the problem of balanced billing
 
01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
um where people who are covered with
 
01:22:21.350 --> 01:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
health insurance get surprised by um a
 
01:22:23.990 --> 01:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
balance bill for ambulance services
 
01:22:25.629 --> 01:22:25.639 align:start position:0%
because they don't don't realize that
 
01:22:28.390 --> 01:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
their the ambulance is not in network
 
01:22:31.229 --> 01:22:31.239 align:start position:0%
and therefore not constrained uh by the
 
01:22:33.189 --> 01:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
reimbursement amount that it receives
 
01:22:35.590 --> 01:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
from the health carrier it's the one
 
01:22:37.470 --> 01:22:37.480 align:start position:0%
area that was not dealt with by the
 
01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
federal no surprises act uh because it's
 
01:22:43.510 --> 01:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
a little bit more complex than the other
 
01:22:45.790 --> 01:22:45.800 align:start position:0%
instances of Balan billing that were
 
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
occurring so that's one problem that we
 
01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to solve and the other problem
 
01:22:54.510 --> 01:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
was the increasing Financial strain that
 
01:22:57.270 --> 01:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
ambulance service providers are under
 
01:22:59.870 --> 01:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
these days their costs are going up a
 
01:23:05.910 --> 01:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
lot um and um traditionally um the
 
01:23:09.270 --> 01:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
public payers have not paid very well uh
 
01:23:12.750 --> 01:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
relative to the cost of producing the
 
01:23:15.149 --> 01:23:15.159 align:start position:0%
services so we were trying to tackle
 
01:23:17.669 --> 01:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
those two issues at the same
 
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
time and the um Department we sort of
 
01:23:23.629 --> 01:23:23.639 align:start position:0%
finished up with the meetings we
 
01:23:26.110 --> 01:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
couldn't reach consensus as a group but
 
01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
the department insurance department did
 
01:23:31.110 --> 01:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
produce a a report a final report on the
 
01:23:33.709 --> 01:23:33.719 align:start position:0%
summit meetings which is on our website
 
01:23:35.709 --> 01:23:35.719 align:start position:0%
and the essence of our recommendations
 
01:23:38.709 --> 01:23:38.719 align:start position:0%
were um basically the commercial
 
01:23:40.709 --> 01:23:40.719 align:start position:0%
insurers because that's what it was
 
01:23:43.990 --> 01:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
about is the that percentage of the
 
01:23:47.110 --> 01:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
payers um that ambulance service
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
providers have that consists of State
 
01:23:53.310 --> 01:23:53.320 align:start position:0%
regulated commercial insurance which is
 
01:23:56.189 --> 01:23:56.199 align:start position:0%
really only 10% of the payers most of
 
01:23:59.390 --> 01:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
the payers are Medicare Medicaid
 
01:24:01.750 --> 01:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
self-funded commercial coverage which is
 
01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
not regulated by the state and then the
 
01:24:06.270 --> 01:24:06.280 align:start position:0%
last 10% is the commercial
 
01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
insurance um so our recommendation is
 
01:24:11.070 --> 01:24:11.080 align:start position:0%
that that 10% the commercial insurers
 
01:24:12.990 --> 01:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
should increase their reimbursement
 
01:24:15.270 --> 01:24:15.280 align:start position:0%
rates to fully cover the cost of
 
01:24:17.790 --> 01:24:17.800 align:start position:0%
providing ground ambulance services
 
01:24:19.629 --> 01:24:19.639 align:start position:0%
including what cost what's called
 
01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
Readiness of you know be making sure you
 
01:24:23.629 --> 01:24:23.639 align:start position:0%
have sufficient resources to be
 
01:24:23.639 --> 01:24:25.390 align:start position:0%
have sufficient resources to be
available

01:24:25.390 --> 01:24:25.400 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:24:28.149 --> 01:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
um and number two that balance billing
 
01:24:32.189 --> 01:24:32.199 align:start position:0%
should be prohibited in exchange
 
01:24:34.990 --> 01:24:35.000 align:start position:0%
um uh but in order to determine what
 
01:24:38.590 --> 01:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
that uh cost-based fee schedule should
 
01:24:43.070 --> 01:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
be uh it requires uh a study that
 
01:24:46.030 --> 01:24:46.040 align:start position:0%
information I mean we made a sort of lay
 
01:24:47.669 --> 01:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
person's attempt during the summit
 
01:24:49.709 --> 01:24:49.719 align:start position:0%
meetings to put out a survey and gather
 
01:24:49.719 --> 01:24:50.550 align:start position:0%
meetings to put out a survey and gather
some

01:24:50.550 --> 01:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
information um but uh we didn't get
 
01:24:58.109 --> 01:24:58.119 align:start position:0%
usable information in that way so what's
 
01:25:00.270 --> 01:25:00.280 align:start position:0%
needed to move toward this cost based
 
01:25:03.310 --> 01:25:03.320 align:start position:0%
reimbursement system is um a
 
01:25:07.470 --> 01:25:07.480 align:start position:0%
professional study with an actual cost
 
01:25:10.709 --> 01:25:10.719 align:start position:0%
survey um done by accounting an
 
01:25:13.990 --> 01:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
Actuarial firm plus the production of a
 
01:25:17.870 --> 01:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
report and a illustrative fee schedule
 
01:25:22.149 --> 01:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
so when house Commerce got this bill of
 
01:25:24.270 --> 01:25:24.280 align:start position:0%
out of all the recommendations that the
 
01:25:25.550 --> 01:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
insurance department has made they
 
01:25:28.390 --> 01:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
picked out that one piece like the first
 
01:25:31.590 --> 01:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
step and decided let's just do this
 
01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
let's do it quickly so it's due December
 
01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
1st of this year which is indeed a TI uh
 
01:25:45.149 --> 01:25:45.159 align:start position:0%
Fe tight schedule um but um that's how
 
01:25:49.550 --> 01:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
this um replace all Amendment came to
 
01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
be I could pause there or I could
 
01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
explain anticipates the question yes let
 
01:25:57.550 --> 01:25:57.560 align:start position:0%
me just quickly the previous fiscal note
 
01:26:00.270 --> 01:26:00.280 align:start position:0%
said that we were raising people's
 
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
Insurance costs by 11.8 million so
 
01:26:06.149 --> 01:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
that's gone is that what you're saying
 
01:26:09.189 --> 01:26:09.199 align:start position:0%
yeah the the version of the bill that
 
01:26:10.870 --> 01:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
came over from the Senate was quite
 
01:26:13.510 --> 01:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
different it sort of jumped over the
 
01:26:17.229 --> 01:26:17.239 align:start position:0%
cost study and just picked a number uh
 
01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
which was basically either whatever
 
01:26:25.709 --> 01:26:25.719 align:start position:0%
ambulance providers charge or
 
01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
325 of Medicare and so when we had to do
 
01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note for that and you know from
 
01:26:35.189 --> 01:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
our claims data which we used to do a
 
01:26:38.310 --> 01:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
lot of analysis we saw that the current
 
01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:42.040 align:start position:0%
rate is more like 120% of Medicare and
 
01:26:44.750 --> 01:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
so we just used claims data to calculate
 
01:26:46.590 --> 01:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
what the total cost would be to bring it
 
01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
up to 325 per and then what would that
 
01:26:51.910 --> 01:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
would mean on a per member per month
 
01:26:56.590 --> 01:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:01.510 --> 01:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:04.390 --> 01:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
committee representative Lane I don't
 
01:27:06.709 --> 01:27:06.719 align:start position:0%
have as much a question as I have
 
01:27:11.350 --> 01:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
experienced the balance paid and
 
01:27:14.149 --> 01:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
um considering that we had no choice in
 
01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
who we picked um it it was it's a real
 
01:27:21.550 --> 01:27:21.560 align:start position:0%
it's a huge issue for people so um do
 
01:27:23.830 --> 01:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
you think that this is going to lead to
 
01:27:26.669 --> 01:27:26.679 align:start position:0%
a solution of that
 
01:27:29.070 --> 01:27:29.080 align:start position:0%
because that because it was a big
 
01:27:31.070 --> 01:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
surprise well I appreciate your your
 
01:27:33.070 --> 01:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
comment big surprise we get a lot of
 
01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
complaints um in the last two years uh
 
01:27:38.709 --> 01:27:38.719 align:start position:0%
we surveyed uh all the complaints about
 
01:27:40.910 --> 01:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
balance billing we found that the median
 
01:27:43.950 --> 01:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
balance bill was between $3 and
 
01:27:47.109 --> 01:27:47.119 align:start position:0%
$4,000 and that uh 30% of them were
 
01:27:49.350 --> 01:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
actually over
 
01:27:51.669 --> 01:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
$6,000 um and when you compare that to
 
01:27:55.510 --> 01:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
the fact um the enan policy Institute
 
01:27:57.910 --> 01:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
reports that 27% of New Hampshire
 
01:28:00.870 --> 01:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
residents have less than $2,000 in
 
01:28:03.950 --> 01:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
emergency savings it's a real hardship
 
01:28:07.109 --> 01:28:07.119 align:start position:0%
for some people certainly and it was a
 
01:28:09.870 --> 01:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
top priority of the department to to get
 
01:28:12.510 --> 01:28:12.520 align:start position:0%
to that issue yeah and I think when
 
01:28:13.990 --> 01:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about this issue
 
01:28:15.990 --> 01:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
throughout the summit and throughout
 
01:28:17.550 --> 01:28:17.560 align:start position:0%
this legislative session trying to come
 
01:28:19.390 --> 01:28:19.400 align:start position:0%
up with compromises the sticking point
 
01:28:21.149 --> 01:28:21.159 align:start position:0%
is always well what percent are you
 
01:28:22.950 --> 01:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
going to set it at what's the rate going
 
01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
to be and and um I think all the parties
 
01:28:28.629 --> 01:28:28.639 align:start position:0%
are at very opposite sides so this
 
01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
independent analysis will help everyone
 
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
come up with an agreed upon rate that is
 
01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:44.350 --> 01:28:44.360 align:start position:0%
principles more
 
01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:45.990 align:start position:0%
principles more
questions

01:28:45.990 --> 01:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:28:48.510 --> 01:28:48.520 align:start position:0%
no maybe representative Lane would like
 
01:28:49.830 --> 01:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
to make a
 
01:28:58.430 --> 01:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:00.750 --> 01:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
oh thank you okay and seconded by

01:36:52.510 --> 01:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:52.520 --> 01:37:22.510 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:37:22.510 --> 01:37:22.520 align:start position:0%

01:37:52.430 --> 01:37:52.440 align:start position:0%

01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:22.440 align:start position:0%

e

01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:33.390 --> 01:40:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:36.030 --> 01:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much it's 11:40
 
01:40:39.510 --> 01:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
and we are going to consider Senate Bill
 
01:40:43.589 --> 01:40:43.599 align:start position:0%
487 I see commissioner Arling house here
 
01:40:50.589 --> 01:40:50.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:53.870 --> 01:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
about yes please
 
01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
so so you're going to explain why uh
 
01:40:59.189 --> 01:40:59.199 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to spend 350,000 a
 
01:41:01.870 --> 01:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
year instead of 72,000 in a year just
 
01:41:03.310 --> 01:41:03.320 align:start position:0%
because people are moving from one
 
01:41:06.830 --> 01:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
building to another well it's it's not
 
01:41:09.470 --> 01:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
quite like that
 
01:41:13.709 --> 01:41:13.719 align:start position:0%
um the bill um first of all it's worth
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
noting that there's no appropriation
 
01:41:16.830 --> 01:41:16.840 align:start position:0%
attached to this bill I don't want
 
01:41:19.070 --> 01:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
anyone to think that
 
01:41:21.790 --> 01:41:21.800 align:start position:0%
um I don't want the PAB in particular to
 
01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
think that um they will get staff
 
01:41:25.790 --> 01:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
because until money's appropriated
 
01:41:28.950 --> 01:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
nobody gets nothing um so because that's
 
01:41:30.550 --> 01:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
there's no appropriation in the billers
 
01:41:33.990 --> 01:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
as I can tell um the the additional
 
01:41:35.229 --> 01:41:35.239 align:start position:0%
money is an estimate of what an
 
01:41:37.149 --> 01:41:37.159 align:start position:0%
independent PAB would cost and it
 
01:41:39.669 --> 01:41:39.679 align:start position:0%
presumes they have a couple of people um
 
01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
and that they right now basically the
 
01:41:42.870 --> 01:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
the way the Personnel appeals board
 
01:41:44.669 --> 01:41:44.679 align:start position:0%
works is is it
 
01:41:47.550 --> 01:41:47.560 align:start position:0%
is it's an appellate body that is
 
01:41:49.629 --> 01:41:49.639 align:start position:0%
fundamentally independent but not
 
01:41:52.270 --> 01:41:52.280 align:start position:0%
legally independent it's it's an
 
01:41:54.149 --> 01:41:54.159 align:start position:0%
afterthought of State government like
 
01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
like a lot of these little things are
 
01:41:57.070 --> 01:41:57.080 align:start position:0%
they're sort of an afterthought and
 
01:41:58.709 --> 01:41:58.719 align:start position:0%
you're like well we're not really in
 
01:42:02.430 --> 01:42:02.440 align:start position:0%
charge of you and you could argue for
 
01:42:04.830 --> 01:42:04.840 align:start position:0%
example they rely upon the good graces
 
01:42:08.430 --> 01:42:08.440 align:start position:0%
of the division of personnel to um let
 
01:42:10.149 --> 01:42:10.159 align:start position:0%
them use their conference room and
 
01:42:12.070 --> 01:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
Supply them such staff as they might
 
01:42:14.430 --> 01:42:14.440 align:start position:0%
have as might have free time to help out
 
01:42:16.790 --> 01:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
with various administrative duties and
 
01:42:18.390 --> 01:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
that that's always been a source of some
 
01:42:20.350 --> 01:42:20.360 align:start position:0%
degree of tension right between the two
 
01:42:22.709 --> 01:42:22.719 align:start position:0%
organizations particularly given that we
 
01:42:22.719 --> 01:42:23.830 align:start position:0%
organizations particularly given that we
are

01:42:23.830 --> 01:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:42:26.990 --> 01:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
typically on one side of their decisions
 
01:42:30.790 --> 01:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
right we they're deciding between uh an
 
01:42:33.830 --> 01:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
opinion that all often includes dop um
 
01:42:35.189 --> 01:42:35.199 align:start position:0%
and somebody else so it's sort one of
 
01:42:36.830 --> 01:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
these awkward things like you know I
 
01:42:38.229 --> 01:42:38.239 align:start position:0%
don't work for you you no I know you
 
01:42:39.910 --> 01:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
don't work for us but you know if you
 
01:42:40.910 --> 01:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
want to use the conference room on
 
01:42:42.910 --> 01:42:42.920 align:start position:0%
Wednesday you got to ask somebody um and
 
01:42:44.470 --> 01:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
so there's all of that so for a long
 
01:42:46.310 --> 01:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
time um they've wanted to be independent
 
01:42:47.950 --> 01:42:47.960 align:start position:0%
this is this is a something the the
 
01:42:50.310 --> 01:42:50.320 align:start position:0%
board itself has wanted for a long time
 
01:42:51.350 --> 01:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
and so they did so what does
 
01:42:52.709 --> 01:42:52.719 align:start position:0%
independence look like Independence
 
01:42:53.950 --> 01:42:53.960 align:start position:0%
looks like you are actually an
 
01:42:56.750 --> 01:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
independent agency like a lot of other
 
01:42:59.109 --> 01:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
little tiny things that are attached to
 
01:43:02.830 --> 01:43:02.840 align:start position:0%
um in most cases unfortunately us um but
 
01:43:04.550 --> 01:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
like the Commission on Aging has one and
 
01:43:07.189 --> 01:43:07.199 align:start position:0%
a half people the child advocate has I
 
01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
think six at this point the special ed
 
01:43:13.830 --> 01:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
Advocate has one soon to be two the
 
01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:15.149 align:start position:0%
Advocate has one soon to be two the
conservation

01:43:15.149 --> 01:43:15.159 align:start position:0%
conservation
 
01:43:15.159 --> 01:43:17.189 align:start position:0%
conservation
land

01:43:17.189 --> 01:43:17.199 align:start position:0%
land
 
01:43:19.390 --> 01:43:19.400 align:start position:0%
stewardship it's not trust what's I
 
01:43:21.310 --> 01:43:21.320 align:start position:0%
think just conservation land stewardship
 
01:43:23.149 --> 01:43:23.159 align:start position:0%
the sort of flatsome that when we
 
01:43:25.750 --> 01:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
abolished OSI was left over someone want
 
01:43:27.189 --> 01:43:27.199 align:start position:0%
oh make them independent and attach them
 
01:43:28.790 --> 01:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
there well what that happens is you get
 
01:43:30.790 --> 01:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
a you get a signed State office space
 
01:43:32.310 --> 01:43:32.320 align:start position:0%
and the way State office space works is
 
01:43:34.470 --> 01:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
you get you get charged for it a rent-
 
01:43:36.669 --> 01:43:36.679 align:start position:0%
likee charge and so that's an allocation
 
01:43:38.709 --> 01:43:38.719 align:start position:0%
you get a doit allocation for the
 
01:43:40.750 --> 01:43:40.760 align:start position:0%
computers that you use and so that's all
 
01:43:43.149 --> 01:43:43.159 align:start position:0%
those costs amount to about this I think
 
01:43:45.270 --> 01:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
our fiscal note I it's not the fiscal
 
01:43:46.510 --> 01:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
note but if you looked at the fiscal
 
01:43:48.629 --> 01:43:48.639 align:start position:0%
note worksheet that was provided it has
 
01:43:50.589 --> 01:43:50.599 align:start position:0%
footnotes for where all those costs come
 
01:43:54.310 --> 01:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
from uh like the Personnel line which be
 
01:43:56.430 --> 01:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
um two- part-time positions there'd be
 
01:43:58.950 --> 01:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
some expense to to you know put a desk
 
01:44:02.270 --> 01:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
and a cubicle in an office um to set up
 
01:44:05.430 --> 01:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
a room there'd be a copier a printer um
 
01:44:09.070 --> 01:44:09.080 align:start position:0%
you'd have HR Support um and then just
 
01:44:12.750 --> 01:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
those costs right now the costs are um
 
01:44:16.030 --> 01:44:16.040 align:start position:0%
are only the very direct costs allocated
 
01:44:19.030 --> 01:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
to the paab members in One accounting
 
01:44:21.149 --> 01:44:21.159 align:start position:0%
unit that happens to be carried within
 
01:44:27.070 --> 01:44:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:29.709 --> 01:44:29.719 align:start position:0%
did you have a question no
 
01:44:32.350 --> 01:44:32.360 align:start position:0%
questions represent of wiland just a
 
01:44:34.070 --> 01:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
comment I've been impressed with how
 
01:44:37.709 --> 01:44:37.719 align:start position:0%
often um conference rooms can be
 
01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
multi-used because you know once a month
 
01:44:43.350 --> 01:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
once a quarter it's pretty expensive
 
01:44:46.550 --> 01:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
real estate to one agency no I think
 
01:44:48.229 --> 01:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
it's I think it's an important thing I
 
01:44:50.950 --> 01:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
you know we we uh you probably know this
 
01:44:53.109 --> 01:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
that I I've said from the beginning that
 
01:44:55.470 --> 01:44:55.480 align:start position:0%
that um from from when I started that
 
01:44:56.950 --> 01:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
there's no such thing as a Das
 
01:44:58.950 --> 01:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
conference room that we have three
 
01:45:00.669 --> 01:45:00.679 align:start position:0%
conference rooms that that our agency
 
01:45:03.270 --> 01:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
sort of controls the scheduling for and
 
01:45:04.629 --> 01:45:04.639 align:start position:0%
they're routinely Human Rights
 
01:45:05.790 --> 01:45:05.800 align:start position:0%
Commission used to always meet in room
 
01:45:07.870 --> 01:45:07.880 align:start position:0%
405 of the annex which is quote unquote
 
01:45:09.790 --> 01:45:09.800 align:start position:0%
our conference room and I remember
 
01:45:12.390 --> 01:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
saying that to um agriculture once when
 
01:45:13.870 --> 01:45:13.880 align:start position:0%
somebody wanted to use their conference
 
01:45:15.830 --> 01:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
room I said it's not yours it's the
 
01:45:18.629 --> 01:45:18.639 align:start position:0%
states and so generally then where I
 
01:45:20.229 --> 01:45:20.239 align:start position:0%
would like to get eventually is where
 
01:45:21.950 --> 01:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
adjudicative bodies because there are a
 
01:45:23.470 --> 01:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
lot of little if you think about the
 
01:45:26.229 --> 01:45:26.239 align:start position:0%
state these administrative the plrb is
 
01:45:27.790 --> 01:45:27.800 align:start position:0%
one and the Human Rights Commission has
 
01:45:31.109 --> 01:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
hearings and that although they're very
 
01:45:33.709 --> 01:45:33.719 align:start position:0%
independent minded so they're probably
 
01:45:36.910 --> 01:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
probably won't play ball but um housing
 
01:45:38.510 --> 01:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
appeals board it's another thing that's
 
01:45:40.350 --> 01:45:40.360 align:start position:0%
attached to admin services but there are
 
01:45:42.310 --> 01:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
all these little things and nobody uses
 
01:45:44.550 --> 01:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
a conference nobody uses a a hearing
 
01:45:47.470 --> 01:45:47.480 align:start position:0%
room five days a week and so I P for
 
01:45:50.030 --> 01:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
example has two big hearing rooms the
 
01:45:51.830 --> 01:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
one of them they let everybody use PAB
 
01:45:53.790 --> 01:45:53.800 align:start position:0%
actually has hearings there some times
 
01:45:56.070 --> 01:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
um the other one they tend not to let
 
01:45:58.350 --> 01:45:58.360 align:start position:0%
anybody else use cuz it has name plates
 
01:46:00.070 --> 01:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
and they don't want anyone messing with
 
01:46:01.750 --> 01:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
their stuff but I want to get to the
 
01:46:04.470 --> 01:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
point where there's a building that has
 
01:46:07.070 --> 01:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
all the boards of various sizes and has
 
01:46:08.550 --> 01:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
like two rooms that everyone has to
 
01:46:10.589 --> 01:46:10.599 align:start position:0%
reserve and that nobody gets to leave
 
01:46:11.830 --> 01:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
their papers behind have have to take
 
01:46:14.390 --> 01:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
them home at night or put them in their
 
01:46:16.830 --> 01:46:16.840 align:start position:0%
office down the
 
01:46:20.189 --> 01:46:20.199 align:start position:0%
hall yeah and you're you're redoing the
 
01:46:22.350 --> 01:46:22.360 align:start position:0%
building right so everybody's moving out
 
01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:23.430 align:start position:0%
building right so everybody's moving out
soon

01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
soon
 
01:46:27.149 --> 01:46:27.159 align:start position:0%
anyways yes the the annex is under is
 
01:46:29.709 --> 01:46:29.719 align:start position:0%
about to my I'm told the first
 
01:46:32.350 --> 01:46:32.360 align:start position:0%
Sledgehammer swings June 1st um
 
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
contracts done and and people are moving
 
01:46:36.950 --> 01:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
out already from the annex um admin
 
01:46:38.950 --> 01:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
services will have there seven seven
 
01:46:40.189 --> 01:46:40.199 align:start position:0%
different agencies that have people in
 
01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
the building and admin services will
 
01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:44.189 align:start position:0%
the building and admin services will
have

01:46:44.189 --> 01:46:44.199 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:46:49.950 --> 01:46:49.960 align:start position:0%
about 7 108 to 115 people move out and
 
01:46:51.510 --> 01:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
about 30 of us left behind the Secretary
 
01:46:53.709 --> 01:46:53.719 align:start position:0%
of State um this is one of those
 
01:46:55.709 --> 01:46:55.719 align:start position:0%
agencies it's very hard to exercise any
 
01:46:58.270 --> 01:46:58.280 align:start position:0%
control over does not want to leave so
 
01:47:00.390 --> 01:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
they won't um so they're going to say
 
01:47:02.510 --> 01:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
treasury is's going to stay um the
 
01:47:04.830 --> 01:47:04.840 align:start position:0%
governor's office I don't dare touch um
 
01:47:06.990 --> 01:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
so they're they're Suite of offices over
 
01:47:09.149 --> 01:47:09.159 align:start position:0%
there they're staying too I don't that's
 
01:47:10.430 --> 01:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
sort of obnoxious I don't mean I don't
 
01:47:13.470 --> 01:47:13.480 align:start position:0%
dare touch but you know I'm appointed by
 
01:47:15.310 --> 01:47:15.320 align:start position:0%
the governor I'm not going to touch
 
01:47:19.310 --> 01:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
him um 33 people moved to Pillsbury the
 
01:47:21.589 --> 01:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
old van the van McLoud building um old
 
01:47:23.390 --> 01:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
labor in the budget if if you're if
 
01:47:26.470 --> 01:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
you're historically minded um and we're
 
01:47:28.109 --> 01:47:28.119 align:start position:0%
moving 80 of them to the space
 
01:47:30.390 --> 01:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
Corrections abandoned in the main
 
01:47:33.510 --> 01:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
building so we did some painting and
 
01:47:37.669 --> 01:47:37.679 align:start position:0%
stuff and vacuuming but it looks
 
01:47:41.350 --> 01:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
nice so all right so if we pass this
 
01:47:44.109 --> 01:47:44.119 align:start position:0%
bill can we expect in the next
 
01:47:48.310 --> 01:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
budget this agency's cost will go up and
 
01:47:51.149 --> 01:47:51.159 align:start position:0%
yours will go down by a similar amount
 
01:47:53.589 --> 01:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
or not no ours will not go down by it
 
01:47:55.390 --> 01:47:55.400 align:start position:0%
Sim moreon CU right now they're they're
 
01:47:56.910 --> 01:47:56.920 align:start position:0%
I mean they they would be a real
 
01:47:58.350 --> 01:47:58.360 align:start position:0%
independent agency that would get their
 
01:47:59.669 --> 01:47:59.679 align:start position:0%
own office space arguably they're
 
01:48:02.350 --> 01:48:02.360 align:start position:0%
entitled to it now to an extent rather
 
01:48:06.189 --> 01:48:06.199 align:start position:0%
than being um vagabonds just setting up
 
01:48:08.430 --> 01:48:08.440 align:start position:0%
in a conference room ours won't go down
 
01:48:10.270 --> 01:48:10.280 align:start position:0%
simply because the the
 
01:48:12.990 --> 01:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
people uh the people who are helping PAB
 
01:48:15.470 --> 01:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
right now are not dedicated to helping
 
01:48:18.270 --> 01:48:18.280 align:start position:0%
paab they're they're staff who do you
 
01:48:20.030 --> 01:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
know like well let's have Linda do it
 
01:48:22.189 --> 01:48:22.199 align:start position:0%
this week CU she has time and and why
 
01:48:23.589 --> 01:48:23.599 align:start position:0%
don't you do the scheduling I why don't
 
01:48:25.750 --> 01:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
you help with this and those people all
 
01:48:27.990 --> 01:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
have you know jobs where they don't have
 
01:48:29.430 --> 01:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
any free time anyway and you're just
 
01:48:30.950 --> 01:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
hoping that on Wednesday they can do
 
01:48:32.830 --> 01:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
that so you won't you won't really see
 
01:48:34.669 --> 01:48:34.679 align:start position:0%
any any you won't see any reduction in
 
01:48:37.830 --> 01:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
our budget you'll see an increase in
 
01:48:40.629 --> 01:48:40.639 align:start position:0%
theirs can't you reorganize those people
 
01:48:43.709 --> 01:48:43.719 align:start position:0%
slightly so that rather than this week
 
01:48:45.550 --> 01:48:45.560 align:start position:0%
it's this person and this week it's that
 
01:48:48.030 --> 01:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
person it's always this person and the
 
01:48:51.070 --> 01:48:51.080 align:start position:0%
other people feeling we we could but the
 
01:48:54.589 --> 01:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
the the truth is that to support PAB we
 
01:48:58.510 --> 01:48:58.520 align:start position:0%
don't have sufficient staff now and so
 
01:49:01.109 --> 01:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is doing the best we
 
01:49:03.470 --> 01:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
can and so what you're asking everybody
 
01:49:05.470 --> 01:49:05.480 align:start position:0%
is is it's essentially if I walked in
 
01:49:07.350 --> 01:49:07.360 align:start position:0%
and said said you know what you guys
 
01:49:09.550 --> 01:49:09.560 align:start position:0%
have to support the PAB you know the the
 
01:49:12.510 --> 01:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
10 of you 10ish of you however many of
 
01:49:14.270 --> 01:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
you there are and you're like well look
 
01:49:16.149 --> 01:49:16.159 align:start position:0%
I got stuff to do I don't and I said
 
01:49:18.510 --> 01:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
yeah tough cancel a hearing and make
 
01:49:20.470 --> 01:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
time and so what we're doing and I'm not
 
01:49:22.270 --> 01:49:22.280 align:start position:0%
saying that's a bad approach but it's
 
01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
what we're doing now when someone said
 
01:49:27.430 --> 01:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
um I know you don't have enough hours in
 
01:49:29.270 --> 01:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
the day to do your job today I don't
 
01:49:32.030 --> 01:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
care I need five more of your hours in a
 
01:49:34.470 --> 01:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
week and we're just going to everybody's
 
01:49:36.229 --> 01:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
going to do a little so we get there
 
01:49:38.390 --> 01:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
when everybody stops doing that they
 
01:49:39.669 --> 01:49:39.679 align:start position:0%
just have time to do the things that
 
01:49:45.669 --> 01:49:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:50.070 --> 01:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
now other questions no anybody like to
 
01:49:53.709 --> 01:49:53.719 align:start position:0%

01:49:53.719 --> 01:49:55.550 align:start position:0%

03:01:22.150 --> 03:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
the press from the actuary yesterday and
 
03:01:24.269 --> 03:01:24.279 align:start position:0%
sent over to LBA after hours yesterday
 
03:01:26.590 --> 03:01:26.600 align:start position:0%
so it hasn't caught up with the the bill
 
03:01:30.190 --> 03:01:30.200 align:start position:0%
yet um for a fiscal note so essentially
 
03:01:32.750 --> 03:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
what Senate Bill 134 would do is create
 
03:01:36.550 --> 03:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
a new uh level of disability benefit in
 
03:01:40.469 --> 03:01:40.479 align:start position:0%
nhrs for group two members uh violently
 
03:01:43.389 --> 03:01:43.399 align:start position:0%
in attacked and injured on the job um
 
03:01:46.510 --> 03:01:46.520 align:start position:0%
you know by um with a by means of a
 
03:01:49.110 --> 03:01:49.120 align:start position:0%
deadly weapon
 
03:01:51.349 --> 03:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
right now there are two existing types
 
03:01:53.710 --> 03:01:53.720 align:start position:0%
for both member groups job related and
 
03:01:55.510 --> 03:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
non-job related disability there's
 
03:01:57.269 --> 03:01:57.279 align:start position:0%
different eligibility and different
 
03:02:00.670 --> 03:02:00.680 align:start position:0%
benefit uh Provisions for each of those
 
03:02:01.830 --> 03:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
they're they're referred to in the
 
03:02:04.309 --> 03:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
statute as ordinary which is non-job
 
03:02:06.910 --> 03:02:06.920 align:start position:0%
related and accidental uh which is job
 
03:02:08.190 --> 03:02:08.200 align:start position:0%
related it doesn't have to be an
 
03:02:09.550 --> 03:02:09.560 align:start position:0%
accident that's just the way that the
 
03:02:11.990 --> 03:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
statute was constructed so this would
 
03:02:14.469 --> 03:02:14.479 align:start position:0%
create a violent accidental disability
 
03:02:18.269 --> 03:02:18.279 align:start position:0%
benefit um the bill has been ended
 
03:02:20.510 --> 03:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
significantly since it uh was first
 
03:02:22.429 --> 03:02:22.439 align:start position:0%
introduced last year and then we
 
03:02:27.070 --> 03:02:27.080 align:start position:0%
referred to um Senate Edna and NH HRS um
 
03:02:30.070 --> 03:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
worked with Senator birdell and other
 
03:02:32.710 --> 03:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
agencies on the wording uh for the
 
03:02:36.670 --> 03:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
current bill um primarily the the one of
 
03:02:38.030 --> 03:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
the largest sticking points was the
 
03:02:40.030 --> 03:02:40.040 align:start position:0%
eligibility what is the definition of a
 
03:02:43.030 --> 03:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
violent assault and who attest to that
 
03:02:45.990 --> 03:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
so um the department of safety uh
 
03:02:49.309 --> 03:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
graciously agreed to um do that review
 
03:02:51.269 --> 03:02:51.279 align:start position:0%
they already the commissioner already
 
03:02:53.510 --> 03:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
certifies for line of duty death benefit
 
03:02:55.110 --> 03:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
lumpsum payments under a separate
 
03:02:57.870 --> 03:02:57.880 align:start position:0%
statute as well as some other uh pieces
 
03:03:00.190 --> 03:03:00.200 align:start position:0%
so that took away an administrative
 
03:03:01.349 --> 03:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
issue for
 
03:03:04.870 --> 03:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
nhrs um the benefit amount formula is
 
03:03:07.469 --> 03:03:07.479 align:start position:0%
different for this benefit um and again
 
03:03:10.190 --> 03:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
this a a fiscal committee so I'm not
 
03:03:11.790 --> 03:03:11.800 align:start position:0%
really going to go into huge detail here
 
03:03:13.389 --> 03:03:13.399 align:start position:0%
unless anybody has any
 
03:03:16.110 --> 03:03:16.120 align:start position:0%
questions um you know and there are a
 
03:03:18.150 --> 03:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
couple of other changes including the
 
03:03:19.990 --> 03:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
eligibility for a medical subsidy
 
03:03:23.349 --> 03:03:23.359 align:start position:0%
benefit for these disability annuitants
 
03:03:27.670 --> 03:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh Andor eligible family members um so
 
03:03:30.870 --> 03:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's the gist there the fiscal
 
03:03:34.070 --> 03:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
analysis the original bill um it was
 
03:03:36.269 --> 03:03:36.279 align:start position:0%
sufficiently vague enough where the ACT
 
03:03:38.070 --> 03:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
estimated a very high number of
 
03:03:40.190 --> 03:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
accidental disabilities would be
 
03:03:41.630 --> 03:03:41.640 align:start position:0%
qualified under this I think it said
 
03:03:44.389 --> 03:03:44.399 align:start position:0%
like $10 million or something and that's
 
03:03:46.630 --> 03:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
that's not true what the most recent did
 
03:03:49.870 --> 03:03:49.880 align:start position:0%
and and this number is is again we'd
 
03:03:52.110 --> 03:03:52.120 align:start position:0%
have to look on experience and see what
 
03:03:54.550 --> 03:03:54.560 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen and it is sort of
 
03:03:56.630 --> 03:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
scalable in your own mind if you want to
 
03:03:59.550 --> 03:03:59.560 align:start position:0%
look at it and say that that that's too
 
03:04:02.990 --> 03:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
high but they assume that 10% of group
 
03:04:05.349 --> 03:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
two police job related disabilities
 
03:04:07.550 --> 03:04:07.560 align:start position:0%
would fall under this and that may or
 
03:04:09.030 --> 03:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
may not be too high but we had to pick a
 
03:04:13.870 --> 03:04:13.880 align:start position:0%
number as a Baseline and 1% uh for fire
 
03:04:16.750 --> 03:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
members so that's what the cost is shown
 
03:04:19.670 --> 03:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
on the um the last page here pension
 
03:04:21.870 --> 03:04:21.880 align:start position:0%
results State and political subdivision
 
03:04:25.990 --> 03:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
so for instance if if you thought 1% of
 
03:04:28.030 --> 03:04:28.040 align:start position:0%
disability inance we get this instead of
 
03:04:29.870 --> 03:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
40,000 a year for this data would be
 
03:04:33.150 --> 03:04:33.160 align:start position:0%
4,000 an extra contribution so very very
 
03:04:36.670 --> 03:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
linear calculation um to to think about
 
03:04:39.070 --> 03:04:39.080 align:start position:0%
that way
 
03:04:42.190 --> 03:04:42.200 align:start position:0%
um right now there are currently um
 
03:04:42.200 --> 03:04:44.269 align:start position:0%
um right now there are currently um
about

03:04:44.269 --> 03:04:44.279 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:04:47.190 --> 03:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
445 uh accidental uh jab related
 
03:04:49.750 --> 03:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
disability Anu currently receiving a Ben
 
03:04:51.030 --> 03:04:51.040 align:start position:0%
pension from
 
03:04:56.469 --> 03:04:56.479 align:start position:0%
nhrs uh 85 of those have um retired
 
03:04:59.990 --> 03:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
since 71 of 18 which is a the date the
 
03:05:01.630 --> 03:05:01.640 align:start position:0%
look back date in the bill for anybody
 
03:05:03.429 --> 03:05:03.439 align:start position:0%
who's currently retired who thinks they
 
03:05:05.429 --> 03:05:05.439 align:start position:0%
may qualified for this can reapply so
 
03:05:07.790 --> 03:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
that's that's the the entire universe of
 
03:05:10.870 --> 03:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
people who could um there may only be I
 
03:05:12.429 --> 03:05:12.439 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of folks who have
 
03:05:14.110 --> 03:05:14.120 align:start position:0%
testified in previous hearings and they
 
03:05:16.190 --> 03:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
may be the only ones or there may be
 
03:05:19.190 --> 03:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
others unaware of it or outside the loop
 
03:05:20.550 --> 03:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
we have we wouldn't we have to review
 
03:05:22.950 --> 03:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
all the records to see but um that
 
03:05:25.469 --> 03:05:25.479 align:start position:0%
that's how that works um you know our
 
03:05:28.070 --> 03:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
our longest um group two disability
 
03:05:31.870 --> 03:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
benefit Inu it uh was disabled in 1968
 
03:05:33.070 --> 03:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
and we've had
 
03:05:38.349 --> 03:05:38.359 align:start position:0%
a about 150 prior to the year 2000 so um
 
03:05:41.389 --> 03:05:41.399 align:start position:0%
you know it's a small pace of folks who
 
03:05:44.070 --> 03:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
are even just injured on the job in
 
03:05:45.349 --> 03:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
terms of disability grants
 
03:05:47.309 --> 03:05:47.319 align:start position:0%
year-over-year and this this would be
 
03:05:49.030 --> 03:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
expect expected to be significantly
 
03:05:51.710 --> 03:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
rarer occurrence so um with that I'd be
 
03:05:54.389 --> 03:05:54.399 align:start position:0%
glad to answer any questions all right
 
03:05:56.750 --> 03:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
well I definitely appreciate the smaller
 
03:05:58.429 --> 03:05:58.439 align:start position:0%
number but even
 
03:06:02.830 --> 03:06:02.840 align:start position:0%
so you said you pick 10% and so 10% of
 
03:06:05.950 --> 03:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
this 70 number would be about seven and
 
03:06:08.670 --> 03:06:08.680 align:start position:0%
as I understand it only two are known
 
03:06:10.830 --> 03:06:10.840 align:start position:0%
right so after a lot of looking they
 
03:06:13.950 --> 03:06:13.960 align:start position:0%
found two is that correct yeah well this
 
03:06:17.190 --> 03:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
this projects going forward as well so
 
03:06:18.550 --> 03:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
so in other words you know there's
 
03:06:18.560 --> 03:06:19.590 align:start position:0%
so in other words you know there's
there's

03:06:19.590 --> 03:06:19.600 align:start position:0%
there's
 
03:06:23.150 --> 03:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
340 police and 100 fire currently
 
03:06:25.389 --> 03:06:25.399 align:start position:0%
receiving disability so you know 34 out
 
03:06:28.550 --> 03:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
of you know 10% of 340 because you know
 
03:06:30.190 --> 03:06:30.200 align:start position:0%
hopefully this is a rare or
 
03:06:31.750 --> 03:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
non-occurrence going forward but
 
03:06:33.870 --> 03:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
certainly by the nature of the work
 
03:06:36.389 --> 03:06:36.399 align:start position:0%
they're projecting you know future folks
 
03:06:38.269 --> 03:06:38.279 align:start position:0%
qualifying for this benefit as well it's
 
03:06:41.590 --> 03:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
not just analyzing the the Retro piece
 
03:06:46.110 --> 03:06:46.120 align:start position:0%
thank you um other questions for Mr
 
03:06:49.750 --> 03:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
car I'm not seeing
 
03:06:52.830 --> 03:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
anybody all right
 
03:06:56.990 --> 03:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you do um and as I understand
 
03:07:00.990 --> 03:07:01.000 align:start position:0%
it this is not um directly charging
 
03:07:03.670 --> 03:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
General funds for you know it's not like
 
03:07:05.870 --> 03:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
our our other retirement stuff where we
 
03:07:09.190 --> 03:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to sort of prefunding condition
 
03:07:11.469 --> 03:07:11.479 align:start position:0%
right this is really adding to the
 
03:07:11.479 --> 03:07:13.229 align:start position:0%
right this is really adding to the
unfunded

03:07:13.229 --> 03:07:13.239 align:start position:0%
unfunded
 
03:07:18.309 --> 03:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
liability yeah all right um okay
 
03:07:21.030 --> 03:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to talk to us about yes
 
03:07:23.229 --> 03:07:23.239 align:start position:0%
I see a hand in the back there thank you
 
03:07:40.790 --> 03:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:44.590 --> 03:07:44.600 align:start position:0%
you there we go uh my name is Paul Lewis
 
03:07:46.269 --> 03:07:46.279 align:start position:0%
I'm medically retired out we New
 
03:07:48.469 --> 03:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm one of the two officers
 
03:07:50.870 --> 03:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
that we know of that would directly
 
03:07:53.229 --> 03:07:53.239 align:start position:0%
benefit from this bill um just to go off
 
03:07:55.550 --> 03:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
the number of two New Hampshire is a
 
03:07:58.910 --> 03:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
very small law enforcement Community
 
03:08:00.830 --> 03:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
there's three things that can happen if
 
03:08:02.910 --> 03:08:02.920 align:start position:0%
you get a gun pointed at you right you
 
03:08:07.349 --> 03:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
can either pass away you can either very
 
03:08:10.429 --> 03:08:10.439 align:start position:0%
fortunately have uh very minor injuries
 
03:08:12.670 --> 03:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
which then you could return to work
 
03:08:15.110 --> 03:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
which does happen and then in my case
 
03:08:18.309 --> 03:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
and in dh's case the other officer you
 
03:08:20.309 --> 03:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
have to medically retire due to the
 
03:08:22.630 --> 03:08:22.640 align:start position:0%
severity of the injuries when that
 
03:08:24.990 --> 03:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
happens uh we are a community that looks
 
03:08:27.030 --> 03:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
out for each other anytime there's a big
 
03:08:30.309 --> 03:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
news story we're right on it Dan reaches
 
03:08:32.630 --> 03:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
out to me and I reach out to the next
 
03:08:34.910 --> 03:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
person there's been no one after me in
 
03:08:37.309 --> 03:08:37.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that has had to medically
 
03:08:39.910 --> 03:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
retire after a violent injury there has
 
03:08:41.389 --> 03:08:41.399 align:start position:0%
been in other states and I've reached
 
03:08:43.110 --> 03:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
out to the officers in the other states
 
03:08:46.190 --> 03:08:46.200 align:start position:0%
but uh not yet in New Hampshire for me
 
03:08:48.550 --> 03:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
uh about this bill this is is very
 
03:08:51.269 --> 03:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
important to me I was working in where
 
03:08:54.070 --> 03:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
which even with um a college degree I
 
03:08:57.309 --> 03:08:57.319 align:start position:0%
was making 2150 an hour when I medically
 
03:09:01.309 --> 03:09:01.319 align:start position:0%
retired my pension went to 29 and with
 
03:09:03.030 --> 03:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
like the raise of inflation everywhere
 
03:09:05.269 --> 03:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
it just unsustainable and on top of that
 
03:09:08.630 --> 03:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
I'm capped at making 19,000 per year so
 
03:09:11.870 --> 03:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
it just it's a very uh small number that
 
03:09:14.429 --> 03:09:14.439 align:start position:0%
I'm forced to to live off of right now
 
03:09:16.870 --> 03:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
and uh I don't get health insurance I
 
03:09:18.590 --> 03:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
went in front of the town of wear asking
 
03:09:20.469 --> 03:09:20.479 align:start position:0%
for help with that and they said it's
 
03:09:23.030 --> 03:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
too expensive go to the marketplace so
 
03:09:26.830 --> 03:09:26.840 align:start position:0%
now $300 a month from my 2400 that I'm
 
03:09:29.229 --> 03:09:29.239 align:start position:0%
making is coming out of that and the
 
03:09:30.790 --> 03:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
number just keeps dwindling and it's
 
03:09:33.550 --> 03:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
it's very hard for me right now so with
 
03:09:35.630 --> 03:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
this bill it would it would help me and
 
03:09:37.510 --> 03:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
it would help a lot of uh future
 
03:09:39.830 --> 03:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
officers if it were to happen to them
 
03:09:42.389 --> 03:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
that are in a similar circumstance but
 
03:09:44.429 --> 03:09:44.439 align:start position:0%
in a 100 Years of New Hampshire law
 
03:09:46.830 --> 03:09:46.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement it's two that we certainly
 
03:09:49.830 --> 03:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
know of so it it is rare but it will
 
03:09:51.670 --> 03:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
hugely impact those those people that it
 
03:09:54.550 --> 03:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
do help so we're hoping that uh you
 
03:09:56.229 --> 03:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
understand how helpful this bill can be
 
03:09:59.030 --> 03:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
and I hope that you can think about
 
03:09:59.040 --> 03:10:00.510 align:start position:0%
and I hope that you can think about
passing

03:10:00.510 --> 03:10:00.520 align:start position:0%
passing
 
03:10:04.229 --> 03:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
it thank you questions for officer
 
03:10:08.309 --> 03:10:08.319 align:start position:0%
leis yeah I'll I'll just ask one um if
 
03:10:11.750 --> 03:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
it's not too personal um looking at you
 
03:10:14.309 --> 03:10:14.319 align:start position:0%
myself I would say you look like a
 
03:10:17.750 --> 03:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
person who could work are you is it is
 
03:10:20.070 --> 03:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
it that serious what happened yeah so I
 
03:10:22.550 --> 03:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
was hit uh with two bullets in my
 
03:10:25.990 --> 03:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
dominant arm and after the nerve injury
 
03:10:28.309 --> 03:10:28.319 align:start position:0%
I I've had five surgeries to try to fix
 
03:10:31.469 --> 03:10:31.479 align:start position:0%
it my dominant arm is at about 5 to 10%
 
03:10:35.630 --> 03:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
use I can't write without assistance and
 
03:10:37.830 --> 03:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
it's been uh four and a half years for
 
03:10:40.389 --> 03:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
me five surgeries and every time I go
 
03:10:43.710 --> 03:10:43.720 align:start position:0%
forward and in my progression physically
 
03:10:45.670 --> 03:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
something happens like in fact two years
 
03:10:47.710 --> 03:10:47.720 align:start position:0%
ago I was throwing a ball with friends
 
03:10:50.030 --> 03:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
and my bone re-broke where I took the
 
03:10:52.389 --> 03:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
bullet and then I went into my fifth
 
03:10:54.550 --> 03:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
surgery and they found a staff infection
 
03:10:58.190 --> 03:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
so for that time I needed six weeks of a
 
03:11:01.469 --> 03:11:01.479 align:start position:0%
um an IV on top of an arm that just had
 
03:11:03.870 --> 03:11:03.880 align:start position:0%
surgery and it just things keep
 
03:11:05.070 --> 03:11:05.080 align:start position:0%
happening and and that's like
 
03:11:07.710 --> 03:11:07.720 align:start position:0%
particularly why this is also important
 
03:11:10.710 --> 03:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
Dan dhy he's had 19 surgeries in the 10
 
03:11:15.070 --> 03:11:15.080 align:start position:0%
years so the we want a a separate tear
 
03:11:18.790 --> 03:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
because these are lifelong injuries that
 
03:11:21.910 --> 03:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
keep having setbacks for us and we wish
 
03:11:24.190 --> 03:11:24.200 align:start position:0%
it wasn't that way but due to the
 
03:11:25.510 --> 03:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
severity it's just it's just what
 
03:11:28.030 --> 03:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
happens when you're violently injured
 
03:11:31.030 --> 03:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions no thank you
 
03:11:33.429 --> 03:11:33.439 align:start position:0%
very much for coming thank you so would
 
03:11:34.790 --> 03:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
someone like to make a motion

representative Sweeny sh you've ought to
 
03:11:41.429 --> 03:11:41.439 align:start position:0%

okay it's now 1:20 p.m. and we're here
 
03:20:47.389 --> 03:20:47.399 align:start position:0%
to talk about Senate Bill 476
 
03:20:56.790 --> 03:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:59.389 --> 03:20:59.399 align:start position:0%
commissioner thanks for coming thank you
 
03:21:00.830 --> 03:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon for the record my name
 
03:21:02.150 --> 03:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
is Helen Hanks I'm the commissioner of
 
03:21:03.830 --> 03:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
the Department of Corrections I thank
 
03:21:05.189 --> 03:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity to talk about
 
03:21:07.710 --> 03:21:07.720 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 476 the Department of
 
03:21:10.429 --> 03:21:10.439 align:start position:0%
Corrections has been mindful in all that
 
03:21:12.389 --> 03:21:12.399 align:start position:0%
we have done in asking for capital
 
03:21:15.030 --> 03:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
budget infrastructure but we really at a
 
03:21:17.070 --> 03:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
point uh on behalf of the state
 
03:21:18.349 --> 03:21:18.359 align:start position:0%
where the New Hampshire state prison for
 
03:21:20.790 --> 03:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
men needs a replacement and through my
 
03:21:22.469 --> 03:21:22.479 align:start position:0%
experience in different capacities
 
03:21:23.990 --> 03:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
within the department including the New
 
03:21:25.229 --> 03:21:25.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire correctional facility for
 
03:21:28.710 --> 03:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
women um waiting for litigation to be
 
03:21:30.790 --> 03:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
proactive to be involved to move a
 
03:21:32.750 --> 03:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
project forward is not the way to move
 
03:21:35.110 --> 03:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
forward and when we asked during the
 
03:21:37.830 --> 03:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
budget phase for the initial costs to do
 
03:21:39.950 --> 03:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
the groundwork so that we really know
 
03:21:42.990 --> 03:21:43.000 align:start position:0%
firmly how much a replacement facility
 
03:21:45.030 --> 03:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
um would cost the state is really the
 
03:21:47.630 --> 03:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
right place to begin and the $10 million
 
03:21:49.910 --> 03:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
which we appreciate um is really not
 
03:21:52.550 --> 03:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
enough to do more than the geologicals
 
03:21:55.790 --> 03:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
and we need to um and we're asking for
 
03:21:58.950 --> 03:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
the um autop pass on Senate Bill 476 to
 
03:22:00.830 --> 03:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
get the rest of the initial industry
 
03:22:03.189 --> 03:22:03.199 align:start position:0%
standard costs to do the bid speec
 
03:22:05.269 --> 03:22:05.279 align:start position:0%
documents to do the Staffing analysis do
 
03:22:07.550 --> 03:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
the population analysis all of the front
 
03:22:10.269 --> 03:22:10.279 align:start position:0%
work necessary to lean into this project
 
03:22:12.950 --> 03:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
in a way that's proactive uh I know the
 
03:22:14.469 --> 03:22:14.479 align:start position:0%
number uh that we're currently
 
03:22:16.269 --> 03:22:16.279 align:start position:0%
forecasting for a replacement facility
 
03:22:19.870 --> 03:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
is is a large number um I respect that
 
03:22:21.910 --> 03:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
but even if you just turned to slide
 
03:22:24.590 --> 03:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
five on the informational I sent out
 
03:22:27.070 --> 03:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
every time I turn a corner even this
 
03:22:29.670 --> 03:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
last uh nor Easter we all experienced in
 
03:22:32.150 --> 03:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
April the electrician that is familiar
 
03:22:33.990 --> 03:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
with our infrastructure at the N state
 
03:22:36.030 --> 03:22:36.040 align:start position:0%
prison for men literally said you need
 
03:22:38.189 --> 03:22:38.199 align:start position:0%
to replace the complete electrical
 
03:22:40.110 --> 03:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
infrastructure at this institution the
 
03:22:42.750 --> 03:22:42.760 align:start position:0%
linear feet cost of that is not worth
 
03:22:44.870 --> 03:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
investing in investing in a replacement
 
03:22:47.309 --> 03:22:47.319 align:start position:0%
facility that is proactive Ive for the
 
03:22:49.229 --> 03:22:49.239 align:start position:0%
air quality of the staff that work in
 
03:22:52.389 --> 03:22:52.399 align:start position:0%
that building to promote retention um
 
03:22:54.550 --> 03:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
and create a healthier environment when
 
03:22:56.070 --> 03:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
the research already affirms that
 
03:22:57.590 --> 03:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
working at a correctional facility is
 
03:23:00.269 --> 03:23:00.279 align:start position:0%
dangerous it is stressful uh we can do
 
03:23:01.910 --> 03:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
better and then in addition to
 
03:23:03.630 --> 03:23:03.640 align:start position:0%
continuing to improve the environment
 
03:23:05.389 --> 03:23:05.399 align:start position:0%
because our mission is Rehabilitation
 
03:23:07.429 --> 03:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
for those that are incarcerated there
 
03:23:09.189 --> 03:23:09.199 align:start position:0%
reception and diagnostic was built in
 
03:23:11.349 --> 03:23:11.359 align:start position:0%
the 1800s we are not supposed to be
 
03:23:13.229 --> 03:23:13.239 align:start position:0%
functioning in that institution anymore
 
03:23:15.590 --> 03:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
but we have no choice it is what we have
 
03:23:17.510 --> 03:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
I have a plumbing ISS I'm not sure I
 
03:23:18.990 --> 03:23:19.000 align:start position:0%
have a plumber who actually knows how to
 
03:23:20.790 --> 03:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
work on that plumbing I've not
 
03:23:23.670 --> 03:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
identified one um and the list goes on
 
03:23:25.189 --> 03:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
but in the next five years this is what
 
03:23:26.910 --> 03:23:26.920 align:start position:0%
I can tell you today in the next 10
 
03:23:29.110 --> 03:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
years there's about $400 million of
 
03:23:30.910 --> 03:23:30.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure investment for us to
 
03:23:33.349 --> 03:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
continue to function in that space it is
 
03:23:35.830 --> 03:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
a better investment to be proactive to
 
03:23:38.429 --> 03:23:38.439 align:start position:0%
pass Senate Bill 476 and start working
 
03:23:40.030 --> 03:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
toward understanding what a replacement
 
03:23:42.150 --> 03:23:42.160 align:start position:0%
facility would cost and we do have land
 
03:23:43.349 --> 03:23:43.359 align:start position:0%
behind the New Hampshire correctional
 
03:23:45.870 --> 03:23:45.880 align:start position:0%
facility for women that we're exploring
 
03:23:47.590 --> 03:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
and having done the work at the New
 
03:23:48.830 --> 03:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire correctional facility for
 
03:23:50.870 --> 03:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
women I know it's hard rock but I know
 
03:23:52.550 --> 03:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
we actually saved half a million dollars
 
03:23:54.510 --> 03:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
making our own crushing plant and it's a
 
03:23:56.710 --> 03:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
firm foundation and we can move forward
 
03:23:58.590 --> 03:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
so with that I do have members uh who
 
03:24:00.510 --> 03:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
have worked uh several years at the New
 
03:24:02.309 --> 03:24:02.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state prison for men from my
 
03:24:03.710 --> 03:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
security force and who are leading that
 
03:24:05.070 --> 03:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
force that are happy to talk about
 
03:24:07.269 --> 03:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
operations if that um is an inquiry that
 
03:24:09.030 --> 03:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
comes up from the committee in addition
 
03:24:11.950 --> 03:24:11.960 align:start position:0%
to my Logistics and uh Finance staff so
 
03:24:13.870 --> 03:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
with that I certainly entertain
 
03:24:15.870 --> 03:24:15.880 align:start position:0%
questions thank you commissioner
 
03:24:17.710 --> 03:24:17.720 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
03:24:17.720 --> 03:24:19.229 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
representative

03:24:19.229 --> 03:24:19.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:24:22.030 --> 03:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
wer I'm delighted that you found a good
 
03:24:23.750 --> 03:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
location I remember what we went through
 
03:24:25.750 --> 03:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
with the women's prison and that was a
 
03:24:29.030 --> 03:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
lot of waste of time and effort and I'm
 
03:24:33.030 --> 03:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
wondering with the um Berlin
 
03:24:35.429 --> 03:24:35.439 align:start position:0%
prison are we going to have any savings
 
03:24:37.670 --> 03:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
because we've had a design done and
 
03:24:39.670 --> 03:24:39.680 align:start position:0%
we've paid money for it and if it works
 
03:24:43.429 --> 03:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
can we reproduce that or parts of it
 
03:24:46.630 --> 03:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
without paying it for a whole new design
 
03:24:48.309 --> 03:24:48.319 align:start position:0%
representative wer I really respect your
 
03:24:50.429 --> 03:24:50.439 align:start position:0%
question and I'm I'm actually um working
 
03:24:52.150 --> 03:24:52.160 align:start position:0%
with Partners outside of the state for
 
03:24:53.830 --> 03:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
example the commissioner Montana is
 
03:24:56.030 --> 03:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
building a similar sized institution and
 
03:24:57.429 --> 03:24:57.439 align:start position:0%
if there's some opportunities to
 
03:24:58.349 --> 03:24:58.359 align:start position:0%
understand in
 
03:25:01.990 --> 03:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
2024 what uh we can learn from this uh
 
03:25:04.309 --> 03:25:04.319 align:start position:0%
investment in Senate Bill 476 will help
 
03:25:06.950 --> 03:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
us get there um reminding everyone it
 
03:25:08.950 --> 03:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
was built in 2000 and we've learned a
 
03:25:10.189 --> 03:25:10.199 align:start position:0%
lot more but again there are
 
03:25:12.710 --> 03:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
opportunities in every ter we make but
 
03:25:14.790 --> 03:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
we would need to invest in this first
 
03:25:18.429 --> 03:25:18.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:20.349 --> 03:25:20.359 align:start position:0%
other questions representative
 
03:25:23.710 --> 03:25:23.720 align:start position:0%
evil um uh thanks for coming having
 
03:25:27.630 --> 03:25:27.640 align:start position:0%
visited the facility I several years ago
 
03:25:30.429 --> 03:25:30.439 align:start position:0%
it was also uh it was daunting to see
 
03:25:32.389 --> 03:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
how much work needed to be done at that
 
03:25:37.510 --> 03:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
time um how long would uh the
 
03:25:40.950 --> 03:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
engineering that we would um be
 
03:25:44.910 --> 03:25:44.920 align:start position:0%
considering funding take and how long
 
03:25:47.550 --> 03:25:47.560 align:start position:0%
would it be good for because uh
 
03:25:52.429 --> 03:25:52.439 align:start position:0%
budgeting for $500 million is a
 
03:25:55.389 --> 03:25:55.399 align:start position:0%
lot thank you uh representative the it's
 
03:25:57.670 --> 03:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
a good question we already have a
 
03:26:00.830 --> 03:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
pending U proposed contract for the $10
 
03:26:02.590 --> 03:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
million that we're waiting to bring
 
03:26:04.630 --> 03:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
before governor and Council the timing
 
03:26:06.550 --> 03:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
of this yes but afford US an opportunity
 
03:26:09.590 --> 03:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
to move that more fluidly we would
 
03:26:12.309 --> 03:26:12.319 align:start position:0%
expect it would take at least a year of
 
03:26:14.670 --> 03:26:14.680 align:start position:0%
of this resource to start moving toward
 
03:26:17.870 --> 03:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
a final proposal but uh I would suspect
 
03:26:20.630 --> 03:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
no longer than 2 years uh understanding
 
03:26:22.830 --> 03:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
the timeline and the experience that the
 
03:26:24.309 --> 03:26:24.319 align:start position:0%
agency already has in building the
 
03:26:31.110 --> 03:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:35.750 --> 03:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
women okay so you said you identified a
 
03:26:38.990 --> 03:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
prison in was it Minnesota that is
 
03:26:41.469 --> 03:26:41.479 align:start position:0%
similar how many how many inmates will
 
03:26:44.269 --> 03:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
this prison have the facility that's
 
03:26:46.790 --> 03:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
being built is in the state of Montana
 
03:26:49.510 --> 03:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
it's approximately being built for 1400
 
03:26:53.030 --> 03:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh people we have about uh 1100 people
 
03:26:55.030 --> 03:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
at the Hampshire state prison for men
 
03:26:57.070 --> 03:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
the investment uh contemplated in Senate
 
03:27:00.269 --> 03:27:00.279 align:start position:0%
Bill 476 includes forecasting population
 
03:27:02.349 --> 03:27:02.359 align:start position:0%
population boasts on past experience and
 
03:27:04.030 --> 03:27:04.040 align:start position:0%
also what the legislature might pass
 
03:27:06.469 --> 03:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
towards sentencing that would affect uh
 
03:27:08.469 --> 03:27:08.479 align:start position:0%
population rates including the
 
03:27:11.110 --> 03:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
classification of those individuals and
 
03:27:13.110 --> 03:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
talking with the commissioner of Montana
 
03:27:14.950 --> 03:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
that institution doesn't have all five
 
03:27:18.070 --> 03:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
levels of classification has uh three so
 
03:27:20.590 --> 03:27:20.600 align:start position:0%
we are engaged in uh confidential
 
03:27:22.429 --> 03:27:22.439 align:start position:0%
conversations at this point because it's
 
03:27:25.150 --> 03:27:25.160 align:start position:0%
about his uh design of the interior of
 
03:27:27.590 --> 03:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
the facility uh but there are some
 
03:27:29.229 --> 03:27:29.239 align:start position:0%
definite opportunities to partner with
 
03:27:32.389 --> 03:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
people already uh doing this across the
 
03:27:36.389 --> 03:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
country because this 40 million is um
 
03:27:38.550 --> 03:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
strictly for creating
 
03:27:42.229 --> 03:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
documents um and so I'm I'm getting
 
03:27:46.950 --> 03:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
sticker shock on on that number um
 
03:27:50.309 --> 03:27:50.319 align:start position:0%
and and it seems like
 
03:27:54.110 --> 03:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
repurposing some existing uh
 
03:27:56.429 --> 03:27:56.439 align:start position:0%
design I mean there's there's prisons
 
03:27:58.309 --> 03:27:58.319 align:start position:0%
all over the country besides the one you
 
03:28:00.349 --> 03:28:00.359 align:start position:0%
just mentioned
 
03:28:03.910 --> 03:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
um it's got to be much much cheaper than
 
03:28:07.469 --> 03:28:07.479 align:start position:0%
that so would it make sense even if we
 
03:28:11.030 --> 03:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
allocate this 40 million to not be so
 
03:28:14.550 --> 03:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
specific that we only spend this on
 
03:28:18.950 --> 03:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
documents and not on actual
 
03:28:20.830 --> 03:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
construction representative McGuire
 
03:28:22.269 --> 03:28:22.279 align:start position:0%
that's a reasonable question if there's
 
03:28:26.630 --> 03:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to again and we will work
 
03:28:28.870 --> 03:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
toward that reduce this expenditure to
 
03:28:31.229 --> 03:28:31.239 align:start position:0%
the only Point necessary and have any of
 
03:28:32.630 --> 03:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
those funds then go toward the
 
03:28:34.830 --> 03:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
construction then we would completely be
 
03:28:39.389 --> 03:28:39.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:43.710 --> 03:28:43.720 align:start position:0%
that representative evil um how many
 
03:28:45.670 --> 03:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
contractors in the United States
 
03:28:48.189 --> 03:28:48.199 align:start position:0%
actually build prisons and are there
 
03:28:51.070 --> 03:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
services in
 
03:28:54.229 --> 03:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
demand there are at least um four that I
 
03:28:56.870 --> 03:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
know are commonly contracted with um
 
03:28:58.550 --> 03:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
again the carefulness and and me not
 
03:29:00.110 --> 03:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
talking too deeply about what's going on
 
03:29:02.070 --> 03:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
in Montana is we have a competitive
 
03:29:04.229 --> 03:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
bidding process and we would have to as
 
03:29:05.670 --> 03:29:05.680 align:start position:0%
a state go through that competitive
 
03:29:07.670 --> 03:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
bidding process but I as the
 
03:29:08.910 --> 03:29:08.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner Department of Corrections
 
03:29:10.429 --> 03:29:10.439 align:start position:0%
and mindful that I have opportunities to
 
03:29:11.910 --> 03:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
talk to people who are already engaged
 
03:29:14.070 --> 03:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
in this people are not building prisons
 
03:29:16.349 --> 03:29:16.359 align:start position:0%
every day this just happened to be a un
 
03:29:17.550 --> 03:29:17.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk about what's
 
03:29:20.309 --> 03:29:20.319 align:start position:0%
happening in that state um I'm obviously
 
03:29:21.710 --> 03:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
keenly aware and watching what's
 
03:29:24.070 --> 03:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
happening in Alabama uh they look like
 
03:29:27.550 --> 03:29:27.560 align:start position:0%
we looked in 1976 and uh I expect to see
 
03:29:29.070 --> 03:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of different things happen in that
 
03:29:31.269 --> 03:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
state and they're not meeting their
 
03:29:33.269 --> 03:29:33.279 align:start position:0%
allegedly according to the media health
 
03:29:37.189 --> 03:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
care and other needs um so again I
 
03:29:38.429 --> 03:29:38.439 align:start position:0%
understand who's out there but we have
 
03:29:39.630 --> 03:29:39.640 align:start position:0%
to follow the competitive bidding
 
03:29:44.510 --> 03:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:48.110 --> 03:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
state uh yes representative Griffin uh
 
03:29:50.710 --> 03:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank
 
03:29:56.030 --> 03:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
you um I too am in sticker Shar that it
 
03:30:00.630 --> 03:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
cost $40 million just basically for
 
03:30:03.269 --> 03:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
plans and
 
03:30:06.630 --> 03:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
um it really concerns me that it can't
 
03:30:10.550 --> 03:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
be done for less it's hard to
 
03:30:13.670 --> 03:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
believe uh buildings a I know a prison
 
03:30:16.630 --> 03:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
is a different building but buildings
 
03:30:19.389 --> 03:30:19.399 align:start position:0%
are built all the time complex buildings
 
03:30:23.349 --> 03:30:23.359 align:start position:0%
and $40 million will be a lot of
 
03:30:26.189 --> 03:30:26.199 align:start position:0%
building so I don't I don't know whether
 
03:30:28.630 --> 03:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
they have any comment to that or not
 
03:30:30.590 --> 03:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin I completely
 
03:30:32.830 --> 03:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate your comment I grew up in a
 
03:30:36.349 --> 03:30:36.359 align:start position:0%
construction family um we pour concrete
 
03:30:39.189 --> 03:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
those my parents did to feed our Feed Us
 
03:30:42.469 --> 03:30:42.479 align:start position:0%
on a farm and construction and this this
 
03:30:45.429 --> 03:30:45.439 align:start position:0%
is a high number but the cost of uh
 
03:30:47.469 --> 03:30:47.479 align:start position:0%
Correctional facility at this point
 
03:30:49.269 --> 03:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
really working with our partners at the
 
03:30:51.030 --> 03:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Public Works they're
 
03:30:53.590 --> 03:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
estimating as high as $1,000 per square
 
03:30:56.150 --> 03:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
foot um I we don't control the
 
03:30:57.750 --> 03:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
construction Market when it comes to
 
03:31:00.269 --> 03:31:00.279 align:start position:0%
Corrections um but I am completely
 
03:31:01.950 --> 03:31:01.960 align:start position:0%
mindful of the work that I did on behalf
 
03:31:03.670 --> 03:31:03.680 align:start position:0%
of the state in getting the New
 
03:31:05.269 --> 03:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Correctional Facility women's
 
03:31:07.750 --> 03:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
project um at a lower number I know we
 
03:31:09.510 --> 03:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
had to come back and ask for more but
 
03:31:11.590 --> 03:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
when I started um intervening in that
 
03:31:13.910 --> 03:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
project they wanted even more um so
 
03:31:15.150 --> 03:31:15.160 align:start position:0%
designing for efficiency and
 
03:31:17.070 --> 03:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility is our charge on behalf
 
03:31:18.550 --> 03:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
of of what you provide us the
 
03:31:20.630 --> 03:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do so um we're not
 
03:31:22.990 --> 03:31:23.000 align:start position:0%
building a 2x4 construction I know you
 
03:31:25.590 --> 03:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate that comment it is cement it
 
03:31:28.150 --> 03:31:28.160 align:start position:0%
is uh it is all of those things that
 
03:31:31.070 --> 03:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately cost more in addition to
 
03:31:33.229 --> 03:31:33.239 align:start position:0%
uh working on a correctional facility
 
03:31:35.630 --> 03:31:35.640 align:start position:0%
and having that expertise it's a it's a
 
03:31:38.349 --> 03:31:38.359 align:start position:0%
high number um and is just the number
 
03:31:42.070 --> 03:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:45.229 --> 03:31:45.239 align:start position:0%
market all right so you said $1,000 a
 
03:31:46.429 --> 03:31:46.439 align:start position:0%
square foot
 
03:31:53.269 --> 03:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
but um so it's 500 square ft per inmate
 
03:31:56.429 --> 03:31:56.439 align:start position:0%
is that right representative Maguire I
 
03:31:58.269 --> 03:31:58.279 align:start position:0%
couldn't just do here's your square feet
 
03:31:59.950 --> 03:31:59.960 align:start position:0%
for the total allocation because there
 
03:32:02.750 --> 03:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
are core infrastructure um areas such as
 
03:32:05.150 --> 03:32:05.160 align:start position:0%
our dining kitchen service our health
 
03:32:07.750 --> 03:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
services area those areas have different
 
03:32:09.429 --> 03:32:09.439 align:start position:0%
square foot requirements based on the
 
03:32:11.910 --> 03:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
operation it's not a one for one square
 
03:32:13.790 --> 03:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
foot for what we have now and what we
 
03:32:16.590 --> 03:32:16.600 align:start position:0%
would be looking at in the future
 
03:32:18.309 --> 03:32:18.319 align:start position:0%
do you know how many square feet this
 
03:32:27.550 --> 03:32:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:29.910 --> 03:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
do I would not be recommending we
 
03:32:31.550 --> 03:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
replicate the current square footage of
 
03:32:33.070 --> 03:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
the Hampshire state prison for men given
 
03:32:35.229 --> 03:32:35.239 align:start position:0%
it's a campus campus style layout so
 
03:32:37.710 --> 03:32:37.720 align:start position:0%
again I'm not sure it's a number that
 
03:32:39.750 --> 03:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
will help us in looking at the future
 
03:32:41.110 --> 03:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
other than affirming for you we've
 
03:32:42.389 --> 03:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
worked with the Department of Public
 
03:32:44.990 --> 03:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
Works I mean the numbers we're talking
 
03:32:47.510 --> 03:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
about here is is half a million dollar
 
03:32:47.520 --> 03:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
about here is is half a million dollar
per

03:32:47.840 --> 03:32:47.850 align:start position:0%
per
 
03:32:47.850 --> 03:32:49.269 align:start position:0%
per
[Music]

03:32:49.269 --> 03:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:32:52.389 --> 03:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
inmate to build this prison what what's
 
03:32:54.229 --> 03:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
the ongoing cost what what does your
 
03:32:58.389 --> 03:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
whole department spend per inmate uh for
 
03:33:01.030 --> 03:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
operations for operations my last
 
03:33:03.990 --> 03:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
estimate was around 52,000 per
 
03:33:08.550 --> 03:33:08.560 align:start position:0%
person can you talk louder
 
03:33:13.910 --> 03:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:16.750 --> 03:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
okay h
 
03:33:18.189 --> 03:33:18.199 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:33:18.199 --> 03:33:19.710 align:start position:0%
and so
probably

03:33:19.710 --> 03:33:19.720 align:start position:0%
probably
 
03:33:24.710 --> 03:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
um if we borrow um
 
03:33:26.830 --> 03:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
500,000 this says we're going to be
 
03:33:29.030 --> 03:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
paying back over 20
 
03:33:30.890 --> 03:33:30.900 align:start position:0%
years uh
 
03:33:30.900 --> 03:33:33.389 align:start position:0%
years uh
[Music]

03:33:33.389 --> 03:33:33.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:33:37.630 --> 03:33:37.640 align:start position:0%
750,000 um so we're going to pay roughly
 
03:33:40.590 --> 03:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
another 37 so an inmates going to cost
 
03:33:44.469 --> 03:33:44.479 align:start position:0%
us $100,000 a year including the
 
03:33:48.630 --> 03:33:48.640 align:start position:0%
building that's pretty incredible all
 
03:33:51.590 --> 03:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
right cuz I had always thought you said
 
03:33:53.750 --> 03:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
72,000 but I always thought it was much
 
03:33:57.510 --> 03:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
less than that more like 40 no uh I
 
03:33:59.429 --> 03:33:59.439 align:start position:0%
believe the salary adjustments that
 
03:34:00.990 --> 03:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
occurred have caused that number to
 
03:34:04.550 --> 03:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
increase so yes uh the cost of Staff
 
03:34:07.229 --> 03:34:07.239 align:start position:0%
causes that operational cost to go up I
 
03:34:11.030 --> 03:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
see how is hiring going lately hiring is
 
03:34:12.349 --> 03:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
much better than it was post the
 
03:34:14.550 --> 03:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
pandemic we are holding our own but we
 
03:34:16.229 --> 03:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
are making up for those those major
 
03:34:18.910 --> 03:34:18.920 align:start position:0%
losses in 2022 but I appreciate you
 
03:34:21.269 --> 03:34:21.279 align:start position:0%
asking um and as an aside it's
 
03:34:22.590 --> 03:34:22.600 align:start position:0%
corrections officer and Employee
 
03:34:24.269 --> 03:34:24.279 align:start position:0%
Appreciation week so if you see somebody
 
03:34:25.710 --> 03:34:25.720 align:start position:0%
in Corrections please thank them for
 
03:34:30.510 --> 03:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:33.550 --> 03:34:33.560 align:start position:0%
nationally yes representative Griffin
 
03:34:34.990 --> 03:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
03:34:39.269 --> 03:34:39.279 align:start position:0%
chair um I know the women's prison is is
 
03:34:42.790 --> 03:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh it was a design that was costly in
 
03:34:47.110 --> 03:34:47.120 align:start position:0%
terms of Staff would you agree with that
 
03:34:48.269 --> 03:34:48.279 align:start position:0%
uh representative Griffin I think it
 
03:34:50.150 --> 03:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
would be fair to say any transition from
 
03:34:52.309 --> 03:34:52.319 align:start position:0%
gof toown to a larger facility was going
 
03:34:55.150 --> 03:34:55.160 align:start position:0%
to increase staff uh but we've operated
 
03:34:57.429 --> 03:34:57.439 align:start position:0%
in it now with less St staff than we
 
03:34:58.550 --> 03:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
thought we were going to need in the
 
03:35:01.070 --> 03:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
beginning I know I know when that was
 
03:35:04.830 --> 03:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
originally built uh uh everyone looked
 
03:35:08.229 --> 03:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
at the design and said you know that's
 
03:35:10.910 --> 03:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
going to be very staff
 
03:35:16.309 --> 03:35:16.319 align:start position:0%
intensive uh is the um the the model
 
03:35:19.510 --> 03:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
Montana model is are there actual plans
 
03:35:22.309 --> 03:35:22.319 align:start position:0%
at this point for that prison my
 
03:35:23.469 --> 03:35:23.479 align:start position:0%
understanding the answer to that is yes
 
03:35:25.750 --> 03:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
I've not uh been off I've not been able
 
03:35:27.750 --> 03:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
to look at them I am anxious to see if I
 
03:35:29.030 --> 03:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
can have an opportunity to look so you
 
03:35:31.750 --> 03:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't have an opinion of whether
 
03:35:34.670 --> 03:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
it's efficient in terms of Staff or not
 
03:35:36.030 --> 03:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
no but representative Griffin what I
 
03:35:37.750 --> 03:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
would say to you any design in the
 
03:35:39.510 --> 03:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
future would be cognizant of creating
 
03:35:42.070 --> 03:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
Staffing efficiency and I think a very
 
03:35:43.510 --> 03:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate leading heavily on
 
03:35:46.269 --> 03:35:46.279 align:start position:0%
technology as a resource and really
 
03:35:48.189 --> 03:35:48.199 align:start position:0%
investing in our current infrastructure
 
03:35:49.670 --> 03:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do some of that that
 
03:35:51.750 --> 03:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
would be transferable to any new
 
03:35:53.630 --> 03:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
replacement facility as far as
 
03:35:56.389 --> 03:35:56.399 align:start position:0%
implementing technology thank you
 
03:35:58.550 --> 03:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
thank thank you uh all right
 
03:36:00.550 --> 03:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
Representative cambrell no thank you Mr
 
03:36:03.389 --> 03:36:03.399 align:start position:0%
chair um do you recall what the cost was
 
03:36:06.229 --> 03:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
for the design of the woman's
 
03:36:08.950 --> 03:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
prison so that was roughly 10% of
 
03:36:11.950 --> 03:36:11.960 align:start position:0%
approximately $ 52 million back uh when
 
03:36:16.030 --> 03:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
that project started in the uh 200
 
03:36:17.550 --> 03:36:17.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to guess on that one but
 
03:36:25.229 --> 03:36:25.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:29.189 --> 03:36:29.199 align:start position:0%
million is there no follow up okay
 
03:36:33.309 --> 03:36:33.319 align:start position:0%
um am I right that uh the co operational
 
03:36:37.030 --> 03:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
cost of Berlin per inmate is much less
 
03:36:37.040 --> 03:36:40.830 align:start position:0%
cost of Berlin per inmate is much less
than

03:36:40.830 --> 03:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:43.110 --> 03:36:43.120 align:start position:0%
conquer I don't have a breakout of
 
03:36:46.110 --> 03:36:46.120 align:start position:0%
operational cost by facility
 
03:36:48.950 --> 03:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
so I visited both and and my
 
03:36:51.389 --> 03:36:51.399 align:start position:0%
understanding is one
 
03:36:54.910 --> 03:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
is um you know like a long Corridor and
 
03:36:58.189 --> 03:36:58.199 align:start position:0%
then different uh units kind of off that
 
03:37:02.189 --> 03:37:02.199 align:start position:0%
Corridor and essentially one officer can
 
03:37:04.990 --> 03:37:05.000 align:start position:0%
can almost control the whole thing by
 
03:37:06.590 --> 03:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
you know being at the end of that long
 
03:37:09.189 --> 03:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
Corridor and watching and letting people
 
03:37:11.790 --> 03:37:11.800 align:start position:0%
into it letting closing the doors
 
03:37:15.070 --> 03:37:15.080 align:start position:0%
letting them out Etc whereas in in
 
03:37:17.110 --> 03:37:17.120 align:start position:0%
conquer it's this building that building
 
03:37:18.830 --> 03:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
the other building and you need an
 
03:37:20.990 --> 03:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
officer in each or multiple officers in
 
03:37:23.630 --> 03:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
each am I right or so represent McGuire
 
03:37:25.670 --> 03:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
the northern Correctional Facility was
 
03:37:27.870 --> 03:37:27.880 align:start position:0%
designed to be a direct supervision
 
03:37:29.590 --> 03:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
model so when it opened there was one
 
03:37:32.150 --> 03:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
officer in each housing unit so each
 
03:37:34.990 --> 03:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
unit off that long Corridor and then in
 
03:37:37.070 --> 03:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
uh 2009 2010 I believe we know what
 
03:37:39.030 --> 03:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
happened in our economy and the
 
03:37:41.550 --> 03:37:41.560 align:start position:0%
department in order to uh reduce the
 
03:37:43.670 --> 03:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
impact of layoffs on staff created
 
03:37:46.070 --> 03:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
what's called a roving Patrol and that
 
03:37:47.990 --> 03:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
roving Patrol and that physical plant
 
03:37:50.910 --> 03:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
has allowed for groups of officers to go
 
03:37:54.389 --> 03:37:54.399 align:start position:0%
to each housing unit um to monitor the
 
03:37:55.910 --> 03:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
the conduct on those units but to the
 
03:37:58.229 --> 03:37:58.239 align:start position:0%
point of your question there are lots of
 
03:38:00.030 --> 03:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
efficiencies that can be gained in
 
03:38:01.590 --> 03:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
replacing the New Hampshire state prison
 
03:38:04.349 --> 03:38:04.359 align:start position:0%
for men and utilizing a new design
 
03:38:06.030 --> 03:38:06.040 align:start position:0%
improved design other than what we
 
03:38:07.710 --> 03:38:07.720 align:start position:0%
currently function under right now on
 
03:38:07.720 --> 03:38:10.550 align:start position:0%
currently function under right now on
the

03:38:10.550 --> 03:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:13.830 --> 03:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
campus I I wish you would try to um
 
03:38:16.110 --> 03:38:16.120 align:start position:0%
quantify this question about
 
03:38:19.070 --> 03:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
Berlin versus conquer we can certainly
 
03:38:22.550 --> 03:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
look into that sir yeah um because if
 
03:38:26.269 --> 03:38:26.279 align:start position:0%
you can say I can reduce 72,000 to 50 or
 
03:38:29.309 --> 03:38:29.319 align:start position:0%
something that helps us pay for this
 
03:38:32.750 --> 03:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
now let's say we have a design and we
 
03:38:35.389 --> 03:38:35.399 align:start position:0%
borrow the money to build the prison
 
03:38:38.670 --> 03:38:38.680 align:start position:0%
what's the construction time
 
03:38:41.189 --> 03:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
involved I think it would be Prem
 
03:38:43.110 --> 03:38:43.120 align:start position:0%
premature me to pitch what the
 
03:38:44.750 --> 03:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
construction time would be until we put
 
03:38:47.510 --> 03:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
out a bid and received a response back I
 
03:38:49.349 --> 03:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
can only tell you what it took us to
 
03:38:50.950 --> 03:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
build an Hampshire correctional facility
 
03:38:53.389 --> 03:38:53.399 align:start position:0%
for women but representative wer at the
 
03:38:55.229 --> 03:38:55.239 align:start position:0%
onset pointed out some challenges in
 
03:38:57.229 --> 03:38:57.239 align:start position:0%
that project that I don't suspect we
 
03:38:59.070 --> 03:38:59.080 align:start position:0%
will have again given that they looked
 
03:39:02.070 --> 03:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
at 11 something different designs and I
 
03:39:04.469 --> 03:39:04.479 align:start position:0%
think four or five different locations
 
03:39:06.670 --> 03:39:06.680 align:start position:0%
is that correct sir um that's not what
 
03:39:08.309 --> 03:39:08.319 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do in this in this
 
03:39:08.319 --> 03:39:10.309 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do in this in this
program

03:39:10.309 --> 03:39:10.319 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:39:12.750 --> 03:39:12.760 align:start position:0%
proposal thank
 
03:39:15.670 --> 03:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
you all right shall we uh let let's move
 
03:39:19.150 --> 03:39:19.160 align:start position:0%
on to um uh would our Treasurer like to
 
03:39:28.670 --> 03:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:30.950 --> 03:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
borrow good afternoon Mr chairman
 
03:39:32.510 --> 03:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
03:39:34.990 --> 03:39:35.000 align:start position:0%
State Treasurer Monica
 
03:39:37.389 --> 03:39:37.399 align:start position:0%
mapelli how much can we borrow well it's
 
03:39:40.710 --> 03:39:40.720 align:start position:0%
all depend of how how um how much if
 
03:39:42.590 --> 03:39:42.600 align:start position:0%
your if your budget allows for Debt
 
03:39:46.110 --> 03:39:46.120 align:start position:0%
Service right so um one of the things as
 
03:39:48.269 --> 03:39:48.279 align:start position:0%
as when we talk about the capital budget
 
03:39:51.150 --> 03:39:51.160 align:start position:0%
we typically talk about we give an um
 
03:39:53.990 --> 03:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
typical recommendation our our estimates
 
03:39:57.630 --> 03:39:57.640 align:start position:0%
usually use uh about 120 million for the
 
03:39:59.830 --> 03:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
bium and we that's a common number right
 
03:40:03.389 --> 03:40:03.399 align:start position:0%
that every I think everybody knows um in
 
03:40:05.030 --> 03:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
03:40:08.590 --> 03:40:08.600 align:start position:0%
um um so when when when there are
 
03:40:10.670 --> 03:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
Appropriations Capital Appropriations in
 
03:40:12.229 --> 03:40:12.239 align:start position:0%
in the middle of the budget year and an
 
03:40:15.630 --> 03:40:15.640 align:start position:0%
off year um that usually obviously in uh
 
03:40:18.189 --> 03:40:18.199 align:start position:0%
for the last capital budget it was um
 
03:40:21.389 --> 03:40:21.399 align:start position:0%
137 million was authorized which which
 
03:40:24.990 --> 03:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
included um additional payments for uh
 
03:40:27.630 --> 03:40:27.640 align:start position:0%
um the university system so that was all
 
03:40:29.469 --> 03:40:29.479 align:start position:0%
included so you authorize a little more
 
03:40:31.870 --> 03:40:31.880 align:start position:0%
that we we typically recommend but
 
03:40:33.750 --> 03:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
that's fine it's the state can certainly
 
03:40:36.990 --> 03:40:37.000 align:start position:0%
absorb that um so this 40 million will
 
03:40:39.590 --> 03:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
certainly add to that number right so um
 
03:40:42.950 --> 03:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
I just want to be mindful of of that
 
03:40:44.910 --> 03:40:44.920 align:start position:0%
number in terms of the state having the
 
03:40:46.750 --> 03:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
capacity the state has a capacity to
 
03:40:49.429 --> 03:40:49.439 align:start position:0%
borrow another 40 million we did not
 
03:40:51.030 --> 03:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
consider that Debt Service as part of
 
03:40:53.870 --> 03:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
operating budget but um again um we
 
03:40:55.229 --> 03:40:55.239 align:start position:0%
calculated the numbers and that's how
 
03:40:56.990 --> 03:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
much it will cost to add that to our
 
03:41:00.150 --> 03:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
debt service um right now we're in a
 
03:41:01.750 --> 03:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
position where the state can certainly
 
03:41:04.830 --> 03:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
borrow a little more um again our
 
03:41:07.950 --> 03:41:07.960 align:start position:0%
calculations are based on that number of
 
03:41:11.389 --> 03:41:11.399 align:start position:0%
120 minut we continue to um in general
 
03:41:14.710 --> 03:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
estimate and and project that the number
 
03:41:14.720 --> 03:41:15.750 align:start position:0%
estimate and and project that the number
um

03:41:15.750 --> 03:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:17.710 --> 03:41:17.720 align:start position:0%
to Target that number and it was all
 
03:41:21.189 --> 03:41:21.199 align:start position:0%
based on um you know your debt in
 
03:41:22.910 --> 03:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
relation to your revenues right so right
 
03:41:26.030 --> 03:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
now your revenues are very strong um if
 
03:41:28.710 --> 03:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
that picture changes over time we we
 
03:41:32.149 --> 03:41:32.159 align:start position:0%
need to you know uh consider that 120
 
03:41:34.990 --> 03:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
million of her folks going over that
 
03:41:38.349 --> 03:41:38.359 align:start position:0%
number which is all um you know it's is
 
03:41:40.269 --> 03:41:40.279 align:start position:0%
it makes sense since construction costs
 
03:41:42.229 --> 03:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
have increased and and and and that
 
03:41:44.189 --> 03:41:44.199 align:start position:0%
makes sense but again your bordering
 
03:41:45.870 --> 03:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
should be in relation to to your to your
 
03:41:48.189 --> 03:41:48.199 align:start position:0%
Revenue so again right now we the state
 
03:41:50.389 --> 03:41:50.399 align:start position:0%
has a capacity I wouldn't have a concern
 
03:41:54.110 --> 03:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
with with this number right now um uh in
 
03:41:56.110 --> 03:41:56.120 align:start position:0%
addition to that I've had conversations
 
03:41:58.910 --> 03:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
with with with commissioner Hanks about
 
03:42:01.189 --> 03:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
this particular project um this
 
03:42:04.510 --> 03:42:04.520 align:start position:0%
particular project um the cost of this
 
03:42:07.870 --> 03:42:07.880 align:start position:0%
project obviously is is um is is pretty
 
03:42:10.309 --> 03:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
high a lot more than we typically borrow
 
03:42:14.389 --> 03:42:14.399 align:start position:0%
uh during the bium um and uh one of the
 
03:42:16.630 --> 03:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
discussions um you know we're going to
 
03:42:19.389 --> 03:42:19.399 align:start position:0%
once the commissioner has more numbers
 
03:42:21.429 --> 03:42:21.439 align:start position:0%
and and and in an understanding of the
 
03:42:23.630 --> 03:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
cost and time and and and all of that
 
03:42:25.990 --> 03:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
for this project um I will take that
 
03:42:27.429 --> 03:42:27.439 align:start position:0%
information to try to see if there's
 
03:42:29.070 --> 03:42:29.080 align:start position:0%
anything else you know if we could
 
03:42:31.469 --> 03:42:31.479 align:start position:0%
consider this project separate from our
 
03:42:34.229 --> 03:42:34.239 align:start position:0%
typical um capital budget um because
 
03:42:35.790 --> 03:42:35.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps this needs to be considered a
 
03:42:37.149 --> 03:42:37.159 align:start position:0%
separate project look at it in a
 
03:42:39.950 --> 03:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
different way the useful life of the
 
03:42:41.990 --> 03:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
prison is going to be a lot more than 20
 
03:42:44.830 --> 03:42:44.840 align:start position:0%
years so when we borrow funds um you
 
03:42:47.030 --> 03:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
know we have this requirement of 20
 
03:42:49.229 --> 03:42:49.239 align:start position:0%
years but perhaps for a project like
 
03:42:52.349 --> 03:42:52.359 align:start position:0%
this one we could consider 30 years
 
03:42:54.349 --> 03:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
perhaps you know it just and it will be
 
03:42:56.269 --> 03:42:56.279 align:start position:0%
okay again because of the useful life of
 
03:42:57.910 --> 03:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
this assets so those are the
 
03:42:59.510 --> 03:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
conversations we can have we can
 
03:43:02.750 --> 03:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
probably again once we understand uh
 
03:43:06.349 --> 03:43:06.359 align:start position:0%
better the cost and timing um I can
 
03:43:08.790 --> 03:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
bring that back and speak with some
 
03:43:11.149 --> 03:43:11.159 align:start position:0%
experts that I work with uh to see if
 
03:43:13.830 --> 03:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
there are any great ideas out there that
 
03:43:16.309 --> 03:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
we could consider
 
03:43:18.710 --> 03:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
so it it my back of the envelope
 
03:43:21.790 --> 03:43:21.800 align:start position:0%
calculation is if if we were to borrow
 
03:43:24.870 --> 03:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
the entire cost of the new prison it
 
03:43:29.950 --> 03:43:29.960 align:start position:0%
would add about 50% to our um to our
 
03:43:33.070 --> 03:43:33.080 align:start position:0%
debt service payments annually the
 
03:43:36.349 --> 03:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
entire cost of the 550 million or
 
03:43:39.030 --> 03:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
whatever yeah and and right so it's it's
 
03:43:41.550 --> 03:43:41.560 align:start position:0%
it we borrow we typically borrow about
 
03:43:45.510 --> 03:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
60 million each year um so so an amount
 
03:43:47.189 --> 03:43:47.199 align:start position:0%
like that obviously the construction is
 
03:43:48.910 --> 03:43:48.920 align:start position:0%
going to happen over time so that's also
 
03:43:50.830 --> 03:43:50.840 align:start position:0%
part of the what we want to understand
 
03:43:52.590 --> 03:43:52.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps it will be 100 million in
 
03:43:54.189 --> 03:43:54.199 align:start position:0%
addition to what we already borrow so
 
03:43:56.990 --> 03:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
it's a significant number this is why we
 
03:43:59.229 --> 03:43:59.239 align:start position:0%
probably want to have a good um handle
 
03:44:02.670 --> 03:44:02.680 align:start position:0%
on the cost timing and then see how the
 
03:44:04.389 --> 03:44:04.399 align:start position:0%
numbers those numbers look like but
 
03:44:06.189 --> 03:44:06.199 align:start position:0%
you're right I think that that would be
 
03:44:08.670 --> 03:44:08.680 align:start position:0%
it would be an expensive project of
 
03:44:11.110 --> 03:44:11.120 align:start position:0%
course right but I'm I'm just going off
 
03:44:14.349 --> 03:44:14.359 align:start position:0%
of you said we're paying 120 million oh
 
03:44:16.710 --> 03:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
is that a Bend that's the bium right so
 
03:44:20.149 --> 03:44:20.159 align:start position:0%
we bu for debts debt payments correct so
 
03:44:22.389 --> 03:44:22.399 align:start position:0%
this would double our I'm sorry so the
 
03:44:25.950 --> 03:44:25.960 align:start position:0%
120 million is the amount of borrowing
 
03:44:29.550 --> 03:44:29.560 align:start position:0%
um The Debt Service uh we we are in the
 
03:44:33.630 --> 03:44:33.640 align:start position:0%
neighborhood of 72 million per year per
 
03:44:35.510 --> 03:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal year in terms of all of The Debt
 
03:44:37.389 --> 03:44:37.399 align:start position:0%
Service that we
 
03:44:37.399 --> 03:44:40.110 align:start position:0%
Service that we
have

03:44:40.110 --> 03:44:40.120 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:44:42.670 --> 03:44:42.680 align:start position:0%
okay so that doesn't match what I see in
 
03:44:45.349 --> 03:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note so in the fiscal note so
 
03:44:49.710 --> 03:44:49.720 align:start position:0%
yeah so you said we're borrowing 120 and
 
03:44:56.309 --> 03:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
paying over two years yeah 60 a year
 
03:44:59.389 --> 03:44:59.399 align:start position:0%
right so I guess it depends on how much
 
03:45:02.149 --> 03:45:02.159 align:start position:0%
debt we have yeah so if
 
03:45:06.070 --> 03:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
I if I I guess I'm not I'm not probably
 
03:45:09.149 --> 03:45:09.159 align:start position:0%
with my comments this is borrowing 40
 
03:45:12.269 --> 03:45:12.279 align:start position:0%
and paying 4.6 per year in addition to
 
03:45:14.149 --> 03:45:14.159 align:start position:0%
what we already pay in that in addition
 
03:45:17.870 --> 03:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
to what we already he yes right I see
 
03:45:20.870 --> 03:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
but but the ongoing stuff is right so
 
03:45:23.110 --> 03:45:23.120 align:start position:0%
the current debt service is about right
 
03:45:26.389 --> 03:45:26.399 align:start position:0%
now is about 17 million or I have my
 
03:45:29.349 --> 03:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
numbers here but
 
03:45:32.269 --> 03:45:32.279 align:start position:0%
um I can't get you that number but right
 
03:45:35.030 --> 03:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
so this will be in addition this 4.6
 
03:45:37.110 --> 03:45:37.120 align:start position:0%
million uh will be in addition to we
 
03:45:38.550 --> 03:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
were currently so current that service
 
03:45:41.870 --> 03:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
70 million a year B approximately no a
 
03:45:45.670 --> 03:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
year a year okay
 
03:45:45.680 --> 03:45:47.269 align:start position:0%
year a year okay
all

03:45:47.269 --> 03:45:47.279 align:start position:0%
all
 
03:45:51.510 --> 03:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
right so um so if I take this number and
 
03:45:54.030 --> 03:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
multiply it by
 
03:45:58.349 --> 03:45:58.359 align:start position:0%
12 or 13 right for the whole
 
03:46:00.590 --> 03:46:00.600 align:start position:0%
prison I don't I don't really have all
 
03:46:04.950 --> 03:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
of the um yeah we're talking about yeah
 
03:46:06.670 --> 03:46:06.680 align:start position:0%
so this is almost going to be doubling
 
03:46:09.870 --> 03:46:09.880 align:start position:0%
our debt service payment that's correct
 
03:46:13.189 --> 03:46:13.199 align:start position:0%
yeah this is this is why um you know a
 
03:46:15.830 --> 03:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
potential solution could be to not use
 
03:46:19.110 --> 03:46:19.120 align:start position:0%
the typical 20 years to just defer a
 
03:46:20.710 --> 03:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
little bit obviously it's gonna cost
 
03:46:23.349 --> 03:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
more money but again um it it wouldn't
 
03:46:24.950 --> 03:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
be unreasonable considering the useful
 
03:46:26.950 --> 03:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
life of of this
 
03:46:30.710 --> 03:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
asset um how and we have Debt Service on
 
03:46:32.830 --> 03:46:32.840 align:start position:0%
the women's present
 
03:46:35.830 --> 03:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
yes yes uh yes I don't have that number
 
03:46:35.840 --> 03:46:36.910 align:start position:0%
yes yes uh yes I don't have that number
with

03:46:36.910 --> 03:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:46:39.550 --> 03:46:39.560 align:start position:0%
me yes so so current that service is
 
03:46:42.830 --> 03:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:45.229 --> 03:46:45.239 align:start position:0%
million it is 73 million actually
 
03:46:46.830 --> 03:46:46.840 align:start position:0%
because we also pay for the University
 
03:46:49.349 --> 03:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
system so it is 73 million in that
 
03:46:52.070 --> 03:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
service that we pay each fiscal year
 
03:46:55.750 --> 03:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
thank you all right um other
 
03:46:58.269 --> 03:46:58.279 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative
 
03:47:01.110 --> 03:47:01.120 align:start position:0%
white congratulations on the increase in
 
03:47:05.429 --> 03:47:05.439 align:start position:0%
our our credit rating has that helped us
 
03:47:06.870 --> 03:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
lower the
 
03:47:10.349 --> 03:47:10.359 align:start position:0%
interest um yes I mean in general it it
 
03:47:11.830 --> 03:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
does help us but thank you and more than
 
03:47:13.429 --> 03:47:13.439 align:start position:0%
anything I want to thank you all because
 
03:47:15.349 --> 03:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
this is the product of your work and
 
03:47:18.309 --> 03:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
your and your uh good decisions you're
 
03:47:20.149 --> 03:47:20.159 align:start position:0%
the ones that make the hard decisions
 
03:47:22.349 --> 03:47:22.359 align:start position:0%
Nami I just I was just the uh the
 
03:47:24.110 --> 03:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
messenger this time so but thank you
 
03:47:28.469 --> 03:47:28.479 align:start position:0%
very much um so so yes so in in in
 
03:47:30.990 --> 03:47:31.000 align:start position:0%
concept yes so um just to give you an
 
03:47:32.790 --> 03:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
example we you know the C Hampshire
 
03:47:35.110 --> 03:47:35.120 align:start position:0%
issues bonds only once a year so is
 
03:47:36.590 --> 03:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
we're not you know we don't have too
 
03:47:39.269 --> 03:47:39.279 align:start position:0%
many bonds out in the market so um so
 
03:47:43.149 --> 03:47:43.159 align:start position:0%
our our paper is is pretty um attractive
 
03:47:46.110 --> 03:47:46.120 align:start position:0%
um just this last time that we went um
 
03:47:49.389 --> 03:47:49.399 align:start position:0%
we had the sale we had 15 bids so that
 
03:47:51.550 --> 03:47:51.560 align:start position:0%
um that it was a very good result for
 
03:47:54.429 --> 03:47:54.439 align:start position:0%
our for sale and and overall yes we did
 
03:47:57.429 --> 03:47:57.439 align:start position:0%
have a good rate so we we achieved 3.4%
 
03:47:59.790 --> 03:47:59.800 align:start position:0%
for our last sale so so yes so in
 
03:48:02.550 --> 03:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
general it just obviously if if our
 
03:48:05.229 --> 03:48:05.239 align:start position:0%
investors will want to buy our bonds if
 
03:48:07.990 --> 03:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
we continue with um you know the good
 
03:48:10.269 --> 03:48:10.279 align:start position:0%
management of our finances but again
 
03:48:12.550 --> 03:48:12.560 align:start position:0%
this is thanks to all of you and thank
 
03:48:17.349 --> 03:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:18.990 --> 03:48:19.000 align:start position:0%
should we talk about this
 
03:48:23.630 --> 03:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
bill um do we want to do we want to
 
03:48:28.030 --> 03:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
spend 40 million now do we want to
 
03:48:31.110 --> 03:48:31.120 align:start position:0%
increase the scope of the bill uh do we
 
03:48:33.229 --> 03:48:33.239 align:start position:0%
want to borrow this money
 
03:48:38.469 --> 03:48:38.479 align:start position:0%
or or um spend money we already have
 
03:48:40.110 --> 03:48:40.120 align:start position:0%
what do you
 
03:48:43.309 --> 03:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
think yes representative evil well I
 
03:48:43.319 --> 03:48:44.830 align:start position:0%
think yes representative evil well I
mean

03:48:44.830 --> 03:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
mean
 
03:48:47.149 --> 03:48:47.159 align:start position:0%
I was on public works when the issue
 
03:48:49.630 --> 03:48:49.640 align:start position:0%
came up with the women's prison and we
 
03:48:51.630 --> 03:48:51.640 align:start position:0%
hammed and we Haw and we hammed and we
 
03:48:55.110 --> 03:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
Haw and then all of a sudden there we
 
03:48:58.189 --> 03:48:58.199 align:start position:0%
lost um well there had been all these
 
03:49:00.550 --> 03:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
lawsuits right and then the court
 
03:49:04.269 --> 03:49:04.279 align:start position:0%
basically lost its patience and it said
 
03:49:06.389 --> 03:49:06.399 align:start position:0%
the time is now either you do it or
 
03:49:08.469 --> 03:49:08.479 align:start position:0%
we're going to go ahead and start the
 
03:49:11.070 --> 03:49:11.080 align:start position:0%
construction for you and it was a mad
 
03:49:14.149 --> 03:49:14.159 align:start position:0%
scramble as uh commissioner Hanks was
 
03:49:16.189 --> 03:49:16.199 align:start position:0%
saying trying to figure out where to put
 
03:49:19.550 --> 03:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
it how to build it to get the plans I
 
03:49:22.429 --> 03:49:22.439 align:start position:0%
mean so I mean I don't think there's
 
03:49:24.910 --> 03:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
anybody sitting here that doesn't have a
 
03:49:27.030 --> 03:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
sticker shock from $40
 
03:49:29.710 --> 03:49:29.720 align:start position:0%
million um I like the thought that maybe
 
03:49:34.070 --> 03:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
you can reduce it um I'm encouraged that
 
03:49:35.670 --> 03:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
the treasurer feels that we can
 
03:49:37.790 --> 03:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
accommodate it off
 
03:49:41.990 --> 03:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
cycle um I I guess I just feel like
 
03:49:44.830 --> 03:49:44.840 align:start position:0%
we're over a barrel here and we can't
 
03:49:47.830 --> 03:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
really put off some sort of
 
03:49:50.469 --> 03:49:50.479 align:start position:0%
commitment uh to the people that work
 
03:49:53.309 --> 03:49:53.319 align:start position:0%
there to the prisoners that are there uh
 
03:49:56.149 --> 03:49:56.159 align:start position:0%
to avoid litigation I just feel we have
 
03:49:59.229 --> 03:49:59.239 align:start position:0%
to do something to start um moving
 
03:50:03.349 --> 03:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
forward so I would be in in support of
 
03:50:07.110 --> 03:50:07.120 align:start position:0%
the bill for all those reasons while
 
03:50:09.950 --> 03:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
quaking from sticker
 
03:50:12.030 --> 03:50:12.040 align:start position:0%
shock other
 
03:50:37.870 --> 03:50:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:40.510 --> 03:50:40.520 align:start position:0%
see some nods here yeah okay
 
03:50:43.469 --> 03:50:43.479 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeny yeah it's feels
 
03:50:44.830 --> 03:50:44.840 align:start position:0%
like one of those things where we we
 
03:50:47.149 --> 03:50:47.159 align:start position:0%
have to do it otherwise the cost to just
 
03:50:48.830 --> 03:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
keep up the existing facility over the
 
03:50:51.309 --> 03:50:51.319 align:start position:0%
next 10 years will dwarf what the
 
03:50:54.550 --> 03:50:54.560 align:start position:0%
financing to get the project started um
 
03:50:56.550 --> 03:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
I do know I mean so we just passed a new
 
03:50:59.670 --> 03:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
police station in Salem for $38 million
 
03:51:01.590 --> 03:51:01.600 align:start position:0%
that 10 years ago would have been $20
 
03:51:03.309 --> 03:51:03.319 align:start position:0%
million but due to inflation and
 
03:51:05.910 --> 03:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
construction cost increase it's just all
 
03:51:07.469 --> 03:51:07.479 align:start position:0%
over there I hope we can get a better
 
03:51:10.389 --> 03:51:10.399 align:start position:0%
interest rate with our credit rating um
 
03:51:13.389 --> 03:51:13.399 align:start position:0%
but it feels like we're in that rock in
 
03:51:15.110 --> 03:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
that hard place
 
03:51:20.189 --> 03:51:20.199 align:start position:0%
okay so Mr Hoffman if this bill passes
 
03:51:22.550 --> 03:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
presumably before any of this money is
 
03:51:26.830 --> 03:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
spent the um executive Council looks at
 
03:51:30.750 --> 03:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
the contracts and and choices of of who
 
03:51:33.309 --> 03:51:33.319 align:start position:0%
you know and if they find that that the
 
03:51:35.750 --> 03:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
engineering and design can be done for
 
03:51:38.590 --> 03:51:38.600 align:start position:0%
less than 40 million then the rest of
 
03:51:41.870 --> 03:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
the 40 million will either have not
 
03:51:44.830 --> 03:51:44.840 align:start position:0%
actually been borrowed or will will be
 
03:51:46.870 --> 03:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
available for construction or other
 
03:51:46.880 --> 03:51:56.389 align:start position:0%
available for construction or other
purposes

03:51:56.389 --> 03:51:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:56.399 --> 03:51:58.030 align:start position:0%
 
correct

03:51:58.030 --> 03:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:52:01.030 --> 03:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
instruction which could use the existing
 
03:52:04.429 --> 03:52:04.439 align:start position:0%
balance I see so is that the way it
 
03:52:07.269 --> 03:52:07.279 align:start position:0%
works is that once the contract is let
 
03:52:09.910 --> 03:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
you you then go out and borrow the money
 
03:52:12.349 --> 03:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
that's correct so we we borrow based on
 
03:52:14.990 --> 03:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
expenses so once the agenc spending
 
03:52:18.389 --> 03:52:18.399 align:start position:0%
money um that's when we start bonding
 
03:52:20.110 --> 03:52:20.120 align:start position:0%
pieces because again it's going to go
 
03:52:23.910 --> 03:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
over time happen all right would anyone
 
03:52:26.750 --> 03:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
like to make a motion yes
 
03:52:29.189 --> 03:52:29.199 align:start position:0%
representative I would make the motion
 
03:52:30.550 --> 03:52:30.560 align:start position:0%
even though that means I have to write a
 
03:52:30.560 --> 03:52:31.510 align:start position:0%
even though that means I have to write a
committee

03:52:31.510 --> 03:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:52:35.590 --> 03:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
report um but under the circumstances I
 
03:52:37.870 --> 03:52:37.880 align:start position:0%
I think that we really should do this
 
03:52:41.110 --> 03:52:41.120 align:start position:0%
and the well do I have a
 
03:52:43.910 --> 03:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
second okay thanks um the only other
 
03:52:45.990 --> 03:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
thing I would add here is just again
 
03:52:48.110 --> 03:52:48.120 align:start position:0%
from my experience on public works and
 
03:52:50.990 --> 03:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
working with the treasurer she gives us
 
03:52:53.990 --> 03:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
very wise and very conservative
 
03:52:56.349 --> 03:52:56.359 align:start position:0%
recommendations and
 
03:52:59.149 --> 03:52:59.159 align:start position:0%
um I guess I have to say that if the
 
03:53:01.349 --> 03:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
treasurer is telling us that the state
 
03:53:05.510 --> 03:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
has the capacity to bond for this I
 
03:53:07.229 --> 03:53:07.239 align:start position:0%
respect your opinion and your
 
03:53:09.750 --> 03:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
conservative analysis so I feel like we
 
03:53:14.550 --> 03:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
can um take uh you know solace in that
 
03:53:17.030 --> 03:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
and feel comfortable with the with the
 
03:53:20.630 --> 03:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
bonding amount so and I mean we've
 
03:53:22.229 --> 03:53:22.239 align:start position:0%
discussed this at length there's no
 
03:53:25.070 --> 03:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
question that we need to move ahead I
 
03:53:27.510 --> 03:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
guess not not to BL the point but I also
 
03:53:29.389 --> 03:53:29.399 align:start position:0%
remember in public works one of the
 
03:53:31.550 --> 03:53:31.560 align:start position:0%
first moves we always made is to try to
 
03:53:34.670 --> 03:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
get our engineering house in order to
 
03:53:41.590 --> 03:53:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:44.750 --> 03:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
step any further comments on this motion
 
03:53:54.110 --> 03:53:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:54.120 --> 03:53:56.070 align:start position:0%
 
role

03:53:56.070 --> 03:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
role
 
03:53:56.080 --> 03:53:57.990 align:start position:0%
role
yes

03:53:57.990 --> 03:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:53:58.000 --> 03:54:02.790 align:start position:0%
yes
yes

03:54:02.790 --> 03:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:17.309 --> 03:54:17.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:19.389 --> 03:54:19.399 align:start position:0%
so you you may want to stay for the next
 
03:54:21.030 --> 03:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
bill we're hoping to send you some more
 
03:54:22.230 --> 03:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
inmates you
 
03:54:22.240 --> 03:54:43.070 align:start position:0%
inmates you
[Laughter]

03:54:43.070 --> 03:54:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:45.590 --> 03:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
know about well there's some nasty
 
03:54:48.750 --> 03:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:52.790 --> 03:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
with all right all right so let's we we
 
03:54:55.389 --> 03:54:55.399 align:start position:0%
we have pl we are on time slightly we're
 
03:54:57.389 --> 03:54:57.399 align:start position:0%
a little late so let's start with the
 
03:54:59.110 --> 03:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
03:55:05.070 --> 03:55:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:11.710 --> 03:55:11.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:15.710 --> 03:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
right yes okay do I see our attorney
 
03:55:15.720 --> 03:55:19.030 align:start position:0%
right yes okay do I see our attorney
general

03:55:19.030 --> 03:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:22.269 --> 03:55:22.279 align:start position:0%
yeah good afternoon Mr chair members of
 
03:55:25.750 --> 03:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
The Division I I don't I don't mean to
 
03:55:29.630 --> 03:55:29.640 align:start position:0%
um interfere name or
 
03:55:31.550 --> 03:55:31.560 align:start position:0%
we okay
 
03:55:33.710 --> 03:55:33.720 align:start position:0%
good I certainly don't mean to PRM
 
03:55:35.389 --> 03:55:35.399 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley at the other hearings
 
03:55:36.950 --> 03:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
we've had on this bill he's introduced
 
03:55:39.510 --> 03:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
the bill but I'm I'm assuming based on
 
03:55:41.309 --> 03:55:41.319 align:start position:0%
who's here that I should probably just
 
03:55:43.229 --> 03:55:43.239 align:start position:0%
speak to
 
03:55:45.870 --> 03:55:45.880 align:start position:0%
it would you like how would you like me
 
03:55:47.429 --> 03:55:47.439 align:start position:0%
to proceed would you like me to give an
 
03:55:50.870 --> 03:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
overview of of what this bill does I
 
03:55:52.750 --> 03:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
know this is scheduled as a work session
 
03:55:54.389 --> 03:55:54.399 align:start position:0%
so it just just to be clear I want to
 
03:55:56.670 --> 03:55:56.680 align:start position:0%
make sure I'm giving you what you need
 
03:55:58.830 --> 03:55:58.840 align:start position:0%
we're only concerned with the money okay
 
03:56:02.630 --> 03:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
okay so the 60 million the $60 million
 
03:56:02.640 --> 03:56:03.950 align:start position:0%
okay so the 60 million the $60 million
piece

03:56:03.950 --> 03:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
piece
 
03:56:07.670 --> 03:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
okay so the at present I guess I'll
 
03:56:09.670 --> 03:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
start with just giving a current status
 
03:56:13.510 --> 03:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
of the of the settlement fund process we
 
03:56:17.750 --> 03:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
have received received I think about 450
 
03:56:21.750 --> 03:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
claims but 163 claims have been resolved
 
03:56:24.870 --> 03:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
or settled for a total of about $82
 
03:56:28.309 --> 03:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
million of the fund um the fund has2 or3
 
03:56:30.630 --> 03:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
million in administrative expenses that
 
03:56:34.469 --> 03:56:34.479 align:start position:0%
have been expended since late 2022 so
 
03:56:38.030 --> 03:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
there's roughly $15 million left in the
 
03:56:41.389 --> 03:56:41.399 align:start position:0%
fund so the 60 million is intended to
 
03:56:44.469 --> 03:56:44.479 align:start position:0%
replenish the fund um but it also goes
 
03:56:46.590 --> 03:56:46.600 align:start position:0%
along I think for this bill in
 
03:56:48.750 --> 03:56:48.760 align:start position:0%
particular to understand the 60 million
 
03:56:50.469 --> 03:56:50.479 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand some of the
 
03:56:52.189 --> 03:56:52.199 align:start position:0%
major changes that are being made to the
 
03:56:54.550 --> 03:56:54.560 align:start position:0%
settlement fund
 
03:56:57.229 --> 03:56:57.239 align:start position:0%
process so without going over all of the
 
03:56:58.830 --> 03:56:58.840 align:start position:0%
background on how this came to be
 
03:57:00.469 --> 03:57:00.479 align:start position:0%
because I think at this point the
 
03:57:02.269 --> 03:57:02.279 align:start position:0%
legislature is fairly familiar with it
 
03:57:04.710 --> 03:57:04.720 align:start position:0%
but I'm happy to take questions um as
 
03:57:08.070 --> 03:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
you know when the YDC settlement fund
 
03:57:11.110 --> 03:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
process was first set up and when the
 
03:57:14.229 --> 03:57:14.239 align:start position:0%
first bill passed back in 2022 we did
 
03:57:16.710 --> 03:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
not have broad consensus on the bill I
 
03:57:18.630 --> 03:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
think from the Attorney General's office
 
03:57:20.990 --> 03:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
perspective we felt that the the bill
 
03:57:22.630 --> 03:57:22.640 align:start position:0%
set up a victim centered and Trauma
 
03:57:23.950 --> 03:57:23.960 align:start position:0%
informed process that would be
 
03:57:26.349 --> 03:57:26.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate for many of the victims at
 
03:57:28.830 --> 03:57:28.840 align:start position:0%
YDC but we hadn't achieved broad
 
03:57:31.229 --> 03:57:31.239 align:start position:0%
consensus the bill that's before you
 
03:57:34.110 --> 03:57:34.120 align:start position:0%
makes some changes to that process that
 
03:57:36.750 --> 03:57:36.760 align:start position:0%
now come with agreement from Nixon
 
03:57:39.149 --> 03:57:39.159 align:start position:0%
Peabody and Russ Riley who represent you
 
03:57:41.429 --> 03:57:41.439 align:start position:0%
know 90 plus% of the
 
03:57:44.469 --> 03:57:44.479 align:start position:0%
claimants a big there were three main
 
03:57:48.389 --> 03:57:48.399 align:start position:0%
reasons why Nixon Peabody and Russ Riley
 
03:57:51.830 --> 03:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
had not agreed to recommend this process
 
03:57:54.149 --> 03:57:54.159 align:start position:0%
to the vast majority of their clients
 
03:57:57.469 --> 03:57:57.479 align:start position:0%
before um one of them was just the scope
 
03:57:59.910 --> 03:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
of the bill what the scope of the claims
 
03:58:02.510 --> 03:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
process what types of uh harms and
 
03:58:05.630 --> 03:58:05.640 align:start position:0%
abuses the claims process covered um
 
03:58:09.149 --> 03:58:09.159 align:start position:0%
another major Point were the Caps so
 
03:58:11.429 --> 03:58:11.439 align:start position:0%
what the Caps were at they thought the
 
03:58:14.550 --> 03:58:14.560 align:start position:0%
Caps were too low and then a third major
 
03:58:16.510 --> 03:58:16.520 align:start position:0%
point was just the process and how it
 
03:58:18.429 --> 03:58:18.439 align:start position:0%
worked they felt the process was too
 
03:58:21.630 --> 03:58:21.640 align:start position:0%
complicated and while we we felt that it
 
03:58:23.309 --> 03:58:23.319 align:start position:0%
was a fairly streamlined process
 
03:58:25.189 --> 03:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
certainly compared to the traditional
 
03:58:27.469 --> 03:58:27.479 align:start position:0%
litigation process they felt the process
 
03:58:30.110 --> 03:58:30.120 align:start position:0%
was still too complicated so this bill
 
03:58:32.750 --> 03:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
makes a number of changes to address
 
03:58:34.830 --> 03:58:34.840 align:start position:0%
those concerns um the first thing the
 
03:58:37.670 --> 03:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
bill does is it raises the caps for
 
03:58:39.990 --> 03:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
egregious sexual abuse from 1.5 million
 
03:58:44.429 --> 03:58:44.439 align:start position:0%
to 2.5 million um we expect that
 
03:58:46.830 --> 03:58:46.840 align:start position:0%
egregious cases will be a fairly you
 
03:58:49.469 --> 03:58:49.479 align:start position:0%
know certainly the distinct minority of
 
03:58:52.229 --> 03:58:52.239 align:start position:0%
cases that come through the fund um
 
03:58:53.990 --> 03:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps the best way to illustrate that
 
03:58:56.110 --> 03:58:56.120 align:start position:0%
is that right now the number of claims
 
03:58:57.630 --> 03:58:57.640 align:start position:0%
that have been resolved at the cap it's
 
03:59:00.910 --> 03:59:00.920 align:start position:0%
about 10 or 11 out of 163 so it's a
 
03:59:02.950 --> 03:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
fairly small percentage of claims that I
 
03:59:04.670 --> 03:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
think would be subject to that increased
 
03:59:08.309 --> 03:59:08.319 align:start position:0%
overall cap um the bill also expands the
 
03:59:10.149 --> 03:59:10.159 align:start position:0%
scope of the fund to expand the
 
03:59:13.149 --> 03:59:13.159 align:start position:0%
definition of sexual abuse and include
 
03:59:14.710 --> 03:59:14.720 align:start position:0%
other things
 
03:59:16.590 --> 03:59:16.600 align:start position:0%
it also creates a second category of
 
03:59:18.189 --> 03:59:18.199 align:start position:0%
abuse that's no longer just physical
 
03:59:20.750 --> 03:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
abuse it's physical abuse plus other
 
03:59:23.070 --> 03:59:23.080 align:start position:0%
things so that will now be a category of
 
03:59:23.080 --> 03:59:24.630 align:start position:0%
things so that will now be a category of
other

03:59:24.630 --> 03:59:24.640 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:59:28.309 --> 03:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
abuse and the in exchange for that in
 
03:59:30.070 --> 03:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
exchange for expanding the scope and
 
03:59:32.630 --> 03:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
increasing the caps in certain places
 
03:59:34.590 --> 03:59:34.600 align:start position:0%
the bill provides that the administrator
 
03:59:40.070 --> 03:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
will now be empowered to award claims in
 
03:59:42.670 --> 03:59:42.680 align:start position:0%
annual installments so right now Claims
 
03:59:45.189 --> 03:59:45.199 align:start position:0%
can only be awarded in lumps sums but
 
03:59:47.229 --> 03:59:47.239 align:start position:0%
going forward if this bill passes the
 
03:59:49.189 --> 03:59:49.199 align:start position:0%
administrator will be empowered to award
 
03:59:51.750 --> 03:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
claims and annual installments and the
 
03:59:55.149 --> 03:59:55.159 align:start position:0%
bill will also impose a $75 million per
 
03:59:57.030 --> 03:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal year cap on the amount of money
 
03:59:59.830 --> 03:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
that can be paid out of the fund so that
 
04:00:02.030 --> 04:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
that sort of an exchange for raising the
 
04:00:04.229 --> 04:00:04.239 align:start position:0%
caps and expanding the scope to get more
 
04:00:06.389 --> 04:00:06.399 align:start position:0%
people to come in we have those
 
04:00:09.189 --> 04:00:09.199 align:start position:0%
safeguards that at least protects the
 
04:00:10.910 --> 04:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
state from having this become a a
 
04:00:12.750 --> 04:00:12.760 align:start position:0%
runaway process in which hundreds of
 
04:00:14.550 --> 04:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars get exp ended at any
 
04:00:16.990 --> 04:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
one fiscal year there will still be an
 
04:00:20.550 --> 04:00:20.560 align:start position:0%
option for for the administrator to come
 
04:00:21.950 --> 04:00:21.960 align:start position:0%
to the fiscal committee and to the
 
04:00:24.590 --> 04:00:24.600 align:start position:0%
governor and councel to raise that limit
 
04:00:26.990 --> 04:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
in any given fiscal year but there will
 
04:00:29.590 --> 04:00:29.600 align:start position:0%
be those safeguards in place so that if
 
04:00:31.990 --> 04:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
there the bill you know won't cause the
 
04:00:33.990 --> 04:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
state to spend a lot more money than it
 
04:00:37.110 --> 04:00:37.120 align:start position:0%
has and I would expect that whether the
 
04:00:38.429 --> 04:00:38.439 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee or the governor and
 
04:00:40.189 --> 04:00:40.199 align:start position:0%
Council would agree to increase that
 
04:00:42.229 --> 04:00:42.239 align:start position:0%
limit in any given fiscal year that will
 
04:00:44.710 --> 04:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
depend on how the state's Finance look
 
04:00:48.189 --> 04:00:48.199 align:start position:0%
at that point in time so that those are
 
04:00:50.830 --> 04:00:50.840 align:start position:0%
the basics and Mr chair just because you
 
04:00:52.590 --> 04:00:52.600 align:start position:0%
said you were only really concerned with
 
04:00:54.750 --> 04:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
the money I just I'm I wanted to hit
 
04:00:56.389 --> 04:00:56.399 align:start position:0%
those points I'm happy to answer other
 
04:00:59.349 --> 04:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
questions but the $60
 
04:01:02.429 --> 04:01:02.439 align:start position:0%
million that was our estimate provided
 
04:01:04.510 --> 04:01:04.520 align:start position:0%
to the Senate at the amount of money
 
04:01:07.429 --> 04:01:07.439 align:start position:0%
that we thought
 
04:01:11.950 --> 04:01:11.960 align:start position:0%
would hopefully get us through fiscal
 
04:01:15.110 --> 04:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
year 25 so between now and the end of
 
04:01:19.510 --> 04:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 given that going forward
 
04:01:21.389 --> 04:01:21.399 align:start position:0%
if this bill passes payments could be
 
04:01:23.870 --> 04:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
awarded in annual installments as I said
 
04:01:25.670 --> 04:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
there's about 15 million left in the
 
04:01:28.670 --> 04:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
fund now if we add 60 million that would
 
04:01:33.510 --> 04:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
get it up to 75 million and I expect
 
04:01:35.870 --> 04:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
that we'll that will be close to the
 
04:01:37.750 --> 04:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
amount we need to get through the end of
 
04:01:40.990 --> 04:01:41.000 align:start position:0%
fisal year 25 given that if this bill
 
04:01:42.830 --> 04:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
passes we're going to have to go back
 
04:01:44.630 --> 04:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
through the fiscal committee to change
 
04:01:47.590 --> 04:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
the guidelines and we expect that the
 
04:01:50.149 --> 04:01:50.159 align:start position:0%
claims process will either slow down
 
04:01:52.750 --> 04:01:52.760 align:start position:0%
significantly or even be put on pause
 
04:01:54.510 --> 04:01:54.520 align:start position:0%
for a time while we rewrite the
 
04:01:57.149 --> 04:01:57.159 align:start position:0%
guidelines to match the revisions in the
 
04:01:59.510 --> 04:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
bill so all that said that's really what
 
04:02:03.269 --> 04:02:03.279 align:start position:0%
that's where the number 60 million comes
 
04:02:04.950 --> 04:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
from and I'm happy to answer any
 
04:02:07.110 --> 04:02:07.120 align:start position:0%
questions on other details of the bill
 
04:02:09.389 --> 04:02:09.399 align:start position:0%
or or anything else about this process
 
04:02:11.590 --> 04:02:11.600 align:start position:0%
thank you so did I hear you say that
 
04:02:13.990 --> 04:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
it's about a half million settlement per
 
04:02:17.349 --> 04:02:17.359 align:start position:0%
case on average yes that's correct okay
 
04:02:21.229 --> 04:02:21.239 align:start position:0%
and um and how many cases are there Al
 
04:02:24.389 --> 04:02:24.399 align:start position:0%
together there have been 450 claims
 
04:02:29.229 --> 04:02:29.239 align:start position:0%
filed so far we we know that Nixon puddy
 
04:02:32.790 --> 04:02:32.800 align:start position:0%
and Russ Riley represent 1300 1,400
 
04:02:34.630 --> 04:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
people now they've already filed some of
 
04:02:37.110 --> 04:02:37.120 align:start position:0%
those claims in the fund but all
 
04:02:39.189 --> 04:02:39.199 align:start position:0%
together I would say we're probably
 
04:02:42.910 --> 04:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
looking at close to 1,500 claims maybe
 
04:02:45.790 --> 04:02:45.800 align:start position:0%
more that could come through the process
 
04:02:48.429 --> 04:02:48.439 align:start position:0%
it could be less because um the
 
04:02:49.910 --> 04:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's count attorneys have
 
04:02:51.830 --> 04:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
committed that with these changes they'd
 
04:02:53.229 --> 04:02:53.239 align:start position:0%
recommend the process to the vast
 
04:02:55.189 --> 04:02:55.199 align:start position:0%
majority of their clients but we're
 
04:02:56.830 --> 04:02:56.840 align:start position:0%
certainly looking at a number between
 
04:02:59.950 --> 04:02:59.960 align:start position:0%
1,000 and 2,000 and I think it's at the
 
04:03:01.710 --> 04:03:01.720 align:start position:0%
end of the day when this is all said and
 
04:03:03.950 --> 04:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
done I would estimate we're going to be
 
04:03:07.189 --> 04:03:07.199 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the 1500 claims range but
 
04:03:10.030 --> 04:03:10.040 align:start position:0%
it's difficult we will not know until
 
04:03:15.349 --> 04:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
the the deadline closes next next June
 
04:03:19.830 --> 04:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
2025 1,500 claims so we're talking about
 
04:03:19.840 --> 04:03:22.030 align:start position:0%
2025 1,500 claims so we're talking about
$750

04:03:22.030 --> 04:03:22.040 align:start position:0%
$750
 
04:03:25.309 --> 04:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:29.630 --> 04:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
it and and yet there's only a
 
04:03:29.640 --> 04:03:31.269 align:start position:0%
it and and yet there's only a
dozen

04:03:31.269 --> 04:03:31.279 align:start position:0%
dozen
 
04:03:35.710 --> 04:03:35.720 align:start position:0%
um criminals involved in
 
04:03:39.710 --> 04:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
this so I mean is it really possible for
 
04:03:41.429 --> 04:03:41.439 align:start position:0%
them to
 
04:03:44.990 --> 04:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
move yeah well so 11 individuals have
 
04:03:46.950 --> 04:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
been criminally charged I think what you
 
04:03:50.149 --> 04:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
have to remember is that these types of
 
04:03:52.510 --> 04:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
cases are very difficult criminal cases
 
04:03:56.030 --> 04:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
to bring even when the alleged abuse
 
04:04:00.389 --> 04:04:00.399 align:start position:0%
happened last week let alone decades ago
 
04:04:02.750 --> 04:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
um there are also many allegations that
 
04:04:05.469 --> 04:04:05.479 align:start position:0%
stem stem from a time when the statute
 
04:04:07.149 --> 04:04:07.159 align:start position:0%
of limitations to bring any criminal
 
04:04:10.950 --> 04:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
charges has has long passed so I I I
 
04:04:13.830 --> 04:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
think it is you know it that's what
 
04:04:16.710 --> 04:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
makes what happened here or it's one of
 
04:04:18.149 --> 04:04:18.159 align:start position:0%
the things that makes what happened here
 
04:04:19.710 --> 04:04:19.720 align:start position:0%
so difficult to Grapple with we're
 
04:04:21.870 --> 04:04:21.880 align:start position:0%
talking about a large span of time I
 
04:04:24.510 --> 04:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
mean we have allegations from the 60s so
 
04:04:27.590 --> 04:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
60s 7s 80s 90s early
 
04:04:31.389 --> 04:04:31.399 align:start position:0%
2000s and once you get back past the
 
04:04:33.630 --> 04:04:33.640 align:start position:0%
1990s any statute limitations for
 
04:04:35.189 --> 04:04:35.199 align:start position:0%
criminal cases would have would have
 
04:04:39.870 --> 04:04:39.880 align:start position:0%
long passed so I I I don't think it's
 
04:04:44.030 --> 04:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
uh as much as it may be tempting un I
 
04:04:46.389 --> 04:04:46.399 align:start position:0%
don't think you can really
 
04:04:49.990 --> 04:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
use the number of viable criminal cases
 
04:04:51.830 --> 04:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
to make a reasonable estimate as to the
 
04:04:54.950 --> 04:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
number of viable and credible
 
04:04:57.349 --> 04:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
allegations of abuse that occurred there
 
04:05:00.110 --> 04:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
over the many decades that we're talking
 
04:05:03.990 --> 04:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
about why was there such a delay between
 
04:05:06.950 --> 04:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
the the crimes and
 
04:05:10.389 --> 04:05:10.399 align:start position:0%
now and and coming coming to light
 
04:05:12.469 --> 04:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
recently well that's you know that's a
 
04:05:14.070 --> 04:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
question I will never completely be able
 
04:05:18.389 --> 04:05:18.399 align:start position:0%
to answer but I I think that you know
 
04:05:20.790 --> 04:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
that has a lot to do with the fact that
 
04:05:23.830 --> 04:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
until the first couple of victims came
 
04:05:27.269 --> 04:05:27.279 align:start position:0%
forward the others didn't didn't have
 
04:05:30.110 --> 04:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
the courage to come forward so I I think
 
04:05:31.630 --> 04:05:31.640 align:start position:0%
that that's part of the reason that
 
04:05:34.510 --> 04:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
explains the delay um but you know
 
04:05:37.670 --> 04:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
beyond that that's that's something
 
04:05:39.309 --> 04:05:39.319 align:start position:0%
that's difficult to answer I mean it's
 
04:05:42.870 --> 04:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
not uncommon for victims of sexual abuse
 
04:05:45.269 --> 04:05:45.279 align:start position:0%
especially to to to take many years to
 
04:05:47.550 --> 04:05:47.560 align:start position:0%
come to terms with what happened to them
 
04:05:49.469 --> 04:05:49.479 align:start position:0%
and to have the courage to to come
 
04:05:52.830 --> 04:05:52.840 align:start position:0%
forward and for kids who might have been
 
04:05:54.830 --> 04:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
in in custody in a juvenile detention
 
04:05:57.110 --> 04:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
center this is a population that's
 
04:05:58.990 --> 04:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
particularly susceptible to think that
 
04:06:01.990 --> 04:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
no one would ever believe them thank
 
04:06:04.750 --> 04:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
representative Camal thank you Mr chair
 
04:06:07.149 --> 04:06:07.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question uh uh
 
04:06:09.590 --> 04:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
to dat have any of the claims been
 
04:06:12.149 --> 04:06:12.159 align:start position:0%
rejected as unfounded so they got paid
 
04:06:12.159 --> 04:06:13.910 align:start position:0%
rejected as unfounded so they got paid
nothing

04:06:13.910 --> 04:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
04:06:15.750 --> 04:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
there have been claims that have been
 
04:06:17.750 --> 04:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
that have not been paid anything there
 
04:06:20.830 --> 04:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
have also been many claims who have got
 
04:06:22.870 --> 04:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
whose Awards have been much less than
 
04:06:25.710 --> 04:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
the amount they they claimed so that I
 
04:06:27.229 --> 04:06:27.239 align:start position:0%
mean it brings up an important point
 
04:06:29.110 --> 04:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
this is not a process in which you just
 
04:06:31.110 --> 04:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
come through you say this happened and
 
04:06:34.670 --> 04:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
you get paid out for for what you claim
 
04:06:38.750 --> 04:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
um we right now for the even the claims
 
04:06:40.950 --> 04:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
that have been resolved they've been the
 
04:06:43.590 --> 04:06:43.600 align:start position:0%
amounts that have been paid out are
 
04:06:45.990 --> 04:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
close to half of what was actually
 
04:06:49.349 --> 04:06:49.359 align:start position:0%
claimed and as more claims come in you
 
04:06:52.229 --> 04:06:52.239 align:start position:0%
know we'll we'll get a sense of what the
 
04:06:54.910 --> 04:06:54.920 align:start position:0%
true average will be I don't think it's
 
04:06:56.469 --> 04:06:56.479 align:start position:0%
guaranteed to say the average will
 
04:07:00.510 --> 04:07:00.520 align:start position:0%
maintain at 500,000 I mean you may it
 
04:07:02.910 --> 04:07:02.920 align:start position:0%
even though we know that you know a
 
04:07:04.710 --> 04:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
thousand plus lawsuits have been filed
 
04:07:07.670 --> 04:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
it's not until we see the actual details
 
04:07:09.469 --> 04:07:09.479 align:start position:0%
of a claim in writing that it can really
 
04:07:11.229 --> 04:07:11.239 align:start position:0%
be evaluated but that that was a long
 
04:07:13.030 --> 04:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
answer to your question but yes some
 
04:07:15.269 --> 04:07:15.279 align:start position:0%
claims have been paid nothing and many
 
04:07:16.990 --> 04:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
many many claims have been paid
 
04:07:18.790 --> 04:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
significantly less than the original
 
04:07:18.800 --> 04:07:19.990 align:start position:0%
significantly less than the original
amount

04:07:19.990 --> 04:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
amount
 
04:07:22.550 --> 04:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
claimed thank you um yeah the reason I
 
04:07:24.630 --> 04:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
asked is I just wanted to make sure it's
 
04:07:27.870 --> 04:07:27.880 align:start position:0%
not a situation where anybody that comes
 
04:07:29.750 --> 04:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
forward that had been there makes a
 
04:07:32.510 --> 04:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
claim and then for convenience sake we
 
04:07:34.830 --> 04:07:34.840 align:start position:0%
pay them out just to make them go away
 
04:07:36.710 --> 04:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
that's not the case right no that is
 
04:07:40.389 --> 04:07:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:43.550 --> 04:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
you representative Lane
 
04:07:46.670 --> 04:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um what
 
04:07:49.910 --> 04:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
would the impact of the recent case that
 
04:07:53.229 --> 04:07:53.239 align:start position:0%
was that awarded $38 million have on
 
04:07:56.670 --> 04:07:56.680 align:start position:0%
this whole thing because I know as a
 
04:08:00.309 --> 04:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
plainist attorney I would be hesitant to
 
04:08:03.429 --> 04:08:03.439 align:start position:0%
recommend to settle for this amount with
 
04:08:06.550 --> 04:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
that out there I know it's not a final
 
04:08:09.070 --> 04:08:09.080 align:start position:0%
one but just how does that impact all of
 
04:08:11.790 --> 04:08:11.800 align:start position:0%
this yeah so I I would answer that in a
 
04:08:13.950 --> 04:08:13.960 align:start position:0%
couple ways one
 
04:08:15.910 --> 04:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
you know I think it's safe to say that
 
04:08:17.950 --> 04:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
that the case that was just tried was
 
04:08:19.750 --> 04:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
one of the most egregious if not
 
04:08:22.309 --> 04:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
egregious cases that that we would see
 
04:08:26.030 --> 04:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
from YDC um Second and I don't you know
 
04:08:27.830 --> 04:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
we've still got and I know you'll
 
04:08:29.870 --> 04:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
understand this we've still got you know
 
04:08:31.590 --> 04:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
pending litigation arguments in front of
 
04:08:33.750 --> 04:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
Judge shman and and I'm sure you've seen
 
04:08:36.670 --> 04:08:36.680 align:start position:0%
the news about our position on on the
 
04:08:40.309 --> 04:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
the cap applying but you know
 
04:08:43.229 --> 04:08:43.239 align:start position:0%
we that the case is a good example of
 
04:08:45.590 --> 04:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
the risks of litigation either way right
 
04:08:47.510 --> 04:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
the jury came back with a high damages
 
04:08:49.790 --> 04:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
number but they also came back with a
 
04:08:53.389 --> 04:08:53.399 align:start position:0%
finding of of one incident and um you
 
04:08:55.189 --> 04:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
know we feel very strongly that their
 
04:08:58.030 --> 04:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
finding of one incident should and will
 
04:09:00.349 --> 04:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
hold and that the actual judgment in the
 
04:09:02.149 --> 04:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
case will be
 
04:09:04.870 --> 04:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
$475,000 um beyond that I'm not going to
 
04:09:06.389 --> 04:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
say you know I'm not going to say more
 
04:09:08.109 --> 04:09:08.119 align:start position:0%
because I don't want to be seen to be
 
04:09:11.309 --> 04:09:11.319 align:start position:0%
arguing our case here in this form but
 
04:09:14.790 --> 04:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
but to answer your question the the
 
04:09:18.070 --> 04:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
I I think it we don't know for sure what
 
04:09:19.309 --> 04:09:19.319 align:start position:0%
impact that will have on how many
 
04:09:22.349 --> 04:09:22.359 align:start position:0%
claimants come through but I do think
 
04:09:24.950 --> 04:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
that that that case was it's a it was a
 
04:09:27.469 --> 04:09:27.479 align:start position:0%
really difficult case I
 
04:09:30.149 --> 04:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
mean you know it's an understatement to
 
04:09:32.469 --> 04:09:32.479 align:start position:0%
say that I it was the most difficult for
 
04:09:35.189 --> 04:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
Mr Mian and can't imagine what he what
 
04:09:38.309 --> 04:09:38.319 align:start position:0%
he went through um it was that case was
 
04:09:41.030 --> 04:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
an example of how difficult it could be
 
04:09:43.790 --> 04:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
to try any one of these cases and the
 
04:09:46.229 --> 04:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
risks involved for either the plaintiff
 
04:09:49.030 --> 04:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
or the defense in going to trial in one
 
04:09:50.990 --> 04:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
of these
 
04:09:54.830 --> 04:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
cases yeah is there a legal case being
 
04:09:57.349 --> 04:09:57.359 align:start position:0%
made against us that we should not be
 
04:09:59.030 --> 04:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
able to set
 
04:10:01.990 --> 04:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
caps um because it just it sort of
 
04:10:05.790 --> 04:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
seems to some extent self-serving for us
 
04:10:05.800 --> 04:10:07.870 align:start position:0%
seems to some extent self-serving for us
as

04:10:07.870 --> 04:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:10:12.670 --> 04:10:12.680 align:start position:0%
the defendant yeah thank you to um to
 
04:10:16.349 --> 04:10:16.359 align:start position:0%
say to make a a law that here's all we
 
04:10:19.950 --> 04:10:19.960 align:start position:0%
can pay right you know what I mean um
 
04:10:22.030 --> 04:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
not that I think the taxpayers is in any
 
04:10:25.269 --> 04:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
way responsible in some sense I don't
 
04:10:27.030 --> 04:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
know thank
 
04:10:30.349 --> 04:10:30.359 align:start position:0%
you so so is that it is somebody making
 
04:10:32.670 --> 04:10:32.680 align:start position:0%
that case against us that that we cannot
 
04:10:35.670 --> 04:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
make a cap that case may very well be
 
04:10:38.349 --> 04:10:38.359 align:start position:0%
made at some point you know in my role
 
04:10:40.630 --> 04:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
as the Attorney General I I certainly
 
04:10:43.309 --> 04:10:43.319 align:start position:0%
would would not agree with that legal
 
04:10:45.229 --> 04:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
position if someone took it I believe
 
04:10:47.109 --> 04:10:47.119 align:start position:0%
it's ultimately up to the legislature to
 
04:10:49.710 --> 04:10:49.720 align:start position:0%
determine to what extent you know the
 
04:10:51.590 --> 04:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
state is going to wave sovereign
 
04:10:54.229 --> 04:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
immunity But to answer your question
 
04:10:56.269 --> 04:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
that case has not been explicitly made
 
04:10:58.429 --> 04:10:58.439 align:start position:0%
up to this point but but it could be
 
04:11:00.229 --> 04:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
made as we move forward in the
 
04:11:03.469 --> 04:11:03.479 align:start position:0%
litigation piece of this have there been
 
04:11:06.030 --> 04:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
similar cases in other states or
 
04:11:09.590 --> 04:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
nationally that bear on this on the way
 
04:11:10.800 --> 04:11:10.810 align:start position:0%
this settlement is going
 
04:11:10.810 --> 04:11:11.950 align:start position:0%
this settlement is going
[Music]

04:11:11.950 --> 04:11:11.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:11:14.950 --> 04:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
forward what do you mean the way you
 
04:11:16.710 --> 04:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
know with regard to litigation over Caps
 
04:11:19.429 --> 04:11:19.439 align:start position:0%
or just handling something like this
 
04:11:21.550 --> 04:11:21.560 align:start position:0%
over caps on cases like this on the
 
04:11:24.550 --> 04:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
cases of abuse of
 
04:11:26.990 --> 04:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
children I off the top of my head I'm
 
04:11:28.950 --> 04:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
not I would say I'm not well-versed
 
04:11:34.030 --> 04:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
enough in litigation regarding uh caps
 
04:11:38.149 --> 04:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
that states have P have placed on on you
 
04:11:41.429 --> 04:11:41.439 align:start position:0%
know the liability of a state but I do
 
04:11:43.950 --> 04:11:43.960 align:start position:0%
think there is pretty strong case law
 
04:11:46.070 --> 04:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
that supports the concept of sovereign
 
04:11:47.790 --> 04:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
immunity and at the end of the day what
 
04:11:50.830 --> 04:11:50.840 align:start position:0%
a cap is is the state waving sovereign
 
04:11:54.030 --> 04:11:54.040 align:start position:0%
immunity up to a point because the state
 
04:11:56.670 --> 04:11:56.680 align:start position:0%
actually I think the state would have
 
04:11:59.030 --> 04:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
the right to to not wave sovereign
 
04:12:01.309 --> 04:12:01.319 align:start position:0%
immunity at all so to not allow any
 
04:12:03.950 --> 04:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
recovery against the state but the state
 
04:12:07.030 --> 04:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:11.469 --> 04:12:11.479 align:start position:0%
that all right thank you um any other
 
04:12:13.750 --> 04:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
questions uh represent
 
04:12:17.870 --> 04:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
W just a really quick one so I know that
 
04:12:20.389 --> 04:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
in this bill we're changing that now we
 
04:12:23.710 --> 04:12:23.720 align:start position:0%
can pay annually is that the claimant
 
04:12:26.630 --> 04:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
can make that choice or is that the way
 
04:12:29.030 --> 04:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
all payments will be
 
04:12:32.630 --> 04:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
made the all payments will not
 
04:12:34.710 --> 04:12:34.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily be be made in annual
 
04:12:36.269 --> 04:12:36.279 align:start position:0%
installments but it will now be up to
 
04:12:39.670 --> 04:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
the administrator and it whereas before
 
04:12:41.990 --> 04:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
it was it was completely the clayman's
 
04:12:44.429 --> 04:12:44.439 align:start position:0%
choice the administ Ator can now require
 
04:12:46.469 --> 04:12:46.479 align:start position:0%
it as part of the administrator's job to
 
04:12:48.229 --> 04:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
sort of manage the fund and ensure that
 
04:12:51.070 --> 04:12:51.080 align:start position:0%
no more than 75 million goes out in any
 
04:12:51.080 --> 04:12:52.189 align:start position:0%
no more than 75 million goes out in any
one

04:12:52.189 --> 04:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:12:52.199 --> 04:12:57.070 align:start position:0%
one
year

04:12:57.070 --> 04:12:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:00.269 --> 04:13:00.279 align:start position:0%
y How could a jury even come up with a
 
04:13:03.109 --> 04:13:03.119 align:start position:0%
figure like $38 million it makes no
 
04:13:06.030 --> 04:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
sense it doesn't help the person they're
 
04:13:07.670 --> 04:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
just going to waste the money the
 
04:13:09.109 --> 04:13:09.119 align:start position:0%
lawyers are going to come in for a big
 
04:13:11.389 --> 04:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
piece of it and think whoopy we'll get
 
04:13:14.109 --> 04:13:14.119 align:start position:0%
more cases like this I mean I
 
04:13:18.269 --> 04:13:18.279 align:start position:0%
mean was the jury instructed as to what
 
04:13:20.229 --> 04:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
money would be used or how would it be
 
04:13:22.990 --> 04:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
used or how how you even can claim
 
04:13:25.349 --> 04:13:25.359 align:start position:0%
obviously the average person if they
 
04:13:28.149 --> 04:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
were working hard and keeping their nose
 
04:13:30.429 --> 04:13:30.439 align:start position:0%
clean might make over a million dollars
 
04:13:31.550 --> 04:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
in a
 
04:13:33.910 --> 04:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
lifetime somebody got up to claim oh
 
04:13:36.229 --> 04:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
he'd lost $2 million in his lifetime
 
04:13:38.990 --> 04:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
because of his earnings an exceptionable
 
04:13:40.950 --> 04:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
person will make a couple of million
 
04:13:42.429 --> 04:13:42.439 align:start position:0%
dollars in their lifetime but not if
 
04:13:44.830 --> 04:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
they've been in trouble and hadn't
 
04:13:46.750 --> 04:13:46.760 align:start position:0%
gotten any advanced
 
04:13:49.510 --> 04:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
qualifications and and be work hard to
 
04:13:51.269 --> 04:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
get enough that but but some of these
 
04:13:53.790 --> 04:13:53.800 align:start position:0%
figures just Boggle the mind and then I
 
04:13:56.990 --> 04:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
wonder why the your team didn't even
 
04:14:01.670 --> 04:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
bring the reality to it this jury it's
 
04:14:04.349 --> 04:14:04.359 align:start position:0%
crazy what they came up with well I'm
 
04:14:06.269 --> 04:14:06.279 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be careful on commenting on
 
04:14:09.550 --> 04:14:09.560 align:start position:0%
on where the jury landed but but I will
 
04:14:13.070 --> 04:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
say um you know on behalf of our team I
 
04:14:15.950 --> 04:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
I mean I couldn't be prouder of the work
 
04:14:17.750 --> 04:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
our trial team did in this case and as
 
04:14:20.030 --> 04:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
you imagine it was a very difficult case
 
04:14:21.830 --> 04:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
for attorneys from the Department of
 
04:14:23.790 --> 04:14:23.800 align:start position:0%
Justice to have to try it's
 
04:14:27.309 --> 04:14:27.319 align:start position:0%
not many times at the doj you know our
 
04:14:29.189 --> 04:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
team is wearing the white hat we're
 
04:14:31.389 --> 04:14:31.399 align:start position:0%
either Prosecuting offenders or we're
 
04:14:33.149 --> 04:14:33.159 align:start position:0%
we're playing offense to protect the
 
04:14:36.590 --> 04:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
public and having to uh defend the state
 
04:14:38.510 --> 04:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
in a case like this is a it's a
 
04:14:39.950 --> 04:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
complicated Endeavor it's difficult
 
04:14:41.469 --> 04:14:41.479 align:start position:0%
Endeavor I think the trial team did a
 
04:14:43.389 --> 04:14:43.399 align:start position:0%
great job and the trial team certainly
 
04:14:45.590 --> 04:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
made a strong case and I bet you if
 
04:14:47.349 --> 04:14:47.359 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's council were here they they
 
04:14:49.870 --> 04:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
would tell you that um as as far as
 
04:14:52.429 --> 04:14:52.439 align:start position:0%
where the jury landed you know that that
 
04:14:54.269 --> 04:14:54.279 align:start position:0%
could be the subject of certainly the
 
04:14:56.389 --> 04:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
subject of post-trial proceedings and
 
04:14:59.109 --> 04:14:59.119 align:start position:0%
and appell proceedings and and even
 
04:15:01.109 --> 04:15:01.119 align:start position:0%
aside from that I want to be careful
 
04:15:03.830 --> 04:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
with with commenting on on how the jury
 
04:15:06.109 --> 04:15:06.119 align:start position:0%
came up with what they came up with
 
04:15:07.710 --> 04:15:07.720 align:start position:0%
interestingly we had never heard the
 
04:15:07.720 --> 04:15:14.389 align:start position:0%
interestingly we had never heard the
475,000

04:15:14.389 --> 04:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:17.109 --> 04:15:17.119 align:start position:0%
well I with respect to that
 
04:15:18.710 --> 04:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
representative I would say that I I
 
04:15:20.309 --> 04:15:20.319 align:start position:0%
certainly have discussed that cap when
 
04:15:21.710 --> 04:15:21.720 align:start position:0%
I've been before the legislature and
 
04:15:23.030 --> 04:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
when I've talked about this this
 
04:15:26.109 --> 04:15:26.119 align:start position:0%
settlement process and uh it's it's in
 
04:15:28.550 --> 04:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
the statute and and that was an issue
 
04:15:30.469 --> 04:15:30.479 align:start position:0%
that certainly was discussed in depth
 
04:15:33.149 --> 04:15:33.159 align:start position:0%
and in detail in front of the judge in
 
04:15:34.990 --> 04:15:35.000 align:start position:0%
this case and the judge decided that the
 
04:15:37.309 --> 04:15:37.319 align:start position:0%
jury would not be instructed on the cap
 
04:15:39.429 --> 04:15:39.439 align:start position:0%
but but I I think that I've I've
 
04:15:41.229 --> 04:15:41.239 align:start position:0%
definitely discussed the cap when I've
 
04:15:44.070 --> 04:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
been before the legislature
 
04:15:46.910 --> 04:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
other questions seeing none thank you
 
04:15:50.030 --> 04:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
very much General froma thank you are
 
04:15:52.550 --> 04:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
there others who would like to speak to
 
04:16:01.189 --> 04:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:05.269 --> 04:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
591 yes no
 
04:16:14.710 --> 04:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:16.510 --> 04:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman again um for the
 
04:16:20.109 --> 04:16:20.119 align:start position:0%
record Cate Treasurer Monica mapelli um
 
04:16:21.870 --> 04:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
I do not have any comments as to the
 
04:16:24.830 --> 04:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
purpose of of this bill um I understand
 
04:16:27.389 --> 04:16:27.399 align:start position:0%
um I understand what it's being uh um
 
04:16:29.950 --> 04:16:29.960 align:start position:0%
this amendment drafted um the only
 
04:16:32.630 --> 04:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
comment I have um is um relative to the
 
04:16:36.229 --> 04:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
bond and authorization um my only um
 
04:16:39.429 --> 04:16:39.439 align:start position:0%
which it could be understandable that uh
 
04:16:43.189 --> 04:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
perhaps there will be um uh the opport
 
04:16:47.590 --> 04:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
to to finance some of this cost as as um
 
04:16:50.269 --> 04:16:50.279 align:start position:0%
some of the um right now we we have
 
04:16:52.750 --> 04:16:52.760 align:start position:0%
aound through this bill there's a
 
04:16:55.229 --> 04:16:55.239 align:start position:0%
particular estimate as to how much
 
04:16:59.149 --> 04:16:59.159 align:start position:0%
perhaps um the ministerial can spend um
 
04:17:01.389 --> 04:17:01.399 align:start position:0%
so there are only two ways to fund this
 
04:17:03.790 --> 04:17:03.800 align:start position:0%
uh through Appropriations or uh through
 
04:17:06.389 --> 04:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
the add of bonds so the the only comment
 
04:17:09.309 --> 04:17:09.319 align:start position:0%
I have is for you to consider is um
 
04:17:12.189 --> 04:17:12.199 align:start position:0%
typically we see in bills uh abondon
 
04:17:14.510 --> 04:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
authorization amount The reason an
 
04:17:16.429 --> 04:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
authorization amount is helpful is
 
04:17:19.349 --> 04:17:19.359 align:start position:0%
because um I have to budget for Debt
 
04:17:21.189 --> 04:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
Service so this will be Debt Service
 
04:17:24.309 --> 04:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
that would be paid uh with General funds
 
04:17:27.229 --> 04:17:27.239 align:start position:0%
um the other purpose um the other uh
 
04:17:28.870 --> 04:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
reason why it's important to have an
 
04:17:30.870 --> 04:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate U an authorization amount is
 
04:17:33.070 --> 04:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
because I have to calculate the debt
 
04:17:36.030 --> 04:17:36.040 align:start position:0%
limit um every year there's a there's a
 
04:17:37.630 --> 04:17:37.640 align:start position:0%
requirement I say
 
04:17:42.630 --> 04:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
6C um that um I have to calculate uh a
 
04:17:45.309 --> 04:17:45.319 align:start position:0%
Deb limit um so you know how much you're
 
04:17:47.950 --> 04:17:47.960 align:start position:0%
able to borrow each year um so because
 
04:17:49.670 --> 04:17:49.680 align:start position:0%
of that I think it will be important to
 
04:17:53.229 --> 04:17:53.239 align:start position:0%
have a better understanding as to that
 
04:17:55.590 --> 04:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh borrowing uh amount that you may
 
04:17:58.910 --> 04:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
consider whether in the aggregate or or
 
04:18:02.149 --> 04:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
annually um so the bill is um silent on
 
04:18:03.550 --> 04:18:03.560 align:start position:0%
that and that would be my only comment
 
04:18:05.630 --> 04:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
for you to consider and if if it's not
 
04:18:08.510 --> 04:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
through this particular bill um we will
 
04:18:09.830 --> 04:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
probably have to have the same
 
04:18:11.750 --> 04:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
conversation uh when we're trying to
 
04:18:14.950 --> 04:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
budget for the next bium um just because
 
04:18:16.510 --> 04:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
we will have to have a better picture as
 
04:18:17.990 --> 04:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
to how much we're going to be able to
 
04:18:19.950 --> 04:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
borrow uh if you're considering
 
04:18:24.389 --> 04:18:24.399 align:start position:0%
borrowing again um I I don't know um how
 
04:18:26.349 --> 04:18:26.359 align:start position:0%
the you know the legislature will will
 
04:18:28.750 --> 04:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
try to fund some of how to replenish
 
04:18:31.349 --> 04:18:31.359 align:start position:0%
this fund going forward um there are
 
04:18:33.670 --> 04:18:33.680 align:start position:0%
some unknowns uh I understand that part
 
04:18:35.910 --> 04:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
too um but again just something for you
 
04:18:38.109 --> 04:18:38.119 align:start position:0%
to consider as you're discussing this
 
04:18:41.229 --> 04:18:41.239 align:start position:0%
bill um typically we see a bond and
 
04:18:43.349 --> 04:18:43.359 align:start position:0%
authorization amount for every Capital
 
04:18:45.710 --> 04:18:45.720 align:start position:0%
appropriation this one is not a capital
 
04:18:47.830 --> 04:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
appropriation it will be borrowing to
 
04:18:52.269 --> 04:18:52.279 align:start position:0%
try to fund or replenish this fund um
 
04:18:53.870 --> 04:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
another piece I just want to mention for
 
04:18:56.269 --> 04:18:56.279 align:start position:0%
your for your knowledge and again this
 
04:18:58.389 --> 04:18:58.399 align:start position:0%
this perhaps could be discussed in the
 
04:19:01.870 --> 04:19:01.880 align:start position:0%
future but um any borrowing related to
 
04:19:04.469 --> 04:19:04.479 align:start position:0%
um uh for this purpose as the bill has
 
04:19:06.750 --> 04:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
written uh it will have to be a taxable
 
04:19:09.710 --> 04:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
taxable debt just because uh this is not
 
04:19:11.510 --> 04:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
to benefit the state directly this would
 
04:19:16.030 --> 04:19:16.040 align:start position:0%
be to benefit um uh the members uh that
 
04:19:18.389 --> 04:19:18.399 align:start position:0%
will benefit from this fund U the
 
04:19:20.750 --> 04:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries of this fund so uh for
 
04:19:23.429 --> 04:19:23.439 align:start position:0%
that typically a little the debt is a
 
04:19:26.269 --> 04:19:26.279 align:start position:0%
little um more expensive than tax and
 
04:19:27.630 --> 04:19:27.640 align:start position:0%
sub debt so something for you to
 
04:19:30.389 --> 04:19:30.399 align:start position:0%
consider as your as you're funding this
 
04:19:34.990 --> 04:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
um this um for this purpose
 
04:19:37.670 --> 04:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
um yes thank you so I I think this is an
 
04:19:39.550 --> 04:19:39.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate time to bring forward my
 
04:19:39.560 --> 04:19:50.510 align:start position:0%
appropriate time to bring forward my
Amendment

04:19:50.510 --> 04:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:52.349 --> 04:19:52.359 align:start position:0%
because I agree with you that this is
 
04:19:54.229 --> 04:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
maybe not an appropriate thing to borrow
 
04:19:54.239 --> 04:19:56.630 align:start position:0%
maybe not an appropriate thing to borrow
money

04:19:56.630 --> 04:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:59.389 --> 04:19:59.399 align:start position:0%
for and and it could be part of the
 
04:20:01.349 --> 04:20:01.359 align:start position:0%
planning right so I think part of what I
 
04:20:03.750 --> 04:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
I I also wanted to mention
 
04:20:06.149 --> 04:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
is it could it could be appropriate to
 
04:20:07.830 --> 04:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
borrow for this purpose and perhaps you
 
04:20:10.590 --> 04:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
can create design a plan that you know
 
04:20:11.990 --> 04:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
could have a combination of
 
04:20:14.670 --> 04:20:14.680 align:start position:0%
Appropriations and finance and finance
 
04:20:17.670 --> 04:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
and a portion of it
 
04:20:21.630 --> 04:20:21.640 align:start position:0%
um so that could be a perhaps an
 
04:20:23.790 --> 04:20:23.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate plan to proceed I think what
 
04:20:27.269 --> 04:20:27.279 align:start position:0%
will be important typically um it is it
 
04:20:29.590 --> 04:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
is helpful to know and try to estimate
 
04:20:31.710 --> 04:20:31.720 align:start position:0%
how much you want to borrow we typically
 
04:20:34.429 --> 04:20:34.439 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned previously as when I was
 
04:20:37.870 --> 04:20:37.880 align:start position:0%
speaking before you is we we developed
 
04:20:40.229 --> 04:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
the data affability study we tried to
 
04:20:42.229 --> 04:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
project um how much we're going to
 
04:20:43.750 --> 04:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
borrow how much the general fund is
 
04:20:46.109 --> 04:20:46.119 align:start position:0%
going to pay and and so these will be
 
04:20:48.309 --> 04:20:48.319 align:start position:0%
part of that those calculations that we
 
04:20:51.389 --> 04:20:51.399 align:start position:0%
prepare um but again this is all if you
 
04:20:54.109 --> 04:20:54.119 align:start position:0%
wanted to do some borrowing related to
 
04:20:59.309 --> 04:20:59.319 align:start position:0%
this this bill so thank you
 
04:21:03.790 --> 04:21:03.800 align:start position:0%
um so I I agree so I I think that
 
04:21:06.030 --> 04:21:06.040 align:start position:0%
it's there's a big difference between
 
04:21:08.070 --> 04:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
this bill and the previous one and that
 
04:21:11.870 --> 04:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
is I think it's appropriate to borrow to
 
04:21:13.590 --> 04:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
for for
 
04:21:17.030 --> 04:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
um Capital Equipment and goods and
 
04:21:19.790 --> 04:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
things like like roads and prisons and
 
04:21:22.030 --> 04:21:22.040 align:start position:0%
stuff that's that's going to be used
 
04:21:25.510 --> 04:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
over long periods of time houses right
 
04:21:28.670 --> 04:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
but it's not appropriate to borrow money
 
04:21:28.680 --> 04:21:29.830 align:start position:0%
but it's not appropriate to borrow money
for

04:21:29.830 --> 04:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:21:33.229 --> 04:21:33.239 align:start position:0%
expenses and I see this as a little bit
 
04:21:35.790 --> 04:21:35.800 align:start position:0%
more like an expense right there's going
 
04:21:38.429 --> 04:21:38.439 align:start position:0%
to be a a certain amount that we have to
 
04:21:41.229 --> 04:21:41.239 align:start position:0%
spend but
 
04:21:44.750 --> 04:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
um but it's not something it's it's
 
04:21:48.590 --> 04:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
something really that's the the the
 
04:21:52.309 --> 04:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
obligation of in some sense past
 
04:21:56.429 --> 04:21:56.439 align:start position:0%
taxpayers or current ones and not future
 
04:21:58.149 --> 04:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
ones and so
 
04:22:00.830 --> 04:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
therefore um it's not really appropriate
 
04:22:03.349 --> 04:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
to borrow so the question is where do we
 
04:22:04.830 --> 04:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
have $60
 
04:22:08.429 --> 04:22:08.439 align:start position:0%
million and as you all know we have it
 
04:22:11.189 --> 04:22:11.199 align:start position:0%
in the education trust fund and so
 
04:22:16.389 --> 04:22:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:20.109 --> 04:22:20.119 align:start position:0%
does I guessed you
 
04:22:23.469 --> 04:22:23.479 align:start position:0%
might that's a shock yeah all right any
 
04:22:23.479 --> 04:22:25.389 align:start position:0%
might that's a shock yeah all right any
any

04:22:25.389 --> 04:22:25.399 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:22:30.030 --> 04:22:30.040 align:start position:0%
comments any no all right all right so
 
04:22:33.790 --> 04:22:33.800 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm going to move um ought to pass
 
04:22:37.149 --> 04:22:37.159 align:start position:0%
with amendment I guess and um don't we
 
04:22:39.910 --> 04:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
vote on the amendment first yeah yeah
 
04:22:41.750 --> 04:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
but I'm I'm moving that and so I'll move
 
04:22:46.670 --> 04:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:50.149 --> 04:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
all right any comments on the
 
04:22:52.429 --> 04:22:52.439 align:start position:0%
amendment representative grass if if
 
04:22:53.710 --> 04:22:53.720 align:start position:0%
this goes to the floor of the house and
 
04:22:55.349 --> 04:22:55.359 align:start position:0%
your amendment is rejected where does it
 
04:22:57.790 --> 04:22:57.800 align:start position:0%
leave us standing well then it would
 
04:23:00.030 --> 04:23:00.040 align:start position:0%
simply be if if it was ought to if the
 
04:23:01.469 --> 04:23:01.479 align:start position:0%
committee was assuming the committee was
 
04:23:03.550 --> 04:23:03.560 align:start position:0%
ought to pass with Amendment then and
 
04:23:05.109 --> 04:23:05.119 align:start position:0%
the amendment's rejected then there's
 
04:23:07.149 --> 04:23:07.159 align:start position:0%
ought to pass I obviously there could be
 
04:23:09.309 --> 04:23:09.319 align:start position:0%
floor amendments right the basic bill
 
04:23:11.590 --> 04:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
that we have here would be next up so
 
04:23:11.600 --> 04:23:13.750 align:start position:0%
that we have here would be next up so
yeah

04:23:13.750 --> 04:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:23:16.710 --> 04:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin I I think there
 
04:23:19.990 --> 04:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
some is some logic in charging the
 
04:23:23.149 --> 04:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
education trust fund because most of
 
04:23:26.950 --> 04:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
these victims were were U school
 
04:23:30.070 --> 04:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
AG children for the most part they were
 
04:23:32.269 --> 04:23:32.279 align:start position:0%
teenagers high
 
04:23:39.590 --> 04:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:42.550 --> 04:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
it I I know I'm only a substitute but
 
04:23:46.750 --> 04:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
but um you get to vote I get to vote and
 
04:23:50.990 --> 04:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
um I my feeling is that until we get
 
04:23:54.030 --> 04:23:54.040 align:start position:0%
through having set as a substitute for
 
04:23:57.990 --> 04:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
long-term on education until we get the
 
04:24:01.590 --> 04:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
lawsuits about adequate funding for
 
04:24:04.510 --> 04:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
schools in the state and until we
 
04:24:07.229 --> 04:24:07.239 align:start position:0%
adequately fund them I don't think we
 
04:24:11.149 --> 04:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
should be robbing Peter to pay Paul and
 
04:24:14.309 --> 04:24:14.319 align:start position:0%
I don't um understand the
 
04:24:17.349 --> 04:24:17.359 align:start position:0%
analysis of taking money that we've put
 
04:24:20.910 --> 04:24:20.920 align:start position:0%
aside for education and using it to pay
 
04:24:24.070 --> 04:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
for what is amounting to negligence on
 
04:24:26.830 --> 04:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
the state's part and its administration
 
04:24:29.750 --> 04:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
of the Youth Detention
 
04:24:32.429 --> 04:24:32.439 align:start position:0%
Center thank
 
04:24:36.389 --> 04:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
you um so she representative Lane brings
 
04:24:38.990 --> 04:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
up an interesting question um I don't
 
04:24:42.389 --> 04:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
know if General formela would like to
 
04:24:46.429 --> 04:24:46.439 align:start position:0%
say anything about the education
 
04:24:53.710 --> 04:24:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:02.469 --> 04:25:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:04.990 --> 04:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
you so I I I guess my answer on that
 
04:25:07.550 --> 04:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
might be somewhat disappointing I mean I
 
04:25:09.790 --> 04:25:09.800 align:start position:0%
I think it's best not to get in really
 
04:25:11.510 --> 04:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
get into the substance substance of the
 
04:25:13.309 --> 04:25:13.319 align:start position:0%
education funding
 
04:25:15.429 --> 04:25:15.439 align:start position:0%
lawsuits other than to say I I could
 
04:25:18.510 --> 04:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
understand the position that um you
 
04:25:21.030 --> 04:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
might not want to mess with the
 
04:25:22.590 --> 04:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
education trust fund while that's
 
04:25:25.710 --> 04:25:25.720 align:start position:0%
pending but I you know I I didn't come
 
04:25:27.910 --> 04:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
prepared today to think that through
 
04:25:29.950 --> 04:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
very deeply I I would just point out
 
04:25:31.389 --> 04:25:31.399 align:start position:0%
when it comes to taking money from the
 
04:25:33.950 --> 04:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
education trust fund the other thing to
 
04:25:36.790 --> 04:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
keep in mind is that you know if some of
 
04:25:40.189 --> 04:25:40.199 align:start position:0%
that money came from from the lottery
 
04:25:42.790 --> 04:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
the lottery funds cannot be diverted
 
04:25:44.429 --> 04:25:44.439 align:start position:0%
away from the education trust fund so
 
04:25:45.790 --> 04:25:45.800 align:start position:0%
you would just want to make sure that if
 
04:25:48.750 --> 04:25:48.760 align:start position:0%
you're diverting $60 million away that
 
04:25:50.389 --> 04:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
you're not you're not taking Lottery
 
04:25:52.309 --> 04:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
money and I I wouldn't be in a position
 
04:25:54.469 --> 04:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
to do that analysis right right here
 
04:25:55.710 --> 04:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
sitting here but that that' just be
 
04:25:57.870 --> 04:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
another point I'd make um given that the
 
04:25:59.550 --> 04:25:59.560 align:start position:0%
bonding Authority was discussed too I
 
04:26:01.429 --> 04:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
thought I'd just make a point with that
 
04:26:03.189 --> 04:26:03.199 align:start position:0%
you know the way the Bill's drafted it's
 
04:26:06.469 --> 04:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
not saying that the state will borrow
 
04:26:08.750 --> 04:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
anything it just contemplates that the
 
04:26:10.389 --> 04:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
legislature and the governor and Council
 
04:26:14.349 --> 04:26:14.359 align:start position:0%
in a given year might dis side to borrow
 
04:26:16.790 --> 04:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
borrow money to replenish the settlement
 
04:26:19.950 --> 04:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
fund as opposed to just a you know um
 
04:26:21.550 --> 04:26:21.560 align:start position:0%
taking money from funds other not
 
04:26:23.630 --> 04:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
otherwise appropriated but other than
 
04:26:26.510 --> 04:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
that I wouldn't I'm not sure it's my
 
04:26:29.109 --> 04:26:29.119 align:start position:0%
place to comment on on this amendment
 
04:26:31.630 --> 04:26:31.640 align:start position:0%
because it just it seems that it's just
 
04:26:33.429 --> 04:26:33.439 align:start position:0%
the legislature making a policy decision
 
04:26:35.550 --> 04:26:35.560 align:start position:0%
on where to pull funds from and as long
 
04:26:37.149 --> 04:26:37.159 align:start position:0%
as you keep in mind the Constitutional
 
04:26:39.870 --> 04:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
restrictions on how to use Lottery money
 
04:26:41.349 --> 04:26:41.359 align:start position:0%
I think that's a decision that really is
 
04:26:43.030 --> 04:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
up to you
 
04:26:45.030 --> 04:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:26:48.229 --> 04:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
um my argument back on that specific
 
04:26:50.469 --> 04:26:50.479 align:start position:0%
point would be the amount we sent to
 
04:26:53.189 --> 04:26:53.199 align:start position:0%
schools is way way greater than the
 
04:26:56.590 --> 04:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
total amount of Lottery money and so
 
04:26:59.070 --> 04:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
therefore what we're spending here would
 
04:27:02.429 --> 04:27:02.439 align:start position:0%
be what other funds that that are not
 
04:27:06.429 --> 04:27:06.439 align:start position:0%
Lottery funds I mean presumably we could
 
04:27:08.469 --> 04:27:08.479 align:start position:0%
put some kind of line in here but the
 
04:27:10.469 --> 04:27:10.479 align:start position:0%
money is fungible right so there's
 
04:27:13.109 --> 04:27:13.119 align:start position:0%
there's no you know there's there's no
 
04:27:15.550 --> 04:27:15.560 align:start position:0%
color on one dollar versus another that
 
04:27:17.229 --> 04:27:17.239 align:start position:0%
says this came from the lottery and this
 
04:27:19.550 --> 04:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
came from you know what I mean so yeah
 
04:27:21.630 --> 04:27:21.640 align:start position:0%
yes money is absolutely fungible and and
 
04:27:22.750 --> 04:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
I think that would probably be a
 
04:27:25.349 --> 04:27:25.359 align:start position:0%
question for the LBA if anyone to take a
 
04:27:27.830 --> 04:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
look at at you know I I went to law
 
04:27:31.229 --> 04:27:31.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:33.790 --> 04:27:33.800 align:start position:0%
numbers further
 
04:27:37.189 --> 04:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
discussion representative evil without
 
04:27:41.070 --> 04:27:41.080 align:start position:0%
commenting specifically on this uh what
 
04:27:42.870 --> 04:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
does it take to
 
04:27:45.590 --> 04:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
get into the rainy day fund and is this
 
04:27:50.149 --> 04:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:54.149 --> 04:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
know um Mr Hoffman do you
 
04:27:57.070 --> 04:27:57.080 align:start position:0%
know I'm sorry you were
 
04:28:00.269 --> 04:28:00.279 align:start position:0%
asking well there's also uh rainy day
 
04:28:05.189 --> 04:28:05.199 align:start position:0%
fund money and I was curious how one
 
04:28:07.630 --> 04:28:07.640 align:start position:0%
accesses dives into the
 
04:28:10.830 --> 04:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
rain huh
 
04:28:12.990 --> 04:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
it's well
 
04:28:15.630 --> 04:28:15.640 align:start position:0%
all right M treasurer do you want to
 
04:28:23.510 --> 04:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:26.710 --> 04:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
you thank you for the question um so
 
04:28:28.590 --> 04:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
that just as a reminder that the Rainy
 
04:28:31.269 --> 04:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
Define is a reserve uh and by law it
 
04:28:34.269 --> 04:28:34.279 align:start position:0%
needs to be it can only be accessed if
 
04:28:36.109 --> 04:28:36.119 align:start position:0%
there is a deficit at the end of the
 
04:28:39.229 --> 04:28:39.239 align:start position:0%
bium so uh normally you will you know
 
04:28:41.710 --> 04:28:41.720 align:start position:0%
it's not a typical process there is a
 
04:28:44.590 --> 04:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
proced procedure yes that um I forget
 
04:28:48.269 --> 04:28:48.279 align:start position:0%
his um a number that needs to be passed
 
04:28:51.189 --> 04:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
in order to to withdraw um funds from
 
04:28:53.030 --> 04:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
the rainy day fund before the end of the
 
04:28:55.309 --> 04:28:55.319 align:start position:0%
biannual but the typical process is just
 
04:28:58.229 --> 04:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
in the event of a deficit or um if the
 
04:29:00.910 --> 04:29:00.920 align:start position:0%
state doesn't um collect enough Revenue
 
04:29:03.109 --> 04:29:03.119 align:start position:0%
that's when mechanically you can you
 
04:29:04.870 --> 04:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
could potentially access funds for the
 
04:29:08.309 --> 04:29:08.319 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund but it's not uh what we
 
04:29:10.670 --> 04:29:10.680 align:start position:0%
so it's a it's a it's a a sensitive
 
04:29:12.510 --> 04:29:12.520 align:start position:0%
topic when it comes to this discussing
 
04:29:14.630 --> 04:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
to investors and the rating agencies
 
04:29:16.590 --> 04:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
because one of the reasons we received
 
04:29:20.429 --> 04:29:20.439 align:start position:0%
the rating um the upgrade um the because
 
04:29:22.630 --> 04:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
we have H strong reserves right now so
 
04:29:24.830 --> 04:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
strong cash reserves was an important
 
04:29:26.990 --> 04:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
part of of the upgrade that we received
 
04:29:30.030 --> 04:29:30.040 align:start position:0%
so just hopefully that answers the
 
04:29:34.469 --> 04:29:34.479 align:start position:0%
question representa wner yes thank you
 
04:29:37.349 --> 04:29:37.359 align:start position:0%
when we originally set up the settlement
 
04:29:41.030 --> 04:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
fund wasn't the first $100 million that
 
04:29:43.469 --> 04:29:43.479 align:start position:0%
we deposited in into that fund wasn't
 
04:29:46.030 --> 04:29:46.040 align:start position:0%
that from the rainy day fund it was it
 
04:29:49.750 --> 04:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
was an action of law in um U which we it
 
04:29:52.389 --> 04:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
was completely understood why um that
 
04:29:54.510 --> 04:29:54.520 align:start position:0%
was taken at the time it was a policy
 
04:29:56.870 --> 04:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
decision uh one of the concerns I raised
 
04:29:59.990 --> 04:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
at that time was you know perhaps I was
 
04:30:01.870 --> 04:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
trying to suggest if maybe it could be
 
04:30:03.670 --> 04:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
could have been taken from some other
 
04:30:06.189 --> 04:30:06.199 align:start position:0%
place just because I know how sensitive
 
04:30:09.349 --> 04:30:09.359 align:start position:0%
the fact that is sensitive topic again I
 
04:30:11.109 --> 04:30:11.119 align:start position:0%
have to respond to questions from
 
04:30:13.510 --> 04:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
investors from rating agencies you know
 
04:30:15.309 --> 04:30:15.319 align:start position:0%
why are we taking the money from that
 
04:30:17.590 --> 04:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
pot if we have other pots of money right
 
04:30:19.469 --> 04:30:19.479 align:start position:0%
so so for the most part my my
 
04:30:21.469 --> 04:30:21.479 align:start position:0%
recommendation is you you have your
 
04:30:23.630 --> 04:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
reserves you know we all have emergency
 
04:30:25.510 --> 04:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
funds so should have emergency funds so
 
04:30:27.750 --> 04:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
that's what the you know the rating fund
 
04:30:30.670 --> 04:30:30.680 align:start position:0%
should should function as that as a an
 
04:30:30.680 --> 04:30:33.269 align:start position:0%
should should function as that as a an
emergency

04:30:33.269 --> 04:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:36.389 --> 04:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
fund wner sorry
 
04:30:39.990 --> 04:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
W my recollection on the rainy day fund
 
04:30:41.630 --> 04:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
there two times you can take the money
 
04:30:41.640 --> 04:30:42.590 align:start position:0%
there two times you can take the money
out

04:30:42.590 --> 04:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:30:45.630 --> 04:30:45.640 align:start position:0%
either the revenue comes up less than we
 
04:30:48.590 --> 04:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
assumed when we made the budget or the
 
04:30:52.349 --> 04:30:52.359 align:start position:0%
spending was more than the budget called
 
04:30:54.790 --> 04:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
for those are the two times you get in
 
04:30:58.389 --> 04:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
the rainy day funds that is correct so
 
04:31:03.510 --> 04:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that if
 
04:31:08.550 --> 04:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
um revenue is low or lower than expected
 
04:31:12.510 --> 04:31:12.520 align:start position:0%
in the budget the governor is both
 
04:31:16.630 --> 04:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
is authorized to and obligated to spend
 
04:31:20.429 --> 04:31:20.439 align:start position:0%
less by by cancelling whatever he can to
 
04:31:22.630 --> 04:31:22.640 align:start position:0%
make us not run out of money is that
 
04:31:25.309 --> 04:31:25.319 align:start position:0%
right that is also an option of course
 
04:31:27.229 --> 04:31:27.239 align:start position:0%
um control and expenditures before the
 
04:31:29.750 --> 04:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
end of the banum yes and we did that it
 
04:31:32.790 --> 04:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
was done during the uh pandemic time it
 
04:31:34.830 --> 04:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
was it was a difficult time there was uh
 
04:31:36.790 --> 04:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
there were some um limitations on the
 
04:31:38.870 --> 04:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
amount of spending and also there was
 
04:31:40.830 --> 04:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
there was the plan to to tap into the
 
04:31:44.510 --> 04:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
rain fund at point but um just the
 
04:31:47.269 --> 04:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
economy changed and and we receive uh
 
04:31:48.950 --> 04:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
funds from the federal from the federal
 
04:31:50.510 --> 04:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
government at that point things just
 
04:31:56.389 --> 04:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:58.469 --> 04:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
recovering representative eel and then
 
04:32:00.590 --> 04:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
representative Lane I I just wondered
 
04:32:02.750 --> 04:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
what was currently in the rainy day fund
 
04:32:05.710 --> 04:32:05.720 align:start position:0%
do you know I believe it's two um 292
 
04:32:05.720 --> 04:32:09.389 align:start position:0%
do you know I believe it's two um 292
million

04:32:09.389 --> 04:32:09.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:12.790 --> 04:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
dollar uh thank you um
 
04:32:15.590 --> 04:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
what are are there other reserves that
 
04:32:17.030 --> 04:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
you mentioned other reserves when you
 
04:32:18.830 --> 04:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
were talking would there be other
 
04:32:22.229 --> 04:32:22.239 align:start position:0%
reserves that we could take this money
 
04:32:25.389 --> 04:32:25.399 align:start position:0%
from no thank you for the question no so
 
04:32:27.910 --> 04:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
the rain f is really the the one Reserve
 
04:32:29.870 --> 04:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
we have I mean I was was speaking of
 
04:32:31.590 --> 04:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
strong reserves because we we have a
 
04:32:34.349 --> 04:32:34.359 align:start position:0%
strong cash position we still have oura
 
04:32:37.149 --> 04:32:37.159 align:start position:0%
funds but in reality everything has been
 
04:32:39.670 --> 04:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
appropriated through the budget process
 
04:32:41.630 --> 04:32:41.640 align:start position:0%
um probably the only items that have not
 
04:32:43.429 --> 04:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
been appropriated are the Surplus
 
04:32:45.229 --> 04:32:45.239 align:start position:0%
revenue or the additional Revenue we
 
04:32:48.910 --> 04:32:48.920 align:start position:0%
have received this year uh which is um
 
04:32:51.309 --> 04:32:51.319 align:start position:0%
th those are the funds the LBA tracks
 
04:32:53.950 --> 04:32:53.960 align:start position:0%
and those are the funds that are perhaps
 
04:32:56.189 --> 04:32:56.199 align:start position:0%
with all the various Appropriations that
 
04:32:58.349 --> 04:32:58.359 align:start position:0%
the legislature is considering during
 
04:33:01.309 --> 04:33:01.319 align:start position:0%
this off year um those will be funds
 
04:33:03.790 --> 04:33:03.800 align:start position:0%
that could be used for those additional
 
04:33:05.789 --> 04:33:05.799 align:start position:0%
Appropriations that were not part of the
 
04:33:05.799 --> 04:33:09.429 align:start position:0%
Appropriations that were not part of the
operating

04:33:09.429 --> 04:33:09.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:13.551 --> 04:33:13.561 align:start position:0%
budget represent grass uh you made a
 
04:33:15.150 --> 04:33:15.160 align:start position:0%
statement that you could take the funds
 
04:33:16.789 --> 04:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
out of the rainy day fund by two two
 
04:33:18.869 --> 04:33:18.879 align:start position:0%
ways one is that revenues are too low or
 
04:33:20.830 --> 04:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
expenditures too high but when
 
04:33:22.310 --> 04:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
addressing representative walner
 
04:33:23.390 --> 04:33:23.400 align:start position:0%
question was she said where did the
 
04:33:25.390 --> 04:33:25.400 align:start position:0%
100,000 $100 million come from you said
 
04:33:27.429 --> 04:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
it was done by legislative action so
 
04:33:28.709 --> 04:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
there was actually a third way we could
 
04:33:31.390 --> 04:33:31.400 align:start position:0%
take the money out by legislative action
 
04:33:33.590 --> 04:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
that that is correct that is correct it
 
04:33:36.109 --> 04:33:36.119 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be something I will recommend
 
04:33:37.670 --> 04:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
but that is that is
 
04:33:40.709 --> 04:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
a you're
 
04:33:43.510 --> 04:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
welcome so this is a question for the
 
04:33:47.830 --> 04:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
LBA the house passed two bills that put
 
04:33:50.349 --> 04:33:50.359 align:start position:0%
large expenses on the education trust
 
04:33:54.789 --> 04:33:54.799 align:start position:0%
fund one for just general uh 68 million
 
04:33:57.429 --> 04:33:57.439 align:start position:0%
if I remember right higher adequate
 
04:34:00.590 --> 04:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
education payments the other one was I
 
04:34:02.949 --> 04:34:02.959 align:start position:0%
think about $18 million for special
 
04:34:06.510 --> 04:34:06.520 align:start position:0%
education and I I looked at the status
 
04:34:08.830 --> 04:34:08.840 align:start position:0%
of uh this I saw the spe special
 
04:34:11.990 --> 04:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
education bill I think is is SK uh
 
04:34:14.390 --> 04:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
recommended interim study in this in the
 
04:34:16.551 --> 04:34:16.561 align:start position:0%
Senate do you know what the the other
 
04:34:49.830 --> 04:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:57.070 --> 04:34:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:00.230 --> 04:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
is in the Senate finance
 
04:35:02.310 --> 04:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
committee and I don't believe they've
 
04:35:05.670 --> 04:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:09.629 --> 04:35:09.639 align:start position:0%
yet thank you other discussion on the
 
04:35:09.639 --> 04:35:11.949 align:start position:0%
yet thank you other discussion on the

yes we're way past 2 o' so we can start
 
04:37:12.869 --> 04:37:12.879 align:start position:0%
on Sate Bill 553
 
04:37:25.429 --> 04:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:28.789 --> 04:37:28.799 align:start position:0%
all you leaving not leaving leaving I
 
04:37:46.670 --> 04:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:46.680 --> 04:37:50.590 align:start position:0%
 
I

04:37:50.590 --> 04:37:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:54.429 --> 04:37:54.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:18.590 --> 04:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:22.070 --> 04:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
so I asked Melissa to uh create a little
 
04:38:25.070 --> 04:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
packet of the relevant laws in case
 
04:38:26.670 --> 04:38:26.680 align:start position:0%
anybody would like to
 
04:38:26.680 --> 04:38:28.429 align:start position:0%
anybody would like to
know

04:38:28.429 --> 04:38:28.439 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:38:32.269 --> 04:38:32.279 align:start position:0%
um you know read existing law and so on
 
04:38:35.269 --> 04:38:35.279 align:start position:0%
um it turns out it's it's a little weird
 
04:38:35.279 --> 04:38:36.830 align:start position:0%
um it turns out it's it's a little weird
that

04:38:36.830 --> 04:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:38:41.470 --> 04:38:41.480 align:start position:0%
um the the this this uh fund has been
 
04:38:44.029 --> 04:38:44.039 align:start position:0%
been in existence since
 
04:38:46.910 --> 04:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
1991 but it's only been under the
 
04:38:49.910 --> 04:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
treasurer since last year it previously
 
04:38:52.390 --> 04:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
had been under the banking commissioner
 
04:38:54.750 --> 04:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
so that may be why the treasurer doesn't
 
04:38:56.910 --> 04:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
have rules and things like that right
 
04:38:58.750 --> 04:38:58.760 align:start position:0%
because it's it's it hasn't been very
 
04:39:02.470 --> 04:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
long so um but in any case the the
 
04:39:04.830 --> 04:39:04.840 align:start position:0%
language in the law is essentially the
 
04:39:07.189 --> 04:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
same as it was under the banking
 
04:39:10.150 --> 04:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner um for many many you know
 
04:39:14.470 --> 04:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
well over 30 years so um but that
 
04:39:18.070 --> 04:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
information's in in this but and so I
 
04:39:21.029 --> 04:39:21.039 align:start position:0%
guess that representative Sweeney would
 
04:39:22.230 --> 04:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
like to
 
04:39:22.240 --> 04:39:24.029 align:start position:0%
like to
offer

04:39:24.029 --> 04:39:24.039 align:start position:0%
offer
 
04:39:29.310 --> 04:39:29.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1843 1843 and okay
 
04:39:31.189 --> 04:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
representative evil a second and we'll
 
04:39:33.029 --> 04:39:33.039 align:start position:0%
speak to his motion perect thank you
 
04:39:35.349 --> 04:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chairman uh so this was the
 
04:39:36.750 --> 04:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
bill that we were about to inter room
 
04:39:38.430 --> 04:39:38.440 align:start position:0%
study yesterday and we we just wanted to
 
04:39:40.708 --> 04:39:40.718 align:start position:0%
give stakeholders one more day sort of
 
04:39:42.750 --> 04:39:42.760 align:start position:0%
discuss it with the treasurer uh this
 
04:39:44.670 --> 04:39:44.680 align:start position:0%
amendment represents a compromise
 
04:39:46.310 --> 04:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
between the proponents of the
 
04:39:48.590 --> 04:39:48.600 align:start position:0%
legislation and the treasurer in order
 
04:39:50.670 --> 04:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
to make this uh from the original bill
 
04:39:53.350 --> 04:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
which was going to mandate 100% of the
 
04:39:57.030 --> 04:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
of P dip into invested in New Hampshire
 
04:39:58.910 --> 04:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
uh this is an encouragement bill now
 
04:40:02.270 --> 04:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
that will simply ask them to strive that
 
04:40:04.670 --> 04:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
no less than 30% be invested in New
 
04:40:06.990 --> 04:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh but there is no requirement
 
04:40:09.788 --> 04:40:09.798 align:start position:0%
within the within this amendment or or
 
04:40:12.070 --> 04:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
once we amend the legislation that would
 
04:40:14.628 --> 04:40:14.638 align:start position:0%
actually require uh the investment be in
 
04:40:15.990 --> 04:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but it will just show the
 
04:40:18.310 --> 04:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
legislative intent and encouragement
 
04:40:20.628 --> 04:40:20.638 align:start position:0%
that the fund be partially invested in
 
04:40:22.590 --> 04:40:22.600 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire uh while
 
04:40:24.470 --> 04:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
still maintaining that the and I'll
 
04:40:26.550 --> 04:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
quote directly the investment advisor
 
04:40:28.110 --> 04:40:28.120 align:start position:0%
selected by the state treasurer and
 
04:40:30.430 --> 04:40:30.440 align:start position:0%
advisory committee shall achieve and
 
04:40:32.670 --> 04:40:32.680 align:start position:0%
maintain the highest attainable rating
 
04:40:34.550 --> 04:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
for stable value local government
 
04:40:37.270 --> 04:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
investment pools uh right above that we
 
04:40:39.070 --> 04:40:39.080 align:start position:0%
say the investment advisor selected by
 
04:40:40.910 --> 04:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
the state treasur and advisory committee
 
04:40:43.788 --> 04:40:43.798 align:start position:0%
shall strive to maintain no less than
 
04:40:45.868 --> 04:40:45.878 align:start position:0%
30% of the funds held by the public
 
04:40:48.788 --> 04:40:48.798 align:start position:0%
deposit investment pool in insured or
 
04:40:50.350 --> 04:40:50.360 align:start position:0%
collateralized deposits meet the
 
04:40:52.470 --> 04:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
requirements of RSA
 
04:40:57.070 --> 04:40:57.080 align:start position:0%
68i and 68 I a so the real emphasis to
 
04:40:59.110 --> 04:40:59.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment is that their main
 
04:41:02.110 --> 04:41:02.120 align:start position:0%
priority is to obtain the highest
 
04:41:04.230 --> 04:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
attainable rating for stable value local
 
04:41:06.390 --> 04:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
government investment pools and while
 
04:41:08.990 --> 04:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
striving to make sure that 30% meet the
 
04:41:11.670 --> 04:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
original intent of the bill um there is
 
04:41:14.708 --> 04:41:14.718 align:start position:0%
an update to the definition of ratings
 
04:41:17.750 --> 04:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
in the bill in the amendment uh further
 
04:41:19.670 --> 04:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
conversations with the treasurer that I
 
04:41:22.150 --> 04:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
would just want to read in uh to this
 
04:41:24.190 --> 04:41:24.200 align:start position:0%
amendment uh as a friendly Amendment
 
04:41:27.070 --> 04:41:27.080 align:start position:0%
instead of lines 25 through 27 for the
 
04:41:30.070 --> 04:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
purposes uh striking that and just say
 
04:41:32.270 --> 04:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
the credit rating is an indication of
 
04:41:34.670 --> 04:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
the ability to preserve Principle as
 
04:41:36.590 --> 04:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
determined by a nationally recognized
 
04:41:39.350 --> 04:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
statistical ratings organization just to
 
04:41:40.910 --> 04:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
provide that definition as to what
 
04:41:43.150 --> 04:41:43.160 align:start position:0%
credit rating in the in the terms of
 
04:41:45.830 --> 04:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is uh and for Monday's meeting
 
04:41:48.070 --> 04:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
I'll have a an updated Amendment with
 
04:41:50.550 --> 04:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
that directly in it but that is I think
 
04:41:52.510 --> 04:41:52.520 align:start position:0%
there we we heard a lot about people
 
04:41:55.590 --> 04:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
wanting to protect pip as it is we heard
 
04:41:58.110 --> 04:41:58.120 align:start position:0%
from from stakeholders of the the value
 
04:41:59.510 --> 04:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
that would be added to New Hampshire's
 
04:42:02.110 --> 04:42:02.120 align:start position:0%
economy with with more money invested in
 
04:42:04.070 --> 04:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire I think this
 
04:42:07.150 --> 04:42:07.160 align:start position:0%
amendment can can protect PP while also
 
04:42:09.270 --> 04:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
investing in our own economy um and it's
 
04:42:11.628 --> 04:42:11.638 align:start position:0%
a good Middle Road for for the problem
 
04:42:14.510 --> 04:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
that's been uh brought forward to us
 
04:42:17.150 --> 04:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you um representative
 
04:42:19.190 --> 04:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
Griffin thank you Mr
 
04:42:22.590 --> 04:42:22.600 align:start position:0%
chair um I looked at the
 
04:42:25.510 --> 04:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
amendment I I'm still very unhappy with
 
04:42:28.390 --> 04:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
the shells strive and the
 
04:42:31.708 --> 04:42:31.718 align:start position:0%
30% I think now that we know the history
 
04:42:34.990 --> 04:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
of uh the fund and the changes in the
 
04:42:37.708 --> 04:42:37.718 align:start position:0%
law that were made to it last
 
04:42:41.750 --> 04:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
year uh we should give the uh the fund
 
04:42:44.788 --> 04:42:44.798 align:start position:0%
administrator and the policy committee
 
04:42:49.390 --> 04:42:49.400 align:start position:0%
time to develop policies on their own
 
04:42:52.830 --> 04:42:52.840 align:start position:0%
that may encourage investment in in New
 
04:42:56.190 --> 04:42:56.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and still maintain the safety
 
04:42:58.110 --> 04:42:58.120 align:start position:0%
of the fund and not
 
04:43:01.070 --> 04:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily Target a certain percentage
 
04:43:04.390 --> 04:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
so I will be voting no against the
 
04:43:08.470 --> 04:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
amendment and supporting a motion to uh
 
04:43:12.670 --> 04:43:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:15.628 --> 04:43:15.638 align:start position:0%
represent Cal thank you Mr chair in
 
04:43:17.910 --> 04:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
reading the amendment I believe that
 
04:43:20.030 --> 04:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
this amendment is that encouragement for
 
04:43:22.190 --> 04:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
them to look at their policies and it is
 
04:43:24.670 --> 04:43:24.680 align:start position:0%
not a mandate therefore I would be
 
04:43:24.680 --> 04:43:26.510 align:start position:0%
not a mandate therefore I would be
supporting

04:43:26.510 --> 04:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
supporting
 
04:43:29.510 --> 04:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
it representative grassy yes thank you
 
04:43:33.470 --> 04:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I have to to disagree I
 
04:43:35.550 --> 04:43:35.560 align:start position:0%
first of all I I this bill should have
 
04:43:37.270 --> 04:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
went to Commerce instead of here where
 
04:43:38.590 --> 04:43:38.600 align:start position:0%
they have a little more experience in
 
04:43:40.190 --> 04:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
dealing with banking issues and
 
04:43:42.310 --> 04:43:42.320 align:start position:0%
investment issues but but secondly I
 
04:43:43.590 --> 04:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
think that you know one of the first
 
04:43:44.990 --> 04:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
things I think was said is that this is
 
04:43:47.110 --> 04:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
an agreement was reached between the
 
04:43:49.350 --> 04:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
parties uh but it was the treasurer and
 
04:43:50.750 --> 04:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
the banking industry that it was reached
 
04:43:52.230 --> 04:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
was where were the cities and towns that
 
04:43:54.270 --> 04:43:54.280 align:start position:0%
spoke against this bill where were they
 
04:43:56.350 --> 04:43:56.360 align:start position:0%
in that negotiations I think that one of
 
04:43:57.788 --> 04:43:57.798 align:start position:0%
the things that we left out and what
 
04:43:59.270 --> 04:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
I've received a number of phone calls
 
04:44:00.868 --> 04:44:00.878 align:start position:0%
with people that I've worked with in the
 
04:44:03.350 --> 04:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
past for the small cities and towns who
 
04:44:05.070 --> 04:44:05.080 align:start position:0%
do not have the ability to invest on
 
04:44:08.470 --> 04:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
their own um and and and get rates that
 
04:44:10.590 --> 04:44:10.600 align:start position:0%
they're able to get through the pool and
 
04:44:12.070 --> 04:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
I think that that's the important thing
 
04:44:14.830 --> 04:44:14.840 align:start position:0%
is that until we hear from them I don't
 
04:44:16.670 --> 04:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
think I can support this and I would
 
04:44:18.708 --> 04:44:18.718 align:start position:0%
rather see this go to interim study so
 
04:44:20.590 --> 04:44:20.600 align:start position:0%
that we can take a look and and bring
 
04:44:22.830 --> 04:44:22.840 align:start position:0%
the cities and towns who opposed the
 
04:44:25.590 --> 04:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
original bill into this negotiation so
 
04:44:27.270 --> 04:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
we can sit down and maybe we can find an
 
04:44:29.070 --> 04:44:29.080 align:start position:0%
agreement between everybody but
 
04:44:30.510 --> 04:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
negotiations between the bank and the
 
04:44:32.628 --> 04:44:32.638 align:start position:0%
treasurer leaves out all those small
 
04:44:35.470 --> 04:44:35.480 align:start position:0%
communities that we
 
04:44:38.670 --> 04:44:38.680 align:start position:0%
represent thank you further
 
04:44:42.628 --> 04:44:42.638 align:start position:0%
discussion no all right yeah I'm uh I'm
 
04:44:45.070 --> 04:44:45.080 align:start position:0%
with uh Representatives Griffin and
 
04:44:48.788 --> 04:44:48.798 align:start position:0%
grassy on this um I tend to
 
04:44:52.030 --> 04:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
think this is a very successful program
 
04:44:55.390 --> 04:44:55.400 align:start position:0%
all the people we spoke to who use it
 
04:44:57.628 --> 04:44:57.638 align:start position:0%
like it don't want it change we had
 
04:45:00.708 --> 04:45:00.718 align:start position:0%
another two letters today one from uh
 
04:45:04.230 --> 04:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
Randolph one from coas County both say
 
04:45:05.510 --> 04:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
don't make any
 
04:45:09.750 --> 04:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
changes you know I think you know 30% of
 
04:45:11.670 --> 04:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
a mistake is still
 
04:45:14.030 --> 04:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
mistake so
 
04:45:17.550 --> 04:45:17.560 align:start position:0%
um so I'm going to be voting no also all
 
04:45:19.590 --> 04:45:19.600 align:start position:0%
right what further discussion
 
04:45:22.670 --> 04:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
representative evil yeah um I agreed to
 
04:45:25.788 --> 04:45:25.798 align:start position:0%
sign on to the amendment with uh rep
 
04:45:27.310 --> 04:45:27.320 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney and I thank him
 
04:45:30.230 --> 04:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
for bringing it Forward I I mean as I
 
04:45:32.070 --> 04:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
read this this is purely an
 
04:45:34.948 --> 04:45:34.958 align:start position:0%
encouragement um approach uh
 
04:45:38.430 --> 04:45:38.440 align:start position:0%
encouragement that I was persuaded was
 
04:45:40.350 --> 04:45:40.360 align:start position:0%
important and needed based on the
 
04:45:42.070 --> 04:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
testimony that we heard during the
 
04:45:45.030 --> 04:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
original hearing and then as far as the
 
04:45:47.110 --> 04:45:47.120 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm very respectful of the
 
04:45:50.270 --> 04:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities I didn't see that the New
 
04:45:53.030 --> 04:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association took a
 
04:45:56.110 --> 04:45:56.120 align:start position:0%
position on this I know they didn't um
 
04:45:58.708 --> 04:45:58.718 align:start position:0%
but the other important Point here is if
 
04:46:01.190 --> 04:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
there's concerns about return for the P
 
04:46:04.470 --> 04:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
dip if you invest locally there's a
 
04:46:06.788 --> 04:46:06.798 align:start position:0%
requirement here that they shall achieve
 
04:46:08.990 --> 04:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
and maintain the highest attainable
 
04:46:12.708 --> 04:46:12.718 align:start position:0%
rating uh for the pools so I think that
 
04:46:17.990 --> 04:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
answers the return concern and for that
 
04:46:21.830 --> 04:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
reason um I will be supporting the
 
04:46:24.270 --> 04:46:24.280 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you I'll just I'll just
 
04:46:28.510 --> 04:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
point out rating here is about uh safety
 
04:46:32.670 --> 04:46:32.680 align:start position:0%
it is not about return as far as I I am
 
04:46:36.788 --> 04:46:36.798 align:start position:0%
believe and and interestingly enough
 
04:46:39.788 --> 04:46:39.798 align:start position:0%
none of the language in law for many
 
04:46:42.470 --> 04:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
many years said said anything about
 
04:46:44.830 --> 04:46:44.840 align:start position:0%
return you know it didn't say you know
 
04:46:47.030 --> 04:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
you would expect it to say you
 
04:46:49.948 --> 04:46:49.958 align:start position:0%
know achieve the highest possible return
 
04:46:51.910 --> 04:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
given an adequate level of safety or
 
04:46:53.510 --> 04:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
something like that but it actually
 
04:46:55.708 --> 04:46:55.718 align:start position:0%
didn't say any of that it just said to
 
04:46:59.030 --> 04:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
the advisory committee you come up with
 
04:47:01.350 --> 04:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
criteria and that's what they naturally
 
04:47:05.430 --> 04:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
did so anyway um let's have a vote I
 
04:47:07.708 --> 04:47:07.718 align:start position:0%
guess are we ready when the clerk is
 
04:47:12.708 --> 04:47:12.718 align:start position:0%
ready yep okay all right um uh okay this
 
04:47:15.750 --> 04:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
is just on the amend so
 
04:47:19.990 --> 04:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
1843 H representative Griffin no
 
04:47:21.750 --> 04:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
