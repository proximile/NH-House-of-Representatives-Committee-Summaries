10 o'clock we'll open the work session
 
00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 align:start position:0%
on a house bill
 
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
1583 and since Dr was so accommodating
 
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
yesterday we'll give you first
 
00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.590 align:start position:0%
 
morning

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
and we have your hand up yes um good
 
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
morning uh members of the committee my
 
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
name is Keen M Wong tax policy council
 
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
with the Dr and good morning Lawrence
 
00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 align:start position:0%
gyon Revenue council with the no
 
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Dr um so once again to
 
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 align:start position:0%
reiterate Dr doesn't have a position
 
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 align:start position:0%
it's neutral on on the bill on the
 
00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 align:start position:0%
amendment um and um we went we read
 
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
through the amendment and came up with
 
00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 align:start position:0%
uh some some observations in terms of
 
00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 align:start position:0%
the administration of the uh the
 
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
amendment so we like to see clar
 
00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 align:start position:0%
ification or even U Point certain um
 
00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 align:start position:0%
potential um roadblocks that we could
 
00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 align:start position:0%
see um in terms of the uh the the
 
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
administration of of the amendment and I
 
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
let um Lawrence um go through those
 
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
observations you do have them in front
 
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 align:start position:0%
of you so I'll try to go more high level
 
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
and not Point by point so you have so
 
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not wasting anybody's time here um
 
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 align:start position:0%
in regards to the adjustment of the
 
00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 align:start position:0%
amount it in terms of How It's worded in
 
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 align:start position:0%
the new bill and with the amendment
 
00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 align:start position:0%
a little concern uh
 
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
regarding the specific language as to
 
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
swept is going to fund 773 as opposed to
 
00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 align:start position:0%
the swept is to be calculated to achieve
 
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
that Revenue amount so there's a number
 
00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 align:start position:0%
of calculations that go into the
 
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
formulation of the tax rate that
 
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
achieves swept and so the deter that
 
00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 align:start position:0%
calculation requires a fixed number to
 
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
be reached and so the language as
 
00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 align:start position:0%
written creates a question of how that
 
00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 align:start position:0%
is going to achieved whether the rate
 
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
would need to be a little more fluid in
 
00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 align:start position:0%
order to achieve 773 or if the rate is
 
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
intended to reach that and that's what
 
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
the rate is set to be calculated for and
 
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
so it just creates a bit of a gray area
 
00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
and possible challenges and issues down
 
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
the road uh paragraph two under the uh
 
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
under the bill also it's not in my our
 
00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:52.159 align:start position:0%
notes there but it does potentially
 
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
create a distortive effect uh depending
 
00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:57.879 align:start position:0%
on when warrants are issued warrants for
 
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
202 for this fiscal year were set last
 
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 align:start position:0%
fall and so uh the presumption is that
 
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
this amendment this bill would require
 
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
an amended warrant to be issued this
 
00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 align:start position:0%
summer otherwise the December billing
 
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
which would true up to achieve that 773
 
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
will be extremely distortive and so
 
00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:17.759 align:start position:0%
you're going to see a lopsided billing
 
00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 align:start position:0%
effect and that Distortion continues in
 
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
the following paragraphs uh where the
 
00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
rate that the amount that to be
 
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
collected is now a percentage b a
 
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
calculation based off of admr so you no
 
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
longer have a fixed amount and so
 
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 align:start position:0%
there's a potential for that warrant
 
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
again one of the other issues identified
 
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
that we identified as a potential
 
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
problem is there's no uh Clarity in
 
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
terms of the expectation for excess
 
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 align:start position:0%
swept in terms of collections there's
 
00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 align:start position:0%
the assessed amount and then there's
 
00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 align:start position:0%
what it actually ends up being collected
 
00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 align:start position:0%
and historically those amounts are
 
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 align:start position:0%
generally pretty uh accurate is my
 
00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
understanding but should there be a
 
00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 align:start position:0%
shortfall or just a temporal shortfall
 
00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:07.759 align:start position:0%
it uh clarity as to whether the
 
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 align:start position:0%
municipality is on the hook for that
 
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 align:start position:0%
access right out out the
 
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
gate sure thank you and thank you for
 
00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 align:start position:0%
being here and for taking questions I'm
 
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 align:start position:0%
just trying to make sure I understand as
 
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
we go because two minutes later it may
 
00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
be too late for me um so you are saying
 
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 align:start position:0%
that right now we set a swept rate but
 
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
we don't necessarily know how much the
 
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 align:start position:0%
time Town collects because the swept you
 
00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
know the original calculation is just an
 
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
estimate and then we threw up to the
 
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 align:start position:0%
actuals right so so is that what we are
 
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
talking about here so the rate itself is
 
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
is Cal is set to calculate a certain
 
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
amount for the general assessment to be
 
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
at a certain amount right tax collection
 
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 align:start position:0%
efforts are performed by the
 
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities and so which may or may
 
00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 align:start position:0%
not collect the same amount because of
 
00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
many factors there a potential there may
 
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 align:start position:0%
be a shortfall there may be a temporal
 
00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
there may be an appeal yeah and and so
 
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.150 align:start position:0%
there may be an appeal yeah and and so
there

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
that there's the possibility that a
 
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
municipality doesn't collect the full
 
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
swept amount in the time frame and are
 
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
they then on the hook for that okay so
 
00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:10.759 align:start position:0%
your concern is if we expect the
 
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 align:start position:0%
municipality to collect x amount right
 
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
now if the municipality does not collect
 
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280 align:start position:0%
quite that it's their problem because
 
00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
they retain it so they deal with it
 
00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.400 align:start position:0%
right but right now because we would be
 
00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
expected to transfer it again if they
 
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
are under the estimates now do they owe
 
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 align:start position:0%
or do we recognize that's your question
 
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 align:start position:0%
and concern abolutely just making sure I
 
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
you if I could provide further Clarity
 
00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.780 align:start position:0%
 
question

00:06:59.780 --> 00:06:59.790 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:08.940 align:start position:0%
question
[Laughter]

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:08.950 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:16.110 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:16.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.070 align:start position:0%
 
sence

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:17.080 align:start position:0%
sence
 
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.589 align:start position:0%
sence
says

00:07:19.589 --> 00:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
773 Statewide
 
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.990 align:start position:0%
773 Statewide
based

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
based
 
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.510 align:start position:0%
based
not

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:32.199 align:start position:0%
773 can you can you
 
00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:34.919 align:start position:0%
that that that is one of the items we
 
00:07:38.469 --> 00:07:38.479 align:start position:0%
identified as of concern which is why
 
00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
we'd ask for the original language to be
 
00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
retained to set the the swept rate will
 
00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:45.080 align:start position:0%
be calculated to assess an amount equal
 
00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
to that's the original language that
 
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
that's a off the cuff I I don't have the
 
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
exact quote off hand but the bills uh
 
00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
the statute original
 
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
language require Dr to set a rate to
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
calculate a swept amount of
 
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.230 align:start position:0%
calculate a swept amount of
the

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.869 align:start position:0%
 
363

00:08:04.869 --> 00:08:04.879 align:start position:0%
363
 
00:08:07.629 --> 00:08:07.639 align:start position:0%
and and and also just to add the the
 
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
amendment here um So currently as as the
 
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
law is working right now um the Dr is
 
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
suppos is T to calculate um a rate to
 
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
achieve a revenue amount for the swept
 
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
of 363 so the amendment here in fact
 
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
actually changes that language we're not
 
00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:29.080 align:start position:0%
now calculating the way I see it we're
 
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
not calculating the swept amount the
 
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:32.360 align:start position:0%
revenue for the swep amount we're
 
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:34.120 align:start position:0%
calculating for the Statewide based
 
00:08:39.469 --> 00:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
adequacy a to be paid um through a swep
 
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
tax um so it's it's right that's so
 
00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:47.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:51.509 --> 00:08:51.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:56.240 align:start position:0%
yeah turning to page two uh in regards
 
00:08:58.910 --> 00:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
to the Appropriations cap uh Dr does
 
00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
anticipate the this would require
 
00:09:02.949 --> 00:09:02.959 align:start position:0%
considerable effort to calculate and set
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
as well as a question as to who is
 
00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
calculating the percentage cap itself
 
00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:08.959 align:start position:0%
whether that be the Dr the department of
 
00:09:12.509 --> 00:09:12.519 align:start position:0%
Ed or some other body uh and a lot of
 
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
that calculation and cap percentage is
 
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:16.760 align:start position:0%
going to rely on information gathering
 
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
primarily uh falling on the shoulders of
 
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:25.880 align:start position:0%
reporting CH could I ask a question
 
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
please so you're saying that that's
 
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:29.800 align:start position:0%
going to fall in the backs of the
 
00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:32.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities so is this going to be
 
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
another burden for them is it something
 
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
special they're going to have to do on
 
00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
top of what they already do I would have
 
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
to defer to the municipalities in
 
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
answering that it would depend on their
 
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
information collection as it is and uh
 
00:09:47.069 --> 00:09:47.079 align:start position:0%
there is already reporting to the Dr but
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
depending on how this cap is implemented
 
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
there is would be potential for
 
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:53.800 align:start position:0%
additional information so we don't know
 
00:09:56.069 --> 00:09:56.079 align:start position:0%
correct thank
 
00:09:59.509 --> 00:09:59.519 align:start position:0%
you doing a calculation all this is
 
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:02.200 align:start position:0%
saying is there might be additional
 
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
calculation with all du respect I think
 
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
we have to wait and see what M
 
00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:17.560 align:start position:0%
different well uh that's a true
 
00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
statement please continue oh can we get
 
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
get through it we're gonna we're going
 
00:10:26.069 --> 00:10:26.079 align:start position:0%
to die on the vine here uh because we're
 
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
not going to solve all these tell me
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
what a is a critical issue that's going
 
00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:32.959 align:start position:0%
to kill this amendment without critical
 
00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
issue not this maybe this maybe that
 
00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:36.680 align:start position:0%
maybe tell me the critical
 
00:10:39.269 --> 00:10:39.279 align:start position:0%
issues that we need amendments on I
 
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
think the greatest uh requirement here
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
is Clarity in terms of timing and
 
00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:45.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility uh regarding the
 
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
disallowance of Appropriations by Dr
 
00:10:49.949 --> 00:10:49.959 align:start position:0%
requires reporting for the
 
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities sufficient enough for us
 
00:10:55.069 --> 00:10:55.079 align:start position:0%
to allow to do so as well as guidance as
 
00:10:56.829 --> 00:10:56.839 align:start position:0%
to how those disallowances are supposed
 
00:10:58.870 --> 00:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
to be processed assuming that process
 
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
goes into to effect whether a general
 
00:11:03.629 --> 00:11:03.639 align:start position:0%
operating budget is approved by the
 
00:11:07.389 --> 00:11:07.399 align:start position:0%
municipal voters if it isn't by a 2third
 
00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:09.320 align:start position:0%
vote uh which would be the majority
 
00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
required to exceed the cap how or
 
00:11:13.509 --> 00:11:13.519 align:start position:0%
disallowance is intended to be processed
 
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
to the extent their individual uh
 
00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
Appropriations that are voted on in
 
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
excess of the cap is it a reverse order
 
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
Clarity in terms of how that process is
 
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
supposed to work uh would be crucial in
 
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
regards to that so uh Dr to the extent
 
00:11:30.269 --> 00:11:30.279 align:start position:0%
that this cap is going be placed in into
 
00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:31.839 align:start position:0%
effect and Appropriations would be
 
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
required uh Ru making ability may be
 
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
critical to our ability to properly
 
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
administer that cap um as well as
 
00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:43.160 align:start position:0%
clarity as to whether the dr's uh
 
00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:45.279 align:start position:0%
ability to create forms without going
 
00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:46.959 align:start position:0%
through the jail car process for this
 
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
process is an exception uh a second
 
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
major issue of concern is to the extent
 
00:11:56.069 --> 00:11:56.079 align:start position:0%
that the municipalities are on the hook
 
00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
for excess or they choose not to remit
 
00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:00.760 align:start position:0%
the excess the language of the amendment
 
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
and the statute currently used the term
 
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
taxpayer if municipalities are to be
 
00:12:07.629 --> 00:12:07.639 align:start position:0%
termed as taxpayers that runs into
 
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
issues of Dr confidentiality
 
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
requirements and additional carve out
 
00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:14.519 align:start position:0%
may be required as well as the ability
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
of Dr to enforce tax uh colle tax
 
00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
collection efforts against the
 
00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
municipality and Clarity around that
 
00:12:22.829 --> 00:12:22.839 align:start position:0%
process and whether or not it is
 
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
available I think those would be the
 
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
crucial issues uh that we'd be seeking
 
00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
Clarity on the the the uh effective date
 
00:12:33.629 --> 00:12:33.639 align:start position:0%
of this is July 1 of
 
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
2024 and the first action from the Dr Dr
 
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
is January
 
00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
1 with the invoices is that my that's my
 
00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
understanding the question is it's six
 
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
months enough time to have rules and get
 
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.590 align:start position:0%
months enough time to have rules and get
this

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:57.069 --> 00:12:57.079 align:start position:0%
done the answer is maybe I know yes
 
00:12:58.590 --> 00:12:58.600 align:start position:0%
because going through the jail card
 
00:13:00.629 --> 00:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
process is as you may know um there's
 
00:13:02.509 --> 00:13:02.519 align:start position:0%
the public hearing process and then
 
00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
receiving comments and then addressing
 
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
public comments addressing OLS concerns
 
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:11.480 align:start position:0%
so it is at least six months to to go
 
00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
through the uh the jail car process the
 
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
the ru making process okay
 
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
representative Heath thank you Mr
 
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
chair with this knowledge and with the
 
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
knowledge that we still have so many
 
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
questions about cooperatives um there's
 
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
a myriad of ISS issues with this
 
00:13:32.829 --> 00:13:32.839 align:start position:0%
amendment I'd like to suggest that we
 
00:13:35.629 --> 00:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
send the amendment to the subcommittee
 
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:38.680 align:start position:0%
we'll be working this summer um and then
 
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
we can a lot has to be done here and the
 
00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
time frame is tight I just don't see how
 
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
we can go forward with such a
 
00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:50.120 align:start position:0%
significant amendment that has such an
 
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
impact on our city and I never thought
 
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
I'd be saying this but I honestly have
 
00:13:58.350 --> 00:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
to say that I'm feeling it's very unfair
 
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
for the we excess weep towns to Bear the
 
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
burden of having to raise the whole $91
 
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:07.480 align:start position:0%
million so I would like to make a motion
 
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
that we transfer this um we re refer
 
00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:15.880 align:start position:0%
this amendment um to the subcomittee on
 
00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.150 align:start position:0%
this amendment um to the subcomittee on
education

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
funding and if one of my colleagues
 
00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:21.079 align:start position:0%
would have it a
 
00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:25.959 align:start position:0%
second yes y thank you Mr chair um you
 
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
asked Dar to come up you know with the
 
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:30.680 align:start position:0%
one thing that's really the problem here
 
00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
you know that we could focus on and what
 
00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:34.959 align:start position:0%
I heard is that Dar basically said the
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
problem is throughout the entire
 
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:38.680 align:start position:0%
amendment that there's not one thing
 
00:14:40.949 --> 00:14:40.959 align:start position:0%
that I mean he listed uh I don't know I
 
00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
can't keep up I don't type that fast but
 
00:14:44.069 --> 00:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
he list half a dozen things that needed
 
00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:46.120 align:start position:0%
to be addressed so I don't think there
 
00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
is one thing I think that there is a
 
00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
complicated um Nest here that really
 
00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:52.600 align:start position:0%
needs to be sorted out so I would
 
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
support that motion that we send it to
 
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee which has the the
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
knowledge of Education they have they
 
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
understand excess swept towns they
 
00:15:01.949 --> 00:15:01.959 align:start position:0%
understand the poorer towns they
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
understand the consequences that
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes we've missed um and to send it
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
back to them for them to work on it
 
00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:10.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps in conjunction with with people
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
with Finance because we can bring in our
 
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
own perspective for that but um I just
 
00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
feel especially when we you asked for
 
00:15:18.189 --> 00:15:18.199 align:start position:0%
one thing and he just started listing a
 
00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:20.120 align:start position:0%
whole slew of things and I couldn't keep
 
00:15:22.269 --> 00:15:22.279 align:start position:0%
up typing so I would support um
 
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
Representatives he's motion if you
 
00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:25.480 align:start position:0%
please I'm not disagreeing but I don't
 
00:15:28.189 --> 00:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
know if most of these are procedural
 
00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:30.440 align:start position:0%
they're not about the concept they're
 
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
not killing the concept they're saying
 
00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:33.560 align:start position:0%
this is very complicated it's going to
 
00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
take a lot of work it's not that work's
 
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
not going to get done until there's
 
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
something to do nobody's going to solve
 
00:15:41.309 --> 00:15:41.319 align:start position:0%
this problem until there's something to
 
00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:43.519 align:start position:0%
do right now there's nothing to do if it
 
00:15:45.189 --> 00:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
goes to subcommittee there's nothing to
 
00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
do so nobody's going to solve the
 
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
problem oh so I I I don't I I agree with
 
00:15:53.949 --> 00:15:53.959 align:start position:0%
you that this could be problematic but
 
00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
if we don't try to do something
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
nothing's going to happen you started
 
00:16:00.189 --> 00:16:00.199 align:start position:0%
this is something you know you did start
 
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
something you this is something and I
 
00:16:03.949 --> 00:16:03.959 align:start position:0%
think this is something that we can send
 
00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
to the subcommittee for them to start
 
00:16:07.309 --> 00:16:07.319 align:start position:0%
working on because it's not just
 
00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:09.160 align:start position:0%
procedural there are some policy
 
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
questions when you're talking about the
 
00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
differences of poor communities and
 
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
wealthier communities um the common sent
 
00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:17.240 align:start position:0%
is municipality on the hook or as a
 
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
taxpayer on the hook um these are things
 
00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
that I think are better addressed
 
00:16:22.629 --> 00:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
through the education committee but this
 
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
is something and there are things we
 
00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
certainly I sure as heck support the
 
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
7,000 you know that and I think this is
 
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
a start this is something you can work
 
00:16:32.269 --> 00:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
with they don't need to start with a
 
00:16:34.389 --> 00:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
blank slate they can start with this
 
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
information this amendment and take
 
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
their knowledge around education and how
 
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
swept works and the differences between
 
00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:42.680 align:start position:0%
the communities and work out some of
 
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
these issues I think that would be a
 
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
really good second step okay by a show
 
00:16:48.629 --> 00:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
of hands how many people would like to
 
00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
send this to the
 
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.150 align:start position:0%
send this to the
subcommittee

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
each we've got an education one that I'm
 
00:16:58.710 --> 00:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
on the one the one there's four all
 
00:16:58.720 --> 00:16:59.350 align:start position:0%
on the one the one there's four all
those

00:16:59.350 --> 00:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
who don't don't want to send this to the
 
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee okay four to four motion
 
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:12.429 --> 00:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
continue I I I believe I addressed your
 
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
last question of what the the key issue
 
00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
that I I that we saw at the Dr okay uh I
 
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
can proceed through the document again
 
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
further but if there are any other
 
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
questions I think that may be more
 
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
productive since you already have the
 
00:17:25.789 --> 00:17:25.799 align:start position:0%
document in front of you well you you
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
know my position it's my Amendment so
 
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I'm loathed to say y nuts let's
 
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
don't do it it's too hard this is going
 
00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
to be terrible to do this no doubt about
 
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
it because it's a new process we're
 
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
starting with the number up here and
 
00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:45.160 align:start position:0%
then figuring out how to get there so
 
00:17:48.669 --> 00:17:48.679 align:start position:0%
it's a a widely different approach as I
 
00:17:50.029 --> 00:17:50.039 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
but okay Mary you're on a roll I'm
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
sorry this this amendment it
 
00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
it limits local communities in terms of
 
00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
how much they can spend on education and
 
00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:08.360 align:start position:0%
then in order to increase they have to
 
00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
have a 2third vote which is difficult
 
00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
always at best there are so many things
 
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
in the amendment that we don't know I
 
00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:19.720 align:start position:0%
think um representative cordelli when he
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
spoke about the cooperatives there are
 
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
just too many unknowns how it will
 
00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:28.280 align:start position:0%
impact this fundamentally changes the
 
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
authority of public education from local
 
00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities to the state in some
 
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
sense in part
 
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
yes in a big part and it really
 
00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
limits so many steps that we've taken um
 
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
and then there are other issues I just I
 
00:18:52.669 --> 00:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
just think it needs so much more work at
 
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
least we have to push out the date um
 
00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
just based on what what gr is telling
 
00:19:01.029 --> 00:19:01.039 align:start position:0%
us but
 
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
fundamentally we are changing the spirit
 
00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
of public education in the state of New
 
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:11.909 --> 00:19:11.919 align:start position:0%
statement I I guess you're going to be a
 
00:19:11.919 --> 00:19:14.230 align:start position:0%
statement I I guess you're going to be a
no

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
vote I think we're done uh quite
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
honestly I appreciate your the issues
 
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
you brought up and all include that in
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
the with the folder but
 
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
I'm I want to move ahead and i' like to
 
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
hear other testimony thank Youk thank
 
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
time I think they're
 
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
staying are you going to hang around for
 
00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
a little while yeah okay
 
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
good make another bite at the
 
00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.590 align:start position:0%
good make another bite at the
Apple

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:46.600 align:start position:0%
Apple
 
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
who yesterday had something to say that
 
00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:57.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:02.190 align:start position:0%
 
just

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:02.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
um my name is Mark takoto I'm the town
 
00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
manager in Waterville Valley I'm also
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
the tax collector in Waterville Valley
 
00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
and you just asked a question about the
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
procedure right and the six-month period
 
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
if you put this into effect for one July
 
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
2024 the school budget has already been
 
00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:23.240 align:start position:0%
voted on in Waterville Valley it's
 
00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:27.640 align:start position:0%
set the warrant as Dr indicated the
 
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
warrant for
 
00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
budget has already been sent to the town
 
00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.350 align:start position:0%
budget has already been sent to the town
last

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.029 align:start position:0%
last
winter

00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:39.039 align:start position:0%
winter
 
00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:41.480 align:start position:0%
and the tax
 
00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:44.440 align:start position:0%
rate if if you have to go back in and
 
00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
put in an amendment to the
 
00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
warrant and the amount goes up that'll
 
00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
be reflected on the October 24 tax
 
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.789 align:start position:0%
be reflected on the October 24 tax
bill

00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:56.799 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:20:59.149 --> 00:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
and we
 
00:21:02.909 --> 00:21:02.919 align:start position:0%
cannot in our July tax bill unless there
 
00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:06.440 align:start position:0%
are Provisions for it we
 
00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
cannot tax anything more than one/ half
 
00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:15.400 align:start position:0%
of last year's tax bill so all of the
 
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
increase will hit in the December tax
 
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
bill and for our community and the other
 
00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
53 donor communities that'll be a huge
 
00:21:31.269 --> 00:21:31.279 align:start position:0%
impact whereas if you if you took the
 
00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:34.360 align:start position:0%
same plan but made the effective date
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
next July then we could
 
00:21:41.789 --> 00:21:41.799 align:start position:0%
adjust and we would be better prepared
 
00:21:44.149 --> 00:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
because we'd have another town meeting
 
00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:47.320 align:start position:0%
and another school district meeting to
 
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
to be able to take it into
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
consideration we've already made votes
 
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
we've already made
 
00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
commitments in both the municipal and
 
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
the school budget um um without this
 
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
additional funding um so for these 53
 
00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:07.960 align:start position:0%
communities it'll be very it'll be very
 
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh a lot to take on in one tax
 
00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
bill I I'll respond with two different
 
00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.350 align:start position:0%
bill I I'll respond with two different
thoughts

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
thoughts
 
00:22:21.909 --> 00:22:21.919 align:start position:0%
M the thought of it won't increase
 
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
taxes as far as the the carve out that
 
00:22:28.029 --> 00:22:28.039 align:start position:0%
the state is going to say is now called
 
00:22:28.039 --> 00:22:29.710 align:start position:0%
the state is going to say is now called
swept

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:29.720 align:start position:0%
swept
 
00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
so the tax bill for the the individual
 
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
property owner is going to stay the same
 
00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:35.320 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
topic however with the increased
 
00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:39.630 align:start position:0%
topic however with the increased
adequacy

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:39.640 align:start position:0%
adequacy
 
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
payments the the swep payment will be
 
00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
greater than it has been right that
 
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
greater amount could be an increase in
 
00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
taxes fore well
 
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
the again I can only speak to our
 
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
situation but going from 76 ,000 swept
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
that's what our current warrant is my
 
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
understanding that the warrant will go
 
00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
up to something like
 
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
1.5 million okay but our revenues when
 
00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
we set taxes in October if this goes
 
00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
through our revenues from Raising that
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
1.5 million will only be
 
00:23:23.549 --> 00:23:23.559 align:start position:0%
$300,000 in our
 
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
community okay so we will have to send a
 
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
check or checks equal to the 1.2
 
00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:36.799 align:start position:0%
million to here to conquer to Dr however
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
it however it works out as the excess
 
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
swep but it will have to be
 
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
raised in the tax rate in October if the
 
00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
effective date is 1 July
 
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
2024 I might be wrong on that but Dr can
 
00:23:57.149 --> 00:23:57.159 align:start position:0%
correct me but that that's my
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
understanding is it would be in effect
 
00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
for the October tax bill I would look to
 
00:24:04.669 --> 00:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
Mickey or mark because we did talk about
 
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
this that's that's correct so it would
 
00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:09.400 align:start position:0%
reflected that on tax bill you got to
 
00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:18.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
mic sorry so that is correct the um T
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
make this all effective fiscal year 25
 
00:24:27.669 --> 00:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
July 1 24 um it would all be reflected
 
00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
in the tax bill bills that go out um tax
 
00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
rate seting uh setting season starts in
 
00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
October um each town has a different
 
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
distribution schedule um but it would be
 
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
reflected their new tax bill would be
 
00:24:42.269 --> 00:24:42.279 align:start position:0%
reflected um in that fall uh fall 24
 
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
payment um so that's when they would
 
00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
start be collecting that but there's
 
00:24:48.549 --> 00:24:48.559 align:start position:0%
this the difference between a fiscal
 
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
year and a a tax year there's this lag
 
00:24:52.029 --> 00:24:52.039 align:start position:0%
so there's this mix match so they're
 
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
going to be collecting revenue for all
 
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
the first few months of fiscal year 25
 
00:24:58.190 --> 00:24:58.200 align:start position:0%
based on the old swept so they're going
 
00:25:00.909 --> 00:25:00.919 align:start position:0%
to short cash um when you look at the
 
00:25:03.389 --> 00:25:03.399 align:start position:0%
whole scope of fiscal year 25 so they're
 
00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:07.240 align:start position:0%
going to be in a cash crunch um to start
 
00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:08.440 align:start position:0%
um they're going to have to according to
 
00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:09.320 align:start position:0%
this amendment they're going to have to
 
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
make their first payment January 30% 30%
 
00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:14.600 align:start position:0%
so they'll have to make a
 
00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:17.240 align:start position:0%
30% essentially down payment for
 
00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
February 1 yeah February 1 yeah yeah so
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
they'll have to make a a first payment
 
00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
off the revenue they're collecting off
 
00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:25.240 align:start position:0%
that new tax bill in the fall of 24
 
00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
they'll make a first payment um then
 
00:25:29.789 --> 00:25:29.799 align:start position:0%
they'll make their final payment
 
00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:34.360 align:start position:0%
um uh after the tax cycle is ended um so
 
00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:37.720 align:start position:0%
in March 31st it's an April 1 to March
 
00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
31st tax okay so so yeah our first tax
 
00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:46.120 align:start position:0%
bill our first tax bill is always
 
00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:50.360 align:start position:0%
limited to exactly 1 half of the prior
 
00:25:54.149 --> 00:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
Year's total tax bill so in our case we
 
00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
can only send out a tax bill in July
 
00:25:59.789 --> 00:25:59.799 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
$65 in our case right so we're only
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
going to collect even if we collect
 
00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
100% that's all we're going to collect
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
on is
 
00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
$6.5 then if our tax rate does go up as
 
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
I testified Yesterday by
 
00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
$2.33 that would be a change to say 14
 
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:23.750 align:start position:0%
$2.33 that would be a change to say 14
or

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
$15 that we've only sent out a first
 
00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:30.559 align:start position:0%
half bill of $6 on our taxpayers will
 
00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
face a
 
00:26:37.789 --> 00:26:37.799 align:start position:0%
$9 per thousand tax bill in December and
 
00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
that's and and that's all going to hit
 
00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:42.440 align:start position:0%
on that one tax bill and then we will
 
00:26:45.149 --> 00:26:45.159 align:start position:0%
have to collect a minimum of our
 
00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
operating budgets and the excess swep
 
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
because in February we will have to take
 
00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
30% of the 1.2 million that we have to
 
00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
send to Dr and we're we're going to have
 
00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:00.559 align:start position:0%
to make that
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
$400,000 payment so just as a as a
 
00:27:06.909 --> 00:27:06.919 align:start position:0%
practical matter if the date changes to
 
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh July 1 of 2025 what's the difference
 
00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
the difference is the the budgets that
 
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:15.640 align:start position:0%
we have voted on at town meeting will
 
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
stay in effect the tax rate would be set
 
00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
on those tax bills and the original
 
00:27:24.029 --> 00:27:24.039 align:start position:0%
warrant of
 
00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
76,000 and we'll and we'll collect you
 
00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
know it'll go on the way that it has
 
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
been uh being done and then the excess
 
00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
swep the the effective date then we will
 
00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:43.480 align:start position:0%
we'll now have a year to plan to to do
 
00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
that uh and if Dr if we can have some
 
00:27:49.509 --> 00:27:49.519 align:start position:0%
mechanism where we could increase the
 
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:52.559 align:start position:0%
July Bill next year
 
00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
to because we will know what the
 
00:28:00.509 --> 00:28:00.519 align:start position:0%
actual uh what actual warrant is for
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
swept if we could get something either
 
00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
regulatory or or in the legislation that
 
00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:10.120 align:start position:0%
allows us to adjust the July
 
00:28:15.509 --> 00:28:15.519 align:start position:0%
bill um for 2025 then we would be able
 
00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:18.440 align:start position:0%
cash flow wise it would make it much
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
much better but make this read right now
 
00:28:23.789 --> 00:28:23.799 align:start position:0%
and we did that you'd still be in the
 
00:28:25.269 --> 00:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
same boat you're in right now we would
 
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
be in the same yeah in my ARG arguments
 
00:28:32.029 --> 00:28:32.039 align:start position:0%
from yesterday still do not go away but
 
00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
but it's the immediacy that is the
 
00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
immediate problem the the issues that um
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
the folks from Dr just highlighted those
 
00:28:43.909 --> 00:28:43.919 align:start position:0%
those sorts of things can be worked out
 
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
over a year
 
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559 align:start position:0%
period rather than over the six-month
 
00:28:51.909 --> 00:28:51.919 align:start position:0%
period the the six-month period has the
 
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
tax rate setting in the middle of it
 
00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
we're we're going to actually set the
 
00:28:58.750 --> 00:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
rates in
 
00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:02.440 align:start position:0%
uh October early November so if the
 
00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:04.919 align:start position:0%
effective date was changed to
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
2025 it be enough time to handle some of
 
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
the Dr issues and and some of the cash
 
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
flow issu well it would certainly make
 
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
it better it from our
 
00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
procedurally uh for us yes okay yeah um
 
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
I think there's two issues going on
 
00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:20.360 align:start position:0%
there's planning uh that you're hearing
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
the mun perspective from an EXs weap
 
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
Community um procedurally there's a
 
00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
planning a planning concern that he just
 
00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
uh just discussed
 
00:29:30.269 --> 00:29:30.279 align:start position:0%
um but there's still always going to be
 
00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
that deviation between fiscal year
 
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
versus tax year and so what he what uh
 
00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:36.799 align:start position:0%
was just kind of thrown out there as an
 
00:29:39.269 --> 00:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
idea is if there would be authority to
 
00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
modify your tax bill outside of the tax
 
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
cycle is that correct yeah to to solve
 
00:29:47.149 --> 00:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
that cash flow problem instead of
 
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
instead of having the Stagger of six
 
00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
months under the old tax rate and then
 
00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:52.360 align:start position:0%
six months under the new tax rate if you
 
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:54.440 align:start position:0%
could have full 12 months under the new
 
00:29:58.230 --> 00:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
tax rate that would um uh solve
 
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
potentially some cash flow problems um
 
00:30:02.789 --> 00:30:02.799 align:start position:0%
but we set tax rates once a year um so
 
00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:05.720 align:start position:0%
there's that's right yeah and and so the
 
00:30:08.669 --> 00:30:08.679 align:start position:0%
first bill that we send out is only an
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
estimate and it's always based we're
 
00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
still going to have a low First Billing
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
but at least we know it's coming and if
 
00:30:20.269 --> 00:30:20.279 align:start position:0%
Authority can be given to the towns to
 
00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:25.480 align:start position:0%
modify that first half bill in 2025 then
 
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
procedurally it it helps us so there's
 
00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
this would would require an amendment to
 
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
change the date and to put language in
 
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
about being able to collect along with
 
00:30:39.509 --> 00:30:39.519 align:start position:0%
all I shared a lot of the concerns that
 
00:30:42.669 --> 00:30:42.679 align:start position:0%
the folks from Dr highlighted to you in
 
00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
in the actual mechanism and the
 
00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
collections and who's going to be
 
00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
responsible for what I think you still
 
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
have to answer those questions and I I
 
00:30:52.389 --> 00:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
do think that that's going to take
 
00:30:55.029 --> 00:30:55.039 align:start position:0%
longer than six months I to answer those
 
00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
I think those questions get answered to
 
00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:04.149 --> 00:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
yes just a very quick note um towns are
 
00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:06.200 align:start position:0%
supposed are encouraged to have a
 
00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:09.320 align:start position:0%
reserve to cover such unanticipated
 
00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:11.039 align:start position:0%
things but I want to make it clear that
 
00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:14.200 align:start position:0%
that is a guidance and advice and it's
 
00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
not required and for example the town of
 
00:31:18.509 --> 00:31:18.519 align:start position:0%
wiam is kind of an outlier because they
 
00:31:20.669 --> 00:31:20.679 align:start position:0%
essentially don't have one we've been
 
00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
floating on a 300,000 Reserve instead of
 
00:31:25.389 --> 00:31:25.399 align:start position:0%
the you know 5 to8 or whatever the range
 
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
is suggested by the Dr so we've actually
 
00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:30.440 align:start position:0%
started encountering some cash flow
 
00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:32.200 align:start position:0%
issues because of that and this would
 
00:31:34.149 --> 00:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
put a lot of pressures on the towns that
 
00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
may not have been able to have a large
 
00:31:38.789 --> 00:31:38.799 align:start position:0%
cash reserves because also sitting on a
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
cash Reserve can be considered you know
 
00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
just taking taxpayers money and keeping
 
00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:45.320 align:start position:0%
it in an account with no interest and uh
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
not very you know careful you know not
 
00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:50.200 align:start position:0%
very easy to plan for so I just want to
 
00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
emphasize that these difficulties are
 
00:31:54.549 --> 00:31:54.559 align:start position:0%
very real and the weeds when we talk
 
00:31:57.509 --> 00:31:57.519 align:start position:0%
about tax race setting and collecting
 
00:32:00.629 --> 00:32:00.639 align:start position:0%
matter immensely because there is a huge
 
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
amount of confusion if the guidance is
 
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
unclear and it's it's a very complicated
 
00:32:09.389 --> 00:32:09.399 align:start position:0%
process and I think we need to get it
 
00:32:11.149 --> 00:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
right to provide the clarity and the
 
00:32:12.909 --> 00:32:12.919 align:start position:0%
structure that people need to do their
 
00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
jobs and it will take a lot of work I
 
00:32:18.789 --> 00:32:18.799 align:start position:0%
have no problem Chang in the effective
 
00:32:20.629 --> 00:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
date but I don't know that we're going
 
00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:23.320 align:start position:0%
to be able to solve all the
 
00:32:27.669 --> 00:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
problems now I mean well and and that
 
00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:30.200 align:start position:0%
that would be my major concern is the
 
00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
impa and I actually think that this may
 
00:32:36.909 --> 00:32:36.919 align:start position:0%
impact the receiver communities as well
 
00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
because as you take the amount per pupil
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
up if they have to remit that money to
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
the school district an a larger amount
 
00:32:51.029 --> 00:32:51.039 align:start position:0%
of money those payments are set between
 
00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
the school district and the town and you
 
00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:56.200 align:start position:0%
may have the same types of cash flow
 
00:32:58.350 --> 00:32:58.360 align:start position:0%
issues even in the re receiver
 
00:33:00.629 --> 00:33:00.639 align:start position:0%
communities because of the large
 
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
increase in the total that will be due
 
00:33:06.669 --> 00:33:06.679 align:start position:0%
to the school so I agree with you but I
 
00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:08.440 align:start position:0%
don't know that we can solve that one
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
well because we can't but again if if it
 
00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
is if it is eased by having some
 
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
planning time and some additional
 
00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
Authority and I don't know exactly what
 
00:33:25.629 --> 00:33:25.639 align:start position:0%
those changes would need to be but at
 
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
least we would have the year
 
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
knowing that it was coming forward but
 
00:33:34.149 --> 00:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
okay I there's still a lot of other
 
00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:37.880 align:start position:0%
issues to to deal with I to be sure y
 
00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:40.120 align:start position:0%
okay I agree yeah we'll change the
 
00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:43.389 align:start position:0%
okay I agree yeah we'll change the
effective

00:33:43.389 --> 00:33:43.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
date and I don't know if we can solve
 
00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
all the problems but just because what's
 
00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
going to happen is this is now going to
 
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
be part of the next budget
 
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
cycle and a lot of the issues can be
 
00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:57.519 align:start position:0%
addressed during that budget cycle I'm
 
00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:12.669 --> 00:34:12.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
yes uh hello Zach Shen executive
 
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
director of the New Hampshire school
 
00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
funding fairness project um just a few
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
points that I didn't make yesterday was
 
00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:22.520 align:start position:0%
kind of rushing through towards the end
 
00:34:23.869 --> 00:34:23.879 align:start position:0%
of the public hearing so I appreciate
 
00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak again um I
 
00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:28.510 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak again um I
think

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
I just a point that I I made I think in
 
00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
the email I sent to division 2 after the
 
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
amendment was produced I just kind of
 
00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to highlight again um
 
00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
was I think this discussion has brought
 
00:34:41.149 --> 00:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
up a bunch of those pieces I really
 
00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate your stance of if there's
 
00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
nothing to work on then work won't get
 
00:34:47.349 --> 00:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
done right if if there's a balance there
 
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
right if if you it was too complicated
 
00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
and you study it then how much pressure
 
00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:53.720 align:start position:0%
is there to work on it but it is
 
00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
complicated and so where's the push and
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
pull and the timing and the ability of
 
00:34:59.710 --> 00:34:59.720 align:start position:0%
of different staff members to work those
 
00:35:02.109 --> 00:35:02.119 align:start position:0%
problems out the one other element I
 
00:35:05.109 --> 00:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
want to kind of add in there is and I I
 
00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
you know we're an advocacy organization
 
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
so take this or leave this kind of from
 
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
our perspective but is the the elements
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
of this what do changing different
 
00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
pieces do to the possibility of the bill
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
passing along the process um so and
 
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
please correct me if I'm misstating the
 
00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
coalition's stance on this but for
 
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
example I think if you changed all of
 
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
the Dr elements they were just talking
 
00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
about and that Mark just highlighted
 
00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:32.680 align:start position:0%
from his expertise if it had the excess
 
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
sweat piece in it they would still be
 
00:35:36.349 --> 00:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
totally opposed to the amendment is that
 
00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
a correct statement okay and so not that
 
00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:41.240 align:start position:0%
they have the say over the legislative
 
00:35:42.589 --> 00:35:42.599 align:start position:0%
process just like we don't have the say
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
we might be on different sides on this
 
00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
but are there elements that could be in
 
00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
this amendment such as changing the tax
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
Authority that they were just discussing
 
00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:56.200 align:start position:0%
to be able to you know tax outside of
 
00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
the normal year that gets a little above
 
00:35:59.910 --> 00:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
my understanding if that's going to be a
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
hang up in potentially addressing swept
 
00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:05.800 align:start position:0%
and excess swept but that hang up in of
 
00:36:08.589 --> 00:36:08.599 align:start position:0%
itself would not have an impact if it
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
was divorced from say remitting excess
 
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
swept that could be something to add
 
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
into the amendment to get that piece
 
00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:19.480 align:start position:0%
worked out have Dr go through whatever
 
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
rul making process over the next six
 
00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:24.280 align:start position:0%
months so that that layer at least the
 
00:36:26.589 --> 00:36:26.599 align:start position:0%
logistics of that are set for the next
 
00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:29.240 align:start position:0%
budget cycle so in that budget cycle
 
00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
maybe we're talking about what does
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
remitting excess swept look like now we
 
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
can do it in a way that doesn't have all
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
these barriers now the conversation is
 
00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
do we do it how do we do it as opposed
 
00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
to how do we do ating excess swept also
 
00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:45.560 align:start position:0%
there's all these logistical elements to
 
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
it yeah but I think your comment was
 
00:36:49.349 --> 00:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
even if we fix it all you're still not
 
00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
in favor of it not in favor of remitting
 
00:36:57.309 --> 00:36:57.319 align:start position:0%
excess so well okay I'm from Hampton
 
00:36:57.319 --> 00:36:59.030 align:start position:0%
excess so well okay I'm from Hampton
we're

00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:01.480 align:start position:0%
either so I just wanted to point that
 
00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:05.599 align:start position:0%
out that relative to getting this buil
 
00:37:07.349 --> 00:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
through the remain you know continuing
 
00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
along the process that given the vote on
 
00:37:14.109 --> 00:37:14.119 align:start position:0%
HB 1686 back in February that was just
 
00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:15.800 align:start position:0%
about largely just about remitting
 
00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
excess swept and how that was
 
00:37:23.069 --> 00:37:23.079 align:start position:0%
killed does that change the the passage
 
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
potential potential of this bill and
 
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
would there be logistical and Rule
 
00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:30.280 align:start position:0%
making elements to tackle now that then
 
00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:32.440 align:start position:0%
could set up a more fruitful
 
00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:37.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:40.069 --> 00:37:40.079 align:start position:0%
budget if that was the
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
objective part of this is to is to come
 
00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
in line with the ports Direction and if
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
you take the excess swep out of this
 
00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
then you've not followed the conval
 
00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:57.160 align:start position:0%
Judgment conval says XX weeps goes to
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
the educational trust fund and that's
 
00:38:02.109 --> 00:38:02.119 align:start position:0%
what this and that's what this does so
 
00:38:06.309 --> 00:38:06.319 align:start position:0%
that I appreciate the excess swep issue
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
because I'm an excess swep Town correct
 
00:38:11.309 --> 00:38:11.319 align:start position:0%
but at the same time the objective here
 
00:38:14.109 --> 00:38:14.119 align:start position:0%
was to try to resolve the outstanding
 
00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
issue of of the Judgment yeah and as an
 
00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:17.960 align:start position:0%
organization that you know generally is
 
00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
in favor of those rulings and and I
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
absolutely appreciate that the one
 
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
caveat I would put in there I think I
 
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
put in my testimony yesterday was I
 
00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:29.240 align:start position:0%
don't know that increasing base adequacy
 
00:38:31.109 --> 00:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
while also having the school spending
 
00:38:31.119 --> 00:38:32.670 align:start position:0%
while also having the school spending
cap

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:32.680 align:start position:0%
cap
 
00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
would I don't think that that I'm not a
 
00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:36.280 align:start position:0%
lawyer but I don't think that that meets
 
00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:39.560 align:start position:0%
the conval argument because the basis of
 
00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:41.480 align:start position:0%
the conval argument was we're not
 
00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:43.160 align:start position:0%
receiving enough money from the state
 
00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:45.720 align:start position:0%
here's why but if conval a school
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
district gets $5 million from this
 
00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
amendment but can only increase their
 
00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:52.280 align:start position:0%
budget by one because of the spending
 
00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:54.880 align:start position:0%
increase does that meet the kind
 
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
of fundamental piece of the lawsuit
 
00:38:58.750 --> 00:38:58.760 align:start position:0%
saying we need additional funds from the
 
00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
state for Education no so I don't know
 
00:39:05.309 --> 00:39:05.319 align:start position:0%
that it would satisfy the ruling I guess
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
is my point well it would satisfy the
 
00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
ruling how it's funded is what is the
 
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
issue because it is funded out of out of
 
00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
local taxes $400 million out of the 2.2
 
00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:19.480 align:start position:0%
billion that's currently collected
 
00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:23.240 align:start position:0%
locally would be reclassified as swept
 
00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:25.160 align:start position:0%
so according to the judge saying we've
 
00:39:26.829 --> 00:39:26.839 align:start position:0%
gotta you got to spend that much for
 
00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
student it's
 
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
happening yeah I I see where you're
 
00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:34.280 align:start position:0%
coming from I just um I don't know if
 
00:39:36.349 --> 00:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
there's a way to get an opinion from
 
00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:38.200 align:start position:0%
someone who is a lawyer on what that
 
00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:40.280 align:start position:0%
would do to the case but that's what
 
00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:43.000 align:start position:0%
we're here for yeah okay Mar you
 
00:39:44.349 --> 00:39:44.359 align:start position:0%
obviously got something to say because I
 
00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:47.000 align:start position:0%
can see you jumping over there I I what
 
00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
I really would like to hear from is the
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
municipal Association we heard a lot
 
00:39:53.069 --> 00:39:53.079 align:start position:0%
from the Dr and I I don't want to put
 
00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
you on a
 
00:39:57.950 --> 00:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
spot but but
 
00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:01.400 align:start position:0%
but it but and in terms of what Zach is
 
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
saying to us fundamentally we need
 
00:40:07.589 --> 00:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
another funding source we can't continue
 
00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:10.280 align:start position:0%
to pay for Education off the backs of
 
00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:12.920 align:start position:0%
our property taxpayers it's time that we
 
00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
face that issue and figure it out we
 
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
need another source of Revenue I think
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
it's that simple that's why I think we
 
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
should refer this to the special
 
00:40:24.349 --> 00:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
committee for education and start
 
00:40:26.349 --> 00:40:26.359 align:start position:0%
talking about where are we going to get
 
00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
extra revenue for
 
00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
education enough sorry okay Municipal
 
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:45.880 align:start position:0%
you good good morning members of the
 
00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
committee it's okay thank you very much
 
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
my name is Katherine heck and I
 
00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire Municipal
 
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
Association and we are here following
 
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%
this legislation as school funding is an
 
00:40:59.829 --> 00:40:59.839 align:start position:0%
important piece obviously to the overall
 
00:41:02.109 --> 00:41:02.119 align:start position:0%
budgeting process and Taxation process
 
00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire while we have no
 
00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
position on these bills because again
 
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
they fall outside of the municipal realm
 
00:41:10.349 --> 00:41:10.359 align:start position:0%
these are School related bills they
 
00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
certainly do impact our members so
 
00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
therefore we have decided to try to keep
 
00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:17.560 align:start position:0%
a close eye on what's happening in light
 
00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
of the two judgments that have occurred
 
00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:22.720 align:start position:0%
and we sincerely appreciate the work
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
that has been done so far to try to
 
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
address the lawsuits as well as the
 
00:41:29.309 --> 00:41:29.319 align:start position:0%
amendments that's come forward as I
 
00:41:32.069 --> 00:41:32.079 align:start position:0%
understand that you are trying to be
 
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
responsive to um those judgments and
 
00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:37.000 align:start position:0%
that is much appreciated as you've heard
 
00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
from Dr several members and we have no
 
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
position between donor towns versus
 
00:41:44.309 --> 00:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
non-donor towns because we don't get in
 
00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
a position of pitting Town against town
 
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
so we won't weigh in on that section
 
00:41:52.109 --> 00:41:52.119 align:start position:0%
because of course our members are
 
00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:56.440 align:start position:0%
impacted differently um I think all the
 
00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
solutions as we can see from testimony
 
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
and from the amendments are extremely
 
00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
complicated and there does not seem to
 
00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
be a clear path forward um that doesn't
 
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
have some unintended consequence so
 
00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
while you continue to deliberate and
 
00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:16.280 align:start position:0%
debate um the different options that are
 
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
presented to you we just ask that you
 
00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:21.400 align:start position:0%
you know consider all the unintended
 
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
consequences as you've mentioned you're
 
00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
not sure that you can solve for all of
 
00:42:28.829 --> 00:42:28.839 align:start position:0%
the all of the issues isues um at hand I
 
00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
would say that as far as the the tax cap
 
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
piece of the bill that particularly
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
caught our interest because that's
 
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
something that um local control you know
 
00:42:41.109 --> 00:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
we do believe firmly in local control
 
00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
and we're not really sure how that piece
 
00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
directly fits into those judgments
 
00:42:49.109 --> 00:42:49.119 align:start position:0%
however again we are we don't take a
 
00:42:51.309 --> 00:42:51.319 align:start position:0%
position necessarily on education
 
00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:53.720 align:start position:0%
funding but it does affect our members
 
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
typically on the municipal side a bu a
 
00:42:57.630 --> 00:42:57.640 align:start position:0%
municipal budget
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
is about estimated 24 to 36% of a tax
 
00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:07.640 align:start position:0%
bill well maybe up to 8 to 10% could be
 
00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
the county up to and the rest being the
 
00:43:12.309 --> 00:43:12.319 align:start position:0%
school budget right so that's very
 
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
typical Nationwide for that to be the
 
00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:18.200 align:start position:0%
case um so of course Municipal budgets
 
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
are looked at very carefully in light of
 
00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
other school spending because we have
 
00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:25.480 align:start position:0%
the same tax base right it's the same
 
00:43:28.309 --> 00:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
taxpayer paying over all of the funds
 
00:43:30.549 --> 00:43:30.559 align:start position:0%
the local school the swept the county
 
00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
and Municipal budget so again we follow
 
00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
this very closely and we try to work
 
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
closely with our school Partners to
 
00:43:38.309 --> 00:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
understand what their budgeting needs
 
00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
are when we bring forward our Municipal
 
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
budgets understanding that there is
 
00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity issues especially in
 
00:43:47.109 --> 00:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
some of um our e more economically
 
00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:49.000 align:start position:0%
challenged communities There's real
 
00:43:53.069 --> 00:43:53.079 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity concerns for them so I'm
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
not really sure what questions I can
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
answer um directly for you we just
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to say that we do appreciate the
 
00:44:01.829 --> 00:44:01.839 align:start position:0%
work questions and answers I know and I
 
00:44:03.549 --> 00:44:03.559 align:start position:0%
but I do we do appreciate all the work
 
00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
that's being done around this because
 
00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
this is a really important issue so
 
00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for being responsive um to
 
00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:13.079 align:start position:0%
that yes thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
for coming testifying and for taking
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
questions you were referring to a you
 
00:44:19.950 --> 00:44:19.960 align:start position:0%
know typical uh breakdown between County
 
00:44:22.589 --> 00:44:22.599 align:start position:0%
and Municipal and the school budget what
 
00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
would you say the you know typical
 
00:44:26.549 --> 00:44:26.559 align:start position:0%
percentages would be just ballpark I
 
00:44:28.589 --> 00:44:28.599 align:start position:0%
know they from town to town but you said
 
00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:30.200 align:start position:0%
typical and I wasn't sure what the
 
00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
typical values were so again it it is
 
00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
going to vary wildly depending on
 
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:38.440 align:start position:0%
community but generally it's not
 
00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:42.280 align:start position:0%
uncommon for 60% of the budget to be the
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
the school and that's again Nationwide
 
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
that's very typical um because it's such
 
00:44:50.069 --> 00:44:50.079 align:start position:0%
a heavily service-based salary based um
 
00:44:52.349 --> 00:44:52.359 align:start position:0%
delivery Educational Services where the
 
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
municipal budget would be that less than
 
00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
30 and here in New England and
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
especially New Hampshire our counties
 
00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
not to say they don't do very important
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
work but they don't do the same type of
 
00:45:05.549 --> 00:45:05.559 align:start position:0%
work at that they do out west so they
 
00:45:08.069 --> 00:45:08.079 align:start position:0%
typically have a smaller slice of that
 
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
piece of the pie thank you just was
 
00:45:13.589 --> 00:45:13.599 align:start position:0%
curious I appreciate
 
00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
it yes question thank you Mr chair
 
00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:17.960 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question I think
 
00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
this should be an easy one for you um
 
00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
even though you've said that you don't
 
00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
want to take a position on the bill
 
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
itself or the underlying Amendment
 
00:45:30.069 --> 00:45:30.079 align:start position:0%
um is it safe to say that if this
 
00:45:32.549 --> 00:45:32.559 align:start position:0%
amendment were to impose an additional
 
00:45:35.069 --> 00:45:35.079 align:start position:0%
additional administrative burden of
 
00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:37.160 align:start position:0%
collecting and remitting taxes on a
 
00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
municipality that previously did not
 
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
have that
 
00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility uh would those same
 
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
communities prefer to be compensated for
 
00:45:47.589 --> 00:45:47.599 align:start position:0%
that additional
 
00:45:50.349 --> 00:45:50.359 align:start position:0%
work so that is a very good question and
 
00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
we have seen several bills that have
 
00:45:54.589 --> 00:45:54.599 align:start position:0%
this session and the session before that
 
00:45:57.710 --> 00:45:57.720 align:start position:0%
we have had to weigh in on that look at
 
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
remitting swept for example to the state
 
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
or on a different schedule all swept so
 
00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:05.480 align:start position:0%
we're just going to pull that piece out
 
00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:07.480 align:start position:0%
so the municipalities collect the taxes
 
00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the county and the school
 
00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:12.200 align:start position:0%
we perfect the tax collection system in
 
00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
that we owe 100% of Our obligation based
 
00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
on the schedule dictated by law or by
 
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:20.200 align:start position:0%
the local school board so the counties
 
00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
um it's right in statute when we must
 
00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
pay over in December whether we've
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
collected it or not as well as to the
 
00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
school we pay $1 % of the obligation
 
00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
it's not uncommon for a community to
 
00:46:34.549 --> 00:46:34.559 align:start position:0%
have about a 3% uncollected tax rate it
 
00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:36.280 align:start position:0%
could go much higher depending on
 
00:46:38.549 --> 00:46:38.559 align:start position:0%
certain economic certain circumstances
 
00:46:40.549 --> 00:46:40.559 align:start position:0%
in that community at the time perhaps
 
00:46:43.109 --> 00:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
fiscal stress could play a role in that
 
00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
but just imagine a world where 95% of
 
00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
the taxes are collected but you owe 100%
 
00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
to all your vendors everyone you do
 
00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
business with as well as the the county
 
00:46:56.109 --> 00:46:56.119 align:start position:0%
and the school district so when some
 
00:46:58.750 --> 00:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
bills have come forward to have swept be
 
00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:01.480 align:start position:0%
collected and remitted on say December
 
00:47:05.109 --> 00:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
15th I may or may not have those dollars
 
00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:08.680 align:start position:0%
my tax bill may be due before then but
 
00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
it certainly can't be due before
 
00:47:11.549 --> 00:47:11.559 align:start position:0%
December 1st based on our tax rate
 
00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
setting process it may be due December
 
00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:16.760 align:start position:0%
31st so I have to pay money over whether
 
00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
I have collected it or not so there's
 
00:47:21.309 --> 00:47:21.319 align:start position:0%
not only an administrative piece to that
 
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
but there's a cash flow concern about we
 
00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
would have to take out costly tan notes
 
00:47:28.589 --> 00:47:28.599 align:start position:0%
tax and anticipation notes in order to
 
00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:31.720 align:start position:0%
meet those obligations so again we do
 
00:47:33.589 --> 00:47:33.599 align:start position:0%
have a very efficient system here in New
 
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have very um clear taxation
 
00:47:39.309 --> 00:47:39.319 align:start position:0%
formulas here in New Hampshire we have
 
00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
excellent Tax Collectors this is not to
 
00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
say that everyone's not doing an
 
00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
excellent job but the system itself we
 
00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:48.280 align:start position:0%
have to just be again those unintended
 
00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:50.559 align:start position:0%
consequences on any administrative
 
00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
burden would fall on the municipal side
 
00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:54.640 align:start position:0%
because the school has nothing to do
 
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
with the tax collection process the lean
 
00:47:58.870 --> 00:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
or or the deed process by Design right
 
00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:01.960 align:start position:0%
it does make for many efficiencies that
 
00:48:05.109 --> 00:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
we don't have multiple people collecting
 
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
taxes which is the case in other states
 
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
and everyone kind of has a piece of the
 
00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
pie and that does dilute um and make
 
00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
things a little more complicated
 
00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:16.720 align:start position:0%
depending on which Bill wasn't paid so
 
00:48:18.549 --> 00:48:18.559 align:start position:0%
there is that consideration of course
 
00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
administratively and the timing of that
 
00:48:23.069 --> 00:48:23.079 align:start position:0%
um remittance back up to the state
 
00:48:25.309 --> 00:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
whether or not we've have collected it
 
00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
and is there consideration for
 
00:48:29.069 --> 00:48:29.079 align:start position:0%
uncollected dollars because when you
 
00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
send over your tax bill you don't get to
 
00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
determine the $100 I want you to apply
 
00:48:36.069 --> 00:48:36.079 align:start position:0%
to the school and 50 here and I'll come
 
00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:37.640 align:start position:0%
up with a payment plan because you know
 
00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
I've had some rough times maybe I've
 
00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:42.760 align:start position:0%
lost my job it it really doesn't quite
 
00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:44.680 align:start position:0%
work that way because the obligation
 
00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
side is determined Again by Statute by
 
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
right by the local school board and we
 
00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
have to spend and pay over on their
 
00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
schedule based on their cash flow needs
 
00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
um okay let me let me just make a a a
 
00:48:59.789 --> 00:48:59.799 align:start position:0%
a strategic
 
00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
comment my intention is to amend this to
 
00:49:06.309 --> 00:49:06.319 align:start position:0%
the extent that anybody else has other
 
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
suggestions that make a lot of sense and
 
00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
to move it out of the subcommittee into
 
00:49:16.309 --> 00:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
full Finance it could very well die
 
00:49:20.549 --> 00:49:20.559 align:start position:0%
there the underlying bill will not 18 uh
 
00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
1583 will still move
 
00:49:27.069 --> 00:49:27.079 align:start position:0%
forward uh but we're going to have to
 
00:49:28.829 --> 00:49:28.839 align:start position:0%
vote we do we have to vote that out of
 
00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
here 1583 the basic we got so H hung up
 
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
on the amendment I don't even know where
 
00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:36.680 align:start position:0%
we are we we've taken no votes on 1583
 
00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:38.200 align:start position:0%
so depending on what you decide to do
 
00:49:40.109 --> 00:49:40.119 align:start position:0%
with this amendment you'd still have to
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation on 1583 so because
 
00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:46.720 align:start position:0%
I want 1583 to move forward regardless
 
00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:49.240 align:start position:0%
uh all right
 
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh well do you want to make a motion on
 
00:49:54.589 --> 00:49:54.599 align:start position:0%
1583 and just get that off the table
 
00:49:58.030 --> 00:49:58.040 align:start position:0%
I am I done hey I mean just in
 
00:49:59.710 --> 00:49:59.720 align:start position:0%
discussing the
 
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
motion if we move
 
00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
1583 how will then we continue to work
 
00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:07.400 align:start position:0%
on the amendment you know never mind I
 
00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
mean good idea I I think that the intent
 
00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:12.200 align:start position:0%
obviously we have all heard that we
 
00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
intend to move 1583 forward but until we
 
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
have an amendment decision probably by
 
00:50:20.309 --> 00:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
the full finance committee you know no I
 
00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
think we have to make a recommendation
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
on both yes right but but they need to
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
go in the sequence of the am Amendment
 
00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
first and then correct and I would argue
 
00:50:31.109 --> 00:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
that while we would not probably be able
 
00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
to we would only be able to vote on 1583
 
00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:36.640 align:start position:0%
amend as amended if we agree to the
 
00:50:40.030 --> 00:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
amendment but while we can only vote it
 
00:50:41.789 --> 00:50:41.799 align:start position:0%
that way I think the fact that we are
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
all agreeing that 1583 if unamended is
 
00:50:47.349 --> 00:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
still a you know recommended bill should
 
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
take care of any issues in the full
 
00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
finance committee so I would suggest we
 
00:50:52.589 --> 00:50:52.599 align:start position:0%
work on the amendment first once we have
 
00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
a decision on the amendment we can vote
 
00:50:58.069 --> 00:50:58.079 align:start position:0%
on 1583 if amended and then take it to
 
00:50:59.789 --> 00:50:59.799 align:start position:0%
the full Finance but full Finance still
 
00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:02.200 align:start position:0%
has to vote on on both of separately
 
00:51:04.349 --> 00:51:04.359 align:start position:0%
correct right which is why I'm saying we
 
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
we'll will retain all the options in
 
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
finance but here I would argue that we
 
00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
should deal with the amendment first yes
 
00:51:12.030 --> 00:51:12.040 align:start position:0%
thank you we have someone who's worked
 
00:51:14.670 --> 00:51:14.680 align:start position:0%
on budgets Mr Duan from New Market um
 
00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
can we hear from him as well sure what
 
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for are things that need to
 
00:51:23.789 --> 00:51:23.799 align:start position:0%
Bei to make this less unpalatable or
 
00:51:26.349 --> 00:51:26.359 align:start position:0%
more palatable I'm not going to solve
 
00:51:27.829 --> 00:51:27.839 align:start position:0%
all the issues we're not going to be
 
00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
able to dot it cross every te and Dot
 
00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
every eye I want death things and I
 
00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
think the date effective date was a
 
00:51:38.109 --> 00:51:38.119 align:start position:0%
death so are there other items in here
 
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
that are deaths sir yes hello uh my name
 
00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
is Paul desan and I work for the town of
 
00:51:47.069 --> 00:51:47.079 align:start position:0%
Newington uh but prior to that uh I was
 
00:51:48.829 --> 00:51:48.839 align:start position:0%
the Town Administrator in stratum for 30
 
00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
years um I'm uh also Vice chair of the
 
00:51:55.630 --> 00:51:55.640 align:start position:0%
Coalition communities U uh to which mark
 
00:51:59.950 --> 00:51:59.960 align:start position:0%
tooto spoke prior
 
00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
um our fundamental issue as a coalition
 
00:52:07.829 --> 00:52:07.839 align:start position:0%
is is is the excess swep uh Point um but
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
I think it goes to representative SE
 
00:52:13.789 --> 00:52:13.799 align:start position:0%
argument that uh as long as we continue
 
00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
to rely solely on the property tax we're
 
00:52:18.549 --> 00:52:18.559 align:start position:0%
always going to have these complications
 
00:52:20.349 --> 00:52:20.359 align:start position:0%
these complications these
 
00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
complications um both from you know
 
00:52:25.470 --> 00:52:25.480 align:start position:0%
administrative side of things with Dr uh
 
00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
let alone how towns and cities managed
 
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
their cash flow uh how the school
 
00:52:31.870 --> 00:52:31.880 align:start position:0%
districts managed their cash flow uh I
 
00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:34.640 align:start position:0%
keep going back to u a statement made by
 
00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:36.109 align:start position:0%
keep going back to u a statement made by
representative

00:52:36.109 --> 00:52:36.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
Solsbury um on January 19th he said
 
00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
fundamentally we got a situation where
 
00:52:45.549 --> 00:52:45.559 align:start position:0%
the local tax is masquerading as a state
 
00:52:48.349 --> 00:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
tax and we kind of want it to be both
 
00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
things depending on where we sit and how
 
00:52:53.309 --> 00:52:53.319 align:start position:0%
we justify things that to me
 
00:52:56.109 --> 00:52:56.119 align:start position:0%
crystallized exactly what the issue is
 
00:52:59.549 --> 00:52:59.559 align:start position:0%
Rel to school funding and continuing use
 
00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
weep uh as the answer the be all the end
 
00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
all and I think that's the fundamental
 
00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
issue um in terms of putting it in
 
00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
perspective for newington's uh situation
 
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
my prediction would be that um uh the
 
00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:17.720 align:start position:0%
town of Newton just for an excess swep
 
00:53:20.789 --> 00:53:20.799 align:start position:0%
as under present law um Our obligation
 
00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
to the state would be
 
00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:24.910 align:start position:0%
to the state would be
$784,900

00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:24.920 align:start position:0%
$784,900
 
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
um that's a additional money because now
 
00:53:29.829 --> 00:53:29.839 align:start position:0%
we're giving it to the state uh as
 
00:53:31.829 --> 00:53:31.839 align:start position:0%
excess that we would have to add to our
 
00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
local tax rate so taxes are going to go
 
00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
up uh for the property tax payer um you
 
00:53:43.789 --> 00:53:43.799 align:start position:0%
then add the Rand decision and although
 
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
yes we're going to get a little more
 
00:53:48.829 --> 00:53:48.839 align:start position:0%
money uh relative to uh the per pupil uh
 
00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
expenditures for our school um with only
 
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
60 or you know the enrollment averag is
 
00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:00.280 align:start position:0%
between 59 65 in in Newton uh very small
 
00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:03.160 align:start position:0%
so that incremental addition is not
 
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
going to offset the tremendous increase
 
00:54:09.109 --> 00:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
in the swep amount that you've just now
 
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
almost doubled U going from 41 to to the
 
00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
7300 per per student so that plus the
 
00:54:20.549 --> 00:54:20.559 align:start position:0%
excess is going to be a
 
00:54:20.559 --> 00:54:22.750 align:start position:0%
excess is going to be a
3,179

00:54:22.750 --> 00:54:22.760 align:start position:0%
3,179
 
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
641 obligation on the town of Newington
 
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
and that's not that's that that's if it
 
00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:30.520 align:start position:0%
was occurring in
 
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
2023 2024 something similar 2025
 
00:54:37.549 --> 00:54:37.559 align:start position:0%
something similar year after year after
 
00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
year that adds up to a lot of cash and
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
one thing hasn't been stated uh I'll say
 
00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:45.880 align:start position:0%
that from from a taxpayer
 
00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:48.440 align:start position:0%
standpoint I live in the town of stratum
 
00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
and we had a significant increase for
 
00:54:53.589 --> 00:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
multiple reasons uh in our uh local
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
school rate and taxpayers were off the
 
00:54:59.190 --> 00:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
wall because they weren't giving enough
 
00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
communication that that was going to
 
00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:03.160 align:start position:0%
happen so people who have mortgages and
 
00:55:05.309 --> 00:55:05.319 align:start position:0%
they've escorted the amount they're
 
00:55:08.589 --> 00:55:08.599 align:start position:0%
short this bill will only magnify that
 
00:55:10.829 --> 00:55:10.839 align:start position:0%
uh circumstance so taxpayers will have
 
00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
cash flow problems uh you know if you're
 
00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:14.440 align:start position:0%
on a fixed income you usually put a
 
00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
little aside trying to meet the tax bill
 
00:55:20.910 --> 00:55:20.920 align:start position:0%
uh when it comes due again the surprise
 
00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
and and I just don't know how you this
 
00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
complicated a situation how you're going
 
00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
to be able to effectively communicate
 
00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayers um so that they can be
 
00:55:32.589 --> 00:55:32.599 align:start position:0%
prepared um haven't been in the the
 
00:55:35.549 --> 00:55:35.559 align:start position:0%
public uh realm for for number of years
 
00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:37.720 align:start position:0%
I know they're always someone who won't
 
00:55:40.349 --> 00:55:40.359 align:start position:0%
listen to anything uh and then I shocked
 
00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
and surprised but even those who spend
 
00:55:46.069 --> 00:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
most of their time trying to be informed
 
00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
were shocked and surprised when stratum
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
had this large increase uh so
 
00:55:54.910 --> 00:55:54.920 align:start position:0%
so the fundamental issue and
 
00:55:57.870 --> 00:55:57.880 align:start position:0%
complicating factor is Reliance on the
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
property tax be it a state property tax
 
00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
uh or a a local property tax local or or
 
00:56:08.109 --> 00:56:08.119 align:start position:0%
local taxpayers because from our
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint we send out the bills they
 
00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
write the checks to the town of
 
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
Newington they have a problem with the
 
00:56:16.789 --> 00:56:16.799 align:start position:0%
bill they go to the Newington tax
 
00:56:19.789 --> 00:56:19.799 align:start position:0%
collector they want an abatement they go
 
00:56:22.589 --> 00:56:22.599 align:start position:0%
to the Newton uh
 
00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:25.160 align:start position:0%
selectman they make no recognition that
 
00:56:27.950 --> 00:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
swep is a state tax you know you can
 
00:56:29.789 --> 00:56:29.799 align:start position:0%
call it what it is as as the
 
00:56:32.430 --> 00:56:32.440 align:start position:0%
representative sburg representative but
 
00:56:34.670 --> 00:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
in their view it's a local tax and it
 
00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
should be a local decisions relative to
 
00:56:39.390 --> 00:56:39.400 align:start position:0%
the expenditure of those those taxes
 
00:56:41.950 --> 00:56:41.960 align:start position:0%
adding the swep just moneyed the
 
00:56:44.430 --> 00:56:44.440 align:start position:0%
waters and continues to do so and I'll
 
00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:48.640 align:start position:0%
leave it at that okay did anybody else
 
00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
have a death mail they'd like to
 
00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:53.640 align:start position:0%
present because I'm primarily resolving
 
00:56:56.549 --> 00:56:56.559 align:start position:0%
death nails at this point uh to see if
 
00:56:57.710 --> 00:56:57.720 align:start position:0%
we can at least get it out of this
 
00:57:00.390 --> 00:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
committee and it's a full
 
00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
Finance well good we're out of death and
 
00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:03.670 align:start position:0%
Finance well good we're out of death and
else

00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
else
 
00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
anyway just a question if I may Mr chair
 
00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
um given that you are planning to have
 
00:57:11.589 --> 00:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
an amendment am I correct to assume that
 
00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
we will have to have another meeting on
 
00:57:17.950 --> 00:57:17.960 align:start position:0%
the amendment in order to uh well we can
 
00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
if if we can agree what the will vote on
 
00:57:25.950 --> 00:57:25.960 align:start position:0%
this this amendment being amended and
 
00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:28.760 align:start position:0%
then that will come to full Finance next
 
00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
week I don't think we have to I don't
 
00:57:32.349 --> 00:57:32.359 align:start position:0%
think we can turn it around in time to
 
00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
have another meeting that's what we're
 
00:57:37.309 --> 00:57:37.319 align:start position:0%
saying we're going to edit this one with
 
00:57:39.549 --> 00:57:39.559 align:start position:0%
these changes and then we'll rely on the
 
00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:46.349 --> 00:57:46.359 align:start position:0%
Tuesday I've actually found out other
 
00:57:49.309 --> 00:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
committees do that we always had the the
 
00:57:52.109 --> 00:57:52.119 align:start position:0%
guide that you had to see the actual
 
00:57:54.589 --> 00:57:54.599 align:start position:0%
Amendment the other subdivision
 
00:57:58.870 --> 00:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittees here uh do this and to see
 
00:58:00.589 --> 00:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
the edits and they see it for the first
 
00:58:02.829 --> 00:58:02.839 align:start position:0%
time in full Finance
 
00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
so I'm rather than to come back another
 
00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
time Mary do you have okay thank you Mr
 
00:58:12.309 --> 00:58:12.319 align:start position:0%
Speaker I think while I'm speaking for
 
00:58:14.789 --> 00:58:14.799 align:start position:0%
myself I would love to see a success
 
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
here and I mean everything that we're
 
00:58:19.549 --> 00:58:19.559 align:start position:0%
hearing there are many problems here
 
00:58:20.910 --> 00:58:20.920 align:start position:0%
that we are not going to be able to
 
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
solve and changing the date is going to
 
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
do very little to address those problems
 
00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:26.680 align:start position:0%
I would really like to see
 
00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
this move forward in a way where it
 
00:58:32.910 --> 00:58:32.920 align:start position:0%
becomes a success um you seem to have a
 
00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
strong feeling that this will get killed
 
00:58:37.390 --> 00:58:37.400 align:start position:0%
in finance it probably will um pretty
 
00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
darn sure it get killed on the floor
 
00:58:40.829 --> 00:58:40.839 align:start position:0%
because as soon as you say your property
 
00:58:42.630 --> 00:58:42.640 align:start position:0%
taxes are going up that's going to be
 
00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
gone especially since if I may this is
 
00:58:45.789 --> 00:58:45.799 align:start position:0%
an election year and a lot of those
 
00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
people are going to be paying attention
 
00:58:49.309 --> 00:58:49.319 align:start position:0%
to that I would like to see a success so
 
00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
that was why I think the suggestion is
 
00:58:53.069 --> 00:58:53.079 align:start position:0%
to take this and move it along to
 
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
education with Finance people and you're
 
00:58:57.150 --> 00:58:57.160 align:start position:0%
on that makes sense because it gives a
 
00:58:59.589 --> 00:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
chance to listen better more
 
00:59:07.470 --> 00:59:07.480 align:start position:0%
deeply to a d or Dr No D Dr D you're not
 
00:59:10.349 --> 00:59:10.359 align:start position:0%
that but the Dr I would like to see the
 
00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:12.640 align:start position:0%
success I'd like to see a a program that
 
00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
goes forward I think that having this
 
00:59:17.309 --> 00:59:17.319 align:start position:0%
says yeah we care we want to do
 
00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
something and I see it as a first step
 
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
towards that goal where we can have all
 
00:59:23.670 --> 00:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
the participants and the municipalities
 
00:59:25.069 --> 00:59:25.079 align:start position:0%
everyone coming in to say how are we
 
00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
going to make this equ
 
00:59:29.470 --> 00:59:29.480 align:start position:0%
I mean where it is right now um the
 
00:59:31.789 --> 00:59:31.799 align:start position:0%
excess swep communities are going to
 
00:59:33.789 --> 00:59:33.799 align:start position:0%
take a huge hit and the poor communities
 
00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
are going to be locked into being a poor
 
00:59:36.990 --> 00:59:37.000 align:start position:0%
Community forever in terms of their
 
00:59:39.349 --> 00:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
education because of this CA and so
 
00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
can't we move forward to say we want
 
00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
this to be a success let's continue
 
00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
working on it and move it away from the
 
00:59:48.190 --> 00:59:48.200 align:start position:0%
bill let the bill go through we've got
 
00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
time there has been the stay so it's not
 
00:59:51.710 --> 00:59:51.720 align:start position:0%
like you know we have an April 1
 
00:59:54.029 --> 00:59:54.039 align:start position:0%
deadline but because I want this
 
00:59:56.109 --> 00:59:56.119 align:start position:0%
everyone is we all want to see a success
 
00:59:58.150 --> 00:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
year we all want to see this change this
 
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
is an opportunity to say yes we all care
 
01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
about it and let's continue working on
 
01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
this we've got so many problems with it
 
01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:07.880 align:start position:0%
now even the the technical stuff of the
 
01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:10.630 align:start position:0%
now even the the technical stuff of the
D

01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
D
 
01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
ra um that's that's a big knot to untie
 
01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
I mean for me it'd be a gordian knot but
 
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
working with them we can do that so
 
01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
isn't there a way that we can take this
 
01:00:22.109 --> 01:00:22.119 align:start position:0%
and say yes we care we want to have a
 
01:00:24.430 --> 01:00:24.440 align:start position:0%
success and move it to the committee
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
with a bunch of us maybe we make the
 
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
committee a little bit larger uh we
 
01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:29.720 align:start position:0%
involve all the stakeholders and turn
 
01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:31.480 align:start position:0%
this into something we can work with and
 
01:00:34.829 --> 01:00:34.839 align:start position:0%
be proud of just just minute Dan just so
 
01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
you know my recommendation in that
 
01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
committee was to have this bill go to to
 
01:00:40.829 --> 01:00:40.839 align:start position:0%
Ways and
 
01:00:43.109 --> 01:00:43.119 align:start position:0%
Means yeah I said this doesn't belong in
 
01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
finance this is a ways and means issue
 
01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
because we're not raising enough money
 
01:00:53.069 --> 01:00:53.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
listening then you have a yes I um thank
 
01:01:00.630 --> 01:01:00.640 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I just wanted to state that
 
01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
I agree with a lot of the concerns that
 
01:01:03.710 --> 01:01:03.720 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of work to be done
 
01:01:06.349 --> 01:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
obviously part of the technical and more
 
01:01:08.829 --> 01:01:08.839 align:start position:0%
detailed fixes could be taken care of in
 
01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
the next budget process because we all
 
01:01:13.069 --> 01:01:13.079 align:start position:0%
know that whatever we may adopt today
 
01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
will not make it through hb2 unscathed
 
01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:17.270 align:start position:0%
will not make it through hb2 unscathed
right

01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
but I would suggest that probably the
 
01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
best way to go forward as far as I am
 
01:01:25.589 --> 01:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
concerned is to see what the finance
 
01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
committee as a whole has to say about it
 
01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
because it is a complex issue as you
 
01:01:31.589 --> 01:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
said really it's more of a ways and
 
01:01:33.549 --> 01:01:33.559 align:start position:0%
means deal anyway but we are discussing
 
01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
it here because uh you know it was
 
01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
assigned here but I would feel
 
01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:41.240 align:start position:0%
comfortable you know making a decision
 
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
on the amendment to send it to the
 
01:01:44.549 --> 01:01:44.559 align:start position:0%
finance understanding fully that
 
01:01:46.309 --> 01:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
whatever the finance decide that you
 
01:01:48.069 --> 01:01:48.079 align:start position:0%
know depending on the debate I may
 
01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
support the amended bill or not but I
 
01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
think there is value in having a
 
01:01:55.029 --> 01:01:55.039 align:start position:0%
discussion with a full finance committee
 
01:01:57.390 --> 01:01:57.400 align:start position:0%
because while this this is our bail week
 
01:01:59.870 --> 01:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
it is also a immensely complicated
 
01:02:02.069 --> 01:02:02.079 align:start position:0%
process where everybody else on the
 
01:02:04.390 --> 01:02:04.400 align:start position:0%
finance may have some valuable input you
 
01:02:06.789 --> 01:02:06.799 align:start position:0%
know to add
 
01:02:10.190 --> 01:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
so well I appreciate that and my my
 
01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
question to the committee is I we've
 
01:02:18.349 --> 01:02:18.359 align:start position:0%
identified two push points that we can
 
01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
we can we could solve with a rewrite one
 
01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
is the effective data and the other one
 
01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:26.680 align:start position:0%
is to have language that allow tax
 
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
collection in advance in anticipation of
 
01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:33.160 align:start position:0%
the effective date of of of the
 
01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:35.720 align:start position:0%
legislation so Mr chair I haven't been
 
01:02:37.589 --> 01:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
able to share my thoughts about the
 
01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
amendment yet so um if you are accepting
 
01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
other ideas for amendment to this
 
01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
amendment my suggestion would to be to
 
01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
7300 as the amount for the new base
 
01:02:55.789 --> 01:02:55.799 align:start position:0%
adequacy and then to move to the effect
 
01:02:55.799 --> 01:02:56.750 align:start position:0%
adequacy and then to move to the effect
acve

01:02:56.750 --> 01:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
acve
 
01:02:59.230 --> 01:02:59.240 align:start position:0%
date because I'm saying everything in
 
01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:01.720 align:start position:0%
the middle is so problematic that the
 
01:03:04.349 --> 01:03:04.359 align:start position:0%
minor bandaids were suggesting to put on
 
01:03:06.910 --> 01:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
this hemorrhaging amendment is not
 
01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:08.440 align:start position:0%
enough to save the patient I think the
 
01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
patient's going to go down and I think
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
we all recognize that so my you know if
 
01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
the intent of this amendment is to go
 
01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
forward I think much more work needs to
 
01:03:21.789 --> 01:03:21.799 align:start position:0%
be done than what a piece of paper can
 
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
do in the next you know 72 hours so I
 
01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
appre appreciate your um desire to move
 
01:03:31.870 --> 01:03:31.880 align:start position:0%
forward with these ideas to meet this
 
01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
obligation you know um of course I
 
01:03:36.190 --> 01:03:36.200 align:start position:0%
applaud that effort um but what I would
 
01:03:38.990 --> 01:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
say is that those rulings as we all know
 
01:03:41.950 --> 01:03:41.960 align:start position:0%
as people who are aware you know one
 
01:03:44.109 --> 01:03:44.119 align:start position:0%
ruling can be overturned with the next
 
01:03:46.510 --> 01:03:46.520 align:start position:0%
so you know we are under a stay for one
 
01:03:49.109 --> 01:03:49.119 align:start position:0%
of those rulings and we it's very likely
 
01:03:50.670 --> 01:03:50.680 align:start position:0%
that there could be another stay for the
 
01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
other ruling so um I do believe there is
 
01:03:57.829 --> 01:03:57.839 align:start position:0%
time here to do the hard work and to
 
01:03:59.549 --> 01:03:59.559 align:start position:0%
find a solution that will meet the
 
01:04:01.269 --> 01:04:01.279 align:start position:0%
intent of both the rulings and our
 
01:04:04.069 --> 01:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
desire to do something for the state I
 
01:04:06.349 --> 01:04:06.359 align:start position:0%
think that if we try to Band-Aid this
 
01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:07.720 align:start position:0%
amendment up it will just be
 
01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
performative if this is a performative
 
01:04:11.589 --> 01:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
politics move to say oh we're meeting
 
01:04:13.109 --> 01:04:13.119 align:start position:0%
Our obligation of the rulings and look
 
01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:14.680 align:start position:0%
at us in finance we're trying to solve
 
01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
the problem no the what is going to
 
01:04:19.549 --> 01:04:19.559 align:start position:0%
happen in the next week will not be
 
01:04:22.430 --> 01:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
enough to solve the problem I you know
 
01:04:24.029 --> 01:04:24.039 align:start position:0%
respectfully I don't believe that's
 
01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
that's the case given the overwhelming
 
01:04:28.510 --> 01:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
testimony yesterday and again today
 
01:04:31.269 --> 01:04:31.279 align:start position:0%
there are significant unintended
 
01:04:34.349 --> 01:04:34.359 align:start position:0%
consequences um and then just as an
 
01:04:37.789 --> 01:04:37.799 align:start position:0%
aside um I think that
 
01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
this amendment misses a it is lacking
 
01:04:45.789 --> 01:04:45.799 align:start position:0%
creativity in terms of how to solve the
 
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
solution I think how to solve the
 
01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
problem of you know swept how to solve
 
01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
the problem of raising
 
01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
adequacy the only solution
 
01:04:59.870 --> 01:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
proposed in the amendment is to go at
 
01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
swept to you know increase swept to
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
limit the cap in the future it's not to
 
01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
expand the vision of where does our
 
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
state get you know the revenue sources
 
01:05:14.309 --> 01:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
to feed school funding and I think if if
 
01:05:15.789 --> 01:05:15.799 align:start position:0%
we really want to tackle the problem in
 
01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
a way that does not put the full burden
 
01:05:20.670 --> 01:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
on property owners in our state we need
 
01:05:22.309 --> 01:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
to back up and look at all the other
 
01:05:25.789 --> 01:05:25.799 align:start position:0%
Revenue sources and find a more diverse
 
01:05:28.510 --> 01:05:28.520 align:start position:0%
ified way of existing tax revenues to
 
01:05:29.950 --> 01:05:29.960 align:start position:0%
solve the problem in a way that's more
 
01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
Equitable to people across the state so
 
01:05:35.269 --> 01:05:35.279 align:start position:0%
for instance not just people who own the
 
01:05:37.789 --> 01:05:37.799 align:start position:0%
land P pay to help fund our schools more
 
01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:40.760 align:start position:0%
it's you know there's a whole population
 
01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
of people who come and do business in
 
01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
our state that could also be working
 
01:05:47.269 --> 01:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
towards solving that solution
 
01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
so um I think we have an opportunity I
 
01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
think the Band-Aids proposed are not
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
going to solve it and I think if we do
 
01:05:58.309 --> 01:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
do want to do the work if we do want to
 
01:06:00.789 --> 01:06:00.799 align:start position:0%
address this we need to send it to the
 
01:06:03.349 --> 01:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that is not only charged
 
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
with you know solving school funding
 
01:06:09.029 --> 01:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
with a greater perspective but also to
 
01:06:11.109 --> 01:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
to give them the room to do the process
 
01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
to look at the process
 
01:06:16.789 --> 01:06:16.799 align:start position:0%
and this I think if we were to try to
 
01:06:18.750 --> 01:06:18.760 align:start position:0%
pass a this amendment it's going to
 
01:06:21.349 --> 01:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
undercut the state's ability to address
 
01:06:24.190 --> 01:06:24.200 align:start position:0%
the problem at a bigger from a bigger
 
01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
perspective if you limit it to swap
 
01:06:28.829 --> 01:06:28.839 align:start position:0%
you're just going to continue to push
 
01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
down this alley that we all know is not
 
01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
sustainable and if we're looking for a
 
01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
sustainable long-term solution one that
 
01:06:37.269 --> 01:06:37.279 align:start position:0%
is not just a two-year solution but one
 
01:06:39.269 --> 01:06:39.279 align:start position:0%
that will last for many years for our
 
01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
state we have to back up we have to
 
01:06:43.630 --> 01:06:43.640 align:start position:0%
reassess the process and we have to do
 
01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
the hard work which we are which we are
 
01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
capable of doing but not in the next you
 
01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
know four
 
01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
days I appreciate your comments but
 
01:06:53.390 --> 01:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
there are multiple Revenue sources that
 
01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
go into
 
01:06:58.069 --> 01:06:58.079 align:start position:0%
education and uh business profit tax uh
 
01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
all the liquor uh commission profits go
 
01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
in there uh part of part of the gaming
 
01:07:07.029 --> 01:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
commission I mean there's multiple
 
01:07:10.309 --> 01:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
multiple feeders into this so it's not
 
01:07:12.789 --> 01:07:12.799 align:start position:0%
like yes but the only solution in this
 
01:07:15.150 --> 01:07:15.160 align:start position:0%
amendment is to look at property tax
 
01:07:17.269 --> 01:07:17.279 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not talking about
 
01:07:19.109 --> 01:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
getting more Revenue into the education
 
01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
trust fund right now I I agree with you
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
totally which is which is why I think
 
01:07:26.789 --> 01:07:26.799 align:start position:0%
you know way means needs to weigh on
 
01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
this weigh in on this I think they need
 
01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
to have a say about where the education
 
01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:32.559 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
01:07:36.029 --> 01:07:36.039 align:start position:0%
sourcing how much of that moves forward
 
01:07:37.230 --> 01:07:37.240 align:start position:0%
well sounds like you have a bill for
 
01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:38.589 align:start position:0%
well sounds like you have a bill for
next

01:07:38.589 --> 01:07:38.599 align:start position:0%
next
 
01:07:41.069 --> 01:07:41.079 align:start position:0%
turn Mr chair could I just add a couple
 
01:07:43.789 --> 01:07:43.799 align:start position:0%
of things we haven't talked about Equity
 
01:07:46.789 --> 01:07:46.799 align:start position:0%
we also haven't talked about what's in
 
01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
this amendment that we're shifting
 
01:07:52.789 --> 01:07:52.799 align:start position:0%
authority of
 
01:07:57.190 --> 01:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
the running of Ed local education from
 
01:08:01.549 --> 01:08:01.559 align:start position:0%
the locality from the local control of
 
01:08:03.390 --> 01:08:03.400 align:start position:0%
school districts to set their own
 
01:08:09.230 --> 01:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
budgets will now be a state run effort
 
01:08:11.589 --> 01:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
um the the budgets will be set on a
 
01:08:14.309 --> 01:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
three-year average by
 
01:08:18.910 --> 01:08:18.920 align:start position:0%
Dr that takes away the local control
 
01:08:22.189 --> 01:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
that has long been a history in our
 
01:08:26.149 --> 01:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
state and equity and funding
 
01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
for all kids is something that we've
 
01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:30.870 align:start position:0%
for all kids is something that we've
talked

01:08:30.870 --> 01:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
talked
 
01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
about forever and the commission that I
 
01:08:38.550 --> 01:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
sat on um with representative Ames a big
 
01:08:41.669 --> 01:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
part of that was about Equity so that
 
01:08:45.070 --> 01:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
all children in New Hampshire are
 
01:08:49.470 --> 01:08:49.480 align:start position:0%
getting at least close to the same kind
 
01:08:52.349 --> 01:08:52.359 align:start position:0%
of education and this amendment doesn't
 
01:08:55.749 --> 01:08:55.759 align:start position:0%
even direct that at all actually it goes
 
01:08:58.709 --> 01:08:58.719 align:start position:0%
against that so I just had to mention
 
01:09:00.229 --> 01:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
those couple of things thank you Mr
 
01:09:03.149 --> 01:09:03.159 align:start position:0%
chair I reiterate my position I got you
 
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
I addressing the conval judgment and
 
01:09:07.349 --> 01:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
trying to resolve
 
01:09:10.590 --> 01:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
it uh all the other arguments are
 
01:09:13.709 --> 01:09:13.719 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct but that's not what
 
01:09:15.550 --> 01:09:15.560 align:start position:0%
what we're here what this committee is
 
01:09:17.390 --> 01:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
here to do that's that's a bigger
 
01:09:19.630 --> 01:09:19.640 align:start position:0%
discussion so I mean I don't think we're
 
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
could put an amendment on here to say
 
01:09:24.070 --> 01:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
let's let's up this is prophit taxt
 
01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:25.880 align:start position:0%
motion and that's ways
 
01:09:30.269 --> 01:09:30.279 align:start position:0%
means yes d one last short question um
 
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
besides the fact that by the way local
 
01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
control goes with uh you know your
 
01:09:37.269 --> 01:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
ability to raise funds to run your town
 
01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:39.319 align:start position:0%
if you are running your town based on
 
01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
funds gathered by other people other
 
01:09:43.349 --> 01:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
people have a say in your local control
 
01:09:45.630 --> 01:09:45.640 align:start position:0%
because you're using their money so
 
01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
local control works really well when you
 
01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
are paying from your own Pockets when
 
01:09:50.950 --> 01:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
you're paying from somebody else's
 
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
Pockets there is a degree of limitation
 
01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
local control that comes with asking for
 
01:09:56.590 --> 01:09:56.600 align:start position:0%
those funds so that's a very interesting
 
01:09:58.189 --> 01:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
philosophical discussion way out of
 
01:10:02.110 --> 01:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
bounds for today but my question is say
 
01:10:04.110 --> 01:10:04.120 align:start position:0%
that we do not address the conval
 
01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
judgment and that the Judgment does not
 
01:10:10.189 --> 01:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
get State well how in God's name are we
 
01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
going to deal with that or is that also
 
01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
out of bounds for this particular work
 
01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
meeting I because this affects my
 
01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
decision on whether this amendment you
 
01:10:21.669 --> 01:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
know should continue or not because part
 
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
of it is to frankly hedge against the
 
01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
possible choice of the Judiciary to not
 
01:10:29.070 --> 01:10:29.080 align:start position:0%
issue a stay and force us to start
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
paying you know in a week or two or
 
01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
three just start disbursing money
 
01:10:34.669 --> 01:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
outside of our normal process and with
 
01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
huge impacts on both this year's budgets
 
01:10:38.350 --> 01:10:38.360 align:start position:0%
and next year's budget process and
 
01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
everything so I'm trying to understand
 
01:10:42.310 --> 01:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
if we do not pass this what risks are we
 
01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
taking in terms of the conval Judgment
 
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
not being state that I don't
 
01:10:51.990 --> 01:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
know Mary can I move the uh Amendment um
 
01:10:56.229 --> 01:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
the bill um can I out um
 
01:10:59.830 --> 01:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
recommend House Bill
 
01:11:01.870 --> 01:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
1583 are to
 
01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
pass not until we have an
 
01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
amendment we might as well vote we know
 
01:11:08.229 --> 01:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
what the vote's going to be unless you
 
01:11:10.709 --> 01:11:10.719 align:start position:0%
go get Ken it's going to be
 
01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
44 that's why I'm going to take a five
 
01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:14.590 align:start position:0%
44 that's why I'm going to take a five
minute

01:11:14.590 --> 01:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
minute
 
01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
recess correction if you please this is
 
01:11:19.270 --> 01:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court issues a stay over the
 
01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
sweeping conal school funding decision
 
01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
there hasn't been one on Rand but I do
 
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
believe there's one on conal and we're
 
01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
talking about conell here I appreciate
 
01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:36.950 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
yep so we'll

01:11:54.239 --> 01:12:24.149 align:start position:0%

01:19:59.870 --> 01:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
we come back to order for the work
 
01:20:03.310 --> 01:20:03.320 align:start position:0%
session on uh House Bill
 
01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:05.390 align:start position:0%
session on uh House Bill
1583

01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
1583
 
01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh what we've discussed is an
 
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
Chang the
 
01:20:16.229 --> 01:20:16.239 align:start position:0%
amendment to an effective date of July 1
 
01:20:19.669 --> 01:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
2025 and adding language that allows tax
 
01:20:21.550 --> 01:20:21.560 align:start position:0%
to be collected in
 
01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
anticipation of the of the
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
implementation because a calendar year
 
01:20:28.149 --> 01:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
and a school year are not the same thing
 
01:20:31.030 --> 01:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
so those will be taken care of by Mickey
 
01:20:33.590 --> 01:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
and be that will be part of the
 
01:20:36.910 --> 01:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
amendment as it appears in full
 
01:20:39.590 --> 01:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
Finance so I would
 
01:20:42.750 --> 01:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
move the amendment whatever number it
 
01:20:44.629 --> 01:20:44.639 align:start position:0%

thank

01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:24:42.229 --> 01:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
you if I do it side by side basically
 
01:24:43.950 --> 01:24:43.960 align:start position:0%
your your amendment has higher dollar
 
01:24:48.030 --> 01:24:48.040 align:start position:0%
values well and what can I speak I speak
 
01:24:52.390 --> 01:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely so um this amendment number
 
01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
um 132 7h is an adjustment of the
 
01:25:00.669 --> 01:25:00.679 align:start position:0%
dollars based on our subcommittee um
 
01:25:04.229 --> 01:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
representative luno um had called me and
 
01:25:06.830 --> 01:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
asked me why the numbers were so low
 
01:25:08.510 --> 01:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
because we had agreed in the
 
01:25:10.430 --> 01:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that the amount of a
 
01:25:12.830 --> 01:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
special ed Aid that would be within this
 
01:25:15.149 --> 01:25:15.159 align:start position:0%
bill um
 
01:25:17.709 --> 01:25:17.719 align:start position:0%
1656 would be $35
 
01:25:21.030 --> 01:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
million and so it ended up being 17
 
01:25:23.950 --> 01:25:23.960 align:start position:0%
million um as presented so we just
 
01:25:25.629 --> 01:25:25.639 align:start position:0%
wanted to to make that adjustment so
 
01:25:27.629 --> 01:25:27.639 align:start position:0%
that local school districts who we all
 
01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
know are suffering from The High Cost of
 
01:25:32.870 --> 01:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
special ed would get the full 35 million
 
01:25:35.870 --> 01:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
that we spoke to as part of our agreed
 
01:25:42.030 --> 01:25:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:45.470 --> 01:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is everybody following this
 
01:25:47.910 --> 01:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
because my I'm I'm trying to remember
 
01:25:49.669 --> 01:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
what my amendment I think that was in
 
01:25:53.229 --> 01:25:53.239 align:start position:0%
the original Bill wasn't it what did we
 
01:25:57.109 --> 01:25:57.119 align:start position:0%
change so if you recall there was a uh
 
01:26:00.629 --> 01:26:00.639 align:start position:0%
uh an issue raised over the data and
 
01:26:02.830 --> 01:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
that there was a catchall a number of uh
 
01:26:04.149 --> 01:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
kids that sped that didn't fall into
 
01:26:06.750 --> 01:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
each of the categories so doe had
 
01:26:09.070 --> 01:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
identified um a provision and you see
 
01:26:11.510 --> 01:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
that on both amendments at the bottom
 
01:26:14.990 --> 01:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
starting on line 14 excuse me it's 15
 
01:26:16.590 --> 01:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
where any pupil receiving special
 
01:26:19.189 --> 01:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
education services identified by the
 
01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
department that was nut and the
 
01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
Department's data collection efforts uh
 
01:26:24.070 --> 01:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
shall default to category a so that's
 
01:26:26.149 --> 01:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
the the technical fix that Doe had
 
01:26:27.910 --> 01:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
brought forward last work session okay
 
01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
so that was my Amendment yes and that is
 
01:26:33.109 --> 01:26:33.119 align:start position:0%
also included in representative heaths
 
01:26:34.750 --> 01:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
and the Really the difference between
 
01:26:36.390 --> 01:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
the two is the per people eight amounts
 
01:26:39.030 --> 01:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
in paragraph sub paragraph da a excuse
 
01:26:43.229 --> 01:26:43.239 align:start position:0%
me D1 on line five and the cost
 
01:26:45.229 --> 01:26:45.239 align:start position:0%
approximately uh yours representative
 
01:26:48.709 --> 01:26:48.719 align:start position:0%
Emer is about $17.7 million in 25 and
 
01:26:50.990 --> 01:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
representative Heath is 35 million so
 
01:26:53.229 --> 01:26:53.239 align:start position:0%
that's materially the
 
01:26:55.390 --> 01:26:55.400 align:start position:0%
difference and this is going to come out
 
01:26:58.629 --> 01:26:58.639 align:start position:0%
of uh educational trust fund anyway and
 
01:27:00.270 --> 01:27:00.280 align:start position:0%
there are sufficient funds right now in
 
01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:06.990 --> 01:27:07.000 align:start position:0%
fund I'll agree with you Mary because
 
01:27:08.910 --> 01:27:08.920 align:start position:0%
you got me on this
 
01:27:12.870 --> 01:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
one so would you like to would
 
01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
you I'd like to Second
 
01:27:18.790 --> 01:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
it that was great what are we moving
 
01:27:22.669 --> 01:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
specifically uh
 
01:27:27.030 --> 01:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
273 thank
 
01:27:32.709 --> 01:27:32.719 align:start position:0%
you okay does anybody have any
 
01:27:35.189 --> 01:27:35.199 align:start position:0%
discussion it's basically different
 
01:27:38.070 --> 01:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
values and the addition of the
 
01:27:40.510 --> 01:27:40.520 align:start position:0%
catchall so if
 
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:49.189 --> 01:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
I uh for the uh Heath Amendment 1327 H
 
01:27:52.229 --> 01:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
approximately $35 million and the Emer
 
01:27:55.910 --> 01:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh1 12 11h is approximately
 
01:27:59.550 --> 01:27:59.560 align:start position:0%
$17.7 million and and I will also just
 
01:28:01.910 --> 01:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
remind the committee these are those are
 
01:28:06.149 --> 01:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
numbers based on this bill isolated you
 
01:28:08.510 --> 01:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
also are moving forward with 1583 which
 
01:28:10.149 --> 01:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
makes other changes to the education
 
01:28:13.030 --> 01:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
funding formula if you ultimately pass
 
01:28:15.990 --> 01:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
both uh we would incorporate both and do
 
01:28:18.030 --> 01:28:18.040 align:start position:0%
a number for you it might not be exactly
 
01:28:20.790 --> 01:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
the sum of the two bills because there's
 
01:28:23.070 --> 01:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
some Provisions that have some netting
 
01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh specifically the hold Harless
 
01:28:27.149 --> 01:28:27.159 align:start position:0%
provision uh just just throwing that out
 
01:28:30.149 --> 01:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
there it's just be uh aware of that as
 
01:28:31.950 --> 01:28:31.960 align:start position:0%
you move
 
01:28:33.870 --> 01:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
forward I was going to ask you some
 
01:28:35.790 --> 01:28:35.800 align:start position:0%
questions after this about what you
 
01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:37.870 align:start position:0%
questions after this about what you
passed

01:28:37.870 --> 01:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
passed
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
out for which Bill 1583
 
01:28:44.149 --> 01:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
yep I can do it as part of this once
 
01:28:45.990 --> 01:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
once we go through with this I'll ask
 
01:28:48.629 --> 01:28:48.639 align:start position:0%
the questions in public sure sure okay
 
01:28:52.390 --> 01:28:52.400 align:start position:0%
so we have uh the the heath amendment
 
01:28:57.189 --> 01:28:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:59.229 --> 01:28:59.239 align:start position:0%
seconded so I guess we'll do it by a
 
01:29:04.270 --> 01:29:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:06.590 --> 01:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
amendment yeah we don't have to we can
 
01:29:09.310 --> 01:29:09.320 align:start position:0%
do this by show hands okay all those in
 
01:29:13.870 --> 01:29:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:16.669 --> 01:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
hands okay all those in favor of the IMC
 
01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:22.149 --> 01:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
hands okay
 
01:29:25.390 --> 01:29:25.400 align:start position:0%
so well technically this was a motion
 
01:29:28.109 --> 01:29:28.119 align:start position:0%
just did not in favor of the heath
 
01:29:29.870 --> 01:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment raise your hand sorry about
 
01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
that now I would I would make a motion

01:31:18.709 --> 01:31:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:21.510 --> 01:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
Finance okay I guess that concludes the
 
01:31:23.950 --> 01:31:23.960 align:start position:0%
formal portion but I would like to have
 
01:31:26.629 --> 01:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
have some a question about the
 
01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
handouts uh particularly this one that
 
01:31:31.350 --> 01:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
you gave us yesterday through with the
 
01:31:33.830 --> 01:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
summary I had a question that came up
 
01:31:42.189 --> 01:31:42.199 align:start position:0%
about well does this include 1656 and I
 
01:31:43.990 --> 01:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
think you already answered that it does
 
01:31:48.229 --> 01:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
not okay and down at the bottom at the
 
01:31:52.350 --> 01:31:52.360 align:start position:0%
net total net State cost do those
 
01:31:54.669 --> 01:31:54.679 align:start position:0%
numbers are that neted out of the 90
 
01:31:58.990 --> 01:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
million swept increase or is that that
 
01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
accounts for the excess swept remitted
 
01:32:04.070 --> 01:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
so this would be 110 million already
 
01:32:05.950 --> 01:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
considering that excess sweps coming
 
01:32:09.790 --> 01:32:09.800 align:start position:0%
coming in so the net increase on this is
 
01:32:13.149 --> 01:32:13.159 align:start position:0%
1106 correct all right correct so we are
 
01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
kind of turning into the Ways and Means
 
01:32:18.669 --> 01:32:18.679 align:start position:0%
Committee we yeah because I think if you
 
01:32:20.550 --> 01:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
do the math like the education trust
 
01:32:22.430 --> 01:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
fund even though it's at a surplus of
 
01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
like 200 at the end of the bium it's
 
01:32:27.109 --> 01:32:27.119 align:start position:0%
going to be gone so now we're talking
 
01:32:28.390 --> 01:32:28.400 align:start position:0%
about moving into the future you're
 
01:32:30.350 --> 01:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
going to have to start bringing in more
 
01:32:33.189 --> 01:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
Revenue it won't be gone to the take 100
 
01:32:35.030 --> 01:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
million out each year it will be in two
 
01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:37.189 align:start position:0%
million out each year it will be in two
years

01:32:37.189 --> 01:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:32:44.189 --> 01:32:44.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:46.350 --> 01:32:46.360 align:start position:0%
are well that's what the next budget
 
01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:48.310 align:start position:0%
are well that's what the next budget
Cycle's

01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
Cycle's
 
01:32:52.750 --> 01:32:52.760 align:start position:0%
for and just a reminder that that $230
 
01:32:54.750 --> 01:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
or so million dollar of education trust
 
01:32:57.430 --> 01:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
fund Surplus that we refer to is the
 
01:32:59.189 --> 01:32:59.199 align:start position:0%
projected Surplus at the end of this
 
01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
bium y so we still have 15 months of
 
01:33:04.350 --> 01:33:04.360 align:start position:0%
Revenue collections to get to that
 
01:33:05.870 --> 01:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
number that need to come in on so that's
 
01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
money that's not in the bank yet either
 
01:33:09.870 --> 01:33:09.880 align:start position:0%
so that's just the plan at this point
 
01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
well I'll be quite honest um
 
01:33:16.750 --> 01:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
um my sense right now is that 15 the
 
01:33:18.550 --> 01:33:18.560 align:start position:0%
amendment for this has little or no
 
01:33:21.550 --> 01:33:21.560 align:start position:0%
chance of making out of Finance so this
 
01:33:24.590 --> 01:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
is kind of a moot discussion so anyway
 
01:33:27.189 --> 01:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming today and we'll see
 
01:33:29.470 --> 01:33:29.480 align:start position:0%
I guess next Tuesday I we haven't seen
 
01:33:33.590 --> 01:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
the the schedule yet we gener exact on
 
01:33:36.109 --> 01:33:36.119 align:start position:0%
Tuesdays I would hope we'll also meet
 
01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
tomorrow in session but yeah as a
 
01:33:40.510 --> 01:33:40.520 align:start position:0%
committee right right as
 
01:33:44.790 --> 01:33:44.800 align:start position:0%
yeah you had to remind me yeah tomorrow
 
01:33:46.590 --> 01:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
no chance to do the and tomorrow night
 
01:33:49.149 --> 01:33:49.159 align:start position:0%
it's look like another 8 o'clock look at
 
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
that you got got half an hour extra I
 
01:33:53.950 --> 01:33:53.960 align:start position:0%
don't know what to do with myself I
 
01:33:58.669 --> 01:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:01.270 --> 01:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
out could have well that would have been
 
01:34:10.430 --> 01:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:12.790 --> 01:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
on Mary I'll be honest with you I don't
 
01:34:20.669 --> 01:34:20.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:32.629 --> 01:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:52.629 --> 01:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:52.639 --> 01:35:04.030 align:start position:0%
