[Music]

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.380 align:start position:0%

00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:12.199 align:start position:0%
I believe it's uh Department of Revenue
 
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
2022-132 is the first on the regular
 
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.129 align:start position:0%
2022-132 is the first on the regular
agenda

00:07:16.129 --> 00:07:16.139 align:start position:0%
agenda
 
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
this particular proposal there was a
 
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:22.380 align:start position:0%
conditional approval filed however
 
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:24.900 align:start position:0%
there were five substantive comments and
 
00:07:26.689 --> 00:07:26.699 align:start position:0%
one comment to jail car still remaining
 
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
on that conditional approval
 
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:31.860 align:start position:0%
the first was on page four it's an
 
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:35.340 align:start position:0%
unclear comment about all amounts
 
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
charged must be included in the amount
 
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
of the gross charge
 
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:41.340 align:start position:0%
which conflicts with later Provisions in
 
00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:43.139 align:start position:0%
the rule as those later Provisions
 
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:45.300 align:start position:0%
layout exceptions so therefore it's not
 
00:07:48.529 --> 00:07:48.539 align:start position:0%
all charges must be gross charges there
 
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:51.180 align:start position:0%
are actually exceptions so there are
 
00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.370 align:start position:0%
are actually exceptions so there are
some

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:55.500 align:start position:0%
issues with that particular rule
 
00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
I don't know if the department wants to
 
00:07:59.150 --> 00:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
respond to that before I move on to the
 
00:08:02.809 --> 00:08:02.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
good morning uh Keen Ming Wong
 
00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue
 
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:08.580 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:08:10.909 --> 00:08:10.919 align:start position:0%
these so just want to start off with
 
00:08:14.029 --> 00:08:14.039 align:start position:0%
saying that these uh these rules were as
 
00:08:14.039 --> 00:08:15.170 align:start position:0%
saying that these uh these rules were as
um

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:17.089 --> 00:08:17.099 align:start position:0%
attorney uh
 
00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
your card has pointed out in her
 
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
comments that uh these were already
 
00:08:25.249 --> 00:08:25.259 align:start position:0%
addressed in the 2012 um Joker meeting
 
00:08:28.249 --> 00:08:28.259 align:start position:0%
and it was passed back back then
 
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
um and look through the uh the files
 
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:34.860 align:start position:0%
the historical files and um couldn't
 
00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
really see any
 
00:08:38.209 --> 00:08:38.219 align:start position:0%
um notes that was written down as to
 
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:40.380 align:start position:0%
what was discussed back in 2012 in the
 
00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
jail club meeting I couldn't bring any
 
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
more additional information uh to sort
 
00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.370 align:start position:0%
more additional information uh to sort
of

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.110 align:start position:0%
of
discuss

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:49.980 align:start position:0%
the uh the outcome of that but
 
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:51.540 align:start position:0%
ultimately uh
 
00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:54.660 align:start position:0%
it was approved and then I
 
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
and I was went back to the um the RSA in
 
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
terms of these uh the 1602.01 A and it
 
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.269 align:start position:0%
terms of these uh the 1602.01 A and it
is

00:09:04.269 --> 00:09:04.279 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:09:07.449 --> 00:09:07.459 align:start position:0%
addressing RSA
 
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
82-a colon 2 Roman 5 all the uh the
 
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:16.860 align:start position:0%
growth the the charges that's considered
 
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
as um as gross charge and then
 
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
specifically I think it is also
 
00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:25.860 align:start position:0%
addressing subpart e where it says
 
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
charges for services so which is um so
 
00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:31.140 align:start position:0%
that that list of charges there is the
 
00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
exception of what should not be in Gross
 
00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
charge and it's a party he says that you
 
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
know charges for services which are not
 
00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
provided in connection with the
 
00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
origination or receiving communication
 
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.930 align:start position:0%
origination or receiving communication
Services

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
Services
 
00:09:44.389 --> 00:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
um and so this part here it looks like
 
00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:47.180 align:start position:0%
to me when I was reading through this
 
00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:51.180 align:start position:0%
1602.01 a addresses more on this support
 
00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:54.180 align:start position:0%
e where it says okay what's not here
 
00:09:57.889 --> 00:09:57.899 align:start position:0%
would be here as accepted as should be
 
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:01.140 align:start position:0%
considered as taxable items in the gross
 
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:08.150 align:start position:0%
considered as taxable items in the gross
charge

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.470 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:10:12.829 --> 00:10:12.839 align:start position:0%
so this is not resolved no not at this
 
00:10:12.839 --> 00:10:14.449 align:start position:0%
so this is not resolved no not at this
time

00:10:14.449 --> 00:10:14.459 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:10:14.459 --> 00:10:16.850 align:start position:0%
time
yes

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
could it be
 
00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:22.380 align:start position:0%
reasonable to say that all amounts
 
00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:25.860 align:start position:0%
except those specifically Exempted
 
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
I mean really you've got the exemptions
 
00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
are very specific and narrow yeah you
 
00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:34.019 align:start position:0%
just need to include make sure that
 
00:10:38.889 --> 00:10:38.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
yes it looks like it's it's like a like
 
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
a um
 
00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:46.140 align:start position:0%
sort of a uh an opening statement say
 
00:10:48.889 --> 00:10:48.899 align:start position:0%
okay all charges share our gross charges
 
00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
and then there's this
 
00:10:54.769 --> 00:10:54.779 align:start position:0%
thing here as uh the attorney uh the
 
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
staff attorney had mentioned making
 
00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:01.519 align:start position:0%
reference to the later rev rules of
 
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
1602.02 160 2.03 B and those
 
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
well those are what services by the
 
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:14.100 align:start position:0%
retailer that shall not be included in
 
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
the growth charge
 
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:19.860 align:start position:0%
and in 16 so just for an example 1602.02
 
00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
it says uh support a say Services
 
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
provided by a retailer that shall not be
 
00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:27.660 align:start position:0%
included in close charge but then when
 
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
you look back to 1602.01
 
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:32.940 align:start position:0%
um it does say all charges
 
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
but used in by customers in connection
 
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
with origination or reception of
 
00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
communication services
 
00:11:42.829 --> 00:11:42.839 align:start position:0%
shall be included in amount of those
 
00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:44.820 align:start position:0%
charge whereas
 
00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:47.519 align:start position:0%
in 1602.02
 
00:11:47.519 --> 00:11:48.829 align:start position:0%
in 1602.02
um

00:11:48.829 --> 00:11:48.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:51.300 align:start position:0%
so what are the services that is not in
 
00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:53.940 align:start position:0%
there so in A1 it says those which are
 
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
not directly overlayed so there's no
 
00:11:58.910 --> 00:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
there's no conflict I don't see the
 
00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
conflict between a 160201a
 
00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:07.740 align:start position:0%
and O2 A1 because it sort of coughs it
 
00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.410 align:start position:0%
and O2 A1 because it sort of coughs it
out

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:09.420 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:12:11.449 --> 00:12:11.459 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:12:13.009 --> 00:12:13.019 align:start position:0%
so just make sure I'm clear you're
 
00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
saying that the later sections are
 
00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:17.700 align:start position:0%
different than the origination or
 
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
reception of communicating services and
 
00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:21.660 align:start position:0%
that's why they're not considered
 
00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
exceptions to all gross charges it's
 
00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
I will say there might be some overlap
 
00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of trying to carve out what's
 
00:12:32.449 --> 00:12:32.459 align:start position:0%
not a growth charge
 
00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
um and I think the 160201 is is this
 
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:38.100 align:start position:0%
blanket statement trying to capture all
 
00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
I would say that language is
 
00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:46.860 align:start position:0%
therefore unclear because you're saying
 
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
that there's some overlay but those are
 
00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
exceptions when you're saying all
 
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:54.949 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
I guess my other point may not be a
 
00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:00.180 align:start position:0%
strong point to say that but um since
 
00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:01.860 align:start position:0%
these rules have been in place since
 
00:13:07.009 --> 00:13:07.019 align:start position:0%
2012 oh we have not had any issues from
 
00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
yeah we're not bound by the errors of
 
00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
the past yeah
 
00:13:12.769 --> 00:13:12.779 align:start position:0%
about so I'm just trying to point out
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
that um we haven't received any kind of
 
00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:18.980 align:start position:0%
uh confusion comments from from um
 
00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:22.380 align:start position:0%
taxpayers or retailers who are filing
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
these returns
 
00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
um saying that okay yeah we're not
 
00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:27.839 align:start position:0%
there's no certainty or there's
 
00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959 align:start position:0%
if there are no more
 
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
questions regarding that particular
 
00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:42.180 align:start position:0%
comment uh the next comment which first
 
00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
appears on page 14 but then is
 
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
reiterated on pages 16 22 and 23
 
00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
is an authority legislative intent no to
 
00:13:51.829 --> 00:13:51.839 align:start position:0%
jail car comment this has to do with
 
00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:53.700 align:start position:0%
that Pains of penalty language we
 
00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:55.620 align:start position:0%
discussed at the last meeting appearing
 
00:13:58.569 --> 00:13:58.579 align:start position:0%
on forms when there's no statutory
 
00:14:02.329 --> 00:14:02.339 align:start position:0%
Authority for that however because we
 
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
discussed at the last meeting and it
 
00:14:05.569 --> 00:14:05.579 align:start position:0%
seems the department is moving forward
 
00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:08.100 align:start position:0%
with legislation to fix that if that
 
00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
legislation goes through that would fix
 
00:14:11.389 --> 00:14:11.399 align:start position:0%
the comments on this particular rule as
 
00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:14.100 align:start position:0%
well so the next uh substantive comment
 
00:14:16.009 --> 00:14:16.019 align:start position:0%
is on the bottom of page 14 it's an
 
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
unclear comment that says that the
 
00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
statute shall apply but it does not say
 
00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:23.940 align:start position:0%
what the statute shall apply to in the
 
00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:25.370 align:start position:0%
what the statute shall apply to in the
original

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:25.380 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
proposal they had originally cited
 
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
another statute but in the conditional
 
00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
approval have struck that statute due to
 
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
so the um the original language is that
 
00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:41.100 align:start position:0%
saying that the uh the underpayment
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
panel the underpayment penalties shall
 
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
apply to the communication Services tax
 
00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
RSA 82-a
 
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
um and so receiving the comment from
 
00:14:53.389 --> 00:14:53.399 align:start position:0%
staff attorney saying that okay shall
 
00:14:53.399 --> 00:14:54.350 align:start position:0%
staff attorney saying that okay shall
not

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:57.300 align:start position:0%
make reference to a2-a that's the reason
 
00:14:59.389 --> 00:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
why I took it out
 
00:15:02.509 --> 00:15:02.519 align:start position:0%
well the problem was the way the rule
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
was written in the proposal was saying
 
00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
that this statute shall apply to this
 
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:07.740 align:start position:0%
other statute but the statutory language
 
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:09.540 align:start position:0%
did not reference
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
that at all so you were essentially
 
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
using a rule to say that a statute shall
 
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:15.660 align:start position:0%
apply to another statute which is not
 
00:15:18.889 --> 00:15:18.899 align:start position:0%
within the authority of the department
 
00:15:18.899 --> 00:15:20.030 align:start position:0%
within the authority of the department
um

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:22.860 align:start position:0%
I guess so then we are okay to strike
 
00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:25.500 align:start position:0%
out that entire um support B because it
 
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:28.260 align:start position:0%
does say well I guess within the 21j32
 
00:15:30.949 --> 00:15:30.959 align:start position:0%
it does say that um
 
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
that underpayment penalty does apply to
 
00:15:35.689 --> 00:15:35.699 align:start position:0%
um rs-82 a within that particular
 
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:38.220 align:start position:0%
statute itself so I probably we don't
 
00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:42.180 align:start position:0%
need that in in in the rule here that's
 
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:47.220 align:start position:0%
if that's all right with the committee
 
00:15:50.569 --> 00:15:50.579 align:start position:0%
to just write that language yeah go
 
00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:52.860 align:start position:0%
ahead the next comment's an unclear
 
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
comment on page 19 the department uses
 
00:15:58.610 --> 00:15:58.620 align:start position:0%
the term substantial to measure
 
00:16:02.689 --> 00:16:02.699 align:start position:0%
the penalty attributable to or a measure
 
00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
to of whether or not a penalty will be
 
00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.350 align:start position:0%
to of whether or not a penalty will be
invoked

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
invoked
 
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
to an understatement of tax liability
 
00:16:11.629 --> 00:16:11.639 align:start position:0%
it's also used to measure the legal
 
00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
Authority required to avoid liability
 
00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:15.420 align:start position:0%
for an understatement which might
 
00:16:17.269 --> 00:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
otherwise impose that legal liability so
 
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
using the term substantial as a means of
 
00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:22.380 align:start position:0%
measurement to invoke a penalty and to
 
00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:24.420 align:start position:0%
say that whether or not someone has
 
00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
enough legal Authority is not clear and
 
00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
is in violation of RSA 541 A1 because
 
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:33.720 align:start position:0%
there's no criteria on how the
 
00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
department is actually going to
 
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
determine that on a case-by-case basis
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
so for the first substantial Authority
 
00:16:43.449 --> 00:16:43.459 align:start position:0%
comment which is on
 
00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
1611.01 A2
 
00:16:49.389 --> 00:16:49.399 align:start position:0%
um and then it goes on to if we look at
 
00:16:51.949 --> 00:16:51.959 align:start position:0%
1611.01 C
 
00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:54.300 align:start position:0%
it says in determining whether whether a
 
00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
retailer or customer has substantial
 
00:16:57.889 --> 00:16:57.899 align:start position:0%
Authority so detection consider the
 
00:16:57.899 --> 00:16:58.850 align:start position:0%
Authority so detection consider the
following

00:16:58.850 --> 00:16:58.860 align:start position:0%
following
 
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
um and those are the things that that
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
the uh department will be looking into
 
00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
this to determine whether there is that
 
00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:09.959 align:start position:0%
substantial Authority by the retailer
 
00:17:09.959 --> 00:17:11.510 align:start position:0%
substantial Authority by the retailer
customer

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
customer
 
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:14.100 align:start position:0%
and one with that motion
 
00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:17.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:18.900 align:start position:0%
Senator Gray
 
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
I think that what we've heard here is
 
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
that there's still a lot of Staff work
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
to be done on this one and that the
 
00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
comments from
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
The Joker staff really haven't been
 
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
addressed by the department and so I
 
00:17:39.049 --> 00:17:39.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
we have a motion on a second any further
 
00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.789 align:start position:0%
we have a motion on a second any further
discussion

00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:43.799 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:17:43.799 --> 00:17:46.070 align:start position:0%
discussion
huh

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
huh
 
00:17:48.169 --> 00:17:48.179 align:start position:0%
all those in favor
 
00:17:48.179 --> 00:17:49.190 align:start position:0%
all those in favor
aye

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
aye
 
00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:54.660 align:start position:0%
do you know where the office is you
 
00:17:56.409 --> 00:17:56.419 align:start position:0%
should go visit them
 
00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
and the next item on the regular agenda
 
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
is item 202262 from the Department of
 
00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:16.610 align:start position:0%
is item 202262 from the Department of
Safety

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
Safety
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh this particular rule um the
 
00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
department also filed a conditional
 
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
approval which addressed a majority of
 
00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:26.700 align:start position:0%
Staff comments however there is still
 
00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
one substantive comment remaining
 
00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
on page two there's an unclear comment
 
00:18:34.909 --> 00:18:34.919 align:start position:0%
as the rule
 
00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
states that every sexual offender or
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
offender against children shall register
 
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
and references the statutes but the
 
00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:44.700 align:start position:0%
statutes are circular in that the
 
00:18:46.669 --> 00:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
definition of a
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
sexual offender
 
00:18:51.409 --> 00:18:51.419 align:start position:0%
or offender against children say anyone
 
00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
who needs to be registered and then when
 
00:18:54.529 --> 00:18:54.539 align:start position:0%
you look at the other statute the
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
statute says that every sexual offender
 
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
or Fender against children shall
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
register so there's no real clear
 
00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
definition of of what that is this
 
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
comment was made on the conditional
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
approval text from 2012 and the
 
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
committee did approve the language at
 
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
that time but it seems that there was no
 
00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:25.799 align:start position:0%
I was told that a representative from
 
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
safety would be here it's not the normal
 
00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.289 align:start position:0%
safety would be here it's not the normal
attorney

00:19:30.289 --> 00:19:30.299 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
she said that she was going to be out
 
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
but that someone else would be here but
 
00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:35.220 align:start position:0%
it appears as though
 
00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:42.409 --> 00:19:42.419 align:start position:0%
do you have a recommendation on this
 
00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
I I don't have a specific recommendation
 
00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:47.340 align:start position:0%
as I said this language was approved
 
00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
before but
 
00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:52.260 align:start position:0%
um once as you said chairman that we're
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
not bound by the past so if the
 
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
committee feels as though this is enough
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
to be a preliminary objection it would
 
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
allow the department of me more time to
 
00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
talk and then see if we can come to a
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
resolution about that or we can accept
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
the conditional approval as is and leave
 
00:20:09.049 --> 00:20:09.059 align:start position:0%
that language there for now
 
00:20:09.059 --> 00:20:09.970 align:start position:0%
that language there for now
um

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:09.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire yes thank you Mr
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
chair I move we approve the rule with
 
00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
the recommendation that the department
 
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
Motion in a second any discussion all
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
those in favor
 
00:20:31.549 --> 00:20:31.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:31.559 --> 00:20:34.270 align:start position:0%
 
next

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
electrologists okay so um this proposal
 
00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:39.900 align:start position:0%
makes changes to the licensing rules for
 
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
Alcohol and Other Drug use professionals
 
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
laid acts and laid acts Etc
 
00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
the agency has filed a conditional
 
00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:50.460 align:start position:0%
approval request but there are still a
 
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
few comments that remain the first issue
 
00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:56.220 align:start position:0%
is on page 17 of the conditional
 
00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:01.740 align:start position:0%
approval request page 18 of the PDF
 
00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:04.140 align:start position:0%
there's been some testimonies submitted
 
00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
stating that the rule violates the
 
00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:07.860 align:start position:0%
statute because it does not allow for
 
00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
remote supervision on a platform like
 
00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
Zoom the rule does allow for indirect
 
00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:17.820 align:start position:0%
supervision and it defines that as being
 
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
telephonic the statute doesn't
 
00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
explicitly state that either clinical
 
00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
supervision or supervised practical
 
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
training can be done remotely and it
 
00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't Define what indirect supervision
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
means it also doesn't Define what a
 
00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
location is whether a location can be a
 
00:21:39.289 --> 00:21:39.299 align:start position:0%
remote location
 
00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
um we know that technology like Zoom
 
00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:43.940 align:start position:0%
would allow for video and not just audio
 
00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:46.740 align:start position:0%
like the the telephonic what what's
 
00:21:49.549 --> 00:21:49.559 align:start position:0%
currently in the role but this may be a
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
policy decision for the board
 
00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:53.820 align:start position:0%
um so that's what that first note is
 
00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
about if you want um Tina could respond
 
00:21:58.250 --> 00:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
to that before we move on to the next
 
00:21:58.260 --> 00:21:59.930 align:start position:0%
to that before we move on to the next
item

00:21:59.930 --> 00:21:59.940 align:start position:0%
item
 
00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm Tina Kelly I'm the
 
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
program specialist with the office of
 
00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
and if you look under C of that section
 
00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
it says supervised practical training
 
00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:14.940 align:start position:0%
that includes direct and indirect
 
00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
supervision both direct and indirect
 
00:22:20.409 --> 00:22:20.419 align:start position:0%
supervision are defined in
 
00:22:24.409 --> 00:22:24.419 align:start position:0%
ALC 301.01 ink
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
and one of those it just has to be a
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
combination of both one of those allows
 
00:22:33.649 --> 00:22:33.659 align:start position:0%
for uh telephonic and those types of um
 
00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
they and we don't put specifically Zoom
 
00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
we just telephonic or remote
 
00:22:42.649 --> 00:22:42.659 align:start position:0%
and I can read the definition if you
 
00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
um I don't know about you the others but
 
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
I don't actually need you to read that
 
00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
okay what I would like to see is that if
 
00:22:57.169 --> 00:22:57.179 align:start position:0%
there's a reference to those things that
 
00:23:00.409 --> 00:23:00.419 align:start position:0%
it be put into this paragraph
 
00:23:02.529 --> 00:23:02.539 align:start position:0%
um as a part of the conditional approval
 
00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
for this and therefore I think that
 
00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:19.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
it's defined there
 
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
um so do you want me to put in a direct
 
00:23:27.289 --> 00:23:27.299 align:start position:0%
includes direct supervision as defined
 
00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
in 301
 
00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to have you work that out with
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
staff or indirect supervision and as
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
defined yeah I can yeah that's easy
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
enough to add that's okay pretty much
 
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
editorial you'd say
 
00:23:42.049 --> 00:23:42.059 align:start position:0%
um or is that substantive it's a little
 
00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559 align:start position:0%
something we can make it as part of the
 
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:46.020 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request okay
 
00:23:48.649 --> 00:23:48.659 align:start position:0%
so I'll move on to the next item and
 
00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
that's on pages 26 and 27 it also
 
00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:55.039 align:start position:0%
involves a comment on page
 
00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:57.780 align:start position:0%
33. let me just scroll down there
 
00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:59.510 align:start position:0%
33. let me just scroll down there
um

00:23:59.510 --> 00:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh here the rule is talking about the
 
00:24:06.169 --> 00:24:06.179 align:start position:0%
application or licensing requirements
 
00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
for those holding an out of state
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
license a testimony has been submitted
 
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
stating that the statute allows for
 
00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:16.500 align:start position:0%
automatic licensing but it doesn't the
 
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
board has to waive the supervised work
 
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
and practical training experience to
 
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
anyone submitting proof of active
 
00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:25.340 align:start position:0%
practice for a period of five years
 
00:24:27.649 --> 00:24:27.659 align:start position:0%
initially we were thinking that the
 
00:24:27.659 --> 00:24:28.750 align:start position:0%
initially we were thinking that the
requirement

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:31.740 align:start position:0%
of submission of an official transcript
 
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
as you see there highlighted that's the
 
00:24:37.789 --> 00:24:37.799 align:start position:0%
sub paragraph four that that may be
 
00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
beyond what is necessary given that the
 
00:24:43.549 --> 00:24:43.559 align:start position:0%
board has to waive those requirements
 
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
the supervised in Practical training
 
00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
requirements but the statute does allow
 
00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
the board to license folks whose
 
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
academic study has been less than what's
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
required in New Hampshire is certain
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
other requirements are met so we think
 
00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
that's probably the reason why this
 
00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:01.860 align:start position:0%
requirement is here was without that
 
00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:03.900 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't know what coursework the
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
person actually has but there is an
 
00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
issue around the the rural language and
 
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
that's on page 27 and also on page 23
 
00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:16.559 align:start position:0%
where it's talking about that the person
 
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
has to have an active proof of active
 
00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:21.320 align:start position:0%
practice for 10 years
 
00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:24.980 align:start position:0%
the statute talks about five years
 
00:25:27.769 --> 00:25:27.779 align:start position:0%
so we've placed like I said that comment
 
00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:30.900 align:start position:0%
occurs also on page 33 and with that I
 
00:25:33.649 --> 00:25:33.659 align:start position:0%
can let Tina address that
 
00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
yep the um the clarification of why the
 
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
board's asking for the transcripts is
 
00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:41.820 align:start position:0%
exactly correct it's because it's so
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
different but we can change the 10 years
 
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
to five years I did look at the statute
 
00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:46.740 align:start position:0%
and the statute it's very clear it's
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:53.820 align:start position:0%
um and then the last comment is on page
 
00:25:58.669 --> 00:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
58 of The Proposal but 59 of the PDF and
 
00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
that's really a comment letting the
 
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
committee know that the board still does
 
00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:04.740 align:start position:0%
retain some fee Authority in the
 
00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:07.140 align:start position:0%
statutes and that's the only comments I
 
00:26:09.529 --> 00:26:09.539 align:start position:0%
have and this is a conditional approval
 
00:26:09.539 --> 00:26:12.370 align:start position:0%
have and this is a conditional approval
request

00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:12.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
Carol yes thank you I move we approve
 
00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
the conditional
 
00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:19.559 align:start position:0%
approval request with the addition of
 
00:26:21.769 --> 00:26:21.779 align:start position:0%
the correction of 10 years to five years
 
00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
in at least two places and the other
 
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:28.260 align:start position:0%
editorial comments recommended by staff
 
00:26:30.649 --> 00:26:30.659 align:start position:0%
and I believe that the fee Authority
 
00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:32.460 align:start position:0%
question is being addressed in
 
00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:35.930 align:start position:0%
question is being addressed in
legislation

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
Motion in a second any discussion
 
00:26:40.549 --> 00:26:40.559 align:start position:0%
all those in favor
 
00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:43.980 align:start position:0%
aye any objections
 
00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
yes so the board did submit a draft
 
00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:52.860 align:start position:0%
conditional approval however it sounds
 
00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
as though there was some technical
 
00:26:57.409 --> 00:26:57.419 align:start position:0%
difficulties over at the oplc which
 
00:26:59.330 --> 00:26:59.340 align:start position:0%
prevented them from officially
 
00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:00.900 align:start position:0%
submitting that conditional approval but
 
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
I was able to talk to uh Miss Kelly
 
00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
prior to this meeting to discuss the
 
00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:08.460 align:start position:0%
remaining comments after reviewing that
 
00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:11.820 align:start position:0%
draft conditional approval and came up
 
00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:14.940 align:start position:0%
with solutions to address those specific
 
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
concerns so at this time the conditional
 
00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:19.909 align:start position:0%
concerns so at this time the conditional
approval

00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
approval
 
00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:22.740 align:start position:0%
would be what was submitted as a draft
 
00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
in addition to changing the form that
 
00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
says pharmacist and advanced pharmacy
 
00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:31.559 align:start position:0%
technicians application that was
 
00:27:33.409 --> 00:27:33.419 align:start position:0%
submitted with the final proposal to
 
00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
pharmacists certified pharmacy
 
00:27:37.789 --> 00:27:37.799 align:start position:0%
technicians and Pharmacy interns
 
00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:41.400 align:start position:0%
application to administer vaccines to
 
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
change the section where it says
 
00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
pharmacy license to just say license or
 
00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:49.140 align:start position:0%
certification so that the certified
 
00:27:51.049 --> 00:27:51.059 align:start position:0%
pharmacy techs and interns could also
 
00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:53.460 align:start position:0%
use that application and then to change
 
00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:56.940 align:start position:0%
the rule itself to say instead of just
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
pharmacists shall apply pharmacists
 
00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
certified pharmacy techs and Pharmacy
 
00:28:04.669 --> 00:28:04.679 align:start position:0%
interns as the new statute does allow
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
all three of these
 
00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:08.700 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy Personnel to administer
 
00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:18.830 align:start position:0%
 
questions

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:20.870 align:start position:0%
 
motion

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:25.140 align:start position:0%
so I think for this um you have she
 
00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:28.260 align:start position:0%
sorry the department has to request
 
00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:31.140 align:start position:0%
um the conditional approval based on
 
00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:32.940 align:start position:0%
um the draft submitted and the other
 
00:28:36.169 --> 00:28:36.179 align:start position:0%
comments of attorney Ricard and then
 
00:28:36.179 --> 00:28:36.890 align:start position:0%
comments of attorney Ricard and then
um

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:36.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:38.820 align:start position:0%
jailcar has to waive the deadline
 
00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
because they they're filing it here at
 
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
any discussion all those in favor
 
00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:59.870 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:28:59.870 --> 00:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:02.029 --> 00:29:02.039 align:start position:0%
um and then you would accept the our
 
00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:04.020 align:start position:0%
move to accept the draft conditional
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
approval with the extra comments okay
 
00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
any discussion
 
00:29:14.269 --> 00:29:14.279 align:start position:0%
I'll lose some favor
 
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:23.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:25.740 align:start position:0%
okay um this proposal
 
00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:27.350 align:start position:0%
okay um this proposal
um

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
see is on the requirements for Renewal
 
00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
reinstatement and continuing education
 
00:29:34.669 --> 00:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
requirements for licensees for
 
00:29:38.029 --> 00:29:38.039 align:start position:0%
veterinarians there are two comments and
 
00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:40.380 align:start position:0%
on the amended conditional approval that
 
00:29:42.289 --> 00:29:42.299 align:start position:0%
you have before you and I'll just
 
00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:44.460 align:start position:0%
mention the easiest one first and that's
 
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:48.799 align:start position:0%
on page 10 of the proposal and the PDF
 
00:29:52.909 --> 00:29:52.919 align:start position:0%
they're the rule cites to the vet 800s
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
which doesn't currently exist but the
 
00:29:58.010 --> 00:29:58.020 align:start position:0%
agency is currently enroll regular rule
 
00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:01.860 align:start position:0%
making for that rule set the second
 
00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:04.740 align:start position:0%
comment is right there on page one the
 
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
rules have been expired since January 28
 
00:30:12.289 --> 00:30:12.299 align:start position:0%
of 2020 the statute does establish a
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
health program fee and that became
 
00:30:18.529 --> 00:30:18.539 align:start position:0%
effective in this year and then the PLC
 
00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:20.940 align:start position:0%
has established some rules also in some
 
00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:21.710 align:start position:0%
has established some rules also in some
other

00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
um in some other has established some
 
00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:27.240 align:start position:0%
fees and some other rules and those also
 
00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
have have effective dates in this year
 
00:30:31.909 --> 00:30:31.919 align:start position:0%
so the committee may have some questions
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
about the collection of fees and any
 
00:30:36.289 --> 00:30:36.299 align:start position:0%
refunds that have been done during that
 
00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
time period in which the rule was
 
00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
expired and the statutes weren't
 
00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:43.370 align:start position:0%
expired and the statutes weren't
effective

00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:47.700 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record Lindsey
 
00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
Courtney executive director office of
 
00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
professional Ace insurance certification
 
00:30:53.149 --> 00:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
with respect to the first comment
 
00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
regarding the vet 800s what we would
 
00:30:59.630 --> 00:30:59.640 align:start position:0%
propose is to have the board adopt each
 
00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
set of rules concurrently at the same
 
00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:05.460 align:start position:0%
time so as to avoid reference to a rule
 
00:31:08.269 --> 00:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
that's not in effect with respect to the
 
00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:11.940 align:start position:0%
fee issue as the committee is aware the
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
board of veterinary medicine was
 
00:31:15.769 --> 00:31:15.779 align:start position:0%
previously attached to the Department of
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
Agriculture they were in the process of
 
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
rulemaking at the time that they were
 
00:31:22.909 --> 00:31:22.919 align:start position:0%
transferred over to the office
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
think it was two budget Cycles ago
 
00:31:29.389 --> 00:31:29.399 align:start position:0%
um the rules expired in January 2020
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
um and but obviously that was an
 
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
oversight on our part in terms of not
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
understanding that uh the fees were
 
00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:38.940 align:start position:0%
captured in our mlo database that has
 
00:31:41.889 --> 00:31:41.899 align:start position:0%
since been corrected and about
 
00:31:45.169 --> 00:31:45.179 align:start position:0%
240 individuals have been issued refunds
 
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
to date it is a manual process so it is
 
00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:52.020 align:start position:0%
taking some time there are currently a
 
00:31:54.529 --> 00:31:54.539 align:start position:0%
thousand licensed veterinarians so it
 
00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
requires us to review each licensee
 
00:32:00.889 --> 00:32:00.899 align:start position:0%
record to assess whether or not a fee
 
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
was improperly charged and to issue the
 
00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate refund I did attempt to uh
 
00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:09.240 align:start position:0%
to obtain some documentation to support
 
00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
that our reporting was a little bit
 
00:32:15.889 --> 00:32:15.899 align:start position:0%
difficult in that it's a manual process
 
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
and includes
 
00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:21.080 align:start position:0%
protected financial information
 
00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:23.460 align:start position:0%
but if the committee would like for
 
00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
their documentation we can continue to
 
00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:28.799 --> 00:32:33.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:35.820 align:start position:0%
okay I had no further comment and um
 
00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:38.820 align:start position:0%
this is a conditional approval actually
 
00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:48.830 align:start position:0%
 
Carol

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
Carol
 
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
I move we accept the conditional amended
 
00:32:57.169 --> 00:32:57.179 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request and uh
 
00:32:59.750 --> 00:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank the oplc for issuing the refunds
 
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:04.559 --> 00:33:06.590 align:start position:0%
thank you
second

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:12.409 --> 00:33:12.419 align:start position:0%
we have this Motion in a second only
 
00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:16.980 align:start position:0%
question that I have was about uh 800
 
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
director had said adopting him
 
00:33:20.399 --> 00:33:22.450 align:start position:0%
director had said adopting him
concurrently

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:22.460 align:start position:0%
concurrently
 
00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:26.820 align:start position:0%
yeah um I don't see it as necessarily as
 
00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
our problem that these that the rule set
 
00:33:31.549 --> 00:33:31.559 align:start position:0%
you know that this rule refers to
 
00:33:33.889 --> 00:33:33.899 align:start position:0%
non-existing rules they are in the
 
00:33:36.889 --> 00:33:36.899 align:start position:0%
process of doing regular rule making I
 
00:33:39.529 --> 00:33:39.539 align:start position:0%
have reviewed the 800s so I think that
 
00:33:41.149 --> 00:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
they're going to be moving forward soon
 
00:33:43.549 --> 00:33:43.559 align:start position:0%
with that rule set I believe in the next
 
00:33:45.169 --> 00:33:45.179 align:start position:0%
month right
 
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
so we would be looking at a January gel
 
00:33:51.649 --> 00:33:51.659 align:start position:0%
card date possibly a December I think
 
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
it depends but yeah the latest would be
 
00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
January are you going to have a gel car
 
00:33:58.730 --> 00:33:58.740 align:start position:0%
by December
 
00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:07.549 --> 00:34:07.559 align:start position:0%
turn off my mic yeah
 
00:34:07.559 --> 00:34:08.450 align:start position:0%
turn off my mic yeah
okay

00:34:08.450 --> 00:34:08.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
there has only been one instance in the
 
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
history of gel car where they were not
 
00:34:17.589 --> 00:34:17.599 align:start position:0%
able to meet in December after uh
 
00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:20.940 align:start position:0%
organization yes
 
00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
okay did you vote
 
00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
I think he moved but didn't vote right
 
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you so we have a motion
 
00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:32.940 align:start position:0%
in a second
 
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
any other discussion
 
00:34:37.369 --> 00:34:37.379 align:start position:0%
seeing none all those in favor
 
00:34:37.379 --> 00:34:38.089 align:start position:0%
seeing none all those in favor
aye

00:34:38.089 --> 00:34:38.099 align:start position:0%
aye
 
00:34:42.349 --> 00:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
and next
 
00:34:47.089 --> 00:34:47.099 align:start position:0%
hey um next we have an amended
 
00:34:49.129 --> 00:34:49.139 align:start position:0%
conditional approval
 
00:34:51.169 --> 00:34:51.179 align:start position:0%
um on the prescription drug
 
00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:54.540 align:start position:0%
affordability rules this proposal would
 
00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
establish organizational rules for the
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
board and rules outlining the board's
 
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
operations there are three comments to
 
00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
bring to your attention we have received
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
this morning from representative Lang a
 
00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
document about 15 minutes before the
 
00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:11.820 align:start position:0%
committee began that have not had a
 
00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:13.820 align:start position:0%
chance to review
 
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
and I have just forwarded we've just
 
00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:18.660 align:start position:0%
forwarded that over to the agency as
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
well I can go ahead and get into the the
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
comments that I have in the rule
 
00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
um the first one
 
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
is on page 18 of the PDF
 
00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:35.150 align:start position:0%
and um
here

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:40.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:44.460 align:start position:0%
okay oh yes so actually it's on page one
 
00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
and that's just an informational note
 
00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:47.940 align:start position:0%
there kind of giving you the background
 
00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:52.140 align:start position:0%
uh for the for the rule itself and the
 
00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:54.079 align:start position:0%
fact that um
 
00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
hb1208 had an effective date of 2020 so
 
00:35:59.329 --> 00:35:59.339 align:start position:0%
you may have some questions about
 
00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
whether or not the board has been
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
meeting and issuing reports as required
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
by the um by the underlying statute
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
don't know if you want me to go ahead
 
00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:12.180 align:start position:0%
and turn it over to Allison or continue
 
00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:16.140 align:start position:0%
on to the next comment is your
 
00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
evaluation complete or are you waiting
 
00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:20.690 align:start position:0%
evaluation complete or are you waiting
for

00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:20.700 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
do you still have other things to review
 
00:36:25.609 --> 00:36:25.619 align:start position:0%
now there are a few other things on here
 
00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
to go over
 
00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
um let's see the like I said this on the
 
00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:32.940 align:start position:0%
next comment is on page 18 and
 
00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:36.180 align:start position:0%
um here also that that page is going to
 
00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:39.060 align:start position:0%
say page one because this Begins the the
 
00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
second set of rules the 300s
 
00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
um so here we we've received a comment
 
00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
because the rule basically restates
 
00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
what's in the statute and
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
um and it does mostly do that but the
 
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
board has added some additional
 
00:36:56.329 --> 00:36:56.339 align:start position:0%
information around data sets that
 
00:36:57.589 --> 00:36:57.599 align:start position:0%
they're going to be considering it
 
00:36:59.810 --> 00:36:59.820 align:start position:0%
determining the annual spending targets
 
00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
the board may need to do some additional
 
00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:04.380 align:start position:0%
rulemaking in the future as they kind of
 
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
Flesh that out in order to figure out
 
00:37:09.069 --> 00:37:09.079 align:start position:0%
what the spending targets should be
 
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
the next comment is on page 20 of the
 
00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:15.300 align:start position:0%
PDF and that's going to say page three
 
00:37:19.069 --> 00:37:19.079 align:start position:0%
at the top here the statute says that
 
00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:22.740 align:start position:0%
the board may may look into you know
 
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
getting funds and grants and contracts
 
00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
to augment their assessment fees and
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
that is what the statute says and in
 
00:37:34.069 --> 00:37:34.079 align:start position:0%
response to my comment the board has
 
00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:37.140 align:start position:0%
struck that out but I we do know that
 
00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:38.589 align:start position:0%
struck that out but I we do know that
often

00:37:38.589 --> 00:37:38.599 align:start position:0%
often
 
00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:41.220 align:start position:0%
agencies do not have to commit their
 
00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:44.220 align:start position:0%
process for accepting grants funds or
 
00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:47.820 align:start position:0%
contracts within the rules so um with
 
00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
that I had no other comments
 
00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:54.300 align:start position:0%
I I don't know if you in your question
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
uh you were referring to the email that
 
00:37:59.870 --> 00:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
representative Lang had received we have
 
00:38:02.089 --> 00:38:02.099 align:start position:0%
not reviewed that comment yet apparently
 
00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
the and representative Lang certainly
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
can talk more about it but apparently
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
someone questioned the constitutionality
 
00:38:12.109 --> 00:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
of the fees uh in the rules
 
00:38:12.119 --> 00:38:13.069 align:start position:0%
of the fees uh in the rules
yeah

00:38:13.069 --> 00:38:13.079 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:14.700 align:start position:0%
um sorry about that if that's what you
 
00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
meant no I have not reviewed it yet
 
00:38:20.329 --> 00:38:20.339 align:start position:0%
um it appears to be a 14-page document
 
00:38:20.339 --> 00:38:20.990 align:start position:0%
um it appears to be a 14-page document
um

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:24.349 --> 00:38:24.359 align:start position:0%
and um like I said neither me nor the
 
00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
agency has reviewed it yet
 
00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
um as far as I know the sport is not
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
assessing fines or fees per se they do
 
00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
have some assessment fees so I'm not
 
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
really sure what exactly the issue is
 
00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:40.740 align:start position:0%
and in the document until until I've had
 
00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
a chance to look at it so and this is
 
00:38:44.329 --> 00:38:44.339 align:start position:0%
outside of the public hearing process
 
00:38:46.609 --> 00:38:46.619 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
00:38:48.829 --> 00:38:48.839 align:start position:0%
hard to consider
 
00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:51.180 align:start position:0%
when there was an opportunity to comment
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
so there are um
 
00:38:55.849 --> 00:38:55.859 align:start position:0%
this is a 14-page document written in
 
00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:00.060 align:start position:0%
2013 so there's a large time Gap but it
 
00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:02.460 align:start position:0%
was written by Marcus Hearn who's very
 
00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:03.670 align:start position:0%
was written by Marcus Hearn who's very
um

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:06.300 align:start position:0%
well respected
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
um scholar in the area so it would
 
00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:10.740 align:start position:0%
definitely be something that we would
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
like to review and consider however you
 
00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:17.060 align:start position:0%
have a few options you can either
 
00:39:19.609 --> 00:39:19.619 align:start position:0%
approve today
 
00:39:21.349 --> 00:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
um do a preliminary objection based on
 
00:39:23.329 --> 00:39:23.339 align:start position:0%
staff comments which would give us more
 
00:39:25.069 --> 00:39:25.079 align:start position:0%
time to review this and then we would
 
00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:27.720 align:start position:0%
have to ask the potentially ask the the
 
00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
board for a revised objection response
 
00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:35.220 align:start position:0%
um but if you you approve it you can we
 
00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:37.140 align:start position:0%
can also then still go back take the
 
00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
time review everything and you can come
 
00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
back with a petition if something needs
 
00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:42.660 align:start position:0%
to be changed
 
00:39:44.569 --> 00:39:44.579 align:start position:0%
and and I could report out to the
 
00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
committee next time you know my review
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
and and um Christine is correct I I was
 
00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
a student of Marcus Hearn and have a
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
great deal of respect for him so I think
 
00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
receiving it at this late date doesn't
 
00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
give me an adequate time to really
 
00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:59.630 align:start position:0%
give me an adequate time to really
review

00:39:59.630 --> 00:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
review
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
um his analysis Carol
 
00:40:05.089 --> 00:40:05.099 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm concerned that
 
00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:07.820 align:start position:0%
somebody brings forth an eight-year-old
 
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
objection to fees and fines which we
 
00:40:12.829 --> 00:40:12.839 align:start position:0%
have been imposing for
 
00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:16.380 align:start position:0%
however many years which in this memo
 
00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
was written before this board was
 
00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:19.310 align:start position:0%
was written before this board was
created

00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
created
 
00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure how it can apply
 
00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
it should be either applying to all
 
00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:30.660 align:start position:0%
entities in the state or it's
 
00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
it's obsolete and I'm not sure we should
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
take it more seriously than to actually
 
00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:39.710 align:start position:0%
take it more seriously than to actually
than

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
um so seriously enough just based on my
 
00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
very preliminary review of skimming this
 
00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:47.940 align:start position:0%
14-page document
 
00:40:50.089 --> 00:40:50.099 align:start position:0%
um I do think that he may have a point
 
00:40:50.099 --> 00:40:51.470 align:start position:0%
um I do think that he may have a point
he's

00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
he's
 
00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
he's connecting
 
00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
fees or fines or whatever you call them
 
00:40:59.870 --> 00:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
to the the benefit or the thing that the
 
00:41:02.089 --> 00:41:02.099 align:start position:0%
the person gets back
 
00:41:05.329 --> 00:41:05.339 align:start position:0%
um so you pay a fee you get your license
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
um and so I think in this situation
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
there may be a point but like I said we
 
00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
can if you do approve we can go back and
 
00:41:16.849 --> 00:41:16.859 align:start position:0%
we'll do the analysis still and then
 
00:41:19.609 --> 00:41:19.619 align:start position:0%
recommend if the petition is needed that
 
00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:22.140 align:start position:0%
way they can move forward and we will
 
00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:23.220 align:start position:0%
still go ahead and take the time to
 
00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:25.140 align:start position:0%
review fine in that case what I would
 
00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:28.140 align:start position:0%
Rec I would move that we approve the
 
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
rule and request the agency to report on
 
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
the cost benefit of their fees
 
00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:37.010 align:start position:0%
the cost benefit of their fees
because

00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
they should know what it is second
 
00:41:42.109 --> 00:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
and that would be for an amended
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
conditional approval
 
00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:45.950 align:start position:0%
conditional approval
yes

00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:41:48.829 --> 00:41:48.839 align:start position:0%
any discussion
 
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
you're okay with that Gary
 
00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:54.060 align:start position:0%
so I guess my only question is there a
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
timeliness issue with this that forces
 
00:41:59.089 --> 00:41:59.099 align:start position:0%
us to move forward today given the fact
 
00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
that we may have a constitutional issue
 
00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
so we've just asked for them to go ahead
 
00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:04.740 align:start position:0%
and review
 
00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:07.260 align:start position:0%
field but we've been proven the rule as
 
00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:08.820 align:start position:0%
it's written and then they'd have to
 
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
come back with another amendment and go
 
00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:13.140 align:start position:0%
through rule number again no to come
 
00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
back with an analysis that justifies
 
00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
that the fees only
 
00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:20.700 align:start position:0%
the fees align with the benefits that
 
00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:22.140 align:start position:0%
they're provided to the people who are
 
00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:23.700 align:start position:0%
paying the fee
 
00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
and if the benefit if the analysis does
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
not show that then we can object and
 
00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:29.640 align:start position:0%
require them to return the fees or
 
00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:32.630 align:start position:0%
require them to return the fees or
whatever

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:36.180 align:start position:0%
yeah sure
 
00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
um representative Gary Merchant
 
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
um to your question Senator Reagan I
 
00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
any other discussion
 
00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none all those in favor
 
00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:52.380 align:start position:0%
aye any objections
 
00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes I think that that in light
 
00:42:58.550 --> 00:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
of this reminder that we
 
00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
that we keep an eye out for fees and
 
00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:02.750 align:start position:0%
that we keep an eye out for fees and
expect

00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
expect
 
00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:05.700 align:start position:0%
future fee setting authority to have a
 
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
an analysis of the benefits because
 
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
we need that to decide if it's
 
00:43:15.829 --> 00:43:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:25.020 align:start position:0%
and Department of Health and Human
 
00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:27.290 align:start position:0%
and Department of Health and Human
Services

00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:27.300 align:start position:0%
Services
 
00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:30.300 align:start position:0%
hey yes sir um these two proposals I'm
 
00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:32.220 align:start position:0%
going to lump them together because they
 
00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:34.500 align:start position:0%
deal with the same sort of issue or they
 
00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:37.500 align:start position:0%
have the same issue they both of these
 
00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:39.540 align:start position:0%
proposals make amendments to the rules
 
00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:42.180 align:start position:0%
on licensing and the radiation safety
 
00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:45.660 align:start position:0%
requirements for radiators and for wire
 
00:43:47.809 --> 00:43:47.819 align:start position:0%
line service operators
 
00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:49.980 align:start position:0%
there is a one comment that's applicable
 
00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:53.640 align:start position:0%
to both proposals both at a citation to
 
00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:56.290 align:start position:0%
to both proposals both at a citation to
hep4

00:43:56.290 --> 00:43:56.300 align:start position:0%
hep4
 
00:43:59.809 --> 00:43:59.819 align:start position:0%
1038 which is the rule on physical
 
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
protection of category one and Category
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
2 materials the fiscal impact statement
 
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
didn't address whether or not there
 
00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
would be an increase in cost for the
 
00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:13.700 align:start position:0%
entities to comply with ATP
 
00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:17.460 align:start position:0%
4038 the agency didn't talk about it in
 
00:44:19.849 --> 00:44:19.859 align:start position:0%
its request for fiscal impact that it's
 
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
submitted to the LBA and I reached out
 
00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:25.500 align:start position:0%
to the agency and it's subject matter
 
00:44:28.609 --> 00:44:28.619 align:start position:0%
experts said that and I'm summarizing
 
00:44:28.619 --> 00:44:29.470 align:start position:0%
experts said that and I'm summarizing
here

00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:29.480 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
and the agency is here and probably can
 
00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
correct me that after 9 11 it was
 
00:44:37.609 --> 00:44:37.619 align:start position:0%
required to administratively add all the
 
00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:40.020 align:start position:0%
federal requirements to the licensing
 
00:44:43.089 --> 00:44:43.099 align:start position:0%
requirements and I think those Federal
 
00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
requirements were in 10 CFR 37 so it was
 
00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:49.740 align:start position:0%
added as an additional licensing a
 
00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:51.060 align:start position:0%
separate additional licensing
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
requirement it sounded like adding now
 
00:44:58.609 --> 00:44:58.619 align:start position:0%
adding in this citation and requirements
 
00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:02.220 align:start position:0%
to the to the Hep 4038 will basically
 
00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:05.940 align:start position:0%
have no impact but again the agency is
 
00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:08.220 align:start position:0%
here and can answer any questions about
 
00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:09.530 align:start position:0%
here and can answer any questions about
that

00:45:09.530 --> 00:45:09.540 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
good morning Nicole valenzola Department
 
00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services
 
00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:15.780 align:start position:0%
administrative rules coordinator uh yes
 
00:45:18.290 --> 00:45:18.300 align:start position:0%
thank you oh sorry
 
00:45:20.329 --> 00:45:20.339 align:start position:0%
good morning senators and
 
00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
representatives my name is Augustine is
 
00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:25.260 align:start position:0%
all last names OMG I'm the administrator
 
00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:27.780 align:start position:0%
for the radiological health section
 
00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:31.500 align:start position:0%
uh so yes as attorney Reeves said um
 
00:45:33.589 --> 00:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
there are no new requirements being put
 
00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:36.060 align:start position:0%
forth on licensees they've already been
 
00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
established in CFR and through the
 
00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:40.500 align:start position:0%
nuclear Regulatory Commission uh
 
00:45:42.589 --> 00:45:42.599 align:start position:0%
therefore this was an update to site to
 
00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:44.220 align:start position:0%
include the rule
 
00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:46.130 align:start position:0%
include the rule
yes

00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:46.140 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:45:48.589 --> 00:45:48.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for that information However
 
00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:51.780 align:start position:0%
the fact that it's new to the rule
 
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
is I can't believe that a new section of
 
00:45:58.010 --> 00:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
of federal rules has no cost impact
 
00:46:01.309 --> 00:46:01.319 align:start position:0%
whatsoever and I think that this change
 
00:46:03.530 --> 00:46:03.540 align:start position:0%
to the rule
 
00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:06.060 align:start position:0%
should have been addressed
 
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm very concerned that you think
 
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
there's no cost impact and nobody needs
 
00:46:11.809 --> 00:46:11.819 align:start position:0%
to worry about
 
00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:14.700 align:start position:0%
a new Federal Regulation so it's not a
 
00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:16.380 align:start position:0%
new federal record it's new to the rule
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
it wasn't in the previous version
 
00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
the fact that it was applied by the
 
00:46:23.089 --> 00:46:23.099 align:start position:0%
federal government is one thing
 
00:46:23.099 --> 00:46:24.530 align:start position:0%
federal government is one thing
but

00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:24.540 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:27.780 align:start position:0%
if you waited 11 years to impose it it's
 
00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:30.660 align:start position:0%
a new rule for people that that are just
 
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
looking at your rules
 
00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:34.130 align:start position:0%
looking at your rules
membership

00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:34.140 align:start position:0%
membership
 
00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:42.589 --> 00:46:42.599 align:start position:0%
yes I think I could address that so
 
00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
since uh 911 the nuclear Regulatory
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
Commission uh issue emergency order to
 
00:46:54.349 --> 00:46:54.359 align:start position:0%
secure uh the use of certain types of
 
00:46:56.890 --> 00:46:56.900 align:start position:0%
materials that are classified as
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
category one and category two those
 
00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:02.700 align:start position:0%
reactive materials are of such a high
 
00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
activity that could impact the health
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
and safety of those using the material
 
00:47:10.490 --> 00:47:10.500 align:start position:0%
or for the security of this country so
 
00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:13.020 align:start position:0%
that being said then the emergency order
 
00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:16.140 align:start position:0%
that was issued by NRC shortly after 9
 
00:47:19.569 --> 00:47:19.579 align:start position:0%
11 were to have
 
00:47:22.670 --> 00:47:22.680 align:start position:0%
the agreement states of which New
 
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is one whereby we could
 
00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
through that emergency order to
 
00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:32.060 align:start position:0%
administratively add those security
 
00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:36.180 align:start position:0%
conditions onto the then current
 
00:47:38.809 --> 00:47:38.819 align:start position:0%
licenses so that being said that had
 
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
exists have exists since 9 11. so
 
00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:46.140 align:start position:0%
finally in our c
 
00:47:48.650 --> 00:47:48.660 align:start position:0%
um I would say less than 10 years ago
 
00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:53.880 align:start position:0%
finally issue the formal part 38 I'm
 
00:47:57.710 --> 00:47:57.720 align:start position:0%
sorry part 37 which is the security of
 
00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
the category one and two so that being
 
00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:04.260 align:start position:0%
that so since the uh those rules became
 
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
or regulations became fully uh adopted
 
00:48:11.089 --> 00:48:11.099 align:start position:0%
at the national level that would enable
 
00:48:16.069 --> 00:48:16.079 align:start position:0%
the agreement states to then issue those
 
00:48:16.079 --> 00:48:17.150 align:start position:0%
the agreement states to then issue those
rules

00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:48:21.050 --> 00:48:21.060 align:start position:0%
all right under our own 4038 which is
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
the equivalent part so by having the 40
 
00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:26.940 align:start position:0%
38 now becoming fully adopted and
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
effective we remove the administrative
 
00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
conditions from those previous licenses
 
00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
thereby uh creating uh uh more why would
 
00:48:42.349 --> 00:48:42.359 align:start position:0%
I say correct version of the license
 
00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:45.980 align:start position:0%
whereby it's the citation of 40 38
 
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
instead of relying on non-existing 4038
 
00:48:52.690 --> 00:48:52.700 align:start position:0%
and simply those conditions that were
 
00:48:56.809 --> 00:48:56.819 align:start position:0%
administratively added sir I agree that
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
the the federal agency issued this
 
00:49:03.829 --> 00:49:03.839 align:start position:0%
emergency rule however are you aware
 
00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
that our state constitution not the
 
00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
Federal Constitution for business from
 
00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
adopting any federal rule without
 
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
legislative approval yes I understand
 
00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
that well it sounds like you're
 
00:49:19.309 --> 00:49:19.319 align:start position:0%
in 2011 you adopted the federal rule
 
00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
without legislative approval and now
 
00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
you're trying to bring It Forward saying
 
00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:26.700 align:start position:0%
well we did it 11 years ago it's no big
 
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
deal okay and I'm very concerned that
 
00:49:30.890 --> 00:49:30.900 align:start position:0%
that is the case
 
00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:33.770 align:start position:0%
that is the case
understood

00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:33.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:42.780 align:start position:0%
so I I mean I could be misunderstanding
 
00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:44.940 align:start position:0%
the rule 40 38 has already been in place
 
00:49:48.290 --> 00:49:48.300 align:start position:0%
so if 4038 isn't a new rule it's just
 
00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:50.940 align:start position:0%
citing to it
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's just this rule is are there
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
requirements on the licensees in section
 
00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:58.910 align:start position:0%
requirements on the licensees in section
44038

00:49:58.910 --> 00:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:00.900 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm assuming I'm sure he can
 
00:50:03.010 --> 00:50:03.020 align:start position:0%
Augie can speak to specific
 
00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
requirements yes well regarding
 
00:50:07.790 --> 00:50:07.800 align:start position:0%
categories are new requirements for the
 
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
licensees when they when they uh when
 
00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:13.140 align:start position:0%
they apply for it it's a new new section
 
00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:15.540 align:start position:0%
they have to comply with
 
00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
they're all so it's not a new section
 
00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:18.180 align:start position:0%
they're complying with because they're
 
00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:21.300 align:start position:0%
already part of they're already doing it
 
00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
they're already complying with it
 
00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:23.690 align:start position:0%
they're already complying with it
through

00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:23.700 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:26.460 align:start position:0%
being this rule is just encompassing
 
00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:29.240 align:start position:0%
that citation but that rule is already
 
00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
on those folks they're already complying
 
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:39.309 --> 00:50:39.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:39.319 --> 00:50:41.829 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:50:41.829 --> 00:50:41.839 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:44.940 align:start position:0%
the 4038 which is the physical
 
00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:47.220 align:start position:0%
protection of the category one and two
 
00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:51.780 align:start position:0%
that was adopted effectively uh in May
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
on whose authority
 
00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:10.490 align:start position:0%
on whose authority
here

00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
um just a clarification is that the
 
00:51:14.809 --> 00:51:14.819 align:start position:0%
document that you're reading from is
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
that the rule is that the statute is it
 
00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:21.240 align:start position:0%
and to comment on staff on after you get
 
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
done entering the first question
 
00:51:26.809 --> 00:51:26.819 align:start position:0%
okay so um Hep
 
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
um 4038 is on uh the it's on the
 
00:51:33.349 --> 00:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
physical protection of category and
 
00:51:36.890 --> 00:51:36.900 align:start position:0%
category one and Category 2 quantities
 
00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:39.180 align:start position:0%
of radioactive material and it looks
 
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
like it was adopted as they said in May
 
00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
of 2016.
 
00:51:46.609 --> 00:51:46.619 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
00:51:46.619 --> 00:51:47.329 align:start position:0%
whether or not
um

00:51:47.329 --> 00:51:47.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:49.309 --> 00:51:49.319 align:start position:0%
you know whether or not the current
 
00:51:52.549 --> 00:51:52.559 align:start position:0%
entities are the exact same entities
 
00:51:52.559 --> 00:51:53.210 align:start position:0%
entities are the exact same entities
um

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:53.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
I that I don't know I'd have to dig into
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
this a little bit but
 
00:51:59.870 --> 00:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
um to find out whether or not
 
00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
um it sounded as if from what the
 
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
subject matter expert is saying that
 
00:52:08.569 --> 00:52:08.579 align:start position:0%
swapping it sounds really like they're
 
00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
swapping out they're swapping out the
 
00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:13.740 align:start position:0%
previous Federal requirements which were
 
00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
administratively added to the license
 
00:52:18.349 --> 00:52:18.359 align:start position:0%
for these requirements which were in
 
00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
place since 2016. whether or not they
 
00:52:22.849 --> 00:52:22.859 align:start position:0%
impact the exact same entities it kind
 
00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
of sounds like they do but again I need
 
00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:27.660 align:start position:0%
to like look at this a little bit more
 
00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:36.290 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:52:36.290 --> 00:52:36.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
I think that um this you know was a
 
00:52:42.290 --> 00:52:42.300 align:start position:0%
result of my comment and taking a look
 
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
at the um the fiscal impact like I said
 
00:52:46.549 --> 00:52:46.559 align:start position:0%
the fiscal impact request didn't address
 
00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
this thoroughly and um so it wasn't
 
00:52:52.609 --> 00:52:52.619 align:start position:0%
discussed at all in the fiscal impact
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
statement that came out of the LBA the
 
00:52:57.890 --> 00:52:57.900 align:start position:0%
agency couldn't get an amended fiscal
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
impact statement because that's you know
 
00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
there's specific requirements in the
 
00:53:03.849 --> 00:53:03.859 align:start position:0%
statute for that
 
00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:06.660 align:start position:0%
so at the time when we discussed whether
 
00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
or not it would be worthwhile getting
 
00:53:09.549 --> 00:53:09.559 align:start position:0%
revised one
 
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
where folks landed was to come and have
 
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
the conversation in front of the
 
00:53:15.530 --> 00:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
committee since they could not get an
 
00:53:17.349 --> 00:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
amended request
 
00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:20.220 align:start position:0%
it does seem to be a technical oversight
 
00:53:23.329 --> 00:53:23.339 align:start position:0%
in their fiscal impact request that was
 
00:53:25.089 --> 00:53:25.099 align:start position:0%
sent to the LBA
 
00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
the committee has in the past
 
00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:30.540 align:start position:0%
um you know approved such a thing
 
00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
they've also not so it's up to the
 
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:33.950 align:start position:0%
they've also not so it's up to the
committee

00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:53:36.349 --> 00:53:36.359 align:start position:0%
um you know how you want to
 
00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:48.300 align:start position:0%
historically this has happened before
 
00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
where there may have been a fee that was
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
in place federally for some time the and
 
00:53:56.450 --> 00:53:56.460 align:start position:0%
everybody had been paying it but the
 
00:53:58.490 --> 00:53:58.500 align:start position:0%
agency decided to
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
cite to the federal Rule and
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
but not mention it in the fiscal impact
 
00:54:07.990 --> 00:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
statement and technically
 
00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative McGuire is correct it
 
00:54:13.970 --> 00:54:13.980 align:start position:0%
didn't exist in state law in state rules
 
00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:15.710 align:start position:0%
didn't exist in state law in state rules
beforehand

00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:15.720 align:start position:0%
beforehand
 
00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:18.540 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure I didn't review this I'm
 
00:54:21.109 --> 00:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
not sure if the fee was actually in
 
00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:23.720 align:start position:0%
place in the rules and they instead of
 
00:54:25.790 --> 00:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
specifying that they are just now
 
00:54:30.650 --> 00:54:30.660 align:start position:0%
referring to the CFR it I don't think
 
00:54:32.569 --> 00:54:32.579 align:start position:0%
there's a problem if that's the case but
 
00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:34.980 align:start position:0%
certainly if they are just for the first
 
00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
time citing to defeat then technically
 
00:54:42.049 --> 00:54:42.059 align:start position:0%
the rule has a change in it uh imposes a
 
00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
fee that it did not impose before and uh
 
00:54:48.890 --> 00:54:48.900 align:start position:0%
so that's been raised uh I think Kim is
 
00:54:50.569 --> 00:54:50.579 align:start position:0%
right that in the past committees
 
00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
usually gone along with it uh with a
 
00:54:57.410 --> 00:54:57.420 align:start position:0%
notation to the agency but that's not
 
00:55:00.670 --> 00:55:00.680 align:start position:0%
been that has not been up 100 scenario
 
00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
there isn't there isn't a fee that's
 
00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:04.500 align:start position:0%
what it was going there are no fee
 
00:55:06.410 --> 00:55:06.420 align:start position:0%
requirements this is exactly just
 
00:55:09.170 --> 00:55:09.180 align:start position:0%
adopting And discussing the additional
 
00:55:11.089 --> 00:55:11.099 align:start position:0%
category one category two
 
00:55:13.370 --> 00:55:13.380 align:start position:0%
content so there isn't a fiscal impact
 
00:55:16.490 --> 00:55:16.500 align:start position:0%
because again per the agency and the
 
00:55:19.609 --> 00:55:19.619 align:start position:0%
expert did not identify a fiscal impact
 
00:55:21.290 --> 00:55:21.300 align:start position:0%
because there's no there's no fees
 
00:55:23.109 --> 00:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
affiliated with this it's it's
 
00:55:25.069 --> 00:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
encompassing and citing to a rule that's
 
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
already been existence of what has
 
00:55:28.730 --> 00:55:28.740 align:start position:0%
already been in the requirement so
 
00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:30.540 align:start position:0%
that's why when attorney Reeve brought
 
00:55:32.089 --> 00:55:32.099 align:start position:0%
it to me I did ask her for her
 
00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:33.300 align:start position:0%
recommendation to ensure that we
 
00:55:35.690 --> 00:55:35.700 align:start position:0%
complied her statement regarding amended
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact is accurate
 
00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:39.420 align:start position:0%
um and she said it probably actually
 
00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
isn't even I forget how Kim phrased it
 
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
but it's not even like a thing probably
 
00:55:45.770 --> 00:55:45.780 align:start position:0%
she was like oh it wouldn't even be
 
00:55:48.829 --> 00:55:48.839 align:start position:0%
worth it to go back so we came here to
 
00:55:51.410 --> 00:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
answer if there were questions but
 
00:55:52.730 --> 00:55:52.740 align:start position:0%
um yeah I just wanted to clarify that
 
00:55:54.430 --> 00:55:54.440 align:start position:0%
thank you though um
 
00:55:57.049 --> 00:55:57.059 align:start position:0%
yes thank you whether there's a fee or
 
00:55:59.630 --> 00:55:59.640 align:start position:0%
not does not definitively say whether
 
00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:02.460 align:start position:0%
there's a fiscal impact if this requires
 
00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:06.540 align:start position:0%
more secure or more expensive or more or
 
00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
traceable or whatever containment
 
00:56:10.970 --> 00:56:10.980 align:start position:0%
Vehicles that's a cost and it's a fiscal
 
00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:12.349 align:start position:0%
Vehicles that's a cost and it's a fiscal
impact

00:56:12.349 --> 00:56:12.359 align:start position:0%
impact
 
00:56:17.089 --> 00:56:17.099 align:start position:0%
and I'm extremely concerned that HHS in
 
00:56:17.099 --> 00:56:18.410 align:start position:0%
and I'm extremely concerned that HHS in
particular

00:56:18.410 --> 00:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:56:21.170 --> 00:56:21.180 align:start position:0%
merrily adopts Federal requirements
 
00:56:24.109 --> 00:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
without getting the proper approval and
 
00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to vote to support this
 
00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:29.270 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to vote to support this
rule

00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:32.210 --> 00:56:32.220 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I um
 
00:56:34.849 --> 00:56:34.859 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't say you know we I wouldn't
 
00:56:36.170 --> 00:56:36.180 align:start position:0%
say it that way I think you know
 
00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
Department I'm new to this role I'm
 
00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:39.839 align:start position:0%
doing how I've been taught and how I've
 
00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
been trained and with communication with
 
00:56:43.130 --> 00:56:43.140 align:start position:0%
the attorneys consistently and
 
00:56:45.890 --> 00:56:45.900 align:start position:0%
constantly regarding rules again nuclear
 
00:56:47.690 --> 00:56:47.700 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Commission and specifically
 
00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:50.460 align:start position:0%
the radioactives has had other sort of
 
00:56:52.790 --> 00:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
they have sort of other I don't know if
 
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
the words agreements or there are
 
00:56:56.569 --> 00:56:56.579 align:start position:0%
certain things that you can't we can't
 
00:57:01.010 --> 00:57:01.020 align:start position:0%
do because of the standards of NRC so we
 
00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:03.720 align:start position:0%
fall back on not fall back on because we
 
00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:05.640 align:start position:0%
have nothing else that we want to do but
 
00:57:07.010 --> 00:57:07.020 align:start position:0%
there are things we literally cannot
 
00:57:09.049 --> 00:57:09.059 align:start position:0%
change content-wise when it comes to
 
00:57:10.790 --> 00:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
this because New Hampshire is an
 
00:57:13.490 --> 00:57:13.500 align:start position:0%
agreement state with NRC so it's not a
 
00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
falling back on the CFR it starts
 
00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
certain things we're not even allowed to
 
00:57:19.309 --> 00:57:19.319 align:start position:0%
change so they're already I forget what
 
00:57:20.569 --> 00:57:20.579 align:start position:0%
it's called I've been looking at you
 
00:57:22.430 --> 00:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
guys but yes
 
00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:24.109 align:start position:0%
guys but yes
sorry

00:57:24.109 --> 00:57:24.119 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:57:26.990 --> 00:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
okay how these happen
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
is it seems to be a separate issue from
 
00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
what costs are involved
 
00:57:34.849 --> 00:57:34.859 align:start position:0%
it's not a matter of we yield to the
 
00:57:37.549 --> 00:57:37.559 align:start position:0%
feds because they give us money it's how
 
00:57:40.970 --> 00:57:40.980 align:start position:0%
much does this cost the citizens of New
 
00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:44.870 align:start position:0%
much does this cost the citizens of New
Hampshire

00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:47.809 --> 00:57:47.819 align:start position:0%
so again we we don't we don't believe
 
00:57:51.589 --> 00:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
there is a cost associated with this
 
00:57:53.690 --> 00:57:53.700 align:start position:0%
um if you know I'll take whatever
 
00:57:55.490 --> 00:57:55.500 align:start position:0%
recommendation attorney Reeve or
 
00:57:58.430 --> 00:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
attorney morals say with respect to
 
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
writing that there might be an
 
00:58:01.970 --> 00:58:01.980 align:start position:0%
indeterminable but again these licensees
 
00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:04.260 align:start position:0%
are already under these requirements
 
00:58:05.870 --> 00:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
this is just a citation to it but
 
00:58:07.490 --> 00:58:07.500 align:start position:0%
they're already they already are
 
00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
mandated these requirements we're not
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
talking about we're talking about the
 
00:58:17.210 --> 00:58:17.220 align:start position:0%
costs incurred in obeying these rules
 
00:58:20.270 --> 00:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
was there a fiscal impact statement in
 
00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
approved in 2016 when we did approved
 
00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
this derivative rule
 
00:58:29.930 --> 00:58:29.940 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there was I'm sure there was
 
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
well that's that's something that needs
 
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:58:36.530 --> 00:58:36.540 align:start position:0%
now that you're applying it to in this
 
00:58:38.329 --> 00:58:38.339 align:start position:0%
rule you'll say it's covered under the
 
00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
cost for that rule
 
00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
which was previously approved
 
00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:43.970 align:start position:0%
which was previously approved
Mike

00:58:43.970 --> 00:58:43.980 align:start position:0%
Mike
 
00:58:47.089 --> 00:58:47.099 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair if I can ask the
 
00:58:50.210 --> 00:58:50.220 align:start position:0%
agency uh you've mentioned New Hampshire
 
00:58:53.329 --> 00:58:53.339 align:start position:0%
being in agreement State uh is there any
 
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
codification in statute of New Hampshire
 
00:58:59.770 --> 00:58:59.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:04.190 --> 00:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
understand your question is how did the
 
00:59:05.930 --> 00:59:05.940 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire become an agreement state
 
00:59:08.690 --> 00:59:08.700 align:start position:0%
is it was there a statute that specified
 
00:59:11.569 --> 00:59:11.579 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire would be a member oh
 
00:59:17.930 --> 00:59:17.940 align:start position:0%
I see it was uh back in 1966 whereby
 
00:59:20.450 --> 00:59:20.460 align:start position:0%
then the governor and the New Hampshire
 
00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:22.329 align:start position:0%
then the governor and the New Hampshire
Administration

00:59:22.329 --> 00:59:22.339 align:start position:0%
Administration
 
00:59:26.569 --> 00:59:26.579 align:start position:0%
came to agreement with NRC that NRC
 
00:59:30.349 --> 00:59:30.359 align:start position:0%
regulations would then be uh how should
 
00:59:33.049 --> 00:59:33.059 align:start position:0%
I say transferred over to New Hampshire
 
00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:36.420 align:start position:0%
to manage so would or without New
 
00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire NRC will still be controlling
 
00:59:42.109 --> 00:59:42.119 align:start position:0%
the user react materials and also the
 
00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:44.700 align:start position:0%
licensing and also the fees associated
 
00:59:47.569 --> 00:59:47.579 align:start position:0%
with it it's simply transferred over the
 
00:59:50.569 --> 00:59:50.579 align:start position:0%
the applications necessary to manage the
 
00:59:52.970 --> 00:59:52.980 align:start position:0%
radioactive materials instead of under
 
00:59:56.589 --> 00:59:56.599 align:start position:0%
NRC currently it's under New Hampshire
 
01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
because of this 1966 agreement State com
 
01:00:03.829 --> 01:00:03.839 align:start position:0%
uh agreement between NRC and New
 
01:00:03.839 --> 01:00:04.670 align:start position:0%
uh agreement between NRC and New
Hampshire

01:00:04.670 --> 01:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:00:07.069 --> 01:00:07.079 align:start position:0%
thank you that that seems to be a
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
situation like with Environmental
 
01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:12.540 align:start position:0%
Services where they have
 
01:00:14.450 --> 01:00:14.460 align:start position:0%
um where the of the Agents of the
 
01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
federal government and next essentially
 
01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:19.260 align:start position:0%
for Clean Air Act Clean Water Act
 
01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:21.230 align:start position:0%
for Clean Air Act Clean Water Act
Etc

01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
and that is in RSA 125 F14 it's that
 
01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:28.380 align:start position:0%
does state that um
 
01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
that this is an agreement state
 
01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:35.640 align:start position:0%
with Des for example they could just let
 
01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
the EPA enforce the federal requirements
 
01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
but the state
 
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
chose to have Des do that because they
 
01:00:44.450 --> 01:00:44.460 align:start position:0%
thought it would be easier for the
 
01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:47.220 align:start position:0%
citizens of the state to work with a
 
01:00:48.829 --> 01:00:48.839 align:start position:0%
state agency and instead of trying to
 
01:00:51.589 --> 01:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
work with the EPA
 
01:00:54.170 --> 01:00:54.180 align:start position:0%
okay does somebody have a motion to
 
01:01:00.109 --> 01:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
your staff recommendation
 
01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
the committee could all could of course
 
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
postpone this if they wanted to have
 
01:01:10.370 --> 01:01:10.380 align:start position:0%
further discussion regarding it
 
01:01:13.490 --> 01:01:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:16.250 --> 01:01:16.260 align:start position:0%
a bit of a motion and a second what do
 
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
is your emotions to postpones this may
 
01:01:22.370 --> 01:01:22.380 align:start position:0%
require a waiver I'll ask him
 
01:01:26.329 --> 01:01:26.339 align:start position:0%
the deadline is November December 19th
 
01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
the Nova waiver would be necessary
 
01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:30.829 align:start position:0%
the Nova waiver would be necessary
okay

01:01:30.829 --> 01:01:30.839 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:01:32.930 --> 01:01:32.940 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:36.780 align:start position:0%
all those in favor of postponing bye
 
01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:42.890 --> 01:01:42.900 align:start position:0%
okay thank you can I ask a quick
 
01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:44.569 align:start position:0%
okay thank you can I ask a quick
question

01:01:44.569 --> 01:01:44.579 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:57.349 --> 01:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
the last item is an emergency rule
 
01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:09.720 align:start position:0%
from Office of alcohol and drug abuse
 
01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:11.270 align:start position:0%
from Office of alcohol and drug abuse
prevention

01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
prevention
 
01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:12.109 align:start position:0%
prevention
um

01:02:12.109 --> 01:02:12.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:14.809 --> 01:02:14.819 align:start position:0%
as you're probably aware in certain
 
01:02:17.030 --> 01:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
instances uh persons that have been
 
01:02:20.809 --> 01:02:20.819 align:start position:0%
convicted of uh drunk driving have been
 
01:02:23.530 --> 01:02:23.540 align:start position:0%
required by the courts to
 
01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
undergo counseling they have to pay for
 
01:02:29.569 --> 01:02:29.579 align:start position:0%
that at their own expense although there
 
01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:34.460 align:start position:0%
is Provisions for Indigent persons
 
01:02:37.930 --> 01:02:37.940 align:start position:0%
the state through HHS
 
01:02:41.030 --> 01:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
and well through this office of alcohol
 
01:02:43.490 --> 01:02:43.500 align:start position:0%
and drug the former office of alcohol
 
01:02:46.510 --> 01:02:46.520 align:start position:0%
and drug abuse prevention
 
01:02:49.970 --> 01:02:49.980 align:start position:0%
licenses providers who actually provide
 
01:02:55.069 --> 01:02:55.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:55.079 --> 01:02:57.170 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:02:57.170 --> 01:02:57.180 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:59.750 --> 01:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
there is various fees that are required
 
01:03:02.109 --> 01:03:02.119 align:start position:0%
by Statute and in the rules
 
01:03:05.450 --> 01:03:05.460 align:start position:0%
the department has recently sent out a
 
01:03:08.270 --> 01:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
memo to the providers indicating that
 
01:03:11.030 --> 01:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
the providers could not charge for
 
01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
transaction fees in other words if a
 
01:03:16.190 --> 01:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
client paid for his fees with a credit
 
01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:18.200 align:start position:0%
card then
 
01:03:20.809 --> 01:03:20.819 align:start position:0%
the agency was passing on the
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
transaction fees from the bank to the
 
01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:26.210 align:start position:0%
transaction fees from the bank to the
client

01:03:26.210 --> 01:03:26.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:29.569 --> 01:03:29.579 align:start position:0%
the department said that that wasn't
 
01:03:32.450 --> 01:03:32.460 align:start position:0%
currently authorized uh the providers
 
01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
said well it's been current practice and
 
01:03:39.049 --> 01:03:39.059 align:start position:0%
there was a cost uh that would be uh it
 
01:03:41.329 --> 01:03:41.339 align:start position:0%
would strain their budgets uh so the
 
01:03:43.609 --> 01:03:43.619 align:start position:0%
department agreed and put in the
 
01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
emergency rule that authorized uh the
 
01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
clients to be charged the transaction
 
01:03:52.250 --> 01:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
fee there was also provision in there
 
01:03:56.210 --> 01:03:56.220 align:start position:0%
that requires the providers to notify
 
01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
the clients ahead of time of this fee
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
and let them know what it is before any
 
01:04:04.690 --> 01:04:04.700 align:start position:0%
charge is made
 
01:04:07.970 --> 01:04:07.980 align:start position:0%
there seems to be Authority regarding
 
01:04:10.069 --> 01:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
this the the
 
01:04:13.130 --> 01:04:13.140 align:start position:0%
rulemaking provision for Authority is
 
01:04:15.589 --> 01:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
fairly broad so it seems to be within
