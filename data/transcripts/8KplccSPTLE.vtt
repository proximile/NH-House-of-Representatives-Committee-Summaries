various versions of the budget as it
 
00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
goes through um one of the most
 
00:13:59.189 --> 00:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
important documents that that we do
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
develop is called the Surplus statement
 
00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:04.440 align:start position:0%

provides the estimated Revenue as well
 
00:14:09.749 --> 00:14:09.759 align:start position:0%
as the Appropriations as um approved by
 
00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
the various bodies to show the public
 
00:14:14.749 --> 00:14:14.759 align:start position:0%

to Define especially in this remote
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%

00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
watching or uh attending uh they can go
 
00:15:27.069 --> 00:15:27.079 align:start position:0%
to our website to go to um to find those
 
00:15:29.189 --> 00:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
documents I'm going to clip
 
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
uh the document that I will go over
 
00:15:34.949 --> 00:15:34.959 align:start position:0%
really quickly um to show kind of what
 
00:15:37.389 --> 00:15:37.399 align:start position:0%
we call a snapshot now we call this a
 
00:15:40.749 --> 00:15:40.759 align:start position:0%
snapshot a surplus statement snapshot um
 
00:15:44.949 --> 00:15:44.959 align:start position:0%
this is to compare actual results versus
 
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
what the budget writers um had developed
 
00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
back in 2019 when the budget was passed
 
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
as you remember the budget was veto to
 
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
the 2021 budget was actually signed into
 
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
law uh right at the end of September
 
00:16:00.629 --> 00:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
setember so it was a three-month delay
 
00:16:02.949 --> 00:16:02.959 align:start position:0%
in starting that budget uh due to the
 
00:16:05.629 --> 00:16:05.639 align:start position:0%
veto but then an agreement was reached
 
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh the budget was put into place for 20
 
00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
and 21 um and then several months later
 
00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
the pandemic hit and so the uh budget
 
00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
rate is really we're dealing with the
 
00:16:17.749 --> 00:16:17.759 align:start position:0%
delay with the veto and then all of a
 
00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:20.519 align:start position:0%
sudden in March we saw the New Hampshire
 
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
economy uh turn on its head and
 
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
basically everything changed um if we
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
look at what happened during the budget
 
00:16:32.189 --> 00:16:32.199 align:start position:0%
process the budget had assumed uh a
 
00:16:33.949 --> 00:16:33.959 align:start position:0%
beginning balance a beginning balance is
 
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
any carry forward balance uh from the
 
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
previous fiscal year budget had assumed
 
00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.230 align:start position:0%
previous fiscal year budget had assumed
about

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:39.240 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
$21.5 million from the previous year and
 
00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
that's because of your your 19 fiscal
 
00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:47.720 align:start position:0%
year 19 revenues were um over budget by
 
00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
close to a couple hundred million
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
dollars uh so they performed really well
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
you remember the last two fiscal years
 
00:16:55.269 --> 00:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
prior to this year uh taxes were
 
00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
performing extremely well especially uh
 
00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
business taxes um in meals and rooms uh
 
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
total revenue coming in uh 262
 
00:17:06.429 --> 00:17:06.439 align:start position:0%
6.1 offset by total Appropriations in
 
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
the budget uh which were about 2.86 s
 
00:17:12.429 --> 00:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
estimated lapse is really an assumption
 
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
that although since the budget is a
 
00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
two-year planning document uh passed in
 
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
2019 ahead of time there are programs uh
 
00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:25.079 align:start position:0%
that don't begin right away there are
 
00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:27.640 align:start position:0%
positions that um do not begin right
 
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
away and as a result you do have laps
 
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
laps being unspent Appropriations and so
 
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
every budget process as we develop a
 
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
surplus statement for the current Bal
 
00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
budget there is an assumed lapse amount
 
00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
um typically in the 3% range um and
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
that's just from you know it's the
 
00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:47.320 align:start position:0%
nature of the process trying to predict
 
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
two years ahead of time uh total net
 
00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
appropriations of about 2.8 uh million
 
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
knowing that the there was a beginning
 
00:17:56.669 --> 00:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
balance that was anticipated of 200
 
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
million uh so cumulative ending balance
 
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:03.640 align:start position:0%
of about $ 27.1 million as part of a
 
00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
budget process any even number fiscal
 
00:18:08.549 --> 00:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
year any balance remaining at the end or
 
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
any deficit remaining at the end carries
 
00:18:12.669 --> 00:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
forward into the next year the second
 
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
year of the bayum and so as far as uh 20
 
00:18:18.669 --> 00:18:18.679 align:start position:0%
the budget was based on the fact that 20
 
00:18:22.149 --> 00:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
would end with a positive $7.1 million
 
00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh Surplus and that carried forward into
 
00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
21 which we'll see in a couple moments
 
00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
and that balanced the budget obviously
 
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
any variance from that good or bad does
 
00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
change the budget picture you can see
 
00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
the caffer the comprehensive annual
 
00:18:38.029 --> 00:18:38.039 align:start position:0%
financial report which was released at
 
00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:42.200 align:start position:0%
the end of uh December showed um the
 
00:18:44.669 --> 00:18:44.679 align:start position:0%
actual results so the the budget writers
 
00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
had a plan in September of 19 the uh
 
00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20 ended on June 30th 2020
 
00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
and the actual results audited uh at the
 
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
end of December showed a small variance
 
00:18:58.590 --> 00:18:58.600 align:start position:0%
in the beginning balance of about 2. 6
 
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
million really has to do with timing of
 
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
some lapsing of funds based on uh the
 
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
previous budget uh total revenue this is
 
00:19:09.669 --> 00:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
where ways means will focus the variance
 
00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
was $15.9 Million uh below so a a
 
00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
deficit in the revenue portion of the
 
00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
budget of about $15.9 million um which
 
00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
is actually better than originally
 
00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:23.960 align:start position:0%
anticipated I think there was a number
 
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
floating around even even higher and so
 
00:19:29.549 --> 00:19:29.559 align:start position:0%
the year ended uh 105 9 million below
 
00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
revenue for 20 uh as far as uh
 
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
Appropriations a small variance in
 
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:37.480 align:start position:0%
appropriations of about 12.9 million in
 
00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
additional Appropriations things like um
 
00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:44.200 align:start position:0%
settlements um payouts for retire
 
00:19:46.669 --> 00:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
positions as um abandoned property
 
00:19:49.029 --> 00:19:49.039 align:start position:0%
claims Etc there is's always a slight
 
00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
variation um and then estimated laps you
 
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
remember I talked about the laps the
 
00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
unspent funds um the unspent funds even
 
00:19:59.230 --> 00:19:59.240 align:start position:0%
though revenues are short by about $15.9
 
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
million the estimated lapse was 102.7 so
 
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
that was a variance of $46 million which
 
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:07.240 align:start position:0%
is to the good that is a a positive
 
00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
variance on the appropriation side and a
 
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
lot of that had to do with the fact that
 
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
um we had positions uh usually take
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
about three months to fill you did have
 
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
the three-month delay in um the passage
 
00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:22.559 align:start position:0%
of the budget you did have a three-month
 
00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
delay in starting programs up so there
 
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
was additional expenditure Laps on top
 
00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
of that uh Health and Human Service say
 
00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:31.640 align:start position:0%
did receive additional federal funds um
 
00:20:33.549 --> 00:20:33.559 align:start position:0%
for the federal matching assistance
 
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
percentage or the so-called fmap of 6.2%
 
00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:40.360 align:start position:0%
from Medicaid which did help uh HHS beat
 
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
their laps targets at the beginning of
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
the year and then the so-called Gap and
 
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
other adjustments in accounting term
 
00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:48.559 align:start position:0%
these are liabilities um that adjust
 
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
based on instead of cash these are
 
00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
actually uh payments or liabilities that
 
00:20:54.909 --> 00:20:54.919 align:start position:0%
are attributable to 20 so they may have
 
00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:57.640 align:start position:0%
occurred in 21 but they are they do have
 
00:20:59.149 --> 00:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
to be cting against 20 because it's
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
based on that activity um so actually
 
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
cumulative vending balance on June 30th
 
00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:07.240 align:start position:0%
was a Nega 54.4
 
00:21:10.149 --> 00:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
million so what what we had to take into
 
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
account when we do our variance for the
 
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
LBA snapshot is yes it was a negative of
 
00:21:19.149 --> 00:21:19.159 align:start position:0%
54.4 but we do remember that the budget
 
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
had uh counted on 27.1 million carrying
 
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
for it for 21 to have a balanced budget
 
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
because that $ 27.1 million did not
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
exist because there was a deficit of
 
00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
54.4 million there's actually a negative
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
variance of 81.5 million so if you were
 
00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
to look at the cafre if you hear um any
 
00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:41.480 align:start position:0%
um presentations or read any articles
 
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
you'll hear about us the state ending 20
 
00:21:47.149 --> 00:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
with a roughly an$ 81.5 million
 
00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:49.400 align:start position:0%
deficit and so that's a budget deficit
 
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
of 81.5 moving quickly into 21 with what
 
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
we know now you can see in the yellow up
 
00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:00.200 align:start position:0%
top 81.5 million uh deficit to begin um
 
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
estimated revenues to date this is a
 
00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
number again this is a snapshot this
 
00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
number is going to change uh rows four
 
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
through seven are really uh those are
 
00:22:13.149 --> 00:22:13.159 align:start position:0%
what ways of means will focus on um 21
 
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
is the first uh year of a balanced
 
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
budget plan so the 22 and 23 budget also
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
has to take into account how does the
 
00:22:25.549 --> 00:22:25.559 align:start position:0%
current fiscal year um how does that
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
present itself and if there is any
 
00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
deficit at the end of 21 part of the
 
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
balanced budget Law requires that any
 
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
deficit be made up of by the budget
 
00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
writers when they develop their 2223
 
00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:40.559 align:start position:0%
budget um and so that's it's an
 
00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:42.440 align:start position:0%
important piece of information we know
 
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
year to date through December uh the
 
00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:47.240 align:start position:0%
state is $ 54.3 million up in general
 
00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
and education trust fund Revenue um
 
00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:52.520 align:start position:0%
again this is halfway through the year
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
you'll find out in on ways and means
 
00:22:57.909 --> 00:22:57.919 align:start position:0%
that um we can't just extrapolate this
 
00:23:00.149 --> 00:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
forward March and April are huge Revenue
 
00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
months um for uh business taxes as as
 
00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
well as other various taxes and so there
 
00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
are times where you do end with a
 
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
positive variance in Revenue um halfway
 
00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
through the fiscal year and you end up
 
00:23:16.909 --> 00:23:16.919 align:start position:0%
in a totally opposite position so that's
 
00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
something I think your house ways Means
 
00:23:19.789 --> 00:23:19.799 align:start position:0%
Committee and Senate ways Means
 
00:23:21.269 --> 00:23:21.279 align:start position:0%
Committee will be paying attention to
 
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
obviously this year um and I think you
 
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
have great presenters coming up
 
00:23:28.029 --> 00:23:28.039 align:start position:0%
commissioner step after me shortly uh
 
00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:30.200 align:start position:0%
which will be able to provide you with
 
00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
uh better information as you develop
 
00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:35.240 align:start position:0%
your 21 estimates so right now as we
 
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
stand a positive variance of 54.3 so for
 
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
the purpose of a snapshot a point in
 
00:23:43.149 --> 00:23:43.159 align:start position:0%
time look um that is a positive offset
 
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
to the negative variance of the 815 and
 
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
then we have our budget Appropriations
 
00:23:49.789 --> 00:23:49.799 align:start position:0%
our estimated laps right now a little
 
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
earlier in the year to figure out if the
 
00:23:54.269 --> 00:23:54.279 align:start position:0%
state will laps above or Beyond um the
 
00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
75.4 the budget writers had assumed we
 
00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
typically in the second year of a bium
 
00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
the laps or the unspent Appropriations
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
are a little higher uh than the previous
 
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
year a lot of that has to do with um
 
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
so-called carry forwards or or unlapsed
 
00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:11.320 align:start position:0%
Appropriations from the first year that
 
00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:14.120 align:start position:0%
carry into the next year um a lot of the
 
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
HHS accounts as well as some debt
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
service accounts do not lapse at the end
 
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
of 20 so if there are any lapsing or
 
00:24:23.149 --> 00:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
unspent funds you would uh recognize
 
00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
that in 21 and then other Appropriations
 
00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
a negative 15.9 12 and a half that has
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
to do with the fact that budget writers
 
00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
assumed HHS would have a12.5 million uh
 
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
budget reduction each year to meet their
 
00:24:40.549 --> 00:24:40.559 align:start position:0%
$25 million back of the budget um
 
00:24:42.549 --> 00:24:42.559 align:start position:0%
requirement uh that the budget writers
 
00:24:45.389 --> 00:24:45.399 align:start position:0%
had put in however HHS was able to meet
 
00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
all of that requirement in 20 so they
 
00:24:50.389 --> 00:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
satisfied the back of the budget
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
requirement of the 25 million so no bi
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
anyal impact uh but because you did that
 
00:24:58.549 --> 00:24:58.559 align:start position:0%
was a positive uh variance in 20 you do
 
00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:00.200 align:start position:0%
have to account for the fact that there
 
00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
will be no further budget reduction in
 
00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
21 um current year balance of about 12
 
00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:08.200 align:start position:0%
A5 uh offset from the negative balance
 
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
carried forward the
 
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
54.4 for cumulative ending balance for
 
00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:13.720 align:start position:0%
the year
 
00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
41.9 um if you can see um if you go
 
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
through the variance column the 81 A5
 
00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
offset by the 54.3 in total revenue
 
00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:25.480 align:start position:0%
offset by net appropriations of 15.9
 
00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
ends with a $ 43.1 million uh budget
 
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
variance uh however when the budget
 
00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
writers developed their budget they did
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
have a small cushion of about $1.2
 
00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
million in uh additional funds that 1.1
 
00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
of which would go to the rainy day fund
 
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
another 0.1 or about $60,000 and it
 
00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
upstand the education trust
 
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
fund rainy day fund balance uh based on
 
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
the kaffer estimates is
 
00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
115.5 so as we stand here today there
 
00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
are sufficient funds in the r day fund
 
00:25:58.269 --> 00:25:58.279 align:start position:0%
should the legislature
 
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
decide um to draw from the rainy day
 
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
fund to balance their budget and the
 
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
reason I say should although any deficit
 
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
can be made up from the rainy day fund
 
00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:09.240 align:start position:0%
since the uh budget is in possession of
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
the legislature they can also uh make a
 
00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:13.720 align:start position:0%
decision not to tap the rainy day fund
 
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:16.559 align:start position:0%
or tap it for a portion of the deficit
 
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
and then handle any remaining deficit in
 
00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:21.640 align:start position:0%
22 and 23 and so that's something will
 
00:26:24.389 --> 00:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
be working with the Committees uh over
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
uh the next couple of U few months
 
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
actually next few months and if that
 
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
were the case today even with the $4
 
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
41.9 million deficit the state could
 
00:26:36.669 --> 00:26:36.679 align:start position:0%
technically end 21 with um still money
 
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
left over in the rainy day fund key is
 
00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
though what's going to happen with
 
00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
revenues we know based on your 20 um FY
 
00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
20 uh 21 and in November of 20 Dr came
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
through with Revenue estimates that
 
00:26:52.269 --> 00:26:52.279 align:start position:0%
could be uh 16 million high for what
 
00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
they collect or $56 million below uh
 
00:26:58.590 --> 00:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
plan um other non-d Revenue estimates
 
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
could be another 20 million below plan
 
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
so that's going to vary um if the state
 
00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
were to just hit plan uh this 54.3
 
00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
million would go away uh you would still
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
have enough in um the ren day fund
 
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
unless there are additional expenditures
 
00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
typically there are another $8 million
 
00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
in expenditures that come through the
 
00:27:21.389 --> 00:27:21.399 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee um or through statutory
 
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
um allowances that do hit the uh the
 
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
balance sheet um and so that's Bas I'll
 
00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
wrap that up and open to any questions
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:48.669 --> 00:27:48.679 align:start position:0%
have presentative major make sure that
 
00:27:48.679 --> 00:27:56.509 align:start position:0%
have presentative major make sure that
you

00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:56.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:56.519 --> 00:27:58.990 align:start position:0%
 
unmute

00:27:58.990 --> 00:27:59.000 align:start position:0%
unmute
 
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
I don't see any hands raised uh for
 
00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:06.440 align:start position:0%
questions and it
 
00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
is 9:29 so maybe we go into the
 
00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:21.960 align:start position:0%

00:29:58.950 --> 00:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
perfect okay so good morning again thank
 
00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:02.559 align:start position:0%
you for having me today
 
00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:05.720 align:start position:0%
um what I plan to do this morning is to
 
00:30:07.389 --> 00:30:07.399 align:start position:0%
give you an overview of the a little
 
00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
brief overview of the Dr talk through
 
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
some of the taxes um that we we we
 
00:30:14.909 --> 00:30:14.919 align:start position:0%
administer so the Dr administers 14
 
00:30:17.789 --> 00:30:17.799 align:start position:0%
taxes for the state which represents
 
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
approximately 78% or just shy of two
 
00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
billion of the audited Revenue collected
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
education trust funds
 
00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:29.480 align:start position:0%
in20 the Dr has important insights into
 
00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
the performance of the significant
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
Revenue sources but we La capacity to
 
00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
perform more complex EIC predictions so
 
00:30:39.509 --> 00:30:39.519 align:start position:0%
my goal this morning is to give you an
 
00:30:41.549 --> 00:30:41.559 align:start position:0%
overview of the taxes what we've seen in
 
00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
the past what we've seen year to date
 
00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:46.360 align:start position:0%
how we believe covid has impacted some
 
00:30:48.269 --> 00:30:48.279 align:start position:0%
of our taxes so that you have a
 
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
foundation for the information that
 
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
you'll be hearing over the course of
 
00:30:53.789 --> 00:30:53.799 align:start position:0%
today and tomorrow with respect to
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
specific economic
 
00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
predictions the presentation is going to
 
00:31:01.269 --> 00:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
follow um a pretty consistent outline as
 
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
we move through the taxes we'll talk
 
00:31:05.389 --> 00:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
about year-to-date revenues we'll talk
 
00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
about factors that impact or affect the
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
taxes and we'll show you um a 10-year
 
00:31:12.509 --> 00:31:12.519 align:start position:0%
Trend versus where that Trend or how
 
00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:17.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
plan so we will jump right in to the
 
00:31:22.029 --> 00:31:22.039 align:start position:0%
meals and rentals
 
00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
tax so the M&amp;R tax is levied on
 
00:31:26.669 --> 00:31:26.679 align:start position:0%
consumers for the purchase of taxable
 
00:31:28.909 --> 00:31:28.919 align:start position:0%
meals accommodation rentals as well as
 
00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle rentals the tax is
 
00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
collected by the operator or the
 
00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
restaurant owner for instance and
 
00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
remitted to the Dr on a monthly
 
00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
basis there is a school building Aid
 
00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
Debt Service that's a monthly transfer
 
00:31:44.629 --> 00:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
that comes out of M&amp;R uh before it's
 
00:31:46.669 --> 00:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
reported at the end of the month the
 
00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:49.960 align:start position:0%
transfer was just under uh 15 million
 
00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:52.360 align:start position:0%
per year in fiscal year 12 but that
 
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
amount has been gradually decreasing to
 
00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
11 a. half million in fiscal year 20 and
 
00:31:58.590 --> 00:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
we're current currently at 8.3 million
 
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 21 and as I mentioned
 
00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
that amount is divided evenly among the
 
00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
12 months and we deduct that each month
 
00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:07.880 align:start position:0%
before reporting the final Revenue at
 
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
the end of the
 
00:32:12.789 --> 00:32:12.799 align:start position:0%
month so audited M&amp;R tax revenue
 
00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:15.320 align:start position:0%
continued to ecrease over the past few
 
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
years until the covid-19 pandemic hit we
 
00:32:22.269 --> 00:32:22.279 align:start position:0%
saw a 5.4% increase in fiscal year 2018
 
00:32:22.279 --> 00:32:23.149 align:start position:0%
saw a 5.4% increase in fiscal year 2018
over

00:32:23.149 --> 00:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:27.720 align:start position:0%
2017 a 5.5% increase in 2019 over
 
00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
2018 however we saw a 99.9% decrease in
 
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2020 over fiscal year
 
00:32:38.029 --> 00:32:38.039 align:start position:0%
2019 for fiscal year 21 actual revenue
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
for the first six months is about
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
21.3% below plan and 16.6 below prior
 
00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:50.600 align:start position:0%
year factors that can affect M&amp;R
 
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
obviously covid um we'll talk a little
 
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
bit more about that on the next slide um
 
00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
the weather can have an impact Sunny
 
00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
Summers colorful Fall Foliage and snowy
 
00:33:03.389 --> 00:33:03.399 align:start position:0%
Winters are all good things for M&amp;R um
 
00:33:05.789 --> 00:33:05.799 align:start position:0%
also the economy so when the economy is
 
00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:10.120 align:start position:0%
thriving M&amp;R tax is usually up so people
 
00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:12.200 align:start position:0%
have more disposable income when we see
 
00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
higher levels of employment we usually
 
00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
see um increased M&amp;R
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
tax specifically mentioning unemployment
 
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
um in the US unemployment was 6.7% in
 
00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
November of 2020 with New Hampshire at
 
00:33:29.789 --> 00:33:29.799 align:start position:0%
3.8% versus um a year prior the US was
 
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
at 3.5% and New Hampshire was at 2.6 so
 
00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:35.960 align:start position:0%
obviously the increase in unemployment
 
00:33:38.269 --> 00:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
um due to primarily the covid-19
 
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
pandemic has also seen as we've seen an
 
00:33:45.389 --> 00:33:45.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
tax for specific Co effects on M&amp;R
 
00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
obviously General impact the
 
00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
stay-at-home order that we saw in the
 
00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
spring restrictions on restaurants and
 
00:33:58.110 --> 00:33:58.120 align:start position:0%
restrictions on hotels HS during that
 
00:34:00.629 --> 00:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
time um as I mentioned the economy when
 
00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
unemployment is high uh we can see a
 
00:34:06.149 --> 00:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
decrease in meals and rentals tax and if
 
00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:08.440 align:start position:0%
if restaurants were forced to close um
 
00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
in recent months that would obviously
 
00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:11.839 align:start position:0%
impact the
 
00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
revenue um some changes in Behavior we
 
00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:15.800 align:start position:0%
obviously saw the shift to outdoor
 
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
dining um in the spring and summer
 
00:34:20.149 --> 00:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
months and into the fall that was
 
00:34:23.109 --> 00:34:23.119 align:start position:0%
helpful for M&amp;R that allowed folks even
 
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
um given the restrictions to still be
 
00:34:28.349 --> 00:34:28.359 align:start position:0%
able to dine out and um remit the meals
 
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
and rentals tax also expanded takeout
 
00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
right you've seen a lot of restaurants
 
00:34:34.589 --> 00:34:34.599 align:start position:0%
that historically might not have done a
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
large takeout business kind of pivot
 
00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
they've done a great job and expanded
 
00:34:39.869 --> 00:34:39.879 align:start position:0%
the takeout options that they have
 
00:34:41.669 --> 00:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
available which again would be subject
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
to the meals and Rental tax we have seen
 
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
shifts from sitdown restaurants to fast
 
00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:49.240 align:start position:0%
food so when we look
 
00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:52.919 align:start position:0%
at the data on an individual basis um at
 
00:34:55.349 --> 00:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
the end of each month we see that the
 
00:34:58.349 --> 00:34:58.359 align:start position:0%
impact to sit down restaurants When
 
00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
comparing to the prior year is more
 
00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
significant than the impact of fast food
 
00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
um by and large fast food restaurants
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
are operating in close to a similar um
 
00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:10.200 align:start position:0%
volume as they were a year ago but
 
00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
obviously sit down restaurants have seen
 
00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
a decrease on the rental side we've seen
 
00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:18.280 align:start position:0%
a shift from hotels um to camps and
 
00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:21.320 align:start position:0%
Cottages through rental agents so again
 
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
comparing year-over-year last year hot
 
00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
when you compare hotel stays from this
 
00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
year to last year you'll see a decrease
 
00:35:31.109 --> 00:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
but when you look at um rental agents
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
who might rent out a camp or a cottage
 
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
on a lake or in the mountains um or the
 
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:38.440 align:start position:0%
use of Airbnb or similar platforms for
 
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
instance you'll see um in some cases an
 
00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
increase but at the very least similar
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
volume to the prior year so the effects
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
of covid on the meals and rentals tax
 
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
can differ um when you look at that
 
00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:54.079 align:start position:0%
specific um functions that the various
 
00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
operators provide or how they're
 
00:35:58.349 --> 00:35:58.359 align:start position:0%
delivering their their their
 
00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:01.400 align:start position:0%
services in terms of our future outlook
 
00:36:04.109 --> 00:36:04.119 align:start position:0%
obviously the lifted restrictions or not
 
00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
imposing any additional uh restrictions
 
00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
uh allow us to have a little bit more of
 
00:36:11.109 --> 00:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
a positive outlook in the future
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
obviously the deployment of vaccine um
 
00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:15.560 align:start position:0%
and getting people more comfortable to
 
00:36:18.309 --> 00:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
be able to go out in public and dine or
 
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
to travel and stay in hotels and just
 
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
the general Improvement in the economy
 
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
um as well as any federal stimulus
 
00:36:27.069 --> 00:36:27.079 align:start position:0%
that's provided that would help
 
00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:29.720 align:start position:0%
businesses stay afloat or help people um
 
00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
have more disposable income so that they
 
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:33.640 align:start position:0%
can spend it on things that may be
 
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:42.069 --> 00:36:42.079 align:start position:0%
tax this shows a breakdown of the meals
 
00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:45.640 align:start position:0%
and rentals tax so the blue section are
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
meals The yellow section is rooms the
 
00:36:50.829 --> 00:36:50.839 align:start position:0%
light gray at the very top is motor
 
00:36:53.109 --> 00:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
vehicles and at the bottom is the
 
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
commission um that operators are able to
 
00:36:59.910 --> 00:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
retain if they um remit and file their
 
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
taxes on a timely manner um so what that
 
00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:06.280 align:start position:0%
looks like at the end of fiscal year 20
 
00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:09.800 align:start position:0%
about 80.4% of our Revenue was from
 
00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
meals 177% from rooms and 2.6% from
 
00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles so again meals tends to
 
00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:20.440 align:start position:0%
be the primary category rooms next and
 
00:37:22.829 --> 00:37:22.839 align:start position:0%
then a smaller amount for motor vehicles
 
00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
and we've kind of shown a history here
 
00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
so you can see what that's look like
 
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.349 align:start position:0%
so you can see what that's look like
over

00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:34.309 --> 00:37:34.319 align:start position:0%
time and lastly for M&amp;R this is the
 
00:37:37.109 --> 00:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
10year trend um you'll see a gradual
 
00:37:38.829 --> 00:37:38.839 align:start position:0%
increase in M&amp;R it's been a strong
 
00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
performing tax as we've been in many
 
00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:43.960 align:start position:0%
years of economic expansion um in good
 
00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:46.280 align:start position:0%
Economic Times you will see that dip
 
00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
from fiscal year 19 to fiscal year 20
 
00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
that is primarily due to covid um our
 
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 Revenue plan is
 
00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
386.3 and you can can see that at least
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
with the trend of fiscal year 20 we are
 
00:38:03.069 --> 00:38:03.079 align:start position:0%
unlikely to um meet that plan for this
 
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
year this really is one of the primary
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
taxes that has had a negative effect um
 
00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:11.720 align:start position:0%
due to the covid-19
 
00:38:13.829 --> 00:38:13.839 align:start position:0%
pandemic um Mr chair if it's okay with
 
00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:15.640 align:start position:0%
you I'll just pause for a moment to
 
00:38:18.069 --> 00:38:18.079 align:start position:0%
answer any questions um before moving on
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:28.670 align:start position:0%
 
tax

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:29.839 align:start position:0%
representative major it looks like
 
00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:31.640 align:start position:0%
representatives of brammy and Tucker
 
00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:35.870 align:start position:0%
representatives of brammy and Tucker
have

00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
questions representative bronley yep hi
 
00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
lay the presentation so far so when we
 
00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
look at the chart right on the screen
 
00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
right now that's exclusive of the school
 
00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:49.480 align:start position:0%
building Aid Debt
 
00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:51.880 align:start position:0%
Service that is correct that will be the
 
00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:53.960 align:start position:0%
final audited Revenue so that is with
 
00:38:56.349 --> 00:38:56.359 align:start position:0%
the school building Aid removed so when
 
00:38:59.109 --> 00:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
we look at this 10-year pattern uh
 
00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:00.440 align:start position:0%
you're saying that the school building
 
00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:03.800 align:start position:0%
Aid Debt Service payment is going
 
00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:05.309 align:start position:0%
Aid Debt Service payment is going
down

00:39:05.309 --> 00:39:05.319 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
um that does have an effect on this a
 
00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
bit right correct right so with the
 
00:39:12.109 --> 00:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
decreased payment you would obviously
 
00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:13.960 align:start position:0%
the the slope of the curve would would
 
00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
change slightly as the payment has
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
evolved over time um General the general
 
00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
trend is consistent okay thank you sure
 
00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:27.160 align:start position:0%
representative Tucker yes uh
 
00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
I I remember this is meals in rooms is
 
00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:33.160 align:start position:0%
this a am I wrong or have you changed it
 
00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
to rentals to include motor
 
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
vehicles um the reference uh changes
 
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
between within the statute so meals and
 
00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:44.079 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals and rentals are both the
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
same things we use the term kind of
 
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
interchangeably I see in here in the
 
00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
North Country the split between meals
 
00:39:57.349 --> 00:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
and rooms is quite um prominent so
 
00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
knowing that that there is you know
 
00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:03.400 align:start position:0%
these two categories is very important
 
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
here correct that's a great Point um and
 
00:40:08.589 --> 00:40:08.599 align:start position:0%
when we meet with the committee in
 
00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
Greater detail to start talking about
 
00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates we have information at
 
00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
the county level um and so we can
 
00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:17.720 align:start position:0%
provide that information to you so you
 
00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
can see how the split between meals and
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
rentals is different between the
 
00:40:23.829 --> 00:40:23.839 align:start position:0%
counties okay one more question uh
 
00:40:23.839 --> 00:40:25.349 align:start position:0%
counties okay one more question uh
representative

00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
Ames yeah thank you um so I'm wondering
 
00:40:32.309 --> 00:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
wondering about the uh facilitators of
 
00:40:37.349 --> 00:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
rentals of homes the Airbnb and other
 
00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
entities like that and whether you're
 
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
actually collecting revenues from them
 
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
and there's also a parallel to the A
 
00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:47.240 align:start position:0%
Automobile rental side where there are
 
00:40:50.109 --> 00:40:50.119 align:start position:0%
entities that are uh enabling rentals I
 
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
think mostly of homeown uh you know
 
00:40:55.069 --> 00:40:55.079 align:start position:0%
individual owned
 
00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
Autos yeah
 
00:40:58.630 --> 00:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
sure so there is some guidance available
 
00:41:01.829 --> 00:41:01.839 align:start position:0%
on our website um for um people that are
 
00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:03.880 align:start position:0%
renting their homes through Airbnb
 
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
versus through other platforms um
 
00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:08.680 align:start position:0%
because who collects the tax and who
 
00:41:11.309 --> 00:41:11.319 align:start position:0%
pays the tax is different um for certain
 
00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
operators so that guidance is available
 
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
on our website and um there is
 
00:41:17.589 --> 00:41:17.599 align:start position:0%
legislation that was introduced last
 
00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
session um that did not make it into the
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
Omnibus bills at the end of the session
 
00:41:24.829 --> 00:41:24.839 align:start position:0%
but I believe it'll be reintroduced this
 
00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:27.160 align:start position:0%
year to clarify the taxability
 
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
of Motor Vehicles that are rented
 
00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:32.200 align:start position:0%
through third parties similar to um your
 
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
airbnbs for the rental of rooms or homes
 
00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
yes that that Bill's been introduced the
 
00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
ways and means and we be we'll be
 
00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:47.800 align:start position:0%
great U one more time for one more
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
Aly represent
 
00:41:55.240 --> 00:42:03.550 align:start position:0%
Aly represent
Aly

00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
okay then apologize I um I just had a
 
00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
call from a constituent trying to make a
 
00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:11.560 align:start position:0%
complaint about something totally
 
00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:13.069 align:start position:0%
complaint about something totally
unrelated

00:42:13.069 --> 00:42:13.079 align:start position:0%
unrelated
 
00:42:18.309 --> 00:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
um on my my question was whether on with
 
00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
this chart we couldn't tell uh pretty
 
00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:24.440 align:start position:0%
much we've always said that rooms and
 
00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:26.680 align:start position:0%
meals uh especially
 
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
was mostly people inside the state that
 
00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:33.640 align:start position:0%
were paying it does this give us some
 
00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
kind of an idea of how true that is
 
00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
since we're now in this situation where
 
00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
everybody's supposed to quarantine if
 
00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:43.880 align:start position:0%
they go between state
 
00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
borders um so we have never known for
 
00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
certain um who the consumers are because
 
00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
again when you go out to eat at a
 
00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:55.960 align:start position:0%
restaurant um or rent a hotel room you
 
00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
pay pay the tax to that operator So to
 
00:43:00.549 --> 00:43:00.559 align:start position:0%
that restaurant or to that hotel and
 
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
then that operator remits the tax to us
 
00:43:07.069 --> 00:43:07.079 align:start position:0%
um so I think in the past we've been
 
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
able to make some assumptions based on
 
00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
some travel and tourism data or just
 
00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
general comments about the economy and
 
00:43:16.829 --> 00:43:16.839 align:start position:0%
about people's um actions or habits or
 
00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
behaviors about who the ultimate
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
consumers are but unfortunately that's
 
00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:23.000 align:start position:0%
not something that's reported directly
 
00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:25.480 align:start position:0%
to us although you do make a very good
 
00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
point that in theory if folks are
 
00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
following um guidance from other states
 
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
they may not be able to travel into New
 
00:43:34.990 --> 00:43:35.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to say go out to eat or to
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
stay at a hotel or to rent um a house
 
00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
for a week and so that is likely
 
00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
contributing to the decrease in the
 
00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
meals and rentals tax that we're seeing
 
00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:48.750 align:start position:0%
meals and rentals tax that we're seeing
Senator

00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
gerer unmute yourself Senator there we
 
00:43:54.549 --> 00:43:54.559 align:start position:0%
go thank you Mr chairman um uh
 
00:43:56.829 --> 00:43:56.839 align:start position:0%
commissioner is there anything in his
 
00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
historically within the records of uh
 
00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
the department that would reflect any
 
00:44:06.309 --> 00:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
kind of a similar catastrophe and
 
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps give us some guidance as to re
 
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
recovery rates and in the different
 
00:44:12.109 --> 00:44:12.119 align:start position:0%
types of
 
00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:15.800 align:start position:0%
Revenue so um this is probably true for
 
00:44:19.589 --> 00:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
all of the taxes um in general but this
 
00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
the impact of covid and this recession
 
00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
is obviously not like anything else that
 
00:44:26.589 --> 00:44:26.599 align:start position:0%
we have really seen
 
00:44:28.589 --> 00:44:28.599 align:start position:0%
um the last significant economic
 
00:44:32.549 --> 00:44:32.559 align:start position:0%
downturn was in 2008 2009 um so we can
 
00:44:34.829 --> 00:44:34.839 align:start position:0%
look back at that and see the general
 
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:38.200 align:start position:0%
trend of recovery um when we do talk
 
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:40.079 align:start position:0%
about our specific Revenue estimates
 
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
coming up over the next few weeks and
 
00:44:43.589 --> 00:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
months at the various committees um
 
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about some of the assumptions
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
that we made um with respect to how this
 
00:44:51.549 --> 00:44:51.559 align:start position:0%
tax might recover one thing that is
 
00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
different from prior recessions is we
 
00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
believe that there's probably some pent
 
00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:00.200 align:start position:0%
up demand um because on one hand folks
 
00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
may not have the disposable income
 
00:45:04.270 --> 00:45:04.280 align:start position:0%
depending on how Co has impacted them to
 
00:45:07.069 --> 00:45:07.079 align:start position:0%
go out to eat on the other hand they may
 
00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
have the income but they're just not
 
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
able to or they don't feel comfortable
 
00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
um going out to eat you know I for one
 
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
have not stepped into a restaurant since
 
00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
um July and in that case it was eating
 
00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:20.440 align:start position:0%
Outdoors so I certainly will be one of
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
the first in line um when things do
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
improve um to enjoy a nice meal out to
 
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
eat so that pint of demand I think is
 
00:45:31.309 --> 00:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
something that is unlike other
 
00:45:33.349 --> 00:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
recessions or downturns that we've seen
 
00:45:35.069 --> 00:45:35.079 align:start position:0%
and we will try to factor that into our
 
00:45:35.079 --> 00:45:41.309 align:start position:0%
and we will try to factor that into our
Revenue

00:45:41.309 --> 00:45:41.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
yly Jordan yeah I trying to get there
 
00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
keeping on the wrong button there um
 
00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:54.280 align:start position:0%
regarding the meals Rooms To Go back to
 
00:45:58.150 --> 00:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
Edith's question uh Mrs steep the or
 
00:45:58.160 --> 00:45:59.270 align:start position:0%
Edith's question uh Mrs steep the or
commissioner

00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:46:02.109 --> 00:46:02.119 align:start position:0%
step is there any way to break out from
 
00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
where the meals and rooms um revenue is
 
00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:09.160 align:start position:0%
coming from that is I know from the
 
00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:11.480 align:start position:0%
parking lot of the restaurants I go to
 
00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:12.510 align:start position:0%
parking lot of the restaurants I go to
in

00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
Hudson a lot more Massachusetts plates
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
than there are New Hampshire plates and
 
00:46:21.549 --> 00:46:21.559 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that's the same uh over in
 
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
Salem and even up into
 
00:46:26.829 --> 00:46:26.839 align:start position:0%
Manchester um the question
 
00:46:29.589 --> 00:46:29.599 align:start position:0%
is even though Massachusetts has this
 
00:46:32.549 --> 00:46:32.559 align:start position:0%
quarantine thing which everyone ignores
 
00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
because they they shop in New Hampshire
 
00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
and we're benefiting greatly from uh uh
 
00:46:43.829 --> 00:46:43.839 align:start position:0%
their uh mentality down there um can we
 
00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:45.480 align:start position:0%
break it up a little bit that way to
 
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
find to see if there's a difference
 
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
between let's say uh uh the meals and
 
00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
room tax revenue um two years ago from
 
00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
conquered and two years ago from from uh
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
Hudson Salem the Southern
 
00:47:02.109 --> 00:47:02.119 align:start position:0%
Tier we can um we typically look at it
 
00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:06.040 align:start position:0%
on a county basis um it can be a little
 
00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
tricky um if you start looking at
 
00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
specific municipalities because of
 
00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:14.440 align:start position:0%
various reporting um for instance a
 
00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:16.280 align:start position:0%
chain of restaurants May submit a
 
00:47:19.309 --> 00:47:19.319 align:start position:0%
Consolidated return that may attribute
 
00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
all of their revenue to conquered even
 
00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
though they have locations and licenses
 
00:47:26.309 --> 00:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
in multiple parts of the state
 
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
um so that's why we do typically look at
 
00:47:30.109 --> 00:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
the county level but yes we can
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
definitely break it down by County we
 
00:47:33.950 --> 00:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
can break it down into meals and rooms
 
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
we can break it down into some of the
 
00:47:37.710 --> 00:47:37.720 align:start position:0%
larger categories in meals and rooms as
 
00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
I mentioned um full service dining as
 
00:47:42.349 --> 00:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
opposed to fast food full service
 
00:47:45.150 --> 00:47:45.160 align:start position:0%
restaurants as opposed to rental agents
 
00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
um and so we can definitely dive into
 
00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:49.160 align:start position:0%
that data and I think you will start to
 
00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
see that there are the impact of the
 
00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
counties um are different and so we will
 
00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
have that prepared and happy to talk to
 
00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
the committee about that when we get
 
00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
further into the revenue estimating
 
00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:01.160 align:start position:0%
process follow up on that
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
nor go ahead yeah would that be
 
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
beneficial to us in trying to estimate
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
under a restricted uh environment of uh
 
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
sales uh as to determining whether or
 
00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:17.000 align:start position:0%
not U there should be tax decrease or
 
00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
tax increase well you know you know what
 
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about as as far as
 
00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
um this this border um concept because
 
00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth is going to benefit from the
 
00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:31.480 align:start position:0%
strictness of Maine and Susan Lebanon is
 
00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
going to benefit uh uh from what's
 
00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
Happening across the river over in
 
00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:37.349 align:start position:0%
Happening across the river over in
Vermont

00:48:37.349 --> 00:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
Vermont
 
00:48:40.589 --> 00:48:40.599 align:start position:0%
so this should be beneficial to us am I
 
00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
correct on
 
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
that M St I I believe so that's
 
00:48:46.549 --> 00:48:46.559 align:start position:0%
definitely we have been looking at the
 
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
data and we are happy to um share that
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
with you and walk through with you you
 
00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
know what we're seeing so I I think
 
00:48:55.829 --> 00:48:55.839 align:start position:0%
that's a very good idea okay okay
 
00:48:58.910 --> 00:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner I think we can go
 
00:49:01.069 --> 00:49:01.079 align:start position:0%
on the next tax we're going to talk
 
00:49:03.309 --> 00:49:03.319 align:start position:0%
about is the real estate transfer tax
 
00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:06.119 align:start position:0%
the tax on the sale transfer or granting
 
00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
of property at a rate of a $150 per $100
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
of price or consideration for the trans
 
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
for the transfer um it is split 75 cents
 
00:49:17.349 --> 00:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
is the obligation of the purchaser and
 
00:49:19.870 --> 00:49:19.880 align:start position:0%
75 cents is the obligation of the
 
00:49:22.789 --> 00:49:22.799 align:start position:0%
seller R has increased in recent years
 
00:49:29.109 --> 00:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
we saw a 5.3% in 20 18 2.5% in 2019 and
 
00:49:33.109 --> 00:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
3.7% in 2020 um over the prior
 
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
years uh for fiscal year 21 actual
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
revenue for the first six months of the
 
00:49:39.069 --> 00:49:39.079 align:start position:0%
year is
 
00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
14.6% ahead of fiscal year um 21 plan
 
00:49:47.549 --> 00:49:47.559 align:start position:0%
and 7.4% ahead of fiscal year 2020 um on
 
00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
audited Revenue year to date the reason
 
00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:51.839 align:start position:0%
why those percentages look like they're
 
00:49:54.349 --> 00:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
a little off or a little inconsistent is
 
00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
there was a new transfer of $5 million
 
00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:00.440 align:start position:0%
that was implemented in fiscal year 21
 
00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
to the affordable housing fund so that
 
00:50:05.549 --> 00:50:05.559 align:start position:0%
full $5 million transfer was performed
 
00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:07.960 align:start position:0%
on October 1st and so that's why you'll
 
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
see that when you're comparing to Prior
 
00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
year um it looks like we're not as head
 
00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
as much as when you compare to plan plan
 
00:50:17.309 --> 00:50:17.319 align:start position:0%
did take into account that
 
00:50:20.109 --> 00:50:20.119 align:start position:0%
transfer uh factors that can affect R
 
00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
obviously the economy um you need to
 
00:50:26.549 --> 00:50:26.559 align:start position:0%
have the ability um to buyer sell a home
 
00:50:28.589 --> 00:50:28.599 align:start position:0%
low interest rates they're currently at
 
00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:30.200 align:start position:0%
historic lows
 
00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
2.77% in November of 2020 inventory
 
00:50:36.069 --> 00:50:36.079 align:start position:0%
levels the homes need to be on the mar
 
00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
Market in order for them to sell um the
 
00:50:41.069 --> 00:50:41.079 align:start position:0%
shift that we've been seeing from Urban
 
00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
to more rural areas um covid has been
 
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
helpful um in this with this respect uh
 
00:50:49.950 --> 00:50:49.960 align:start position:0%
I think as people look to move out of
 
00:50:52.789 --> 00:50:52.799 align:start position:0%
the cities and move into um more rural
 
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
areas such as New Hampshire and then
 
00:50:59.109 --> 00:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
obviously property values um we property
 
00:51:01.309 --> 00:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
values were one
 
00:51:04.349 --> 00:51:04.359 align:start position:0%
84.9 billion uh was the equalized value
 
00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:07.720 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire on April 21st of 2020
 
00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
and that was compared to 175. n billion
 
00:51:13.789 --> 00:51:13.799 align:start position:0%
uh the year before so almost a 10
 
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
billion doll increase in the total
 
00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:18.680 align:start position:0%
equalized value of properties in just a
 
00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:22.280 align:start position:0%
year obviously um with r as I said the
 
00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
homes need to be on the market in order
 
00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
for them to sell we're concerned about
 
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
inventory and sales volumes um and then
 
00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
on the other hand the sales price um
 
00:51:35.589 --> 00:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
impacts the amount of R collected as
 
00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
well and so those can kind of go hand
 
00:51:42.789 --> 00:51:42.799 align:start position:0%
inand um what we are generally seeing
 
00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
right now I'll switch to the next slide
 
00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:48.040 align:start position:0%
with covid is that we are starting to
 
00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:51.640 align:start position:0%
see some um inventory constraints but
 
00:51:54.069 --> 00:51:54.079 align:start position:0%
the values or the sales prices are very
 
00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
high and so those are kind of balancing
 
00:51:58.670 --> 00:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
each other out if we start to if the
 
00:52:01.069 --> 00:52:01.079 align:start position:0%
inventories are are less and the sales
 
00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
volumes decrease and the values decrease
 
00:52:06.589 --> 00:52:06.599 align:start position:0%
as well then um we would see a negative
 
00:52:09.789 --> 00:52:09.799 align:start position:0%
impact to the real estate transfer tax
 
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
so real estate transfer tax was an area
 
00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
where I was at least concerned there may
 
00:52:16.309 --> 00:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
be some impact during the stay-at-home
 
00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:21.240 align:start position:0%
order um but really the industry pivoted
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
very quickly to doing remote or no
 
00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
contact sales
 
00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:28.520 align:start position:0%
um folks have been buying homes without
 
00:52:31.309 --> 00:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
ever stepping foot in them um virtual
 
00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
chours uh for for houses have been very
 
00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:37.160 align:start position:0%
popular and then even a fully remote
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
closing has been able to occur as well
 
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
so I think that has helped the real
 
00:52:43.829 --> 00:52:43.839 align:start position:0%
estate transfer tax um the sales to
 
00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
occur and the tax to stay um at the
 
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
levels that we're
 
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
seeing obviously the economy will play
 
00:52:52.349 --> 00:52:52.359 align:start position:0%
an impact on the real estate transfer
 
00:52:55.230 --> 00:52:55.240 align:start position:0%
tax unemployment higher unemployment to
 
00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
typically leads to fewer people um
 
00:52:59.829 --> 00:52:59.839 align:start position:0%
looking to move or buy or sell
 
00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
homes um larger savings due to fewer um
 
00:53:06.309 --> 00:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
expenses uh is a good thing for the real
 
00:53:08.109 --> 00:53:08.119 align:start position:0%
estate transfer tax if folks have some
 
00:53:09.829 --> 00:53:09.839 align:start position:0%
money in the bank they might be trying
 
00:53:12.109 --> 00:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
to save for that first home or maybe
 
00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
save to purchase a new or bigger home
 
00:53:17.230 --> 00:53:17.240 align:start position:0%
and the savings that people um in many
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
cases are realizing during covid-19 may
 
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
be helpful to that I mentioned in terms
 
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
of changes in Behavior the virtual home
 
00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
sales um a lot of folks are doing home
 
00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
improvements um maybe doing some work on
 
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
their home and then looking to put it on
 
00:53:33.470 --> 00:53:33.480 align:start position:0%
the market and obviously the ability to
 
00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
work from home and a movement away from
 
00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:37.960 align:start position:0%
the urban centers have drawn folks to
 
00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um I believe as a place
 
00:53:43.870 --> 00:53:43.880 align:start position:0%
that they would like to live Recreation
 
00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
lots of outdoor activities here and
 
00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
they're no longer tied to that office
 
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily in um an urban area say in
 
00:53:55.109 --> 00:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts in terms of our future
 
00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
future outlook obviously lifted
 
00:54:00.510 --> 00:54:00.520 align:start position:0%
restrictions um a vaccine improving the
 
00:54:02.829 --> 00:54:02.839 align:start position:0%
economy um these are all things that we
 
00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
think will help the real estate transfer
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
tax um but I will note a area of concern
 
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
is the slowing of home sales due to the
 
00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
inventory um at some point I anticipate
 
00:54:16.910 --> 00:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
that the homes are just not going to be
 
00:54:18.910 --> 00:54:18.920 align:start position:0%
on the market even if people want to buy
 
00:54:22.549 --> 00:54:22.559 align:start position:0%
them um also New Hampshire Winters um
 
00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
can be slow for new home construction um
 
00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
and so there is likely going to be a
 
00:54:30.829 --> 00:54:30.839 align:start position:0%
point here where just the inventory um
 
00:54:33.829 --> 00:54:33.839 align:start position:0%
starts to potentially um decrease some
 
00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
of the tax and that we've been seeing
 
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:41.109 --> 00:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
sales looking at the 10year revenue
 
00:54:44.069 --> 00:54:44.079 align:start position:0%
Trend R's been doing great um again
 
00:54:47.710 --> 00:54:47.720 align:start position:0%
coming out of the 2008 2009 recession
 
00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:50.440 align:start position:0%
those years of economic expansion were
 
00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
were good for the real estate transfer
 
00:54:55.069 --> 00:54:55.079 align:start position:0%
tax um you can see that our fiscal year
 
00:54:59.150 --> 00:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
21 plan at 158.4 million is very close
 
00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
to where we landed um in fiscal year
 
00:55:04.589 --> 00:55:04.599 align:start position:0%
2020 so I would say it is likely that we
 
00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
will um at least meet if not exceed plan
 
00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
here even with the concerns about
 
00:55:13.069 --> 00:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
inventory R is just in a very good place
 
00:55:15.710 --> 00:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
um at this
 
00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
point and I will pause there for any
 
00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:21.880 align:start position:0%
real estate transfer uh tax questions we
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
have a question from senator
 
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.069 align:start position:0%
have a question from senator
rosenwall

00:55:26.069 --> 00:55:26.079 align:start position:0%
rosenwall
 
00:55:28.390 --> 00:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman good morning
 
00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner can the department quantify
 
00:55:37.789 --> 00:55:37.799 align:start position:0%
for us um of fiscal year 20's um
 
00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
performance above plan what percentage
 
00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
was due to um increased number of sales
 
00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
and what percentage of the performance
 
00:55:53.710 --> 00:55:53.720 align:start position:0%
increase was due to increased value of
 
00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
sales quick question that's a great
 
00:55:59.950 --> 00:55:59.960 align:start position:0%
question um so we do track on a monthly
 
00:56:03.549 --> 00:56:03.559 align:start position:0%
basis the volume of sales um and again
 
00:56:05.589 --> 00:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
we track that by County so we can see
 
00:56:07.829 --> 00:56:07.839 align:start position:0%
what's happening in the various counties
 
00:56:10.029 --> 00:56:10.039 align:start position:0%
so we have the sales volume data and we
 
00:56:12.589 --> 00:56:12.599 align:start position:0%
can compare that to how the how the tax
 
00:56:14.829 --> 00:56:14.839 align:start position:0%
performed as a whole and so that will
 
00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:17.640 align:start position:0%
get at whether it was solely driven just
 
00:56:20.349 --> 00:56:20.359 align:start position:0%
by volume or whether you know for
 
00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
instance if the volume was exactly the
 
00:56:24.109 --> 00:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
same as the prior year but the tax on
 
00:56:25.829 --> 00:56:25.839 align:start position:0%
increase that would be a result of
 
00:56:28.309 --> 00:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
increased values and so again when we
 
00:56:30.270 --> 00:56:30.280 align:start position:0%
come before the Committees to do the
 
00:56:32.309 --> 00:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
more in-depth analysis with respect to
 
00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
the revenue estimating we can certainly
 
00:56:35.950 --> 00:56:35.960 align:start position:0%
provide that information and help you
 
00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:38.200 align:start position:0%
dissect um what that means but we have a
 
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
very long history um on how the the
 
00:56:43.549 --> 00:56:43.559 align:start position:0%
number of transactions by County um and
 
00:56:45.829 --> 00:56:45.839 align:start position:0%
so we can definitely dive into that
 
00:56:48.349 --> 00:56:48.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:56:52.789 --> 00:56:52.799 align:start position:0%
Tucker yes uh it's a great presentation
 
00:56:55.349 --> 00:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
here in the North Country anecdote
 
00:57:00.270 --> 00:57:00.280 align:start position:0%
toally sales or Price say Rose far
 
00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
higher on sales where there was suitable
 
00:57:08.309 --> 00:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
Broadband is there any way that you can
 
00:57:12.190 --> 00:57:12.200 align:start position:0%
quantify that as we talk about the need
 
00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
for Broadband it would be nice to have a
 
00:57:17.549 --> 00:57:17.559 align:start position:0%
base of
 
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
facts that's a good point let me think
 
00:57:23.549 --> 00:57:23.559 align:start position:0%
about that a little bit um we may be
 
00:57:25.789 --> 00:57:25.799 align:start position:0%
able to
 
00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:29.720 align:start position:0%
Break um the data down by municipality
 
00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
and so you could compare those
 
00:57:35.710 --> 00:57:35.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities with Bron band access to
 
00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
those without um and we can see what
 
00:57:40.430 --> 00:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
we're seeing in terms of the volume of
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
the sales and maybe extrapolate from
 
00:57:45.349 --> 00:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
that the the sale prices so let us do a
 
00:57:47.870 --> 00:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
little bit of digging on that one thank
 
00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
janigan janin I'm sorry thank you Mr Mr
 
00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:56.190 align:start position:0%
janigan janin I'm sorry thank you Mr Mr
chairman

00:57:56.190 --> 00:57:56.200 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:57:59.710 --> 00:57:59.720 align:start position:0%
um my my question on this would be what
 
00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
percent is the uh real estate transfer
 
00:58:05.390 --> 00:58:05.400 align:start position:0%
tax of the total
 
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
revenue oh good question I don't have
 
00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:12.280 align:start position:0%
that immediately in front of me but when
 
00:58:14.190 --> 00:58:14.200 align:start position:0%
we come for our next presentation in
 
00:58:15.390 --> 00:58:15.400 align:start position:0%
front of house ways and means we're
 
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
going to show you a nice pie chart that
 
00:58:19.029 --> 00:58:19.039 align:start position:0%
has it all broken out for the various
 
00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:21.240 align:start position:0%
taxes so we will have that
 
00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:23.720 align:start position:0%
information thank you Mr chairman
 
00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:25.309 align:start position:0%
information thank you Mr chairman
followup

00:58:25.309 --> 00:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
followup
 
00:58:28.349 --> 00:58:28.359 align:start position:0%
followup um thank you um and then when
 
00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
you said property values went from 1.75
 
00:58:35.870 --> 00:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
billion to 184 billion from 2019 to 2020
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
that is that the total property value of
 
00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
all properties in New Hampshire that is
 
00:58:42.430 --> 00:58:42.440 align:start position:0%
so that's the total equalized value that
 
00:58:46.470 --> 00:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
we report in our um annual report yep so
 
00:58:49.349 --> 00:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
that's total value for the whole state
 
00:58:49.359 --> 00:58:52.069 align:start position:0%
that's total value for the whole state
thank

00:58:52.069 --> 00:58:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:55.150 --> 00:58:55.160 align:start position:0%
you uh any further questions on the real
 
00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:57.630 align:start position:0%
you uh any further questions on the real
estate

00:58:57.630 --> 00:58:57.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:01.029 --> 00:59:01.039 align:start position:0%
tax I don't see any so
 
00:59:03.029 --> 00:59:03.039 align:start position:0%
commissioner okay moving on to the
 
00:59:03.039 --> 00:59:04.470 align:start position:0%
commissioner okay moving on to the
tobacco

00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
tobacco
 
00:59:08.309 --> 00:59:08.319 align:start position:0%
tax so the tobacco tax is levied on each
 
00:59:10.349 --> 00:59:10.359 align:start position:0%
package of cigarettes at
 
00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
$1.78 um $1.78 per pack of 20 and $223 C
 
00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
per pack of 25 um you will see that as a
 
00:59:20.789 --> 00:59:20.799 align:start position:0%
little stamp on the bottom of a package
 
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
of cigarettes the tobacco tax is also
 
00:59:25.349 --> 00:59:25.359 align:start position:0%
levied on other tobacco
 
00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
products at a rate of 65.0 3% of the
 
00:59:31.870 --> 00:59:31.880 align:start position:0%
wholesale sales price and so this would
 
00:59:34.750 --> 00:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
be your loose tobacco your pipe tobacco
 
00:59:36.190 --> 00:59:36.200 align:start position:0%
um anything that's really not in the
 
00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
form of a cigarette and not in a pack of
 
00:59:39.990 --> 00:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
20 or
 
00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
25 um also we now tax e ecigarettes and
 
00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
that went into effect on January 1st of
 
00:59:49.230 --> 00:59:49.240 align:start position:0%
2020 it is levied on both the closed
 
00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
systems and the open systems so the
 
00:59:54.910 --> 00:59:54.920 align:start position:0%
closed system where you buy just one
 
00:59:57.910 --> 00:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
piece of or the E Cig cigarette is just
 
01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:00.760 align:start position:0%
one piece um that tax rate is three
 
01:00:02.910 --> 01:00:02.920 align:start position:0%
cents per millimeter on the volume of
 
01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:05.640 align:start position:0%
liquid or other substance that contains
 
01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
nicotine in the cartridge or container
 
01:00:11.029 --> 01:00:11.039 align:start position:0%
the open system is where you have like a
 
01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:12.920 align:start position:0%
refillable you might buy the liquid
 
01:00:16.069 --> 01:00:16.079 align:start position:0%
separately and insert it into a system
 
01:00:18.589 --> 01:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
and that is taxed at 8% of the wholesale
 
01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:20.920 align:start position:0%
sales price of the container of liquid
 
01:00:23.549 --> 01:00:23.559 align:start position:0%
or other substance that's containing
 
01:00:23.559 --> 01:00:25.069 align:start position:0%
or other substance that's containing
nicotine

01:00:25.069 --> 01:00:25.079 align:start position:0%
nicotine
 
01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:27.160 align:start position:0%
the composition of tobacco tax revenue
 
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
is changing historically it was
 
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
primarily stamp sales so packs of
 
01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
cigarettes um but in recent years other
 
01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
tobacco products has grown and currently
 
01:00:40.109 --> 01:00:40.119 align:start position:0%
makes up 7.7% of the tobacco tax revenue
 
01:00:42.670 --> 01:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
compared to fiscal year 2012 when other
 
01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
tobacco products made up 3.4% of Revenue
 
01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:47.720 align:start position:0%
so again seeing a little bit of that
 
01:00:50.309 --> 01:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
shift away from cigarettes into other
 
01:00:50.319 --> 01:00:51.630 align:start position:0%
shift away from cigarettes into other
tobacco

01:00:51.630 --> 01:00:51.640 align:start position:0%
tobacco
 
01:00:53.829 --> 01:00:53.839 align:start position:0%
products um factors that can affect the
 
01:00:56.549 --> 01:00:56.559 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax crossborder elasticity we
 
01:00:58.630 --> 01:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
have the lowest tobacco tax rate in the
 
01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
region so we see a fair amount of crossb
 
01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
sales also the trend as I mentioned in
 
01:01:07.069 --> 01:01:07.079 align:start position:0%
stamp sales we typically have over the
 
01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
years have seen a decrease in um stamp
 
01:01:13.069 --> 01:01:13.079 align:start position:0%
sales of approximately 3% year-over-year
 
01:01:16.589 --> 01:01:16.599 align:start position:0%
um but recently uh Massachusetts banded
 
01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:18.760 align:start position:0%
mentholated products are all flavored
 
01:01:21.029 --> 01:01:21.039 align:start position:0%
tobacco products that went into effect
 
01:01:23.789 --> 01:01:23.799 align:start position:0%
on June 1st of 2020 and we have
 
01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
certainly seen an increase in tobacco
 
01:01:30.109 --> 01:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
tax revenue due to that we have uh
 
01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
spoken with not only wholesalers um who
 
01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:35.480 align:start position:0%
essentially collect and pay the tax but
 
01:01:38.589 --> 01:01:38.599 align:start position:0%
also with retailers and um New Hampshire
 
01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
wholesalers have seen an increase um in
 
01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:44.920 align:start position:0%
flavored tobacco product um requests
 
01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
from their retailers and retailers have
 
01:01:48.910 --> 01:01:48.920 align:start position:0%
also mentioned especially those along
 
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
the border that they've seen an increase
 
01:01:53.269 --> 01:01:53.279 align:start position:0%
in sales um primarily of those
 
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
mentholated um
 
01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:58.069 align:start position:0%
mentholated um
tobacco

01:01:58.069 --> 01:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:00.670 --> 01:02:00.680 align:start position:0%
products so as I mentioned audited
 
01:02:02.789 --> 01:02:02.799 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax revenue historically has
 
01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
decreased year-over-year 3 to 4% in 2018
 
01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:07.549 align:start position:0%
decreased year-over-year 3 to 4% in 2018
and

01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:07.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:11.069 --> 01:02:11.079 align:start position:0%
2019 however in fiscal year 2020 we did
 
01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
see a 5.7% increase over fiscal year
 
01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
19 um that I believe is largely due to
 
01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
the uncertainty in the spring as the
 
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
covid-19 pandemic hit we saw a lot of
 
01:02:28.349 --> 01:02:28.359 align:start position:0%
wholesalers stocking up um on their
 
01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
purchases of stamps uh obviously the
 
01:02:33.549 --> 01:02:33.559 align:start position:0%
uncertainty of you know would the Dr be
 
01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
open to uh for us to be able to purchase
 
01:02:38.309 --> 01:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
stamps we remained open throughout the
 
01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
pandemic and the stay-at-home order um
 
01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
but I definitely there was some
 
01:02:44.269 --> 01:02:44.279 align:start position:0%
uncertainty around the business model of
 
01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
the wholesalers and what their um
 
01:02:48.430 --> 01:02:48.440 align:start position:0%
abilities were going to be to continue
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
stamping and distributing product so
 
01:02:52.589 --> 01:02:52.599 align:start position:0%
there was certainly some stocking up
 
01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
there that we saw at the end of fiscal
 
01:02:57.230 --> 01:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
year 20 um and then for fiscal year 21
 
01:02:58.990 --> 01:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
actual revenue for the first six months
 
01:03:02.950 --> 01:03:02.960 align:start position:0%
is 24.8% above plan and
 
01:03:06.990 --> 01:03:07.000 align:start position:0%
26.2% above fiscal year 2020 again I
 
01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
think this is a combination of the ban
 
01:03:13.870 --> 01:03:13.880 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts on flavored tobacco
 
01:03:16.589 --> 01:03:16.599 align:start position:0%
products in particular your mentholated
 
01:03:19.029 --> 01:03:19.039 align:start position:0%
cigarettes um and
 
01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
also um I have heard anecdotally that um
 
01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
the covid-19 pandemic although smoking
 
01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
certainly a risk factor for covid um the
 
01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
stress of what we all have been going
 
01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
through over the past almost you know 10
 
01:03:36.910 --> 01:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
months um might not be the most
 
01:03:39.069 --> 01:03:39.079 align:start position:0%
conducive environment to people for
 
01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
people to decide to quit smoking so
 
01:03:43.349 --> 01:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
we're just not seeing that decline in
 
01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:45.880 align:start position:0%
stamp sales that we've seen in past
 
01:03:48.109 --> 01:03:48.119 align:start position:0%
years also on this slide just for
 
01:03:49.549 --> 01:03:49.559 align:start position:0%
reference I have included what
 
01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
ecigarette Revenue has looked like over
 
01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
the last six months so in the last six
 
01:03:58.309 --> 01:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
months um we've collected about 2.1
 
01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:01.480 align:start position:0%
almost 2.2 million and that is an
 
01:04:03.870 --> 01:04:03.880 align:start position:0%
increase over the 1.2 million that we
 
01:04:05.870 --> 01:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
collected during the first six months of
 
01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
the taxation of ecigarettes that is
 
01:04:10.269 --> 01:04:10.279 align:start position:0%
expected there is typically a bit of a
 
01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:12.359 align:start position:0%
learning curve um when a new product
 
01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
becomes taxable um but we're looking at
 
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
approximately 300 to 400,000 a month in
 
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:26.109 --> 01:04:26.119 align:start position:0%
revenue this will show the trend of
 
01:04:29.269 --> 01:04:29.279 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax stamp revenue from F year 11
 
01:04:30.829 --> 01:04:30.839 align:start position:0%
through fiscal year
 
01:04:34.309 --> 01:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
2020 um I will note in here there are
 
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
some rate changes so that significant
 
01:04:38.910 --> 01:04:38.920 align:start position:0%
decrease you see from fiscal year 11 to
 
01:04:41.829 --> 01:04:41.839 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 12 that is a rate change and
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
then the rate increased from fiscal year
 
01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
13 to fiscal year 14 again you see that
 
01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
bump but starting in fiscal year 16 17
 
01:04:52.829 --> 01:04:52.839 align:start position:0%
18 19 we saw some downward Trends in
 
01:04:54.789 --> 01:04:54.799 align:start position:0%
those stamp sales and that's what I was
 
01:04:57.750 --> 01:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh speaking to with the 3 to 4% decrease
 
01:05:00.510 --> 01:05:00.520 align:start position:0%
but then fiscal year 20 we did see um
 
01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
that increase primarily due to the
 
01:05:07.309 --> 01:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
spring and then here's the chart for
 
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
other tobacco products this very clearly
 
01:05:15.789 --> 01:05:15.799 align:start position:0%
shows um the increase that we've seen um
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
in the sale of those products the again
 
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
the change from fiscal year 11 to 12
 
01:05:23.109 --> 01:05:23.119 align:start position:0%
that decrease that is the result of a
 
01:05:25.549 --> 01:05:25.559 align:start position:0%
rate change there was a rate increase
 
01:05:27.630 --> 01:05:27.640 align:start position:0%
from 13 to 14 and then we've seen a
 
01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
pretty steady increase from fiscal year
 
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
14 to fiscal year 19 that significant
 
01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:34.640 align:start position:0%
jump that you'll see from fiscal year 19
 
01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
to 20 remember that's the start of H
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:44.269 --> 01:05:44.279 align:start position:0%
well and then lastly the tobacco tax
 
01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
revenue 10-year
 
01:05:49.589 --> 01:05:49.599 align:start position:0%
Trend again you can see some fluctuation
 
01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
from fiscal year 11 through fiscal year
 
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
14 15 16 for fiscal year 16 to 19 we did
 
01:05:59.670 --> 01:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
see that decrease um and that is what we
 
01:06:02.190 --> 01:06:02.200 align:start position:0%
were intending to see you can see that
 
01:06:05.029 --> 01:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 plan um was just about
 
01:06:08.069 --> 01:06:08.079 align:start position:0%
equal to fiscal year 19 so I think we
 
01:06:10.349 --> 01:06:10.359 align:start position:0%
anticipated the tax to stabilize just a
 
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
little bit with the taxation of
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
ecigarettes um but we did see that bump
 
01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 20 tobacco tax cons
 
01:06:21.470 --> 01:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
continues to perform well we will talk
 
01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
about that some more in Greater detail
 
01:06:24.990 --> 01:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
in front of the Committees when you're
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
doing your Revenue
 
01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
estimates um we anticipate it will
 
01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
probably level off at some point but it
 
01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
is one of the shining stars uh lately um
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
due to covid um rather than a negative
 
01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
impact we're seeing I think I believe a
 
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
positive impact um on the tobacco
 
01:06:46.269 --> 01:06:46.279 align:start position:0%
tax I'm happy to pause here and answer
 
01:06:46.279 --> 01:06:47.190 align:start position:0%
tax I'm happy to pause here and answer
any

01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
questions any any questions on the
 
01:07:00.109 --> 01:07:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:07.630 --> 01:07:07.640 align:start position:0%
muted sorry about that commissioner um
 
01:07:09.630 --> 01:07:09.640 align:start position:0%
so we spent a lot of time last year on
 
01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:13.640 align:start position:0%
the taxation of Vape products last year
 
01:07:15.390 --> 01:07:15.400 align:start position:0%
uh we had a lot of testimony from vape
 
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
shops but I've heard through the graef
 
01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
find that a lot of the vape shops are uh
 
01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
didn't make it through this this uh time
 
01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of them have closed have you got
 
01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
the same read on that I have not heard
 
01:07:29.470 --> 01:07:29.480 align:start position:0%
that yet but we can certainly look into
 
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
um what our licenses look like and if
 
01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
we've seen some closures um in our uh
 
01:07:37.870 --> 01:07:37.880 align:start position:0%
Vape Shop licenses so we can certainly
 
01:07:41.829 --> 01:07:41.839 align:start position:0%
dig into that right thank you Senator
 
01:07:44.349 --> 01:07:44.359 align:start position:0%
Daniels thank you Mr chairman uh
 
01:07:46.990 --> 01:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner as as looking at your chart
 
01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
there on the uh the revenue coming in
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
and I guess the as we look look like as
 
01:07:56.670 --> 01:07:56.680 align:start position:0%
we lowered the uh tax on it there was
 
01:07:59.269 --> 01:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
less Revenue are we seeing a trend on
 
01:08:02.510 --> 01:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
that or uh there's also the argument
 
01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
that when we lower the tax it we
 
01:08:06.990 --> 01:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
increase because we get over the over
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
the bard of sales uh which one is more
 
01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:14.559 align:start position:0%
accurate um I would say given that we
 
01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
already have the lowest tax in the
 
01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
region that it is probably more likely
 
01:08:21.309 --> 01:08:21.319 align:start position:0%
that when we lower the rate we just
 
01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
decrease Revenue um I'm not sure that it
 
01:08:26.910 --> 01:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
I think the people that are already
 
01:08:31.510 --> 01:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
coming to New Hampshire um to get the
 
01:08:34.349 --> 01:08:34.359 align:start position:0%
cheaper um cigarettes they're already
 
01:08:37.390 --> 01:08:37.400 align:start position:0%
doing that most likely um there may be a
 
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
small amount um that do the math and
 
01:08:42.149 --> 01:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
decide at the current rate it's not
 
01:08:43.990 --> 01:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
enough and if it was 10 cents lower then
 
01:08:45.870 --> 01:08:45.880 align:start position:0%
maybe they would um but I think it's
 
01:08:48.430 --> 01:08:48.440 align:start position:0%
more likely that we have a good amount
 
01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
of crossb sales at this point and
 
01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:53.239 align:start position:0%
reductions to the rate are probably not
 
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
enough to to offset the decrease that we
 
01:08:56.829 --> 01:08:56.839 align:start position:0%
see in
 
01:09:00.349 --> 01:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
Revenue okay just one followup if follow
 
01:09:04.110 --> 01:09:04.120 align:start position:0%
up okay uh so you don't see that uh the
 
01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
more dispar uh more distance we have
 
01:09:09.269 --> 01:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
between uh New Hampshire and neighboring
 
01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:11.759 align:start position:0%
states that you would draw deeper from
 
01:09:14.229 --> 01:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
within the bordering states to come to
 
01:09:16.910 --> 01:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for instance years ago I
 
01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
heard of people coming from
 
01:09:22.229 --> 01:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
Connecticut to to New Hampshire because
 
01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
there there was such a difference
 
01:09:27.669 --> 01:09:27.679 align:start position:0%
sure that is a good point um we can we
 
01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
have the data for those surrounding
 
01:09:32.430 --> 01:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
states um and their current tax rates
 
01:09:34.390 --> 01:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
and so we will definitely present that
 
01:09:36.749 --> 01:09:36.759 align:start position:0%
to the committee so you can kind of see
 
01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
the the level of or the um actual
 
01:09:42.510 --> 01:09:42.520 align:start position:0%
difference in the tax um between the
 
01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
various States and you're right we may
 
01:09:46.709 --> 01:09:46.719 align:start position:0%
see that um Connecticut is significant
 
01:09:49.709 --> 01:09:49.719 align:start position:0%
enough that it could drive sales here um
 
01:09:53.070 --> 01:09:53.080 align:start position:0%
I think what might be more likely is
 
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
what exactly what we're seeing with
 
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts as other states around us
 
01:09:59.950 --> 01:09:59.960 align:start position:0%
ban certain products or restrict access
 
01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
to products um if we don't make the same
 
01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
corresponding change um we're likely to
 
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
see an increase in
 
01:10:10.830 --> 01:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
sales thank you represent El me you want
 
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:18.390 --> 01:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
yourself thank you uh years ago and it
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
was actually Brian GB that came up with
 
01:10:25.709 --> 01:10:25.719 align:start position:0%
this on that there was a a major
 
01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
statistical relationship between our
 
01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
amount of sales and the price of
 
01:10:34.709 --> 01:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
gasoline and the price of Gasol because
 
01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
it takes a lot of gasoline more gasoline
 
01:10:39.790 --> 01:10:39.800 align:start position:0%
to get here from Connecticut or New York
 
01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
where they were coming from some of them
 
01:10:44.830 --> 01:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
01:10:48.270 --> 01:10:48.280 align:start position:0%
um the price of gasoline is has been
 
01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
pretty low since covid
 
01:10:55.390 --> 01:10:55.400 align:start position:0%
started and do you see any relationship
 
01:10:57.030 --> 01:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
there at the current time because we've
 
01:10:59.350 --> 01:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
also got these travel restrictions which
 
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
apparently Massachusetts doesn't obey
 
01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
but Maine and Vermont are pretty strict
 
01:11:10.149 --> 01:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
about sure you're right about the the
 
01:11:12.430 --> 01:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
effect of the price of gasoline um we
 
01:11:15.870 --> 01:11:15.880 align:start position:0%
haven't done an updated analysis um with
 
01:11:18.149 --> 01:11:18.159 align:start position:0%
respect to that um but I you're right
 
01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
that that's certainly one of the factors
 
01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
that could be impacting what we're
 
01:11:23.590 --> 01:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
seeing for example with the ban in Mass
 
01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts if gas if gasoline was
 
01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
prohibitively expensive we not might not
 
01:11:31.149 --> 01:11:31.159 align:start position:0%
be seeing the increase sales in those
 
01:11:32.510 --> 01:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
Bann products that we're seeing here in
 
01:11:34.350 --> 01:11:34.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire if gas was really
 
01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
expensive so that is a very good
 
01:11:39.910 --> 01:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
point Senator
 
01:11:43.149 --> 01:11:43.159 align:start position:0%
Rosen you want to unmute thank you thank
 
01:11:45.870 --> 01:11:45.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman commissioner I'm really
 
01:11:47.830 --> 01:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
um glad that you
 
01:11:52.590 --> 01:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned anxiety and stress as a
 
01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
potential driver for increased tobacco
 
01:11:59.229 --> 01:11:59.239 align:start position:0%
use because that is documented that um
 
01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
addictions cross substances too and that
 
01:12:08.709 --> 01:12:08.719 align:start position:0%
um rates of smoking are are actually
 
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
higher among populations that
 
01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
have uh a mental illness or a substance
 
01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
use disorder and so my I'm wondering if
 
01:12:25.870 --> 01:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
the department has had any discussions
 
01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Health and Human
 
01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
Services or is able to track for
 
01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
example um the revenues for this tax in
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
the current fiscal year alongside of the
 
01:12:44.910 --> 01:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
the numbers of people who are waiting
 
01:12:47.950 --> 01:12:47.960 align:start position:0%
for an emergency psychiatric bed which
 
01:12:51.790 --> 01:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
has shot way up during the pandemic is
 
01:12:53.950 --> 01:12:53.960 align:start position:0%
there a way to look at
 
01:12:58.229 --> 01:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
what the actual impact of increased
 
01:13:02.110 --> 01:13:02.120 align:start position:0%
mental illness and substance use
 
01:13:05.149 --> 01:13:05.159 align:start position:0%
problems um what that impact is on rates
 
01:13:08.709 --> 01:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
of tobacco use sure that's a great point
 
01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
we could certainly reach out to HHS and
 
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
review some of the documentation I was
 
01:13:14.669 --> 01:13:14.679 align:start position:0%
speaking kind of more anecdotally but
 
01:13:17.390 --> 01:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
I'm glad that I wasn't necessarily um
 
01:13:21.310 --> 01:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
wrong in my assumption about the um
 
01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
correlation between anxiety and smoking
 
01:13:25.709 --> 01:13:25.719 align:start position:0%
um so we can certainly look into that
 
01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
see if we can get some better data um or
 
01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
some more specific data what will be a
 
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
little bit difficult is trying to parse
 
01:13:35.910 --> 01:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
the difference between the impact of
 
01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:38.440 align:start position:0%
anxiety or mental health on the rate of
 
01:13:41.709 --> 01:13:41.719 align:start position:0%
smoking and this ban of products in
 
01:13:43.629 --> 01:13:43.639 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts we kind of have two things
 
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
potentially happening at the same time
 
01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
but we can certainly look into the data
 
01:13:48.669 --> 01:13:48.679 align:start position:0%
and see if there's a way that we can
 
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
kind of pull it apart um or at least
 
01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
make sure or try to confirm that the
 
01:13:56.590 --> 01:13:56.600 align:start position:0%
general trend is consistent um with what
 
01:13:59.149 --> 01:13:59.159 align:start position:0%
we're seeing thank
 
01:14:01.709 --> 01:14:01.719 align:start position:0%
you okay I don't see any further
 
01:14:04.750 --> 01:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
questions so um commissioner go on to
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends sure interest in
 
01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
dividends tax so the interest in
 
01:14:10.950 --> 01:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
dividends tax is assessed at a rate of
 
01:14:13.470 --> 01:14:13.480 align:start position:0%
5% on interest in dividend income of
 
01:14:15.870 --> 01:14:15.880 align:start position:0%
individuals Partnerships and
 
01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
fiduciaries over the past three years
 
01:14:21.709 --> 01:14:21.719 align:start position:0%
indd has performed well a 12.2% increase
 
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
year-over-year in 18 8.4 and 19 and 9.6
 
01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:26.910 align:start position:0%
year-over-year in 18 8.4 and 19 and 9.6
and

01:14:26.910 --> 01:14:26.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:30.669 --> 01:14:30.679 align:start position:0%
20 Fisco year 21 uh for the first six
 
01:14:32.709 --> 01:14:32.719 align:start position:0%
months of the year is
 
01:14:35.910 --> 01:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
31.9% ahead of plan and
 
01:14:40.470 --> 01:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
34.1% of fiscal year 2020 I will note
 
01:14:45.550 --> 01:14:45.560 align:start position:0%
that the 21 number um is net of a
 
01:14:48.830 --> 01:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
99.2% anomalous receivable so I'm just
 
01:14:50.910 --> 01:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
going to stop quickly and talk about
 
01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:53.800 align:start position:0%
anomalous receivables um
 
01:14:55.709 --> 01:14:55.719 align:start position:0%
they are most important in the interest
 
01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
in dividends tax and in the business
 
01:15:03.669 --> 01:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
taxes so when the state um produces the
 
01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
caffer the final audited financial
 
01:15:09.550 --> 01:15:09.560 align:start position:0%
report um we take Revenue that's
 
01:15:12.350 --> 01:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
received in fiscal year um
 
01:15:17.350 --> 01:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
21 that we receive in the first 60 days
 
01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:19.400 align:start position:0%
where the underlying activity from that
 
01:15:21.709 --> 01:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
Revenue occurred in the prior year and
 
01:15:25.669 --> 01:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
we're able to pull that ount back in the
 
01:15:25.679 --> 01:15:27.830 align:start position:0%
we're able to pull that ount back in the
audited

01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
audited
 
01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
financials what happened in fiscal year
 
01:15:33.790 --> 01:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
21 is that as you may remember covid hit
 
01:15:37.189 --> 01:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
right around April 15th um there was
 
01:15:40.189 --> 01:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
pressure um to follow the federal due
 
01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
dates the federal uh the IRS moved their
 
01:15:46.110 --> 01:15:46.120 align:start position:0%
due dates from April 15th to July
 
01:15:48.870 --> 01:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
15th here in New Hampshire we moved our
 
01:15:52.149 --> 01:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
due dates from April 15th to June 15th
 
01:15:53.790 --> 01:15:53.800 align:start position:0%
in order to take into into account the
 
01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal year end of the state being on
 
01:15:58.229 --> 01:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
June 30th the federal year end is not
 
01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
until September so they didn't have that
 
01:16:02.629 --> 01:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
same issue of potentially straddling
 
01:16:05.070 --> 01:16:05.080 align:start position:0%
years so we move the date from April
 
01:16:07.790 --> 01:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
15th to June
 
01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
15th however not everyone followed that
 
01:16:14.310 --> 01:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
June 15th date and we received in the
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
case of indd just over $ n million do of
 
01:16:22.229 --> 01:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
Revenue um around July 15th that really
 
01:16:23.709 --> 01:16:23.719 align:start position:0%
was due June
 
01:16:27.910 --> 01:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
15th and so on a cash basis we are going
 
01:16:31.070 --> 01:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to see that 9.2
 
01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
million in the cash basis numbers that
 
01:16:36.750 --> 01:16:36.760 align:start position:0%
the department produces and that will be
 
01:16:38.830 --> 01:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
in the revenues until we get to the end
 
01:16:41.070 --> 01:16:41.080 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal year and we perform the
 
01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
accounting adjustment to remove it but
 
01:16:45.229 --> 01:16:45.239 align:start position:0%
when you want to compare year-over-year
 
01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
we did remove it from this analysis so
 
01:16:50.110 --> 01:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
that you could really compare apples to
 
01:16:52.629 --> 01:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
oranges because that 9.2 million that we
 
01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
received in 21 really was supposed to
 
01:16:57.270 --> 01:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
come in in 20 so it's just a timing
 
01:16:59.390 --> 01:16:59.400 align:start position:0%
difference it gets a little complicated
 
01:17:01.590 --> 01:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
with the accounting um when we spend
 
01:17:03.229 --> 01:17:03.239 align:start position:0%
time with the Committees to talk about
 
01:17:05.310 --> 01:17:05.320 align:start position:0%
your Revenue estimates we'll go into a
 
01:17:07.030 --> 01:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
deeper dive about the anomalous
 
01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
receivable we'll go through an
 
01:17:11.070 --> 01:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
explanation again of why what happened
 
01:17:12.709 --> 01:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
and why it's important and we'll talk
 
01:17:14.350 --> 01:17:14.360 align:start position:0%
about what you need to do with that
 
01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:16.440 align:start position:0%
amounts when you're looking to do your
 
01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:19.950 align:start position:0%
amounts when you're looking to do your
Revenue

01:17:19.950 --> 01:17:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:22.189 --> 01:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
projections um factors that can affect
 
01:17:25.070 --> 01:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
indd obvious VI ly the economy the stock
 
01:17:28.669 --> 01:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
market um past federal tax reform um
 
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
some folks may remember what was
 
01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
referred to as the fiscal cliff um where
 
01:17:36.350 --> 01:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
pending tax changes um resulted in many
 
01:17:38.669 --> 01:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
individuals and businesses accelerating
 
01:17:41.669 --> 01:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
some dividends um and distributions uh
 
01:17:44.030 --> 01:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
at the end of a calendar year in order
 
01:17:47.430 --> 01:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
to um kind of head off some negative tax
 
01:17:49.830 --> 01:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
impacts that were likely to occur um in
 
01:17:52.750 --> 01:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
the following calendar year um so those
 
01:17:56.030 --> 01:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
sort sorts of changes um Can impact the
 
01:17:58.270 --> 01:17:58.280 align:start position:0%
timing of Revenue that we receive
 
01:17:59.510 --> 01:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
obviously the amount of money in the
 
01:18:02.030 --> 01:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
bank and interest rates um also play
 
01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:08.629 --> 01:18:08.639 align:start position:0%
taxed um first I just wanted to show the
 
01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
trend you see some fluctuations um in
 
01:18:19.950 --> 01:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
2013 um 14 and 15 um that was due to
 
01:18:21.870 --> 01:18:21.880 align:start position:0%
some changes in the tax that occurred at
 
01:18:24.430 --> 01:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
the time but generally from 2016 forward
 
01:18:26.550 --> 01:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
we're on a pretty consistent upward
 
01:18:29.629 --> 01:18:29.639 align:start position:0%
Trend again 2020 end of the year ahead
 
01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
of 21 plan so this is another tax where
 
01:18:36.030 --> 01:18:36.040 align:start position:0%
I expect that we will at least meet if
 
01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
not exceed plan the other thing I would
 
01:18:42.149 --> 01:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
just note with respect to um the fact
 
01:18:44.110 --> 01:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
that we are
 
01:18:48.030 --> 01:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
31.9% ahead of plan year to
 
01:18:51.430 --> 01:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
date the vast majority of interest in
 
01:18:54.550 --> 01:18:54.560 align:start position:0%
dividends tax comes in in the last three
 
01:18:57.189 --> 01:18:57.199 align:start position:0%
months of the year so April May and
 
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
June you have your April 15th due date
 
01:19:02.790 --> 01:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
and then you have June 15th estimates
 
01:19:06.110 --> 01:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
that are due so this tax as Mr Kane
 
01:19:08.990 --> 01:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
indicated in his presentation is one
 
01:19:12.310 --> 01:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
where you can see a positive um amount
 
01:19:14.070 --> 01:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
of Revenue compared to plan in the early
 
01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
part of the year but that may get eroded
 
01:19:18.070 --> 01:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
because so much of the revenue is kind
 
01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
of backloaded in the second half of the
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
year so still early with this TX
 
01:19:27.189 --> 01:19:27.199 align:start position:0%
um hang tight will again do a deeper
 
01:19:29.910 --> 01:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
dive into how the tax generally comes in
 
01:19:31.830 --> 01:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
throughout the fiscal year when we do
 
01:19:33.430 --> 01:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
additional presentations to the
 
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
Committees when you're doing your
 
01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:36.870 align:start position:0%
Committees when you're doing your
Revenue

01:19:36.870 --> 01:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
01:19:39.189 --> 01:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
estimates looking at the breakdown of
 
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends tax over the past
 
01:19:43.229 --> 01:19:43.239 align:start position:0%
10 years you'll see that we tax
 
01:19:46.189 --> 01:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
distributions dividends federally tax
 
01:19:48.110 --> 01:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
exempt interest income that's an
 
01:19:50.070 --> 01:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
instance where for federal purposes it
 
01:19:51.709 --> 01:19:51.719 align:start position:0%
is tax exempt but here at the state it
 
01:19:54.669 --> 01:19:54.679 align:start position:0%
is taxable and then interest the
 
01:19:56.669 --> 01:19:56.679 align:start position:0%
breakdown in tax year
 
01:19:58.590 --> 01:19:58.600 align:start position:0%
2019 was
 
01:20:03.270 --> 01:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
32.4% was distributions 43.2 were
 
01:20:06.750 --> 01:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
dividends 8.1 was federal tax exempt
 
01:20:08.550 --> 01:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
interest income and
 
01:20:11.870 --> 01:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
16.2 was regular interest so again we
 
01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
call it interest in dividends but it's
 
01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
really dividends and distributions that
 
01:20:18.189 --> 01:20:18.199 align:start position:0%
are the vast majority of the inputs for
 
01:20:18.199 --> 01:20:20.110 align:start position:0%
are the vast majority of the inputs for
this

01:20:20.110 --> 01:20:20.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:20:24.110 --> 01:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
tax and I will pause here with any
 
01:20:30.550 --> 01:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
yourself did that again I'm sorry
 
01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner um sorry about that um we
 
01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:42.280 align:start position:0%
got the new computer systems up and I
 
01:20:44.030 --> 01:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
think it's for both business tax and
 
01:20:47.110 --> 01:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
indd is that correct correct so let's
 
01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
just talk about indd uh do you think
 
01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
that with the new computer system I know
 
01:20:54.310 --> 01:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
I know you do when you audit this tax
 
01:20:58.270 --> 01:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
you go to the the individual's um
 
01:21:00.270 --> 01:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
personal uh Federal returns is that
 
01:21:03.110 --> 01:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
correct that is correct and does the new
 
01:21:05.629 --> 01:21:05.639 align:start position:0%
computer system make that easier to do
 
01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:06.719 align:start position:0%
and what I'm getting at is there going
 
01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
to be more compliance for this tax
 
01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
because of that that's a great point and
 
01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
yes indd is an area we where we
 
01:21:17.189 --> 01:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
anticipate to see um some improved
 
01:21:20.110 --> 01:21:20.120 align:start position:0%
compliance with our new system so you're
 
01:21:23.709 --> 01:21:23.719 align:start position:0%
correct that we routinely um identify
 
01:21:26.229 --> 01:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
non-filers by comparing their federal
 
01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
tax information to their state tax
 
01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
information and for instance if you had
 
01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
federally reported dividends
 
01:21:35.709 --> 01:21:35.719 align:start position:0%
distributions and interest that are in
 
01:21:38.510 --> 01:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
an excess of the thresholds here in New
 
01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and you're a New Hampshire
 
01:21:42.510 --> 01:21:42.520 align:start position:0%
resident we would expect to see a
 
01:21:44.430 --> 01:21:44.440 align:start position:0%
corresponding New Hampshire interest and
 
01:21:47.189 --> 01:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
dividends tax return when we don't we
 
01:21:49.510 --> 01:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
will reach out and just you know gently
 
01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
say could you help us understand you
 
01:21:53.590 --> 01:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
know what we're missing missing and why
 
01:21:56.550 --> 01:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
you haven't filed that process is fairly
 
01:21:59.470 --> 01:21:59.480 align:start position:0%
manual at this point um given our
 
01:22:02.430 --> 01:22:02.440 align:start position:0%
current system or our old system at this
 
01:22:04.189 --> 01:22:04.199 align:start position:0%
point um interest in dividends and
 
01:22:06.430 --> 01:22:06.440 align:start position:0%
business taxes went live in rims which
 
01:22:08.110 --> 01:22:08.120 align:start position:0%
is our new Revenue information
 
01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
management system at the beginning of
 
01:22:14.510 --> 01:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
October and so we are able to slowly as
 
01:22:17.910 --> 01:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
we ramp up our auditing post covid um
 
01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
will be able to take advantage of the
 
01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
efficiencies that we have in that new
 
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
system um with identifying compliance
 
01:22:25.310 --> 01:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
issues or non or
 
01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
non-filers thank you represent Aly you
 
01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:36.629 --> 01:22:36.639 align:start position:0%
yourself yes thank you on just to follow
 
01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
up on that one before I ask the question
 
01:22:43.310 --> 01:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
I had on in the past a lot of the people
 
01:22:46.189 --> 01:22:46.199 align:start position:0%
that were caught this way had recently
 
01:22:49.229 --> 01:22:49.239 align:start position:0%
moved into the state being told that
 
01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
there wasn't an income tax therefore
 
01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
they didn't have to worry about taxes at
 
01:22:57.910 --> 01:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
all um and uh I think that with the
 
01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
covid refugees coming into this state
 
01:23:04.510 --> 01:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
particularly higher income ones that
 
01:23:08.830 --> 01:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
have jobs that can be remote uh that uh
 
01:23:10.270 --> 01:23:10.280 align:start position:0%
there should be quite a few of them
 
01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
coming found this next year and but my
 
01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
question was that I've noticed a huge
 
01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
part of the revenues come from
 
01:23:23.229 --> 01:23:23.239 align:start position:0%
Individual filers
 
01:23:28.270 --> 01:23:28.280 align:start position:0%
and on they those people including me
 
01:23:31.149 --> 01:23:31.159 align:start position:0%
are doing quarterly estimates uh based
 
01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
on the previous
 
01:23:37.310 --> 01:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
year and so uh it seems difficult to try
 
01:23:42.270 --> 01:23:42.280 align:start position:0%
to project what we're going to see when
 
01:23:45.990 --> 01:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
and at least for me most of the
 
01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
distributions arrived arrive in December
 
01:23:49.830 --> 01:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
with no
 
01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
warning so uh I don't think a lot of
 
01:23:55.270 --> 01:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
people are going to be changing their
 
01:23:57.030 --> 01:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
quarterly estimates until they do their
 
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
final taxes and so the last two payments
 
01:24:01.990 --> 01:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
the year are going to be
 
01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
critical correct that is a good point
 
01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
and again that is why I mentioned and we
 
01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
will go into it in Greater detail how
 
01:24:11.950 --> 01:24:11.960 align:start position:0%
revenue is received throughout the year
 
01:24:14.910 --> 01:24:14.920 align:start position:0%
the April 15th return um and extension
 
01:24:17.590 --> 01:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
due date will be critical for helping us
 
01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
understand um what is happening with
 
01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends tax and you're
 
01:24:25.709 --> 01:24:25.719 align:start position:0%
right again those June estimates um I
 
01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
can say that um you know fiscal year to
 
01:24:33.229 --> 01:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
date through December um estimate
 
01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
payments were 25% ahead of the prior
 
01:24:38.830 --> 01:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
year um so it is looking like as you
 
01:24:42.229 --> 01:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned many folks are making payments
 
01:24:44.430 --> 01:24:44.440 align:start position:0%
consistent with the prior year and some
 
01:24:47.109 --> 01:24:47.119 align:start position:0%
are even increasing them slightly um
 
01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
we'll update that number at the end of
 
01:24:51.390 --> 01:24:51.400 align:start position:0%
this month because January was an
 
01:24:52.790 --> 01:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
estimate month for the interest in
 
01:24:55.229 --> 01:24:55.239 align:start position:0%
dividends tax and so we should have some
 
01:24:56.990 --> 01:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
um additional data on that when we
 
01:24:58.470 --> 01:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
present in front of the committee later
 
01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:00.310 align:start position:0%
present in front of the committee later
this

01:25:00.310 --> 01:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:25:03.430 --> 01:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
month Senator Daniels thank you Mr
 
01:25:05.310 --> 01:25:05.320 align:start position:0%
chairman commissioner what is the
 
01:25:07.950 --> 01:25:07.960 align:start position:0%
threshold in New Hampshire for
 
01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:10.670 align:start position:0%
indd that's a good
 
01:25:10.670 --> 01:25:14.350 align:start position:0%
indd that's a good
[Music]

01:25:14.350 --> 01:25:14.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:17.270 --> 01:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
question me one second it's
 
01:25:20.910 --> 01:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
$2,400 uh dollar for an individual and
 
01:25:23.149 --> 01:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
4,800 for
 
01:25:24.270 --> 01:25:24.280 align:start position:0%
um joint
 
01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
filers thank you and again that'll be
 
01:25:29.109 --> 01:25:29.119 align:start position:0%
information that we provide to the
 
01:25:30.750 --> 01:25:30.760 align:start position:0%
committee we'll do a deeper dive into
 
01:25:32.189 --> 01:25:32.199 align:start position:0%
the taxes and we'll talk about the
 
01:25:34.669 --> 01:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
thresholds for the various taxes the
 
01:25:37.830 --> 01:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
amount of um exemptions that some taxes
 
01:25:39.470 --> 01:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
might have Etc and we'll give it to you
 
01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
in a nice um easy way so that you can
 
01:25:44.430 --> 01:25:44.440 align:start position:0%
reference it in the
 
01:25:47.470 --> 01:25:47.480 align:start position:0%
future commissioner before you go into
 
01:25:50.669 --> 01:25:50.679 align:start position:0%
um utility property tax are are you
 
01:25:54.910 --> 01:25:54.920 align:start position:0%
going to go over the schedules uh of
 
01:25:57.470 --> 01:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
when to report these
 
01:26:00.990 --> 01:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
taxes yes we will do that as well um in
 
01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
our next presentation when we come
 
01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
before um the house Ways and Means
 
01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
Committee next week we'll talk about the
 
01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
due dates so when various um taxes are
 
01:26:12.030 --> 01:26:12.040 align:start position:0%
reported throughout the fiscal year
 
01:26:14.430 --> 01:26:14.440 align:start position:0%
thank you because we have nine new
 
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
members up on our committee sure right
 
01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
and I believe me I understand it can be
 
01:26:21.669 --> 01:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
a steep learning curve um so again we'll
 
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
try to presented in a format um we'll
 
01:26:25.870 --> 01:26:25.880 align:start position:0%
give you statutory references so you
 
01:26:27.270 --> 01:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
know where to look if you have more
 
01:26:29.470 --> 01:26:29.480 align:start position:0%
specific questions we'll talk about the
 
01:26:31.709 --> 01:26:31.719 align:start position:0%
timing of filings and revenues we'll
 
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
talk about key exemptions thresholds Etc
 
01:26:38.470 --> 01:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
and hopefully um in a way that you can
 
01:26:40.350 --> 01:26:40.360 align:start position:0%
uh keep it and refer to it throughout
 
01:26:44.229 --> 01:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
the session as you need it thank you all
 
01:26:46.590 --> 01:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
right you you told the property
 
01:26:50.070 --> 01:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
tax okay utility property tax so this is
 
01:26:51.950 --> 01:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
a tax imposed on the value of utility
 
01:26:53.990 --> 01:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
prop properties the rate is
 
01:26:58.149 --> 01:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
$6.60 per $1,000 of value and the Dr
 
01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
sets that value as of April 1st of each
 
01:27:04.709 --> 01:27:04.719 align:start position:0%
year ubt Revenue has fluctuated a bit
 
01:27:07.629 --> 01:27:07.639 align:start position:0%
over the past few years from an 88.2%
 
01:27:10.750 --> 01:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
increase over the prior year in 18 to a
 
01:27:14.310 --> 01:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
12.5% decrease in fiscal year 19 to a
 
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
99.6% increase in fiscal year 20 fiscal
 
01:27:20.229 --> 01:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
year 21 actual revenue for the first 6
 
01:27:25.550 --> 01:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
months is 4.8% ahead of plan and 88.5%
 
01:27:27.870 --> 01:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
ahead of Prior
 
01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
year tax year 2020 assessments are
 
01:27:36.030 --> 01:27:36.040 align:start position:0%
38.9 million with a total property value
 
01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
of 5.9 billion um this tax is pretty
 
01:27:44.669 --> 01:27:44.679 align:start position:0%
consistent um year-to year um it all
 
01:27:47.030 --> 01:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
gets deposited into the education trust
 
01:27:49.750 --> 01:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
fund um but things that can impact the
 
01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
tax is obviously the development of any
 
01:27:55.030 --> 01:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
new renewable energy facilities which we
 
01:27:58.709 --> 01:27:58.719 align:start position:0%
have seen in previous years the general
 
01:28:02.030 --> 01:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
valuation of the utility property um
 
01:28:04.510 --> 01:28:04.520 align:start position:0%
which goes into various valuation
 
01:28:07.149 --> 01:28:07.159 align:start position:0%
methods and then energy pricing supply
 
01:28:09.669 --> 01:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
and demand impact the value of these
 
01:28:13.629 --> 01:28:13.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:17.669 --> 01:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
well again questions smaller tax so I
 
01:28:19.430 --> 01:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
just wanted to go over this briefly
 
01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
happy to answer
 
01:28:24.310 --> 01:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
questions uh since no questions
 
01:28:27.430 --> 01:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
communication Services tax perfect
 
01:28:29.470 --> 01:28:29.480 align:start position:0%
communication Services tax is a tax of
 
01:28:31.550 --> 01:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
7% on all two-way
 
01:28:35.070 --> 01:28:35.080 align:start position:0%
Communications in 2012 um the tax
 
01:28:37.590 --> 01:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
excluded charges for internet access
 
01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
which caused a significant decrease in
 
01:28:41.830 --> 01:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
Communication Service tax
 
01:28:44.430 --> 01:28:44.440 align:start position:0%
revenues um you can see that from fiscal
 
01:28:49.310 --> 01:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
year 2009 to 2012 CST was between 76.5
 
01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
million and 81 million after the change
 
01:28:55.990 --> 01:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
from fiscal year 13 to fiscal year 17
 
01:28:57.669 --> 01:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
Revenue was between
 
01:29:02.709 --> 01:29:02.719 align:start position:0%
47.1 and 59.3 million so again the the
 
01:29:04.390 --> 01:29:04.400 align:start position:0%
um exclusion of the taxability of
 
01:29:06.510 --> 01:29:06.520 align:start position:0%
internet access resulted in that
 
01:29:08.229 --> 01:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
decrease in
 
01:29:11.149 --> 01:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
Revenue um but over the past three years
 
01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
um Revenue has been much more consistent
 
01:29:18.750 --> 01:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
43.4 million in 18 41.2 million in 19
 
01:29:20.910 --> 01:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
39.3 million in
 
01:29:24.149 --> 01:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
20 for fiscal year 21 actual revenue for
 
01:29:26.790 --> 01:29:26.800 align:start position:0%
the first 6 months is about 8.8 below
 
01:29:31.470 --> 01:29:31.480 align:start position:0%
plan and 4.6 below um United revenue of
 
01:29:33.990 --> 01:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
the prior year part of that is due to a
 
01:29:36.709 --> 01:29:36.719 align:start position:0%
timing issue um with some late payments
 
01:29:39.470 --> 01:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
that we anticipate receiving this
 
01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
month factors that affect um CST
 
01:29:45.590 --> 01:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
decrease in landlines um you know
 
01:29:48.390 --> 01:29:48.400 align:start position:0%
earlier uh or in Prior years many folks
 
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
had a landline and a cell phone um both
 
01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
would have been taxable
 
01:29:54.229 --> 01:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
now many folks have abandoned the
 
01:29:56.510 --> 01:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
landline and only use their cell phone
 
01:29:58.669 --> 01:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
um resulting in a decrease in taxable
 
01:29:58.679 --> 01:30:00.149 align:start position:0%
um resulting in a decrease in taxable
two-way

01:30:00.149 --> 01:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
two-way
 
01:30:02.270 --> 01:30:02.280 align:start position:0%
Communications um modern pricing and
 
01:30:03.709 --> 01:30:03.719 align:start position:0%
purchasing trends for Wireless
 
01:30:05.550 --> 01:30:05.560 align:start position:0%
Communications again this shift to
 
01:30:08.750 --> 01:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
wireless um and uh decrease in the use
 
01:30:11.510 --> 01:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
of landmines um and then also the
 
01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
inclusion of VoIP um and video
 
01:30:16.149 --> 01:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
conferencing uh will help to stabilize
 
01:30:18.030 --> 01:30:18.040 align:start position:0%
this tax and you can kind of see in
 
01:30:20.709 --> 01:30:20.719 align:start position:0%
recent years um that it has become much
 
01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
more stable um than it was in Prior
 
01:30:26.669 --> 01:30:26.679 align:start position:0%
years again this is a smaller tax so I
 
01:30:28.270 --> 01:30:28.280 align:start position:0%
don't have any charts I just wanted to
 
01:30:30.070 --> 01:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
give a brief overview but I'm happy to
 
01:30:32.070 --> 01:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
01:30:34.669 --> 01:30:34.679 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:30:37.030 --> 01:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
Bry commissioner let me use an example
 
01:30:41.149 --> 01:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
so is this Zoom service that we're using
 
01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
taxable my understanding is yes um but I
 
01:30:48.109 --> 01:30:48.119 align:start position:0%
am not com totally confident that all uh
 
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
video conferencing um is being
 
01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
appropriately remitted to the state so
 
01:30:53.070 --> 01:30:53.080 align:start position:0%
this is something that our audit
 
01:30:56.310 --> 01:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
division is looking into okay thank
 
01:31:01.149 --> 01:31:01.159 align:start position:0%
you that'll be an issue uh representa
 
01:31:05.470 --> 01:31:05.480 align:start position:0%
Jen thank you Mr chairman um so the uh
 
01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
decrease in landlines is causing a
 
01:31:10.750 --> 01:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
decrease in Revenue why why are the why
 
01:31:13.189 --> 01:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
are cell phones or mobile communication
 
01:31:15.910 --> 01:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
not taxed in the same way they are
 
01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
they're still taxable um it's just you
 
01:31:21.109 --> 01:31:21.119 align:start position:0%
before you may have had two taxable
 
01:31:23.229 --> 01:31:23.239 align:start position:0%
products you're landline and your cell
 
01:31:25.790 --> 01:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
phone and now you only have one taxable
 
01:31:28.390 --> 01:31:28.400 align:start position:0%
product I see okay thank so it's just
 
01:31:30.669 --> 01:31:30.679 align:start position:0%
kind of the shift it's it's reducing the
 
01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
tax base a little bit
 
01:31:40.149 --> 01:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:43.669 --> 01:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
elmy Susan you want to unmute
 
01:31:45.830 --> 01:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
yourself mute
 
01:31:50.629 --> 01:31:50.639 align:start position:0%
button um there's also um for those of
 
01:31:53.629 --> 01:31:53.639 align:start position:0%
us that live on cable because it's the
 
01:31:58.030 --> 01:31:58.040 align:start position:0%
only uh Broadband that we can get in our
 
01:32:01.030 --> 01:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
areas uh the cable companies have
 
01:32:04.229 --> 01:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
reduced within their packages the price
 
01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
of uh landline access uh to almost
 
01:32:11.430 --> 01:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
nothing and then they pay the tax on
 
01:32:14.390 --> 01:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
that and they charge us a lot more for
 
01:32:16.510 --> 01:32:16.520 align:start position:0%
internet and
 
01:32:18.510 --> 01:32:18.520 align:start position:0%
television that's a good point so
 
01:32:21.030 --> 01:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
obviously just the shift um even for
 
01:32:22.709 --> 01:32:22.719 align:start position:0%
those with land lines the cost of having
 
01:32:24.870 --> 01:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
a landline has decreased with those
 
01:32:26.550 --> 01:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
Cable packages that some folks are able
 
01:32:30.149 --> 01:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:32.550 --> 01:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
point okay I don't see any further
 
01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
questions so uh go on to the the big
 
01:32:40.229 --> 01:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
ones the big one okay business taxes so
 
01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
business taxes consist of actually two
 
01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
taxes the business Enterprise tax and
 
01:32:46.109 --> 01:32:46.119 align:start position:0%
the business profits
 
01:32:48.790 --> 01:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
tax the bet is assessed on the sum of
 
01:32:51.629 --> 01:32:51.639 align:start position:0%
all compensation PID to recruit interest
 
01:32:53.430 --> 01:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
paid or ACR and dividends paid by the
 
01:32:55.990 --> 01:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
business the BPT is assessed on income
 
01:32:57.709 --> 01:32:57.719 align:start position:0%
from the conduct of business activity
 
01:32:58.750 --> 01:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
within the
 
01:33:01.950 --> 01:33:01.960 align:start position:0%
state so business profits tax conforms
 
01:33:05.470 --> 01:33:05.480 align:start position:0%
to the Internal Revenue code of 1986 in
 
01:33:09.950 --> 01:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
effect on December 31st 2016 for taxable
 
01:33:12.590 --> 01:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
periods beginning on or after January
 
01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:13.950 align:start position:0%
periods beginning on or after January
1st

01:33:13.950 --> 01:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
1st
 
01:33:16.669 --> 01:33:16.679 align:start position:0%
2018 for all tax will periods beginning
 
01:33:19.750 --> 01:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
on or after January 1st 2020 the
 
01:33:22.189 --> 01:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
applicable version of the IRC will be as
 
01:33:24.229 --> 01:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
of December 31st
 
01:33:26.510 --> 01:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
2018 important thing to note there is
 
01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
that the code in effect on December 31st
 
01:33:33.390 --> 01:33:33.400 align:start position:0%
2018 cons uh includes the tax cut and
 
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
jobs act so that is kind of our update
 
01:33:38.990 --> 01:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
from the Internal Revenue code prior to
 
01:33:41.189 --> 01:33:41.199 align:start position:0%
the tax cut and jobs act to the Internal
 
01:33:44.590 --> 01:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
Revenue code with the tax cut and jobs
 
01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
act factors that affect business taxes
 
01:33:49.870 --> 01:33:49.880 align:start position:0%
obviously the economy uh federal tax
 
01:33:53.990 --> 01:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
reform um line 28 of a TA of a
 
01:33:56.109 --> 01:33:56.119 align:start position:0%
business's federal tax return is the
 
01:33:57.910 --> 01:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
starting point for their New Hampshire
 
01:34:00.709 --> 01:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
tax return and uh while applying the
 
01:34:04.830 --> 01:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
code that we um that we reference
 
01:34:07.030 --> 01:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
mergers and Acquisitions can have tax
 
01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
impacts credits and other exemptions
 
01:34:11.950 --> 01:34:11.960 align:start position:0%
will have tax impacts and then obviously
 
01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
any statutory changes um that we
 
01:34:17.109 --> 01:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
consider uh throughout the year uh that
 
01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
ultimately become
 
01:34:22.270 --> 01:34:22.280 align:start position:0%
implemented recent statutory changes
 
01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
um business tax rates you'll see a chart
 
01:34:26.350 --> 01:34:26.360 align:start position:0%
in the presentation and on the screen
 
01:34:28.229 --> 01:34:28.239 align:start position:0%
that gives you a history of the business
 
01:34:31.350 --> 01:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
tax rates um there was a potential
 
01:34:34.910 --> 01:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
trigger um that was uh going to go into
 
01:34:38.390 --> 01:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
effect on January 1 of this year given
 
01:34:40.669 --> 01:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
revenues um that the state received
 
01:34:43.109 --> 01:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
however that trigger was not met so you
 
01:34:45.629 --> 01:34:45.639 align:start position:0%
will see that the rate stayed the same
 
01:34:52.390 --> 01:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
at 7.7% for BPT and 6% for bet
 
01:34:55.310 --> 01:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
other notable statutory changes um
 
01:34:56.950 --> 01:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
there's two here that relate to
 
01:34:59.430 --> 01:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
apportionment so if you are a business
 
01:35:01.470 --> 01:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
business that operates both within and
 
01:35:03.510 --> 01:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
without the state so you're a regional
 
01:35:05.629 --> 01:35:05.639 align:start position:0%
New England business all the way up to a
 
01:35:09.149 --> 01:35:09.159 align:start position:0%
multinational business um if you operate
 
01:35:10.669 --> 01:35:10.679 align:start position:0%
inside New Hampshire and outside New
 
01:35:12.430 --> 01:35:12.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you need to apportion your
 
01:35:15.550 --> 01:35:15.560 align:start position:0%
income to New Hampshire um so we need to
 
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
know what portion of your income is
 
01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
attributable here and then we tax that
 
01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
portion these two changes impact how a
 
01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:25.679 align:start position:0%
portion Min is calculated so the first
 
01:35:27.910 --> 01:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
is market-based sourcing and that is in
 
01:35:30.149 --> 01:35:30.159 align:start position:0%
effect for taxable periods ending on or
 
01:35:33.390 --> 01:35:33.400 align:start position:0%
after December 31st of this year this is
 
01:35:36.149 --> 01:35:36.159 align:start position:0%
for intangibles and services um when
 
01:35:38.590 --> 01:35:38.600 align:start position:0%
you're looking to determine where those
 
01:35:41.310 --> 01:35:41.320 align:start position:0%
services or intangibles should be a
 
01:35:44.629 --> 01:35:44.639 align:start position:0%
portioned you're going to look um to
 
01:35:48.669 --> 01:35:48.679 align:start position:0%
your end customer at this point prior to
 
01:35:50.229 --> 01:35:50.239 align:start position:0%
taxable period ending onor after
 
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
December 31st of 21 you would use What's
 
01:35:55.270 --> 01:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
called the cost of performance method
 
01:35:57.030 --> 01:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
and you would look to where those
 
01:36:00.030 --> 01:36:00.040 align:start position:0%
Services were actually being
 
01:36:02.790 --> 01:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
performed the other apportionment change
 
01:36:04.950 --> 01:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
to note is single sales Factor
 
01:36:07.030 --> 01:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
apportionment which um under current
 
01:36:08.990 --> 01:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
statute would be taxable for periods
 
01:36:12.830 --> 01:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
ending on or after December 31st of
 
01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
2022 currently and up until that date um
 
01:36:19.709 --> 01:36:19.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire calculates apportionment
 
01:36:23.709 --> 01:36:23.719 align:start position:0%
based on sales property and payroll so
 
01:36:25.870 --> 01:36:25.880 align:start position:0%
we look at your sales in the state we
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
look at your property that you own in
 
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
the state and we look at your payroll in
 
01:36:32.109 --> 01:36:32.119 align:start position:0%
the state we double weight that sales
 
01:36:34.870 --> 01:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
factor and then we divide um and that's
 
01:36:36.790 --> 01:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
how we determine what portion of your
 
01:36:39.950 --> 01:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue Pi is attributable here in New
 
01:36:42.109 --> 01:36:42.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um with the single sales
 
01:36:43.950 --> 01:36:43.960 align:start position:0%
Factor apportionment for taxable periods
 
01:36:46.950 --> 01:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
ending on or after December 31st of 2022
 
01:36:48.510 --> 01:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
the only thing that we're going to look
 
01:36:50.550 --> 01:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
at is where your sales occur we're not
 
01:36:52.830 --> 01:36:52.840 align:start position:0%
going to look any anymore at how much
 
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
property you have in the state or what
 
01:36:57.070 --> 01:36:57.080 align:start position:0%
your payroll in the state is all we care
 
01:37:00.149 --> 01:37:00.159 align:start position:0%
about is splitting your Revenue P based
 
01:37:02.590 --> 01:37:02.600 align:start position:0%
on where your sales are
 
01:37:05.070 --> 01:37:05.080 align:start position:0%
located so those are two things that are
 
01:37:08.030 --> 01:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
fairly complicated topics a portion Min
 
01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh definitely have it has its learning
 
01:37:11.910 --> 01:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
curve and we will certainly work with
 
01:37:13.590 --> 01:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
the committee to make sure everyone
 
01:37:17.550 --> 01:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:19.910 --> 01:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
are here's just a history of business
 
01:37:22.830 --> 01:37:22.840 align:start position:0%
tax revenue um in the chart for fiscal
 
01:37:25.270 --> 01:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
year 11 through fiscal year
 
01:37:28.430 --> 01:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
2020 um you will see business taxes do
 
01:37:31.070 --> 01:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
fluctuate year to year um you'll see in
 
01:37:34.430 --> 01:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
18 we had a pretty significant increase
 
01:37:37.510 --> 01:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
um and again a bit of an increase in 19
 
01:37:39.510 --> 01:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
we worked with the prior committee
 
01:37:42.430 --> 01:37:42.440 align:start position:0%
during the prior um session to look at
 
01:37:43.870 --> 01:37:43.880 align:start position:0%
some one-time revenues that we
 
01:37:46.470 --> 01:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
anticipated occurring during that time
 
01:37:49.510 --> 01:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
due to the federal tax cut and jobs act
 
01:37:51.629 --> 01:37:51.639 align:start position:0%
um and then you see a decrease um in
 
01:37:53.830 --> 01:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20 and that is partially due
 
01:37:56.390 --> 01:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
to um the beginning of
 
01:37:59.470 --> 01:37:59.480 align:start position:0%
covid um but business tax revenues
 
01:38:02.310 --> 01:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to date um for the first six
 
01:38:04.109 --> 01:38:04.119 align:start position:0%
months of the year we are
 
01:38:07.310 --> 01:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
14.3% above plan and
 
01:38:11.390 --> 01:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
12.1% above fiscal year 2020 and again
 
01:38:14.629 --> 01:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
we did remove the 18.3 million anomalous
 
01:38:17.229 --> 01:38:17.239 align:start position:0%
receivable that I mentioned earlier um
 
01:38:18.790 --> 01:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
we did remove that so you have a more
 
01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
apples to apples comparison um in the
 
01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
next slide we'll just go through kind of
 
01:38:27.310 --> 01:38:27.320 align:start position:0%
the effects that covid-19 has had on
 
01:38:30.030 --> 01:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
business taxes obviously for many
 
01:38:32.950 --> 01:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
businesses the stay-at-home order um
 
01:38:35.629 --> 01:38:35.639 align:start position:0%
hurt their business um some survived
 
01:38:38.510 --> 01:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
some did not um there's less activity
 
01:38:40.510 --> 01:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
generally in the economy and then
 
01:38:42.109 --> 01:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
there's strain on businesses due to
 
01:38:43.830 --> 01:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
restrictions on
 
01:38:45.950 --> 01:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
employees in terms of what's happening
 
01:38:47.149 --> 01:38:47.159 align:start position:0%
in the economy obviously the
 
01:38:50.270 --> 01:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate plays a factor shift
 
01:38:53.030 --> 01:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
in Behavior years of businesses um
 
01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
Federal stimulus money and then state
 
01:38:57.229 --> 01:38:57.239 align:start position:0%
aid programs there is was a fair amount
 
01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
of money that was distributed to
 
01:39:00.709 --> 01:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
businesses to help them through this
 
01:39:03.189 --> 01:39:03.199 align:start position:0%
time in hopes that um businesses would
 
01:39:06.990 --> 01:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
not have to close um and in large part I
 
01:39:09.109 --> 01:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
think that was very helpful um when
 
01:39:10.950 --> 01:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
we're talking about federal aid programs
 
01:39:13.030 --> 01:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
obviously the PPP loans or grants and
 
01:39:15.870 --> 01:39:15.880 align:start position:0%
the eidl loans are important in terms of
 
01:39:18.470 --> 01:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
helping businesses through that
 
01:39:21.109 --> 01:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
time in terms of changes in behaviors
 
01:39:23.189 --> 01:39:23.199 align:start position:0%
certain businesses are thriving home
 
01:39:25.709 --> 01:39:25.719 align:start position:0%
improvement stores big box stores um
 
01:39:27.070 --> 01:39:27.080 align:start position:0%
anyone with an internet presence you
 
01:39:28.510 --> 01:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
know if I can order it and it can show
 
01:39:30.990 --> 01:39:31.000 align:start position:0%
up at my house um that's certainly a
 
01:39:32.990 --> 01:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
good thing as I'm not going into many
 
01:39:35.189 --> 01:39:35.199 align:start position:0%
stores at this point obviously
 
01:39:37.270 --> 01:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
technology companies as we all
 
01:39:40.229 --> 01:39:40.239 align:start position:0%
transition to working remotely um saw a
 
01:39:42.510 --> 01:39:42.520 align:start position:0%
benefit and obviously medical providers
 
01:39:45.870 --> 01:39:45.880 align:start position:0%
medical devices Etc um potentially
 
01:39:48.550 --> 01:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
benefited from the covid-19
 
01:39:51.070 --> 01:39:51.080 align:start position:0%
pandemic I think it is important to note
 
01:39:54.510 --> 01:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
here in that sense that um unlike other
 
01:39:57.669 --> 01:39:57.679 align:start position:0%
recessions this the pandemic and this
 
01:39:59.870 --> 01:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
downturn in the economy really had a
 
01:40:01.830 --> 01:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
desparate impact on businesses it didn't
 
01:40:04.189 --> 01:40:04.199 align:start position:0%
impact all businesses the same some
 
01:40:07.229 --> 01:40:07.239 align:start position:0%
businesses saw significant um reductions
 
01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
in revenue and potentially did need to
 
01:40:12.229 --> 01:40:12.239 align:start position:0%
close um even with the state aid it was
 
01:40:13.709 --> 01:40:13.719 align:start position:0%
not state or federal aid it was not
 
01:40:15.589 --> 01:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
enough for them to stay open other
 
01:40:19.510 --> 01:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
businesses are thriving um and so it is
 
01:40:21.589 --> 01:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
a very different work world when you
 
01:40:24.470 --> 01:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
look at the various types of businesses
 
01:40:26.870 --> 01:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
and I think that has partially
 
01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:30.719 align:start position:0%
contributed to why we have not seen um a
 
01:40:33.750 --> 01:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
large decrease or a significant impact
 
01:40:35.870 --> 01:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
on business tax revenue that we were
 
01:40:37.830 --> 01:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
originally potentially
 
01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:39.589 align:start position:0%
originally potentially
anticipating

01:40:39.589 --> 01:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
anticipating
 
01:40:42.709 --> 01:40:42.719 align:start position:0%
um also I will note and we will talk
 
01:40:44.189 --> 01:40:44.199 align:start position:0%
more about this when we get into the
 
01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
more specific presentations many of you
 
01:40:49.030 --> 01:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
are probably familiar with our annual
 
01:40:51.790 --> 01:40:51.800 align:start position:0%
report and the triangles that show the
 
01:40:54.390 --> 01:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
number of businesses and how much money
 
01:40:57.510 --> 01:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
businesses pay the punchline from from
 
01:41:00.189 --> 01:41:00.199 align:start position:0%
those charts is that very few businesses
 
01:41:02.750 --> 01:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
pay the vast majority of Revenue to the
 
01:41:06.229 --> 01:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
state and so when you're seeing impacts
 
01:41:08.470 --> 01:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
to smaller businesses Main Street
 
01:41:10.750 --> 01:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
businesses mom and pop
 
01:41:13.350 --> 01:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
shops they definitely contribute to the
 
01:41:15.070 --> 01:41:15.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire economy and they pay
 
01:41:18.430 --> 01:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
Revenue to the state but it is um not as
 
01:41:20.990 --> 01:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
significant as some very large
 
01:41:22.790 --> 01:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
businesses that pay a very large amount
 
01:41:24.790 --> 01:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
of Revenue to the state and so when you
 
01:41:26.870 --> 01:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
see impacts to those smaller businesses
 
01:41:29.830 --> 01:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
we don't always see a direct reaction or
 
01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
a direct correlation to the revenue um
 
01:41:33.870 --> 01:41:33.880 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:41:36.510 --> 01:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
receive in terms of the future outlook
 
01:41:38.790 --> 01:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
as we've said before lifted restrictions
 
01:41:40.550 --> 01:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
the vaccine and just general Improvement
 
01:41:43.189 --> 01:41:43.199 align:start position:0%
of the economy will help business taxes
 
01:41:45.470 --> 01:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
kind of continue on this trend that
 
01:41:48.390 --> 01:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
we're seeing which has been um pretty
 
01:41:50.470 --> 01:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
consistent or has been pretty positive
 
01:41:53.350 --> 01:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
at this point point this is just a graph
 
01:41:55.470 --> 01:41:55.480 align:start position:0%
of the 10-year Trend you'll see that dip
 
01:41:58.830 --> 01:41:58.840 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 2020 fiscal year 21 plan
 
01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:20.870 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 2020 fiscal year 21 plan
is

01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:23.550 --> 01:42:23.560 align:start position:0%
year 2020 in the door and we continue to
 
01:42:28.589 --> 01:42:28.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:32.669 --> 01:42:32.679 align:start position:0%
21 I also with business taxes wanted to
 
01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
provide you kind of a visual of the
 
01:42:38.189 --> 01:42:38.199 align:start position:0%
various types of Revenue that we receive
 
01:42:39.709 --> 01:42:39.719 align:start position:0%
for business
 
01:42:42.430 --> 01:42:42.440 align:start position:0%
taxes so at the very top in the lightest
 
01:42:45.629 --> 01:42:45.639 align:start position:0%
blue are tax notices um these could be a
 
01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
result of an audit this could be a
 
01:42:50.030 --> 01:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
result of a penalty um this could be a
 
01:42:51.149 --> 01:42:51.159 align:start position:0%
return that we received received without
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
a payment we'll send you a tax notice
 
01:42:55.550 --> 01:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
and tell you that you owe us money um
 
01:42:58.350 --> 01:42:58.360 align:start position:0%
the blue color are returns so this is an
 
01:43:01.310 --> 01:43:01.320 align:start position:0%
actual return fully filled out filed
 
01:43:04.589 --> 01:43:04.599 align:start position:0%
with payment on its due date extensions
 
01:43:07.270 --> 01:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
are in the green so you do have the
 
01:43:11.189 --> 01:43:11.199 align:start position:0%
ability here in New Hampshire to um pay
 
01:43:13.709 --> 01:43:13.719 align:start position:0%
what you owe on the due date of your
 
01:43:16.149 --> 01:43:16.159 align:start position:0%
return but get an automatic seven-month
 
01:43:18.350 --> 01:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
extension to actually fill out the
 
01:43:21.310 --> 01:43:21.320 align:start position:0%
actual return with all of the numbers so
 
01:43:23.629 --> 01:43:23.639 align:start position:0%
if you're a corporation on April 15th
 
01:43:25.990 --> 01:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
you can pay us what you owe um but you
 
01:43:27.950 --> 01:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
can have an additional seven months to
 
01:43:29.589 --> 01:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
fill out all the various forms and
 
01:43:31.669 --> 01:43:31.679 align:start position:0%
schedules and submit them to us in the
 
01:43:33.270 --> 01:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
fall so that's what those extension
 
01:43:35.629 --> 01:43:35.639 align:start position:0%
payments are in the green and then in
 
01:43:38.669 --> 01:43:38.679 align:start position:0%
red the largest category are estimates
 
01:43:40.790 --> 01:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
um businesses are generally required to
 
01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
file four quarterly
 
01:43:45.189 --> 01:43:45.199 align:start position:0%
estimates um throughout the year and
 
01:43:46.950 --> 01:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
that is where the vast majority of our
 
01:43:48.750 --> 01:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue comes from and then in the
 
01:43:50.950 --> 01:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
orange below the line you will see those
 
01:43:53.390 --> 01:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
are refunds that we
 
01:43:56.910 --> 01:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
issue when you break down estimates our
 
01:44:00.709 --> 01:44:00.719 align:start position:0%
largest revenue Source into um the
 
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
various entity types here you will see
 
01:44:07.030 --> 01:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
again in the red that corporations pay
 
01:44:10.189 --> 01:44:10.199 align:start position:0%
the largest uh amount of estimates so
 
01:44:12.750 --> 01:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
our largest revenue source for business
 
01:44:15.430 --> 01:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
taxes comes largely from
 
01:44:17.270 --> 01:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
corporations um next would be
 
01:44:18.950 --> 01:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
Partnerships in the green
 
01:44:21.030 --> 01:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
proprietorships in the light blue blue
 
01:44:23.350 --> 01:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
and very small yellow fur fiduciaries
 
01:44:25.229 --> 01:44:25.239 align:start position:0%
that you can see just kind of sneaking
 
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
in there in some years so this kind of
 
01:44:28.950 --> 01:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
goes back
 
01:44:31.350 --> 01:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
to what my conversation about the
 
01:44:33.030 --> 01:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
triangles and where we see the vast
 
01:44:35.229 --> 01:44:35.239 align:start position:0%
majority of our Revenue comes in the
 
01:44:36.550 --> 01:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
form of
 
01:44:39.470 --> 01:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
estimates they are generally based off
 
01:44:41.830 --> 01:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
of the business's prior year
 
01:44:44.070 --> 01:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
performance they come in with very
 
01:44:46.109 --> 01:44:46.119 align:start position:0%
little information with them um it's
 
01:44:48.030 --> 01:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
just a number on a form and a payment
 
01:44:49.950 --> 01:44:49.960 align:start position:0%
attached to it and then those are
 
01:44:55.109 --> 01:44:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:57.109 --> 01:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
corporations this is just the last slide
 
01:44:58.870 --> 01:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
on business taxes and then I will
 
01:45:01.750 --> 01:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
certainly stop for questions um this
 
01:45:03.629 --> 01:45:03.639 align:start position:0%
just shows generally the split between
 
01:45:05.750 --> 01:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax and the
 
01:45:08.629 --> 01:45:08.639 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax um this comes
 
01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
out of the caffer and can just be
 
01:45:13.870 --> 01:45:13.880 align:start position:0%
helpful to see um how the two taxes kind
 
01:45:16.830 --> 01:45:16.840 align:start position:0%
of inter um inter workk with each other
 
01:45:19.270 --> 01:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
the bet is available as a credit against
 
01:45:24.149 --> 01:45:24.159 align:start position:0%
the BPT so if you paid $100 in bet and
 
01:45:27.470 --> 01:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
you have a $100 liability in BPT you
 
01:45:29.790 --> 01:45:29.800 align:start position:0%
would essentially use your bet to offset
 
01:45:32.070 --> 01:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
your BPT and you would make no BPT
 
01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
payment um so again this just shows um
 
01:45:38.430 --> 01:45:38.440 align:start position:0%
the trends of those taxes um over the
 
01:45:40.149 --> 01:45:40.159 align:start position:0%
past 10 years or
 
01:45:43.589 --> 01:45:43.599 align:start position:0%
so at the bottom you'll see the split um
 
01:45:46.350 --> 01:45:46.360 align:start position:0%
typically we run about 60% business
 
01:45:49.830 --> 01:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
profits tax 40% bet that does fluctuate
 
01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
year to year but the splits are shown at
 
01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:53.109 align:start position:0%
year to year but the splits are shown at
the

01:45:53.109 --> 01:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:45:56.589 --> 01:45:56.599 align:start position:0%
bottom and I am happy to pause here and
 
01:45:57.830 --> 01:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
01:45:57.840 --> 01:45:59.750 align:start position:0%
answer any
questions

01:45:59.750 --> 01:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:46:04.510 --> 01:46:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:08.550 --> 01:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you uh this last chart I've
 
01:46:12.070 --> 01:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
been saying for years that and been
 
01:46:16.750 --> 01:46:16.760 align:start position:0%
proved wrong for years that the be BP
 
01:46:22.270 --> 01:46:22.280 align:start position:0%
ratio would be varying a lot and and on
 
01:46:25.270 --> 01:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
we have there for
 
01:46:30.830 --> 01:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
2020 a lot uh much huge a very huge
 
01:46:34.189 --> 01:46:34.199 align:start position:0%
decline in the bet but not the
 
01:46:38.510 --> 01:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
BPT which is a lot smaller decline um is
 
01:46:40.709 --> 01:46:40.719 align:start position:0%
that something you'd rely on or do we
 
01:46:43.270 --> 01:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
need to continue to wait for those
 
01:46:45.669 --> 01:46:45.679 align:start position:0%
extensions from the biggest
 
01:46:48.510 --> 01:46:48.520 align:start position:0%
corporations that is a good question so
 
01:46:50.550 --> 01:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
historically the split between between
 
01:46:53.589 --> 01:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
the two taxes has been based on a
 
01:46:57.390 --> 01:46:57.400 align:start position:0%
historic analysis right so in any given
 
01:46:59.390 --> 01:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal year we're looking to the most
 
01:47:01.790 --> 01:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
recently completed tax year and we're
 
01:47:04.350 --> 01:47:04.360 align:start position:0%
splitting the revenue as it comes in
 
01:47:06.270 --> 01:47:06.280 align:start position:0%
based on the most recently completed tax
 
01:47:09.189 --> 01:47:09.199 align:start position:0%
year which is roughly two to three years
 
01:47:12.950 --> 01:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
behind recently with our new Rim system
 
01:47:16.589 --> 01:47:16.599 align:start position:0%
we're able to do a much more
 
01:47:19.669 --> 01:47:19.679 align:start position:0%
realtime um adjustment to these revenues
 
01:47:22.470 --> 01:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
or split to these revenues to reflect
 
01:47:26.310 --> 01:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
the true real time split as opposed to
 
01:47:29.830 --> 01:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
relying on the historical split so that
 
01:47:31.669 --> 01:47:31.679 align:start position:0%
is sort of what you're starting to see
 
01:47:33.629 --> 01:47:33.639 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 20 I think and it'll
 
01:47:35.550 --> 01:47:35.560 align:start position:0%
continue to be more accurate going
 
01:47:37.870 --> 01:47:37.880 align:start position:0%
forward again we won't be looking to two
 
01:47:40.149 --> 01:47:40.159 align:start position:0%
or three years ago we'll be looking to
 
01:47:42.550 --> 01:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
split the revenue as it actually comes
 
01:47:45.470 --> 01:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
in that month um and so we are working
 
01:47:49.310 --> 01:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:53.629 --> 01:47:53.639 align:start position:0%
data thank you that that would indicate
 
01:47:55.870 --> 01:47:55.880 align:start position:0%
that we've got a much the much worse
 
01:47:58.270 --> 01:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
problem with employment than with
 
01:47:59.870 --> 01:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
profits of large
 
01:48:02.229 --> 01:48:02.239 align:start position:0%
corporations which I think is pro is is
 
01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
generally consistent with kind of what
 
01:48:06.149 --> 01:48:06.159 align:start position:0%
we saw with the unemployment rate being
 
01:48:07.709 --> 01:48:07.719 align:start position:0%
high but then as we talked about there
 
01:48:09.430 --> 01:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
are a number of businesses that are
 
01:48:11.910 --> 01:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
still very profitable in this time um
 
01:48:14.070 --> 01:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
because this economic downturn is not
 
01:48:16.870 --> 01:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
impacting every business exactly the
 
01:48:18.990 --> 01:48:19.000 align:start position:0%
same representative
 
01:48:22.629 --> 01:48:22.639 align:start position:0%
Brony yes thank you commissioner um as
 
01:48:24.030 --> 01:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
you know we spent a lot of time on
 
01:48:26.310 --> 01:48:26.320 align:start position:0%
Market based sourcing and single sales
 
01:48:29.229 --> 01:48:29.239 align:start position:0%
Factor over the last couple of years and
 
01:48:31.510 --> 01:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh just for the new members too uh we
 
01:48:33.550 --> 01:48:33.560 align:start position:0%
rolled a dice to say let's go with
 
01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:34.629 align:start position:0%
rolled a dice to say let's go with
market-based

01:48:34.629 --> 01:48:34.639 align:start position:0%
market-based
 
01:48:37.310 --> 01:48:37.320 align:start position:0%
sourcing um most most States slowly but
 
01:48:38.709 --> 01:48:38.719 align:start position:0%
surely are going to have been going to
 
01:48:41.149 --> 01:48:41.159 align:start position:0%
Market based sourcing but that requires
 
01:48:44.470 --> 01:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
us to identify businesses in other
 
01:48:49.310 --> 01:48:49.320 align:start position:0%
states uh that we we can tax uh just as
 
01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
they're taxing us
 
01:48:53.550 --> 01:48:53.560 align:start position:0%
so I I guess we have given you a year
 
01:48:56.149 --> 01:48:56.159 align:start position:0%
here now another year uh because this
 
01:48:58.510 --> 01:48:58.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't really go in effect until uh the
 
01:49:03.350 --> 01:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
calendar year 2022 tax taxable year
 
01:49:06.350 --> 01:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
correct so so I guess my only question
 
01:49:10.709 --> 01:49:10.719 align:start position:0%
is have we started to uh gear up for the
 
01:49:12.310 --> 01:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
proverbial searching for these
 
01:49:14.070 --> 01:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
businesses that
 
01:49:17.790 --> 01:49:17.800 align:start position:0%
potentially uh would have to comply sure
 
01:49:19.390 --> 01:49:19.400 align:start position:0%
that's a good question so you're right
 
01:49:22.350 --> 01:49:22.360 align:start position:0%
Market based ing is taxable for taxable
 
01:49:25.470 --> 01:49:25.480 align:start position:0%
periods ending on or after December 31st
 
01:49:29.149 --> 01:49:29.159 align:start position:0%
of this year um so most of our taxpayers
 
01:49:32.350 --> 01:49:32.360 align:start position:0%
are calendar year taxpayers and so if
 
01:49:34.750 --> 01:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
they are a full calendar year then that
 
01:49:36.910 --> 01:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
change essentially was effective you
 
01:49:40.750 --> 01:49:40.760 align:start position:0%
know on one one of this year um we will
 
01:49:46.470 --> 01:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
be looking to um identify taxpayers um
 
01:49:49.709 --> 01:49:49.719 align:start position:0%
who may not be currently a taxpayer but
 
01:49:51.109 --> 01:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
under mark Market based sourcing they
 
01:49:53.229 --> 01:49:53.239 align:start position:0%
would be because again their customer is
 
01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
here um under Coster performance we were
 
01:49:57.709 --> 01:49:57.719 align:start position:0%
looking at where the service was
 
01:49:59.270 --> 01:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
actually being performed so if they were
 
01:50:02.510 --> 01:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
sitting in this state um then we knew
 
01:50:04.270 --> 01:50:04.280 align:start position:0%
that that's where the service was being
 
01:50:06.070 --> 01:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
performed so it was a little bit easier
 
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
to identify those folks um and then
 
01:50:10.310 --> 01:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
going forward we'll obviously be looking
 
01:50:12.550 --> 01:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
to potentially identify folks that are
 
01:50:14.750 --> 01:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
not currently paying tax but would be
 
01:50:17.589 --> 01:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
due to um have an obligation under
 
01:50:20.550 --> 01:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing uh unfortunately
 
01:50:22.629 --> 01:50:22.639 align:start position:0%
we didn't know this at the time um the
 
01:50:26.510 --> 01:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
global pandemic is not the ideal time to
 
01:50:28.870 --> 01:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
start sending out Auditors um looking
 
01:50:31.550 --> 01:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
for these businesses our audit activity
 
01:50:33.550 --> 01:50:33.560 align:start position:0%
um has been reduced slightly especially
 
01:50:35.629 --> 01:50:35.639 align:start position:0%
during the stay-at-home orders and now
 
01:50:37.910 --> 01:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
has transition to more of a virtual
 
01:50:41.950 --> 01:50:41.960 align:start position:0%
auditing um type experience for many
 
01:50:43.990 --> 01:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers um but obviously as
 
01:50:45.310 --> 01:50:45.320 align:start position:0%
restrictions are lifted and folks are
 
01:50:47.069 --> 01:50:47.079 align:start position:0%
able to travel more we will be
 
01:50:49.350 --> 01:50:49.360 align:start position:0%
implementing um the regular plan that we
 
01:50:50.990 --> 01:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
had to be identif ifying these
 
01:50:54.030 --> 01:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
businesses commissioner what percentage
 
01:50:58.350 --> 01:50:58.360 align:start position:0%
of the taxpayers are calendar
 
01:51:01.390 --> 01:51:01.400 align:start position:0%
years I we are probably close to
 
01:51:04.270 --> 01:51:04.280 align:start position:0%
90% of our taxpayers are on a calendar
 
01:51:04.280 --> 01:51:05.910 align:start position:0%
90% of our taxpayers are on a calendar
year

01:51:05.910 --> 01:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:51:09.270 --> 01:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
basis again that's volume and not
 
01:51:13.189 --> 01:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
dollars um obviously we have some large
 
01:51:14.910 --> 01:51:14.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that are not on a calendar
 
01:51:18.990 --> 01:51:19.000 align:start position:0%
year but um 90% of the actual taxpayers
 
01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
are calendar year which which is why we
 
01:51:22.390 --> 01:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
look to make those changes so anytime
 
01:51:24.510 --> 01:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking to you guys about making
 
01:51:26.109 --> 01:51:26.119 align:start position:0%
statutory changes we like to have it
 
01:51:27.589 --> 01:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
effective at the end of the calendar
 
01:51:30.709 --> 01:51:30.719 align:start position:0%
year um so it's very clean and easy for
 
01:51:30.719 --> 01:51:32.310 align:start position:0%
year um so it's very clean and easy for
those

01:51:32.310 --> 01:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:51:36.270 --> 01:51:36.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayers uh represented uh
 
01:51:38.510 --> 01:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
janigan thank you Mr chairman I just
 
01:51:41.790 --> 01:51:41.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to um make sure that a Something
 
01:51:43.589 --> 01:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming is true and that would be
 
01:51:46.950 --> 01:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
that um any business that received PPP
 
01:51:50.109 --> 01:51:50.119 align:start position:0%
payments or state aid of some kind all
 
01:51:52.470 --> 01:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
those all those um Aid payments are
 
01:51:55.790 --> 01:51:55.800 align:start position:0%
taxable under bet and
 
01:51:58.149 --> 01:51:58.159 align:start position:0%
BPT in general the answer to your
 
01:52:01.589 --> 01:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
question is yes we can um also talk to
 
01:52:03.589 --> 01:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
the committee about the taxability of
 
01:52:05.510 --> 01:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
state and federal aid when we come
 
01:52:07.390 --> 01:52:07.400 align:start position:0%
before you to talk about specific
 
01:52:09.350 --> 01:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates that we'll be putting
 
01:52:11.790 --> 01:52:11.800 align:start position:0%
out guidance this week for businesses so
 
01:52:14.030 --> 01:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
that they are clear about um the
 
01:52:16.189 --> 01:52:16.199 align:start position:0%
taxability of those payments but in
 
01:52:17.790 --> 01:52:17.800 align:start position:0%
general the answer to your question is
 
01:52:21.270 --> 01:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you uh Senator
 
01:52:24.390 --> 01:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
rosenwall thank you Mr chairman related
 
01:52:28.709 --> 01:52:28.719 align:start position:0%
to representative Abi's question the
 
01:52:33.109 --> 01:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
changes in which kinds of Corporations
 
01:52:37.669 --> 01:52:37.679 align:start position:0%
have done well over the past year do you
 
01:52:40.390 --> 01:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
think that will have a positive or
 
01:52:43.270 --> 01:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
negative impact on what we thought we
 
01:52:45.629 --> 01:52:45.639 align:start position:0%
would happen with market-based and
 
01:52:48.830 --> 01:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:48.840 --> 01:52:50.910 align:start position:0%
 
Factor

01:52:50.910 --> 01:52:50.920 align:start position:0%
Factor
 
01:52:56.069 --> 01:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
that's a good question I think as the
 
01:52:59.350 --> 01:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
um Returns come in in March and April
 
01:53:01.950 --> 01:53:01.960 align:start position:0%
and we're able to get better insight
 
01:53:04.910 --> 01:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
into the specific impacts for specific
 
01:53:07.270 --> 01:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
Industries we'll be able to answer that
 
01:53:11.229 --> 01:53:11.239 align:start position:0%
question um more thoroughly obviously
 
01:53:13.470 --> 01:53:13.480 align:start position:0%
there's probably not much of a change
 
01:53:16.830 --> 01:53:16.840 align:start position:0%
for you know your big box stores um in
 
01:53:18.390 --> 01:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
terms of market-based sourcing because
 
01:53:20.189 --> 01:53:20.199 align:start position:0%
they're not tan they're not service
 
01:53:22.790 --> 01:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
providers they're selling tangible goods
 
01:53:25.069 --> 01:53:25.079 align:start position:0%
um but we can certainly look into for
 
01:53:27.189 --> 01:53:27.199 align:start position:0%
those service providers what sort of
 
01:53:31.430 --> 01:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
services did well under covid and will
 
01:53:33.550 --> 01:53:33.560 align:start position:0%
the shift to market-based sourcing be a
 
01:53:35.790 --> 01:53:35.800 align:start position:0%
net positive or net negative for the
 
01:53:38.189 --> 01:53:38.199 align:start position:0%
state for those businesses you also
 
01:53:40.950 --> 01:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
bring up a good point about also taking
 
01:53:42.510 --> 01:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing and then
 
01:53:44.470 --> 01:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
transitioning that to single sales
 
01:53:46.990 --> 01:53:47.000 align:start position:0%
Factor so we've been asked on numerous
 
01:53:48.830 --> 01:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
occasions for the fiscal impact for
 
01:53:50.669 --> 01:53:50.679 align:start position:0%
single sales Factor for the change to
 
01:53:52.189 --> 01:53:52.199 align:start position:0%
single sales factor from the three
 
01:53:55.550 --> 01:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
Factor apportionment to just sales and
 
01:53:57.149 --> 01:53:57.159 align:start position:0%
the first thing we need to do is
 
01:53:58.790 --> 01:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
understand the impact of market-based
 
01:54:00.629 --> 01:54:00.639 align:start position:0%
sourcing so once we know what
 
01:54:03.189 --> 01:54:03.199 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing has done we get a
 
01:54:05.189 --> 01:54:05.199 align:start position:0%
return or two under our belt we can
 
01:54:07.189 --> 01:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
better predict what is going to happen
 
01:54:09.390 --> 01:54:09.400 align:start position:0%
with single sales Factor but having
 
01:54:11.470 --> 01:54:11.480 align:start position:0%
those two changes kind of stacked on top
 
01:54:14.510 --> 01:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
of each other um it was impossible for
 
01:54:17.310 --> 01:54:17.320 align:start position:0%
us to um determine what the revenue
 
01:54:19.790 --> 01:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
impact for single sales Factor would be
 
01:54:22.550 --> 01:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
largely due to what representative arami
 
01:54:25.550 --> 01:54:25.560 align:start position:0%
um mentioned in that there are taxpayers
 
01:54:27.390 --> 01:54:27.400 align:start position:0%
that were not taxpayers under cost of
 
01:54:29.790 --> 01:54:29.800 align:start position:0%
performance that will be taxpayers under
 
01:54:32.310 --> 01:54:32.320 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing once we have that
 
01:54:34.750 --> 01:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
data then we can do the calculation for
 
01:54:39.350 --> 01:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:41.550 --> 01:54:41.560 align:start position:0%
step okay I don't see any other
 
01:54:43.669 --> 01:54:43.679 align:start position:0%
questions now you can go into the
 
01:54:46.950 --> 01:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
historical Trends sure historic Revenue
 
01:54:48.990 --> 01:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
Trends this just takes everything I
 
01:54:50.990 --> 01:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
presented over fiscal year 11 to fiscal
 
01:54:53.470 --> 01:54:53.480 align:start position:0%
year 20 for all of the different taxes
 
01:54:55.229 --> 01:54:55.239 align:start position:0%
and just kind of puts them in one easy
 
01:54:57.629 --> 01:54:57.639 align:start position:0%
place for you to reference um you can
 
01:54:59.709 --> 01:54:59.719 align:start position:0%
see obviously business taxes at the top
 
01:55:01.790 --> 01:55:01.800 align:start position:0%
are our largest source of Revenue
 
01:55:03.709 --> 01:55:03.719 align:start position:0%
followed by the meals and rentals tax
 
01:55:05.790 --> 01:55:05.800 align:start position:0%
and then tobacco and then you can see
 
01:55:07.589 --> 01:55:07.599 align:start position:0%
the fluctuations year to year within
 
01:55:10.910 --> 01:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
those taxes so just a nice easy way to
 
01:55:12.550 --> 01:55:12.560 align:start position:0%
um see what's been happening for all of
 
01:55:16.310 --> 01:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:18.950 --> 01:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
years and then here this will be your
 
01:55:21.229 --> 01:55:21.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal year revenues to date this is
 
01:55:24.350 --> 01:55:24.360 align:start position:0%
through December from the revenue Focus
 
01:55:27.990 --> 01:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
um we do include here the the anomalous
 
01:55:31.350 --> 01:55:31.360 align:start position:0%
receivable um but you'll see generally
 
01:55:34.109 --> 01:55:34.119 align:start position:0%
with the exception of M&amp;R and CST which
 
01:55:37.030 --> 01:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
is a little bit of a timing issue um the
 
01:55:38.790 --> 01:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
taxes have been performing well even
 
01:55:41.109 --> 01:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
under covid that's uh certainly not the
 
01:55:44.149 --> 01:55:44.159 align:start position:0%
case for every state um in general
 
01:55:45.990 --> 01:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
broad-based sales taxes and broad-based
 
01:55:48.149 --> 01:55:48.159 align:start position:0%
income taxes have certainly felt more of
 
01:55:50.390 --> 01:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
an impact from covid and so New
 
01:55:52.270 --> 01:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has been slightly insulated
 
01:55:54.270 --> 01:55:54.280 align:start position:0%
from that um without having those two
 
01:55:56.950 --> 01:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
broad-based taxes you can also see in
 
01:55:59.910 --> 01:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
the last column the amount of Revenue
 
01:56:02.629 --> 01:56:02.639 align:start position:0%
that we're anticipating in the last six
 
01:56:05.790 --> 01:56:05.800 align:start position:0%
months so for interest with business for
 
01:56:08.229 --> 01:56:08.239 align:start position:0%
for instance with business
 
01:56:11.990 --> 01:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
taxes January through June we plan to
 
01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:13.189 align:start position:0%
taxes January through June we plan to
receive

01:56:13.189 --> 01:56:13.199 align:start position:0%
receive
 
01:56:15.830 --> 01:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
58.4% of the revenue for the year so
 
01:56:17.270 --> 01:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
even though we're six months through the
 
01:56:19.870 --> 01:56:19.880 align:start position:0%
year we've still received only h we've
 
01:56:22.229 --> 01:56:22.239 align:start position:0%
received less than half of the revenue
 
01:56:25.589 --> 01:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
the real one to know is indd in the last
 
01:56:26.990 --> 01:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
six months of the year we will get
 
01:56:30.830 --> 01:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
almost 75% of the revenue to date we've
 
01:56:33.669 --> 01:56:33.679 align:start position:0%
only received about 25% of the revenue
 
01:56:35.790 --> 01:56:35.800 align:start position:0%
and again that's just to help inform you
 
01:56:37.270 --> 01:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at these numbers and
 
01:56:39.390 --> 01:56:39.400 align:start position:0%
you see the difference from plan and you
 
01:56:43.189 --> 01:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
see for instance indd is 62.8% ahead of
 
01:56:46.109 --> 01:56:46.119 align:start position:0%
of plan well we still have three qus of
 
01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
the year to go and so that's 68.2 may
 
01:56:53.069 --> 01:56:53.079 align:start position:0%
not last through the final 3ars of or
 
01:56:54.510 --> 01:56:54.520 align:start position:0%
the final half of the year as we have
 
01:56:56.550 --> 01:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
three4 of percent of the revenue to come
 
01:56:58.589 --> 01:56:58.599 align:start position:0%
in again this is what Mr Cain was
 
01:57:00.430 --> 01:57:00.440 align:start position:0%
referencing just in terms of timing of
 
01:57:02.589 --> 01:57:02.599 align:start position:0%
Revenue um and so we thought it would be
 
01:57:04.589 --> 01:57:04.599 align:start position:0%
hope helpful for you to have this kind
 
01:57:06.870 --> 01:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
of allinone
 
01:57:08.750 --> 01:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
place that is
 
01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:10.750 align:start position:0%
place that is
helpful

01:57:10.750 --> 01:57:10.760 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
01:57:13.069 --> 01:57:13.079 align:start position:0%
good um lastly I'll just mention there
 
01:57:14.629 --> 01:57:14.639 align:start position:0%
are a few taxes that we administered
 
01:57:17.030 --> 01:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
that I didn't cover today um those are
 
01:57:19.430 --> 01:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid enhancement tax the nursing
 
01:57:21.990 --> 01:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
facility quality assessment the railroad
 
01:57:25.030 --> 01:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
tax the excavation tax the timber tax
 
01:57:27.790 --> 01:57:27.800 align:start position:0%
and the Statewide education property tax
 
01:57:30.550 --> 01:57:30.560 align:start position:0%
these taxes um the Medicaid enhancement
 
01:57:32.550 --> 01:57:32.560 align:start position:0%
and Nursing Facility quality assessment
 
01:57:35.589 --> 01:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
are taxes that um are restricted Revenue
 
01:57:36.830 --> 01:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
that don't flow into the general and
 
01:57:40.069 --> 01:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
education trust fund um railroad tax is
 
01:57:42.510 --> 01:57:42.520 align:start position:0%
a very small tax the excavation and
 
01:57:44.950 --> 01:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
Timber taxes we administer those taxes
 
01:57:47.910 --> 01:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
on um behalf of the municipalities so
 
01:57:50.109 --> 01:57:50.119 align:start position:0%
that is revenue um that is ultimately
 
01:57:52.709 --> 01:57:52.719 align:start position:0%
paid to the municipalities but we assist
 
01:57:55.669 --> 01:57:55.679 align:start position:0%
them given our um knowledge in sticks
 
01:57:58.390 --> 01:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
and stones and how to properly value
 
01:58:00.510 --> 01:58:00.520 align:start position:0%
those and then the State education
 
01:58:02.350 --> 01:58:02.360 align:start position:0%
property tax again is assessed at a
 
01:58:04.189 --> 01:58:04.199 align:start position:0%
state level but is collected and
 
01:58:08.390 --> 01:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:11.629 --> 01:58:11.639 align:start position:0%
level with one minute to spare I'm happy
 
01:58:13.510 --> 01:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
to answer any
 
01:58:18.310 --> 01:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:20.189 align:start position:0%
 
better

01:58:20.189 --> 01:58:20.199 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:58:22.750 --> 01:58:22.760 align:start position:0%
one minute and four and one and a half
 
01:58:27.030 --> 01:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
hours I don't there is a question from U
 
01:58:30.069 --> 01:58:30.079 align:start position:0%
representa Ames followed by
 
01:58:30.079 --> 01:58:33.390 align:start position:0%
representa Ames followed by
representative

01:58:33.390 --> 01:58:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:37.069 --> 01:58:37.079 align:start position:0%
elme okay um yeah this is really a a
 
01:58:39.910 --> 01:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
presentation question it's the anomalous
 
01:58:44.510 --> 01:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
revenues U and the subtraction or
 
01:58:47.189 --> 01:58:47.199 align:start position:0%
placement location of those anomalous
 
01:58:49.950 --> 01:58:49.960 align:start position:0%
revenues by fiscal year and so we've got
 
01:58:53.470 --> 01:58:53.480 align:start position:0%
both interest and dividends tax and
 
01:58:55.510 --> 01:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
business tax affected by these to the
 
01:59:00.030 --> 01:59:00.040 align:start position:0%
tune of $30 million or so and um I've
 
01:59:04.709 --> 01:59:04.719 align:start position:0%
seen uh um news reports that have sort
 
01:59:07.870 --> 01:59:07.880 align:start position:0%
of misunderstood the situation and they
 
01:59:10.149 --> 01:59:10.159 align:start position:0%
see us booming along here in the current
 
01:59:10.159 --> 01:59:11.069 align:start position:0%
see us booming along here in the current
fiscal

01:59:11.069 --> 01:59:11.079 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
01:59:15.470 --> 01:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
year um at a pace that in fact is $30
 
01:59:18.149 --> 01:59:18.159 align:start position:0%
million lower than what they're seeing
 
01:59:21.030 --> 01:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
and uh I just wonder you know what your
 
01:59:25.870 --> 01:59:25.880 align:start position:0%
thoughts are about sort of um helping
 
01:59:28.430 --> 01:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
people understand the the reality of
 
01:59:30.589 --> 01:59:30.599 align:start position:0%
this situation not losing track of the
 
01:59:32.870 --> 01:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
fact that oh you've got to subtract $30
 
01:59:39.069 --> 01:59:39.079 align:start position:0%
million than good point sure so um it's
 
01:59:41.750 --> 01:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a comparison of apples
 
01:59:48.390 --> 01:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
and oranges so that 30.8 million is not
 
01:59:53.830 --> 01:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
included in fiscal year 20 cash basis
 
01:59:57.990 --> 01:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
Revenue it is included in fiscal year
 
02:00:01.030 --> 02:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
20 um audited Revenue that's in the
 
02:00:03.669 --> 02:00:03.679 align:start position:0%
cafer because it is part of the auditing
 
02:00:07.470 --> 02:00:07.480 align:start position:0%
adjustment it is also included in fiscal
 
02:00:11.189 --> 02:00:11.199 align:start position:0%
year 21 cash re Cash basis Revenue so
 
02:00:13.270 --> 02:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year 21 revenue reports that
 
02:00:15.709 --> 02:00:15.719 align:start position:0%
you're receiving it is included in there
 
02:00:18.350 --> 02:00:18.360 align:start position:0%
because it did come in the door in
 
02:00:19.709 --> 02:00:19.719 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
02:00:22.750 --> 02:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
it was late fiscal year 20 Revenue but
 
02:00:25.550 --> 02:00:25.560 align:start position:0%
it was received in fiscal year
 
02:00:29.310 --> 02:00:29.320 align:start position:0%
21 when we get to the fiscal year 21
 
02:00:32.310 --> 02:00:32.320 align:start position:0%
cafer it will be removed from the cash
 
02:00:36.390 --> 02:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
basis and so you can look Cash basis to
 
02:00:40.669 --> 02:00:40.679 align:start position:0%
cash bases you can look cafer to caffer
 
02:00:43.149 --> 02:00:43.159 align:start position:0%
but when you look between Cash basis and
 
02:00:46.149 --> 02:00:46.159 align:start position:0%
caffer it's apples and oranges and
 
02:00:48.910 --> 02:00:48.920 align:start position:0%
that's where it can get confusing so
 
02:00:51.149 --> 02:00:51.159 align:start position:0%
what what we are going to do when we
 
02:00:53.950 --> 02:00:53.960 align:start position:0%
present Revenue estimates to you is
 
02:00:55.990 --> 02:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to include it in fiscal year
 
02:00:58.390 --> 02:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
21 Cash basis because that's how the
 
02:01:00.990 --> 02:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
revenue focus is reported and that's how
 
02:01:03.790 --> 02:01:03.800 align:start position:0%
the comparison to plan will work but
 
02:01:07.350 --> 02:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
when we look to fiscal year 21 being the
 
02:01:11.510 --> 02:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
base for which we're going to apply
 
02:01:14.589 --> 02:01:14.599 align:start position:0%
percentage changes growth or decline for
 
02:01:18.390 --> 02:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal years 22 23 we're going to remove
 
02:01:22.069 --> 02:01:22.079 align:start position:0%
that anomaly Revenue because it is not
 
02:01:24.669 --> 02:01:24.679 align:start position:0%
anticipated to continue to come in in
 
02:01:27.470 --> 02:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
that way every year so we'll do fiscal
 
02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:28.270 align:start position:0%
that way every year so we'll do fiscal
year

02:01:28.270 --> 02:01:28.280 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:01:32.350 --> 02:01:32.360 align:start position:0%
21 Cash basis we will remove the
 
02:01:35.709 --> 02:01:35.719 align:start position:0%
anomalous receivable and then we'll Pro
 
02:01:37.750 --> 02:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
apply our growth rates for fiscal year
 
02:01:40.790 --> 02:01:40.800 align:start position:0%
22 and 23 and again when we come before
 
02:01:42.629 --> 02:01:42.639 align:start position:0%
the committee um to do those
 
02:01:44.589 --> 02:01:44.599 align:start position:0%
presentations we'll certainly spend some
 
02:01:46.750 --> 02:01:46.760 align:start position:0%
more time on that um and make sure that
 
02:01:49.189 --> 02:01:49.199 align:start position:0%
everyone's comfortable um but it really
 
02:01:51.430 --> 02:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
comes down to the difference between
 
02:01:53.870 --> 02:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
looking at a cash basis report and an
 
02:01:57.629 --> 02:01:57.639 align:start position:0%
acrel or caffer report and historically
 
02:02:00.629 --> 02:02:00.639 align:start position:0%
this has not been a significant um
 
02:02:04.030 --> 02:02:04.040 align:start position:0%
adjustment because the amount of Revenue
 
02:02:06.390 --> 02:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
that we receive in July and August that
 
02:02:09.470 --> 02:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
we pull into the prior year is has been
 
02:02:12.149 --> 02:02:12.159 align:start position:0%
very consistent year-to year it's just
 
02:02:13.790 --> 02:02:13.800 align:start position:0%
because of this anomaly which is why
 
02:02:15.870 --> 02:02:15.880 align:start position:0%
we're calling an anomalous receivable
 
02:02:17.790 --> 02:02:17.800 align:start position:0%
it's just because of this this one year
 
02:02:19.950 --> 02:02:19.960 align:start position:0%
with the extension with Co
 
02:02:22.109 --> 02:02:22.119 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing the inconsistency year
 
02:02:25.030 --> 02:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
to year okay we have two more
 
02:02:29.430 --> 02:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
presentation but I have two hands up and
 
02:02:31.950 --> 02:02:31.960 align:start position:0%
one question from each and if you could
 
02:02:34.510 --> 02:02:34.520 align:start position:0%
say your question very quickly for a
 
02:02:37.390 --> 02:02:37.400 align:start position:0%
quick response would appreciate it
 
02:02:38.870 --> 02:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
represent elmy
 
02:02:43.069 --> 02:02:43.079 align:start position:0%
first okay uh I'll try um there is one
 
02:02:45.510 --> 02:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
thing missing from other taxes Dr
 
02:02:48.069 --> 02:02:48.079 align:start position:0%
administers that I think the public does
 
02:02:50.669 --> 02:02:50.679 align:start position:0%
not understand very well you are the
 
02:02:53.709 --> 02:02:53.719 align:start position:0%
guarantors for the entire property tax
 
02:02:56.430 --> 02:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
of the State of New Hampshire and what
 
02:03:01.589 --> 02:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
that means is that you have to to check
 
02:03:04.350 --> 02:03:04.360 align:start position:0%
the assessment methods of and the
 
02:03:08.270 --> 02:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
budgets of all of the entities below the
 
02:03:13.030 --> 02:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
state and uh see what they're um whether
 
02:03:14.910 --> 02:03:14.920 align:start position:0%
they have problems with them and then
 
02:03:17.030 --> 02:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
calculate the rates
 
02:03:22.390 --> 02:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
for for Town County School District
 
02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:23.350 align:start position:0%
for for Town County School District
water

02:03:23.350 --> 02:03:23.360 align:start position:0%
water
 
02:03:26.709 --> 02:03:26.719 align:start position:0%
district and send them to each town to
 
02:03:31.149 --> 02:03:31.159 align:start position:0%
be used so um there's there's quite a
 
02:03:34.270 --> 02:03:34.280 align:start position:0%
lot of confusion I think in in how the
 
02:03:36.950 --> 02:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
property tax ends up being what it is in
 
02:03:39.470 --> 02:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of people's minds and I just
 
02:03:41.830 --> 02:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to point that out thank
 
02:03:46.270 --> 02:03:46.280 align:start position:0%
you a great Point um we have done some
 
02:03:49.030 --> 02:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
um press in the past trying to educate
 
02:03:51.870 --> 02:03:51.880 align:start position:0%
folks about um our role with property
 
02:03:54.950 --> 02:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
taxes and how their property tax bill
 
02:03:56.910 --> 02:03:56.920 align:start position:0%
comes to be and we can certainly
 
02:03:58.950 --> 02:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
continue to do that um to make sure
 
02:04:01.669 --> 02:04:01.679 align:start position:0%
folks are well aware okay representative
 
02:04:03.910 --> 02:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
Bry I'll be real quick uh thanks
 
02:04:07.069 --> 02:04:07.079 align:start position:0%
commissioner thanks nor um when it comes
 
02:04:10.030 --> 02:04:10.040 align:start position:0%
to the the school building Aid uh Debt
 
02:04:12.629 --> 02:04:12.639 align:start position:0%
Service for M&amp;R and the $5 million
 
02:04:14.910 --> 02:04:14.920 align:start position:0%
transfer affordable housing
 
02:04:17.750 --> 02:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
fund if I had my brothers I'd like us to
 
02:04:21.629 --> 02:04:21.639 align:start position:0%
predict predict revenue on top and then
 
02:04:24.510 --> 02:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
subtract those but when we compare
 
02:04:26.069 --> 02:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
Revenue year to year I think it was
 
02:04:28.629 --> 02:04:28.639 align:start position:0%
cleaner if we just said this is how much
 
02:04:31.589 --> 02:04:31.599 align:start position:0%
room and meals revenue is and how much
 
02:04:35.069 --> 02:04:35.079 align:start position:0%
rent it is before we start subtracting
 
02:04:37.149 --> 02:04:37.159 align:start position:0%
to to me the bilding aid and The Debt
 
02:04:39.950 --> 02:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
Service are uh billing Aid Debt Service
 
02:04:42.030 --> 02:04:42.040 align:start position:0%
and the uh affordable housing fund
 
02:04:44.629 --> 02:04:44.639 align:start position:0%
transfer with more spending issues than
 
02:04:47.350 --> 02:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
than what we're collecting on Revenue so
 
02:04:49.069 --> 02:04:49.079 align:start position:0%
I I I don't want to take up time here
 
02:04:51.390 --> 02:04:51.400 align:start position:0%
but I think next week maybe Mike Kane
 
02:04:53.149 --> 02:04:53.159 align:start position:0%
and uh Chris Shay can also weigh in on
 
02:04:55.350 --> 02:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
this how do we want to display those
 
02:04:56.750 --> 02:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
things when we start doing our Revenue
 
02:04:58.229 --> 02:04:58.239 align:start position:0%
estimates I just wanted to put that on
 
02:05:00.149 --> 02:05:00.159 align:start position:0%
the table for next week sure that's a
 
02:05:01.510 --> 02:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
great point the other thing I would add
 
02:05:04.390 --> 02:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
to that list is lchip which is right
 
02:05:06.910 --> 02:05:06.920 align:start position:0%
lchip great great that comes out out of
 
02:05:10.470 --> 02:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
R every month so great this is something
 
02:05:12.629 --> 02:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
that's been bothering me the last couple
 
02:05:16.270 --> 02:05:16.280 align:start position:0%
years revenue is my my my vote but let's
 
02:05:19.549 --> 02:05:19.559 align:start position:0%

02:08:43.679 --> 02:08:45.669 align:start position:0%
program see if I can change the layout
here

02:08:45.669 --> 02:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:08:48.669 --> 02:08:48.679 align:start position:0%

inform policy makers uh regarding the
 
02:09:32.549 --> 02:09:32.559 align:start position:0%
financial impact of various policy
 
02:09:35.189 --> 02:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
initiatives uh for example we developed

02:09:41.270 --> 02:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
bonding
 
02:09:43.470 --> 02:09:43.480 align:start position:0%
authorizations and we do not advocate
 
02:09:45.709 --> 02:09:45.719 align:start position:0%
for or against
 
02:09:48.990 --> 02:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
legislation also due to my position uh
 
02:09:52.109 --> 02:09:52.119 align:start position:0%
I'm um I am an ex official member of
 
02:09:54.790 --> 02:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
several statutory boards and commissions
 
02:09:56.270 --> 02:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
um such as the New Hampshire retirement
 
02:09:58.790 --> 02:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
system business Finance Authority New
 
02:10:05.229 --> 02:10:05.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:07.629 --> 02:10:07.639 align:start position:0%
others so moving on to cash and
 
02:10:07.639 --> 02:10:08.790 align:start position:0%
others so moving on to cash and
investment

02:10:08.790 --> 02:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
investment
 
02:10:12.629 --> 02:10:12.639 align:start position:0%
activities um our office is responsible
 
02:10:14.589 --> 02:10:14.599 align:start position:0%
for the daily administration of um
 
02:10:17.629 --> 02:10:17.639 align:start position:0%
between 200 and 700 plus million in cash
 
02:10:20.149 --> 02:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
although in year 19 in the beginning of
 
02:10:24.270 --> 02:10:24.280 align:start position:0%
20 um we reached um about 900 million in
 
02:10:27.069 --> 02:10:27.079 align:start position:0%
our cash position and we've also had the
 
02:10:29.229 --> 02:10:29.239 align:start position:0%
um the custody and the management of the
 
02:10:32.750 --> 02:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
1.25 billion that we uh uh from the
 
02:10:34.310 --> 02:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
Caris money that we received from the
 
02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:35.910 align:start position:0%
Caris money that we received from the
federal

02:10:35.910 --> 02:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
federal
 
02:10:39.109 --> 02:10:39.119 align:start position:0%
government so we perform a variety of um
 
02:10:41.350 --> 02:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
cash management activities we we perform
 
02:10:44.390 --> 02:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
cash flow forecasting liquidity reviews
 
02:10:47.149 --> 02:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
we collect and concentrate the um agency
 
02:10:50.069 --> 02:10:50.079 align:start position:0%
bank deposit deposits we monitor
 
02:10:52.589 --> 02:10:52.599 align:start position:0%
dispersements all the payment um payment
 
02:10:54.910 --> 02:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
files and paper checks go through my
 
02:10:58.270 --> 02:10:58.280 align:start position:0%
office um we respond to numerous agency
 
02:11:01.109 --> 02:11:01.119 align:start position:0%
um payment inquiries and we reconcile
 
02:11:04.709 --> 02:11:04.719 align:start position:0%
approximately 80 bank and investment
 
02:11:08.830 --> 02:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
accounts so once we're able to um pay um
 
02:11:11.069 --> 02:11:11.079 align:start position:0%
our vendors and our payroll and the
 
02:11:13.589 --> 02:11:13.599 align:start position:0%
various State programs and we pay for
 
02:11:16.229 --> 02:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
our banking services uh either through
 
02:11:18.629 --> 02:11:18.639 align:start position:0%
direct charges or via compens stated
 
02:11:21.870 --> 02:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
balance balance balance Arrangements um
 
02:11:23.589 --> 02:11:23.599 align:start position:0%
especially now with the low interest
 
02:11:25.149 --> 02:11:25.159 align:start position:0%
rate environment we we want to make sure
 
02:11:27.109 --> 02:11:27.119 align:start position:0%
we have enough interest to pay for the
 
02:11:30.069 --> 02:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
banking services um so if we have excess
 
02:11:32.430 --> 02:11:32.440 align:start position:0%
liquidity we invest them in authorized
 
02:11:34.910 --> 02:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
short-term Investments uh typically
 
02:11:37.149 --> 02:11:37.159 align:start position:0%
money market accounts uh any interest
 
02:11:37.159 --> 02:11:38.950 align:start position:0%
money market accounts uh any interest
buring

02:11:38.950 --> 02:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
buring
 
02:11:41.589 --> 02:11:41.599 align:start position:0%
accounts so our investment policy
 
02:11:44.350 --> 02:11:44.360 align:start position:0%
dictate us to prare the value and safety
 
02:11:46.549 --> 02:11:46.559 align:start position:0%
of the principle provide sufficient
 
02:11:48.629 --> 02:11:48.639 align:start position:0%
liquidity for the State Financial
 
02:11:51.470 --> 02:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
Financial operations and optimize the
 
02:11:56.629 --> 02:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:58.950 --> 02:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
return um so a few more points I would
 
02:12:02.990 --> 02:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
like to mention um we um nearly all cash
 
02:12:05.589 --> 02:12:05.599 align:start position:0%
receip by the treasury is pulled uh to
 
02:12:08.669 --> 02:12:08.679 align:start position:0%
fund cash operations all taxes fees
 
02:12:10.629 --> 02:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
assessments aid from the federal
 
02:12:13.669 --> 02:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
government including dedicated funds are
 
02:12:17.270 --> 02:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
all what we call Pool cash so funds are
 
02:12:18.990 --> 02:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
segregated in the state's accounting
 
02:12:21.390 --> 02:12:21.400 align:start position:0%
system for proper financial reporting
 
02:12:23.430 --> 02:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
but we do not hold dedicated funds
 
02:12:26.229 --> 02:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
separately except for uh approximately
 
02:12:29.109 --> 02:12:29.119 align:start position:0%
50 trust in custodial accounts that we
 
02:12:32.430 --> 02:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
have for that we do have um those funds
 
02:12:34.109 --> 02:12:34.119 align:start position:0%
in separate
 
02:12:38.189 --> 02:12:38.199 align:start position:0%
custody so with all of that um I'm
 
02:12:40.109 --> 02:12:40.119 align:start position:0%
pleased to say that the state currently
 
02:12:43.870 --> 02:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
has uh sufficient liquidity but um is
 
02:12:45.990 --> 02:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
this the cash is not is not as robust as
 
02:12:48.709 --> 02:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
it was prior to the covid-19 pandemic
 
02:12:51.229 --> 02:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
so we need to continue monitor um a
 
02:12:54.830 --> 02:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
revenues um we need to continue monitor
 
02:12:57.109 --> 02:12:57.119 align:start position:0%
the revenues as they come in and and
 
02:12:59.950 --> 02:12:59.960 align:start position:0%
also how the state uh manages these
 
02:13:02.390 --> 02:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
expenditures um in order to ensure
 
02:13:05.270 --> 02:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
adequate liquidity so it will all depend
 
02:13:08.109 --> 02:13:08.119 align:start position:0%
of how um again how revenues continue to
 
02:13:12.149 --> 02:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
come in and um you know how the expense
 
02:13:14.350 --> 02:13:14.360 align:start position:0%
how the states manag and expenditures in
 
02:13:16.950 --> 02:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
order for us to go back to prepandemic
 
02:13:16.960 --> 02:13:21.109 align:start position:0%
order for us to go back to prepandemic
levels

02:13:21.109 --> 02:13:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:25.870 --> 02:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:28.229 --> 02:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
mention uh one thing I meant to mention
 
02:13:31.549 --> 02:13:31.559 align:start position:0%
is um our interest earnings um
 
02:13:33.149 --> 02:13:33.159 align:start position:0%
unfortunately were not anticipated to
 
02:13:35.629 --> 02:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
receive some um interest earnings uh
 
02:13:38.149 --> 02:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
over the next fiscal years uh due to the
 
02:13:42.830 --> 02:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:46.189 --> 02:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
environment so the good news is that um
 
02:13:48.189 --> 02:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
we have a healthy the state has has a
 
02:13:51.270 --> 02:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
healthy uh Reserve account uh we have 1
 
02:13:53.470 --> 02:13:53.480 align:start position:0%
15.5 million in the revenue
 
02:13:55.910 --> 02:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
stabilization account uh or the rainy
 
02:14:00.950 --> 02:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
day fund so RSA 9 col 13- provides uh
 
02:14:04.669 --> 02:14:04.679 align:start position:0%
the framework on how to use this fund so
 
02:14:07.350 --> 02:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
subject to limitations any the Surplus
 
02:14:09.270 --> 02:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
at the end of the fiscal
 
02:14:13.069 --> 02:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
bium uh is transferred into this account
 
02:14:15.510 --> 02:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
the maximum allowable um in the account
 
02:14:17.470 --> 02:14:17.480 align:start position:0%
is 10% of unresisted general fund
 
02:14:17.480 --> 02:14:18.709 align:start position:0%
is 10% of unresisted general fund
revenues

02:14:18.709 --> 02:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
02:14:21.470 --> 02:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
of of the last fiscal year of the PRI
 
02:14:25.629 --> 02:14:25.639 align:start position:0%
Anum So currently the cap is 162.5
 
02:14:28.910 --> 02:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
million and again in fiscal year 20 uh
 
02:14:33.270 --> 02:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
the balance um was still as 1 15.5
 
02:14:36.669 --> 02:14:36.679 align:start position:0%
million which is 7% of fiscal year uh 19
 
02:14:38.310 --> 02:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
02:14:41.709 --> 02:14:41.719 align:start position:0%
revenues so transfers out of the fund
 
02:14:44.390 --> 02:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
are permitted if two conditions are met
 
02:14:46.430 --> 02:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
one is the budget deficit a budget
 
02:14:48.830 --> 02:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
deficit needs to occur uh of for the
 
02:14:51.870 --> 02:14:51.880 align:start position:0%
most recently completed B Anum and at
 
02:14:54.030 --> 02:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
restrict general fund uh operation
 
02:14:57.270 --> 02:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
revenues um we need to fall short of the
 
02:14:59.669 --> 02:14:59.679 align:start position:0%
budgeted amount the amount to be
 
02:15:01.549 --> 02:15:01.559 align:start position:0%
transferred is the lesser of the budget
 
02:15:03.270 --> 02:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
deficit of the revenue
 
02:15:06.149 --> 02:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
shortfall and of course this this um the
 
02:15:08.149 --> 02:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
procedure for that is that the
 
02:15:10.109 --> 02:15:10.119 align:start position:0%
controller will have to notify uh and
 
02:15:12.430 --> 02:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
request approval of the fiscal committee
 
02:15:13.549 --> 02:15:13.559 align:start position:0%
and the
 
02:15:17.270 --> 02:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
governor so transfers uh other than uh
 
02:15:19.270 --> 02:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
for those purposes require approval of
 
02:15:23.910 --> 02:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
the governor and 2third of each
 
02:15:26.589 --> 02:15:26.599 align:start position:0%
chamber so um on this Slide the last
 
02:15:28.189 --> 02:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
point I would like to make is that the
 
02:15:31.189 --> 02:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
rating agencies will like us to reach um
 
02:15:33.390 --> 02:15:33.400 align:start position:0%
the maximum allowable balance in the
 
02:15:37.310 --> 02:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund and that is um really to
 
02:15:41.350 --> 02:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
be prepared for an economic downturn in
 
02:15:43.270 --> 02:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
um you know like the one we're dealing
 
02:15:46.790 --> 02:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:46.800 --> 02:15:49.310 align:start position:0%
 
now

02:15:49.310 --> 02:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:15:52.669 --> 02:15:52.679 align:start position:0%
so that brings us um to how we finished
 
02:15:54.629 --> 02:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
the year fiscal year
 
02:15:57.750 --> 02:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
20 um I'm including in this in this
 
02:15:59.629 --> 02:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
slide I'm including a chart that comes
 
02:16:04.589 --> 02:16:04.599 align:start position:0%
from the uh the last caffer and um my
 
02:16:08.030 --> 02:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
intention my intention is to highlight
 
02:16:10.830 --> 02:16:10.840 align:start position:0%
really the um the bottom part of this
 
02:16:13.629 --> 02:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
table is the undesignated fund balance
 
02:16:18.310 --> 02:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
as of June 30 2020 so this table um
 
02:16:20.629 --> 02:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
is providing us with the unrestricted
 
02:16:22.910 --> 02:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
revenue for the year um the
 
02:16:25.510 --> 02:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
Appropriations against those against
 
02:16:29.270 --> 02:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
those revenues um some lapses generated
 
02:16:34.429 --> 02:16:34.439 align:start position:0%
and again um the the end result um uh in
 
02:16:37.150 --> 02:16:37.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20 was a negative
 
02:16:37.160 --> 02:16:39.070 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20 was a negative
51.2

02:16:39.070 --> 02:16:39.080 align:start position:0%
51.2
 
02:16:42.790 --> 02:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
million um so again my intention is just
 
02:16:44.389 --> 02:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
simply to highlight how we finished the
 
02:16:47.830 --> 02:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
year and and um also this table shows
 
02:16:51.070 --> 02:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
the um the end result of the education
 
02:16:55.429 --> 02:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
trust fund um and obviously the reserves
 
02:16:57.629 --> 02:16:57.639 align:start position:0%
that we have uh which is in the the
 
02:17:00.830 --> 02:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund so um all of this is a
 
02:17:03.309 --> 02:17:03.319 align:start position:0%
result of uh you know a massive effort
 
02:17:07.270 --> 02:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh to control the pandemic um all these
 
02:17:09.070 --> 02:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
efforts to stimulate the economy to
 
02:17:11.469 --> 02:17:11.479 align:start position:0%
provide relief to those who needed it
 
02:17:13.429 --> 02:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
along with some Cost Containment efforts
 
02:17:15.750 --> 02:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
instituted by the governor uh during the
 
02:17:18.110 --> 02:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
year and we still finished the year
 
02:17:19.709 --> 02:17:19.719 align:start position:0%
uh with this
 
02:17:22.589 --> 02:17:22.599 align:start position:0%
deficit um so because the state uh
 
02:17:24.549 --> 02:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't craft a by annual budget the
 
02:17:26.790 --> 02:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
state didn't have to do anything um at
 
02:17:30.349 --> 02:17:30.359 align:start position:0%
this point um of the banum so then now
 
02:17:32.950 --> 02:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
the challenge is going to be um again to
 
02:17:36.429 --> 02:17:36.439 align:start position:0%
monitor revenues um to monitor
 
02:17:39.549 --> 02:17:39.559 align:start position:0%
expenditures and um the legislature will
 
02:17:41.629 --> 02:17:41.639 align:start position:0%
have to cons you know we have to work on
 
02:17:44.509 --> 02:17:44.519 align:start position:0%
drafting a a a new balanced budget for
 
02:17:48.389 --> 02:17:48.399 align:start position:0%
the upcoming bium and also
 
02:17:51.230 --> 02:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
address a potential deficit um at the
 
02:17:53.429 --> 02:17:53.439 align:start position:0%
end of the
 
02:17:56.389 --> 02:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
biannual so fortunately the state has a
 
02:17:58.669 --> 02:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
as as I mentioned before has a healthy
 
02:18:01.270 --> 02:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
uh rainy day fund uh that could be used
 
02:18:04.230 --> 02:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
to address a potential deficit uh but
 
02:18:05.429 --> 02:18:05.439 align:start position:0%
something I would like to highlight
 
02:18:08.270 --> 02:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
again is is importance the importance of
 
02:18:11.389 --> 02:18:11.399 align:start position:0%
maintaining a um you know the reserve
 
02:18:14.910 --> 02:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
account and to build a backup um in
 
02:18:17.990 --> 02:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
order to respond to uh fiscal needs
 
02:18:25.030 --> 02:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:30.830 --> 02:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:33.270 --> 02:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
management so the state treasurer is
 
02:18:35.709 --> 02:18:35.719 align:start position:0%
responsible for administering 1.1
 
02:18:37.790 --> 02:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
billion in bonds outstanding as of June
 
02:18:37.800 --> 02:18:38.750 align:start position:0%
billion in bonds outstanding as of June
30

02:18:38.750 --> 02:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
30
 
02:18:43.790 --> 02:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
2020 uh 741 million um is um are in
 
02:18:46.549 --> 02:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
general obligation bonds that borrowing
 
02:18:48.509 --> 02:18:48.519 align:start position:0%
is backed but the f faith and credit of
 
02:18:53.669 --> 02:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
the state 70% of that um of that debt is
 
02:18:55.830 --> 02:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
paid from unrestricted general fund
 
02:18:59.230 --> 02:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
revenues and we use those Bond proceeds
 
02:19:01.070 --> 02:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
uh to pay Capital Improvements and
 
02:19:01.080 --> 02:19:02.910 align:start position:0%
uh to pay Capital Improvements and
infrastructure

02:19:02.910 --> 02:19:02.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
02:19:05.110 --> 02:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
projects uh the bonds are typically
 
02:19:07.070 --> 02:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
issued um the material of those bonds
 
02:19:10.429 --> 02:19:10.439 align:start position:0%
are 20 years and we T typically pay uh
 
02:19:13.110 --> 02:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
60% of principle under in the first 10
 
02:19:16.669 --> 02:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
years and uh the other 40% in the last
 
02:19:18.870 --> 02:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh 10 years
 
02:19:22.669 --> 02:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
we also have um 296 million in Turnpike
 
02:19:24.549 --> 02:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
revenue bonds and those and that
 
02:19:28.190 --> 02:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
Services pay from uh Turnpike re Revenue
 
02:19:31.309 --> 02:19:31.319 align:start position:0%
um ter the turnpike toll
 
02:19:34.150 --> 02:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
revenues uh also we have the 91 million
 
02:19:36.190 --> 02:19:36.200 align:start position:0%
of Grant anticipation revenue bonds or
 
02:19:38.990 --> 02:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
the garv bonds and that Deb Services
 
02:19:41.309 --> 02:19:41.319 align:start position:0%
supported by the revenue we reive from
 
02:19:43.270 --> 02:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
the feral Highway
 
02:19:46.910 --> 02:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
Administration as of June 30 uh 2020 we
 
02:19:49.710 --> 02:19:49.720 align:start position:0%
we have bonds authorized in an issued of
 
02:19:53.950 --> 02:19:53.960 align:start position:0%
660 million and 234 million of that were
 
02:19:56.110 --> 02:19:56.120 align:start position:0%
for geo
 
02:19:59.670 --> 02:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
bonds so uh we perform a v variety of
 
02:20:01.590 --> 02:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
debt management activities we monitor
 
02:20:04.950 --> 02:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
compliance with the IRS and the msrb
 
02:20:04.960 --> 02:20:08.150 align:start position:0%
compliance with the IRS and the msrb
regulations

02:20:08.150 --> 02:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:11.630 --> 02:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
um um we um in in you know as part of
 
02:20:17.910 --> 02:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
that process we uh we um uh prepare our
 
02:20:22.550 --> 02:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
voluntary and uh required uh dis Bond
 
02:20:25.190 --> 02:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
disclosures uh we also track Capital
 
02:20:27.990 --> 02:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
expenditures um uh in order to know how
 
02:20:32.510 --> 02:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
much we need to um borrow and also uh to
 
02:20:35.070 --> 02:20:35.080 align:start position:0%
um to see how if if we're spending the
 
02:20:37.030 --> 02:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
bond proceeds within the time allowed
 
02:20:41.270 --> 02:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
especially for tax accept uh Bond issues
 
02:20:46.309 --> 02:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
and um lastly we pay um all the debt
 
02:20:46.319 --> 02:20:50.389 align:start position:0%
and um lastly we pay um all the debt
service

02:20:50.389 --> 02:20:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:52.469 --> 02:20:52.479 align:start position:0%
so the uh the borrowing costs are
 
02:20:55.429 --> 02:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
largely issued uh are largely influenced
 
02:20:57.950 --> 02:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
uh by the state credit rating uh we work
 
02:21:00.349 --> 02:21:00.359 align:start position:0%
closely with the rating agencies uh when
 
02:21:02.110 --> 02:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
they evaluate the state's Financial
 
02:21:05.150 --> 02:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
condition and the oper results uh the
 
02:21:08.670 --> 02:21:08.680 align:start position:0%
rating agencies uh typically focus on uh
 
02:21:12.469 --> 02:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
on key points and key aspects and um the
 
02:21:15.990 --> 02:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
main ones are um the Rainy D rainy day
 
02:21:18.790 --> 02:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
fund balance uh whether the state has a
 
02:21:18.800 --> 02:21:20.150 align:start position:0%
fund balance uh whether the state has a
balanced

02:21:20.150 --> 02:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
balanced
 
02:21:23.910 --> 02:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
budget they also look at um Medicaid
 
02:21:25.670 --> 02:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
pension and post-employment benefit
 
02:21:28.150 --> 02:21:28.160 align:start position:0%
liabilities and funding levels and
 
02:21:31.910 --> 02:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's to uh to see if um if if if those
 
02:21:35.230 --> 02:21:35.240 align:start position:0%
if those liabilities could um create
 
02:21:38.710 --> 02:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
additional burden um fiscal burden uh to
 
02:21:38.720 --> 02:21:39.429 align:start position:0%
additional burden um fiscal burden uh to
the

02:21:39.429 --> 02:21:39.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:21:42.070 --> 02:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
state they also consider the stability
 
02:21:44.830 --> 02:21:44.840 align:start position:0%
and diversity of Revenue sources and
 
02:21:46.429 --> 02:21:46.439 align:start position:0%
they also appreciate legislative
 
02:21:48.190 --> 02:21:48.200 align:start position:0%
flexibility to manage revenues
 
02:21:51.230 --> 02:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:54.870 --> 02:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
reserves so we receive uh ratings uh uh
 
02:21:59.830 --> 02:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
from moodies uh fit and S&amp;P Global um uh
 
02:22:03.110 --> 02:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
moodies uh assigns the state a aa1 um
 
02:22:04.630 --> 02:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
with an estable
 
02:22:08.070 --> 02:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
Outlook uh fit uh gives the state uh a
 
02:22:10.910 --> 02:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
doublea plus within a stable Outlook and
 
02:22:14.070 --> 02:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
S&amp;P Global um gives the state uh a
 
02:22:18.230 --> 02:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
doublea um we a stable out loot so in
 
02:22:19.830 --> 02:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
this couple of slides I'm including a
 
02:22:21.870 --> 02:22:21.880 align:start position:0%
few quotes uh from the rating agencies
 
02:22:24.190 --> 02:22:24.200 align:start position:0%
that I would like to just uh read to you
 
02:22:26.270 --> 02:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
some of the positives and and a few of
 
02:22:29.270 --> 02:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
the notaso positives so uh for example
 
02:22:31.030 --> 02:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
Moody says that New Hampshire has a
 
02:22:34.110 --> 02:22:34.120 align:start position:0%
sound economy strong governance and low
 
02:22:36.190 --> 02:22:36.200 align:start position:0%
debt and pension
 
02:22:38.830 --> 02:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
burden before the Corona virus induced
 
02:22:41.750 --> 02:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
recession rapid economic growth um
 
02:22:44.190 --> 02:22:44.200 align:start position:0%
yielded strong Revenue performance which
 
02:22:46.110 --> 02:22:46.120 align:start position:0%
in turn bolstered uh the state's
 
02:22:47.750 --> 02:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
available reserves and and rainy day
 
02:22:51.630 --> 02:22:51.640 align:start position:0%
fund following years of narrow balances
 
02:22:53.710 --> 02:22:53.720 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire has relatively high
 
02:22:57.830 --> 02:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
wealth levels and a br a broad uh stable
 
02:23:00.190 --> 02:23:00.200 align:start position:0%
tax base which has helped maintain low
 
02:23:03.469 --> 02:23:03.479 align:start position:0%
Deb burden the state's robust governance
 
02:23:05.230 --> 02:23:05.240 align:start position:0%
and fiscal management are likely to
 
02:23:08.309 --> 02:23:08.319 align:start position:0%
provide sufficient responses to these
 
02:23:10.950 --> 02:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
challenges and then not so POS they not
 
02:23:13.870 --> 02:23:13.880 align:start position:0%
so positives are um New Hampshire has
 
02:23:16.030 --> 02:23:16.040 align:start position:0%
the population dynamics of New Hampshire
 
02:23:18.070 --> 02:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
could yield economic pressure over the
 
02:23:20.230 --> 02:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
medium term in high post-employment
 
02:23:22.230 --> 02:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
benefits and rise in Medicaid costs May
 
02:23:25.190 --> 02:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
yield budgetary
 
02:23:28.349 --> 02:23:28.359 align:start position:0%
pressures so along those those lines uh
 
02:23:30.910 --> 02:23:30.920 align:start position:0%
fit has similar comments uh lower
 
02:23:32.510 --> 02:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
liabilities and strong ability to
 
02:23:36.630 --> 02:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
control is budget um both in terms of um
 
02:23:38.510 --> 02:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
revenues and
 
02:23:40.349 --> 02:23:40.359 align:start position:0%
expenditures uh New Hampshire is a
 
02:23:41.830 --> 02:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
prosperous state that has shifted
 
02:23:45.110 --> 02:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
rapidly from manufacturing to services
 
02:23:46.830 --> 02:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
and small government and low spending
 
02:23:49.309 --> 02:23:49.319 align:start position:0%
are characteristic of this
 
02:23:52.469 --> 02:23:52.479 align:start position:0%
state uh S&amp;P Global U has similar
 
02:23:54.309 --> 02:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
comments uh New Hampshire has
 
02:23:55.790 --> 02:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
established record op proactive
 
02:23:57.870 --> 02:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
financial and budget management
 
02:24:00.830 --> 02:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
including timely budget adjustments low
 
02:24:03.150 --> 02:24:03.160 align:start position:0%
management overall debt burden relative
 
02:24:05.670 --> 02:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
peers coupled with rapid
 
02:24:07.870 --> 02:24:07.880 align:start position:0%
ammortization um the rainy day fund
 
02:24:10.190 --> 02:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
Reserve levels while improved over the
 
02:24:13.150 --> 02:24:13.160 align:start position:0%
past two banum but remain well below the
 
02:24:16.550 --> 02:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
state's 10% maximum funding policy and
 
02:24:19.910 --> 02:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
that's what I meant by uh what ra rating
 
02:24:22.309 --> 02:24:22.319 align:start position:0%
agencies would like to see us increase
 
02:24:24.510 --> 02:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
the levels and the rainy day
 
02:24:27.510 --> 02:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
fund so overall many positive comments
 
02:24:29.269 --> 02:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
uh from the rating agencies and that's
 
02:24:32.550 --> 02:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
what drives um the ratings that we we we
 
02:24:35.750 --> 02:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
receive and and again the borrow and the
 
02:24:39.309 --> 02:24:39.319 align:start position:0%
the borrowing cost um that we that we're
 
02:24:41.590 --> 02:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
able to
 
02:24:46.309 --> 02:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
obtain um so the last the last page um
 
02:24:47.950 --> 02:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
of my presentation ation here is I'm
 
02:24:50.309 --> 02:24:50.319 align:start position:0%
including a link to some of the
 
02:24:53.349 --> 02:24:53.359 align:start position:0%
Publications that we post um to our
 
02:24:56.309 --> 02:24:56.319 align:start position:0%
website I'm including here the treasure
 
02:24:58.269 --> 02:24:58.279 align:start position:0%
dashboard as many of you know my
 
02:25:01.389 --> 02:25:01.399 align:start position:0%
predecessor created this dashboard and I
 
02:25:03.429 --> 02:25:03.439 align:start position:0%
continue to update this dashboard on a
 
02:25:06.389 --> 02:25:06.399 align:start position:0%
monthly basis and uh this s board
 
02:25:09.070 --> 02:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
captures uh key metrics that we
 
02:25:11.950 --> 02:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
track which you may find helpful we
 
02:25:14.830 --> 02:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
track uh we track uh our liquidity our
 
02:25:18.590 --> 02:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
bonds outstanding we also track uh the
 
02:25:21.429 --> 02:25:21.439 align:start position:0%
status of our abandoned property claims
 
02:25:25.110 --> 02:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
um our key debt metrics um and um our
 
02:25:27.349 --> 02:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
credit rating and how we compare to
 
02:25:30.550 --> 02:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
other states uh and the last uh chart in
 
02:25:34.309 --> 02:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
this dashboard shows our boring cost and
 
02:25:37.269 --> 02:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
um I recently updated this this table
 
02:25:40.469 --> 02:25:40.479 align:start position:0%
and it shows um how we did um in our
 
02:25:43.630 --> 02:25:43.640 align:start position:0%
last Bor issue uh so we obtained a yield
 
02:25:48.950 --> 02:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
of 1.5 87% which is the lowest we've had
 
02:25:53.870 --> 02:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:56.590 --> 02:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
2009 and that concludes my presentation
 
02:25:58.510 --> 02:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
I know I went uh pretty quickly but I
 
02:26:00.830 --> 02:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
will be happy to answer any questions
 
02:26:04.030 --> 02:26:04.040 align:start position:0%
you may have yeah Monica let me ask the
 
02:26:07.309 --> 02:26:07.319 align:start position:0%
first question how does our state
 
02:26:10.309 --> 02:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
compared to other states where we have
 
02:26:15.790 --> 02:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
to have 10% of our funds in the rainy
 
02:26:15.800 --> 02:26:17.309 align:start position:0%
to have 10% of our funds in the rainy
day

02:26:17.309 --> 02:26:17.319 align:start position:0%
day
 
02:26:21.590 --> 02:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
other states I hear some of them are 5%
 
02:26:24.870 --> 02:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
goals can you explain
 
02:26:28.110 --> 02:26:28.120 align:start position:0%
why yeah so I I I I don't have U
 
02:26:30.670 --> 02:26:30.680 align:start position:0%
particular details on on the states but
 
02:26:32.469 --> 02:26:32.479 align:start position:0%
but I but certainly there are many
 
02:26:35.590 --> 02:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
states that have uh uh rainy uh large
 
02:26:39.389 --> 02:26:39.399 align:start position:0%
rainy day funds and um um many of the
 
02:26:43.910 --> 02:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
states um receive higher better ratings
 
02:26:46.870 --> 02:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
from the rating agencies um so I can
 
02:26:48.590 --> 02:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
provide you some more details on that
 
02:26:50.630 --> 02:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
again I I don't have I I know it goes
 
02:26:53.030 --> 02:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
across the Spectrum um there are states
 
02:26:57.070 --> 02:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
many states that have um um more income
 
02:26:59.510 --> 02:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
sales tax uh income tax they they tend
 
02:27:03.150 --> 02:27:03.160 align:start position:0%
to uh fund those levels um you know
 
02:27:06.469 --> 02:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
higher level um but New Hampshire at
 
02:27:08.230 --> 02:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
this point has uh you know again has
 
02:27:10.750 --> 02:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
been praised uh for how we've been able
 
02:27:12.790 --> 02:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
to uh fund a rainy day
 
02:27:15.590 --> 02:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
fund again and the point of this is is
 
02:27:17.670 --> 02:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
really to you know perhaps the same may
 
02:27:22.469 --> 02:27:22.479 align:start position:0%
need to um utilize that um that tool at
 
02:27:25.070 --> 02:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
the end of the fiscal bium so the R
 
02:27:26.830 --> 02:27:26.840 align:start position:0%
rating agencies will like us to be able
 
02:27:30.830 --> 02:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
to um you know um increase those funding
 
02:27:34.030 --> 02:27:34.040 align:start position:0%
levels so we're able to uh um you know
 
02:27:37.550 --> 02:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
we're able to uh respond to fiscal needs
 
02:27:40.950 --> 02:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
and also uh current economic downturn
 
02:27:44.469 --> 02:27:44.479 align:start position:0%
and and potential future um you know
 
02:27:47.150 --> 02:27:47.160 align:start position:0%
budget pressures and and again future
 
02:27:49.630 --> 02:27:49.640 align:start position:0%
economic downturns so so does it boil
 
02:27:51.950 --> 02:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
down to if you're a
 
02:27:55.190 --> 02:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
broad-based tax state the percentage
 
02:27:57.910 --> 02:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
would be closer to 5% if you're not a
 
02:28:02.910 --> 02:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
broad-based tax state then there require
 
02:28:06.429 --> 02:28:06.439 align:start position:0%
10% you no I so so the so the limit is
 
02:28:08.990 --> 02:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
really our limit is is is establish in
 
02:28:11.630 --> 02:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
statute so again I'm not familiar with
 
02:28:13.030 --> 02:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
you know the other structures in other
 
02:28:15.070 --> 02:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
states but I can certainly try to um
 
02:28:17.230 --> 02:28:17.240 align:start position:0%
research that for you and provide some
 
02:28:20.790 --> 02:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
with some information um but I think
 
02:28:22.830 --> 02:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
it's just it's just um you know the
 
02:28:26.190 --> 02:28:26.200 align:start position:0%
concept of having um sufficient
 
02:28:29.870 --> 02:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
reserves um in order to um you know if
 
02:28:32.630 --> 02:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
if there are um and again the ability
 
02:28:34.750 --> 02:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
for other states to use reserves are
 
02:28:36.110 --> 02:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
different than in New Hampshire in New
 
02:28:38.750 --> 02:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire were limited to uh the results
 
02:28:40.790 --> 02:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
of the bium and other places they're
 
02:28:44.070 --> 02:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
able to reach into those reserves um and
 
02:28:46.830 --> 02:28:46.840 align:start position:0%
so in in this day we we can't until the
 
02:28:49.150 --> 02:28:49.160 align:start position:0%
the bium ends and that's when the state
 
02:28:51.750 --> 02:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
can take action so again I think it's a
 
02:28:54.429 --> 02:28:54.439 align:start position:0%
variety of um
 
02:28:57.110 --> 02:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
um I think this different states have
 
02:29:00.190 --> 02:29:00.200 align:start position:0%
different methods of how to address this
 
02:29:03.309 --> 02:29:03.319 align:start position:0%
um and and again I I will I I'll try to
 
02:29:04.870 --> 02:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
provide you with some more information
 
02:29:08.110 --> 02:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
of how um all the states um have their
 
02:29:10.710 --> 02:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
structure we have a four people with
 
02:29:15.389 --> 02:29:15.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:18.510 --> 02:29:18.520 align:start position:0%
Aly yeah you want to unmute yourself
 
02:29:20.510 --> 02:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:29:23.910 --> 02:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh SNP seem particularly concerned with
 
02:29:26.190 --> 02:29:26.200 align:start position:0%
us not having reached the maximum we're
 
02:29:28.590 --> 02:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
only 13 million or something like that
 
02:29:31.230 --> 02:29:31.240 align:start position:0%
below it which seem makes it a little
 
02:29:33.750 --> 02:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
odd they're doing that but I am
 
02:29:37.030 --> 02:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
wondering do other states only put the
 
02:29:41.190 --> 02:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund on one of their their
 
02:29:44.750 --> 02:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
funds on their general fund because we
 
02:29:48.030 --> 02:29:48.040 align:start position:0%
only have it on the general fund
 
02:29:51.670 --> 02:29:51.680 align:start position:0%
itself and not the education trust fund
 
02:29:54.469 --> 02:29:54.479 align:start position:0%
which the general fund has to support if
 
02:29:55.750 --> 02:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
it has
 
02:29:58.190 --> 02:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
problems and um then there are
 
02:30:01.550 --> 02:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
Transportation funds and and there's the
 
02:30:03.510 --> 02:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
whole question of the local property tax
 
02:30:06.389 --> 02:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:08.950 --> 02:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
this yeah again that's a great question
 
02:30:11.150 --> 02:30:11.160 align:start position:0%
I don't think I have the details um you
 
02:30:15.070 --> 02:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
know how the states have this structure
 
02:30:18.190 --> 02:30:18.200 align:start position:0%
um we do have we do have uh you know our
 
02:30:21.349 --> 02:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
mechanism is is is part of the general
 
02:30:21.359 --> 02:30:23.030 align:start position:0%
mechanism is is is part of the general
fund

02:30:23.030 --> 02:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:30:26.030 --> 02:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
um in in it really is is designed to
 
02:30:27.870 --> 02:30:27.880 align:start position:0%
provide that relief for you know
 
02:30:31.030 --> 02:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
potential fiscal deficit or when there
 
02:30:34.269 --> 02:30:34.279 align:start position:0%
are Revenue shortfalls um but again I'll
 
02:30:36.710 --> 02:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
be happy to look into to to look into
 
02:30:39.950 --> 02:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
how the states um you know handle their
 
02:30:44.269 --> 02:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund a little more um I know
 
02:30:47.150 --> 02:30:47.160 align:start position:0%
um the the rating agency
 
02:30:49.550 --> 02:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
um you know when when when we were
 
02:30:53.030 --> 02:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
talking to them um this last fall um you
 
02:30:54.950 --> 02:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
know they were pleased to know that we
 
02:30:57.110 --> 02:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
have not been able to we we haven't had
 
02:30:59.429 --> 02:30:59.439 align:start position:0%
the need to to touch the r fund so we
 
02:31:01.429 --> 02:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
haven't really had the need to do a
 
02:31:03.830 --> 02:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
short and borrowing even though we've
 
02:31:07.230 --> 02:31:07.240 align:start position:0%
you know they saw that we had a a
 
02:31:11.550 --> 02:31:11.560 align:start position:0%
projected um a deficit uh so again they
 
02:31:14.070 --> 02:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
know that we can uh tap into that rainy
 
02:31:16.830 --> 02:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
day fund to take care of that um deficit
 
02:31:18.830 --> 02:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
if there is a need if we end up with a
 
02:31:22.150 --> 02:31:22.160 align:start position:0%
deficit um and so so the concept of
 
02:31:25.110 --> 02:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
having this Reserve fund um it is it is
 
02:31:27.830 --> 02:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
very important um just like you know in
 
02:31:30.070 --> 02:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
our personal lives um you know it's good
 
02:31:32.710 --> 02:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
to have that Reserve um Reserve fund uh
 
02:31:36.990 --> 02:31:37.000 align:start position:0%
for uh for uh any um you know
 
02:31:39.830 --> 02:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
emergencies and and and and that type of
 
02:31:42.910 --> 02:31:42.920 align:start position:0%
thing um so so the concept is is really
 
02:31:42.920 --> 02:31:43.830 align:start position:0%
thing um so so the concept is is really
that

02:31:43.830 --> 02:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:31:46.830 --> 02:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
in um but again I'll be happy to to do
 
02:31:50.910 --> 02:31:50.920 align:start position:0%
that and um so so S&amp;P
 
02:31:53.870 --> 02:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
um um like the idea that the state has
 
02:31:56.950 --> 02:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
been able to increase uh the rainy day
 
02:31:59.510 --> 02:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
fund and that's why they as part of what
 
02:32:01.469 --> 02:32:01.479 align:start position:0%
they think is if if if the state
 
02:32:04.830 --> 02:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
continues to um you know review the the
 
02:32:07.349 --> 02:32:07.359 align:start position:0%
levels of rainy day fund even if they're
 
02:32:10.510 --> 02:32:10.520 align:start position:0%
need to be used uh for this bium but if
 
02:32:13.030 --> 02:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
the state focuses on um you know
 
02:32:15.950 --> 02:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
building that back up um one of the one
 
02:32:17.790 --> 02:32:17.800 align:start position:0%
of the comments that they made is that
 
02:32:19.670 --> 02:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
you know they will consider a a
 
02:32:23.110 --> 02:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
potential upgrade um in our rating so
 
02:32:25.830 --> 02:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
it's all about how they how they see how
 
02:32:27.990 --> 02:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to be able to meet and and
 
02:32:31.070 --> 02:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
and respond to Future um fiscal
 
02:32:33.070 --> 02:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
pressures and economic downturn so
 
02:32:35.590 --> 02:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
that's really the concept is that
 
02:32:38.910 --> 02:32:38.920 align:start position:0%
representative tuer has a has a question
 
02:32:41.150 --> 02:32:41.160 align:start position:0%
yes you're um It's a Wonderful
 
02:32:43.670 --> 02:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
presentation I'm delayed that you have
 
02:32:47.110 --> 02:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
given so much time to talking about Bond
 
02:32:50.389 --> 02:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
ratings and your predecessor had very
 
02:32:53.429 --> 02:32:53.439 align:start position:0%
strong feelings about where he wanted to
 
02:32:57.269 --> 02:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
see the state go so they would pay lower
 
02:33:00.710 --> 02:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
interest and generally you know present
 
02:33:02.429 --> 02:33:02.439 align:start position:0%
itself to businesses who were thinking
 
02:33:05.150 --> 02:33:05.160 align:start position:0%
of moving here and so forth as a strong
 
02:33:08.550 --> 02:33:08.560 align:start position:0%
economy and a strong background do you
 
02:33:12.990 --> 02:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
have a goal of a particular Bond rating
 
02:33:15.710 --> 02:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
and comments that you'd like to see from
 
02:33:19.230 --> 02:33:19.240 align:start position:0%
will'll say S&amp;P Global he had a very
 
02:33:22.110 --> 02:33:22.120 align:start position:0%
clear picture of what he'd like to see
 
02:33:24.590 --> 02:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
and I wondered whether you followed in
 
02:33:24.600 --> 02:33:26.790 align:start position:0%
and I wondered whether you followed in
his

02:33:26.790 --> 02:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
his
 
02:33:28.790 --> 02:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
footsteps thank you for the question I
 
02:33:31.830 --> 02:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
will do my best to follow his footsteps
 
02:33:35.510 --> 02:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
um so really is is a um it is a it is a
 
02:33:38.469 --> 02:33:38.479 align:start position:0%
team effort here um you know to be able
 
02:33:38.479 --> 02:33:39.630 align:start position:0%
team effort here um you know to be able
to

02:33:39.630 --> 02:33:39.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:33:43.190 --> 02:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
um uh to reach you know to be able to
 
02:33:45.630 --> 02:33:45.640 align:start position:0%
improve our ratings it really is a an
 
02:33:48.590 --> 02:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
enormous effort and uh the state has has
 
02:33:50.710 --> 02:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
a the state has done a tremendous job
 
02:33:53.950 --> 02:33:53.960 align:start position:0%
this year um again trying to stimulate
 
02:33:56.990 --> 02:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
the economy uh providing relief to those
 
02:33:59.510 --> 02:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh who needed it and um you know with
 
02:34:02.510 --> 02:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
the cares funding how um the governor
 
02:34:04.389 --> 02:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
and the various task force and some of
 
02:34:06.429 --> 02:34:06.439 align:start position:0%
the legislators participated in in in
 
02:34:08.670 --> 02:34:08.680 align:start position:0%
that work and how the funds were
 
02:34:11.269 --> 02:34:11.279 align:start position:0%
targeted to you know to really provide
 
02:34:13.990 --> 02:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
that relief to those needed and and so
 
02:34:16.309 --> 02:34:16.319 align:start position:0%
with all of that is is is you know the
 
02:34:17.870 --> 02:34:17.880 align:start position:0%
the goal is really to continue
 
02:34:20.150 --> 02:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
stimulating this economy so we can
 
02:34:23.510 --> 02:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
provide uh again the better the economy
 
02:34:25.550 --> 02:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
the revenues will continue to come in
 
02:34:27.830 --> 02:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
stronger um you know we wouldn't need to
 
02:34:29.590 --> 02:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
be worried about adjusting our
 
02:34:31.710 --> 02:34:31.720 align:start position:0%
expenditures we will be able to meet
 
02:34:34.429 --> 02:34:34.439 align:start position:0%
those expenditures so it really is that
 
02:34:37.070 --> 02:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
ability to continue with this overall
 
02:34:39.349 --> 02:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
effort um you know one of the positives
 
02:34:42.790 --> 02:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
that Hamshire has had this year is is is
 
02:34:46.950 --> 02:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
is the the the tax structure how um you
 
02:34:49.990 --> 02:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
know by the way the state has their
 
02:34:52.670 --> 02:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
taxes is is not really focused on an
 
02:34:54.990 --> 02:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
income tax or a sales taxes just the way
 
02:34:57.550 --> 02:34:57.560 align:start position:0%
it was designed and that is providing
 
02:35:00.150 --> 02:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
that ability to for some to perform
 
02:35:01.950 --> 02:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
really well and the ones that are not
 
02:35:04.710 --> 02:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
performing that well uh well at least is
 
02:35:07.349 --> 02:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
those funds are being compensated so my
 
02:35:09.950 --> 02:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
goal is absolutely to to keep working
 
02:35:11.750 --> 02:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
and to try to communicate to the rating
 
02:35:14.230 --> 02:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
agencies how we you know how the state
 
02:35:16.469 --> 02:35:16.479 align:start position:0%
continues to respond to all of this
 
02:35:19.150 --> 02:35:19.160 align:start position:0%
pressures and all of these um uh
 
02:35:21.950 --> 02:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
challenges that um you know we have as a
 
02:35:24.269 --> 02:35:24.279 align:start position:0%
state and all states have um you know
 
02:35:26.750 --> 02:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
obviously that's the same challenge but
 
02:35:30.469 --> 02:35:30.479 align:start position:0%
um I I have to say um this last fall
 
02:35:32.870 --> 02:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
when it was my my first time uh trying
 
02:35:36.790 --> 02:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
to sell bonds and and I I was um working
 
02:35:40.830 --> 02:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
with a a a team of um State experts you
 
02:35:46.030 --> 02:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
know uh folks from HHS folks from um uh
 
02:35:48.590 --> 02:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
Retirement Systems all of us talking
 
02:35:50.990 --> 02:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
together to talk about you know how the
 
02:35:53.230 --> 02:35:53.240 align:start position:0%
state really is performing and how well
 
02:35:55.870 --> 02:35:55.880 align:start position:0%
the state has been doing and uh it
 
02:35:59.070 --> 02:35:59.080 align:start position:0%
really paid off because um the rating
 
02:36:02.550 --> 02:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
agencies affirmed the rates that we had
 
02:36:06.070 --> 02:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
and um and and so that is great news
 
02:36:07.990 --> 02:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
some of the states were downgraded this
 
02:36:10.429 --> 02:36:10.439 align:start position:0%
year because because of you know a
 
02:36:14.110 --> 02:36:14.120 align:start position:0%
variety of reasons um New York and and
 
02:36:16.870 --> 02:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
other places were impacted and and and
 
02:36:19.269 --> 02:36:19.279 align:start position:0%
we were not and so again it was a it was
 
02:36:22.630 --> 02:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
a very good story to tell and um and
 
02:36:24.469 --> 02:36:24.479 align:start position:0%
it's just again it's it's just something
 
02:36:28.469 --> 02:36:28.479 align:start position:0%
that we we need to continue and um okay
 
02:36:31.389 --> 02:36:31.399 align:start position:0%
we have two more questions thank
 
02:36:34.990 --> 02:36:35.000 align:start position:0%
you brahney followed by Senator Daniels
 
02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.110 align:start position:0%
you brahney followed by Senator Daniels
representative

02:36:37.110 --> 02:36:37.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:36:40.910 --> 02:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
brahney nice presentation Monica um you
 
02:36:43.190 --> 02:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
know in the early years of uh me being
 
02:36:44.990 --> 02:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
on ways and means I tracked the unfunded
 
02:36:46.590 --> 02:36:46.600 align:start position:0%
pension liability
 
02:36:49.190 --> 02:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
pretty much every year I've kind of not
 
02:36:51.469 --> 02:36:51.479 align:start position:0%
done that in a while and in the old days
 
02:36:53.190 --> 02:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
it was the sixth highest adjusted for
 
02:36:54.150 --> 02:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
size of the
 
02:36:56.870 --> 02:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
State uh and that's why it was like in
 
02:36:59.950 --> 02:36:59.960 align:start position:0%
the range of five billion is what our
 
02:37:02.670 --> 02:37:02.680 align:start position:0%
funded unfunded liability was then I I
 
02:37:04.110 --> 02:37:04.120 align:start position:0%
was surprised to see that Moody said we
 
02:37:05.750 --> 02:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
had a low pension
 
02:37:05.760 --> 02:37:07.670 align:start position:0%
had a low pension
burden

02:37:07.670 --> 02:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
burden
 
02:37:10.469 --> 02:37:10.479 align:start position:0%
um can you kind of reconcile that has
 
02:37:12.349 --> 02:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
things gotten any better that I miss
 
02:37:14.630 --> 02:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
something or I guess compared to other
 
02:37:16.309 --> 02:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
states they must think we're where look
 
02:37:17.590 --> 02:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
really good in this area because I know
 
02:37:21.150 --> 02:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of states have big big big uh uh
 
02:37:23.030 --> 02:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
dollar-wise function uh pension
 
02:37:26.150 --> 02:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
liabilities but again not too long ago
 
02:37:27.990 --> 02:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
even our state was ranked six in terms
 
02:37:30.469 --> 02:37:30.479 align:start position:0%
of the when you adjust for the size of
 
02:37:32.750 --> 02:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
of a problem so can you just address
 
02:37:34.070 --> 02:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
that real
 
02:37:36.670 --> 02:37:36.680 align:start position:0%
quick yes I think you um you know again
 
02:37:38.230 --> 02:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I think you
 
02:37:40.110 --> 02:37:40.120 align:start position:0%
you you said it right I think
 
02:37:44.309 --> 02:37:44.319 align:start position:0%
overall um you know the state has a um I
 
02:37:45.830 --> 02:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
guess it's in a better position than
 
02:37:48.469 --> 02:37:48.479 align:start position:0%
other states we do have um as I
 
02:37:50.950 --> 02:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned before they do worry about the
 
02:37:54.150 --> 02:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
funding levels so the especially the um
 
02:37:56.469 --> 02:37:56.479 align:start position:0%
uh the post-employment benefits um that
 
02:37:58.070 --> 02:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
is something that the state doesn't have
 
02:38:00.750 --> 02:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
a separate trust doesn't pay as you go
 
02:38:04.150 --> 02:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
bases so for those those liabilities um
 
02:38:06.830 --> 02:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
the rating agencies um you know they
 
02:38:08.510 --> 02:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
keep mentioning they they worry about
 
02:38:11.469 --> 02:38:11.479 align:start position:0%
that but overall the state has a a low
 
02:38:15.190 --> 02:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
debt burden um also they praise New
 
02:38:17.269 --> 02:38:17.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you know again for for our
 
02:38:20.389 --> 02:38:20.399 align:start position:0%
debt levels in terms of our um our
 
02:38:22.790 --> 02:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
general obligation bonds we we do not
 
02:38:25.710 --> 02:38:25.720 align:start position:0%
borrow as much our our our our debt is
 
02:38:27.990 --> 02:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
low compared to other states um I mean
 
02:38:30.510 --> 02:38:30.520 align:start position:0%
we just went out and we issued 47
 
02:38:32.590 --> 02:38:32.600 align:start position:0%
million in bonds and we do it once a
 
02:38:36.030 --> 02:38:36.040 align:start position:0%
year um other states um there were large
 
02:38:38.349 --> 02:38:38.359 align:start position:0%
issues uh in the fall from other states
 
02:38:41.469 --> 02:38:41.479 align:start position:0%
so overall again we we just uh we just
 
02:38:44.309 --> 02:38:44.319 align:start position:0%
have a um a lower debt burden that
 
02:38:46.550 --> 02:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
compared to other states so so and and
 
02:38:48.469 --> 02:38:48.479 align:start position:0%
you're right the the U the pension
 
02:38:52.030 --> 02:38:52.040 align:start position:0%
liability um is is is something that you
 
02:38:54.230 --> 02:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
know the state will have to uh continue
 
02:38:57.870 --> 02:38:57.880 align:start position:0%
to to work on and one of the positives
 
02:39:00.990 --> 02:39:01.000 align:start position:0%
that they saw this last time is um the
 
02:39:03.269 --> 02:39:03.279 align:start position:0%
retirement the Board of Trustees lower
 
02:39:06.510 --> 02:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
the expect expected rate of return and
 
02:39:09.190 --> 02:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
that typically is a sign that you know
 
02:39:11.510 --> 02:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
when you do that um even though there
 
02:39:13.230 --> 02:39:13.240 align:start position:0%
will be higher contributions in the
 
02:39:15.830 --> 02:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
beginning but that is an attempt to try
 
02:39:19.790 --> 02:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
to address those funding levels um uh
 
02:39:21.870 --> 02:39:21.880 align:start position:0%
rather than not addressing them so so I
 
02:39:23.670 --> 02:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
think that's part of that comment is is
 
02:39:26.950 --> 02:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
really how the state keeps positioning
 
02:39:29.590 --> 02:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
um better every time and and so again
 
02:39:31.590 --> 02:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
compared to other states uh we earn a
 
02:39:33.790 --> 02:39:33.800 align:start position:0%
better decision okay the last question
 
02:39:36.670 --> 02:39:36.680 align:start position:0%
from Senator Daniels thank you Mr
 
02:39:39.030 --> 02:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
chairman are there any benefits to New
 
02:39:42.429 --> 02:39:42.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in building the rainy day fund
 
02:39:45.230 --> 02:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
to a level higher than the threshold is
 
02:39:45.240 --> 02:39:48.110 align:start position:0%
to a level higher than the threshold is
currently

02:39:48.110 --> 02:39:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:50.590 --> 02:39:50.600 align:start position:0%
said yeah that's that's a great question
 
02:39:53.710 --> 02:39:53.720 align:start position:0%
it really is um you know it really is a
 
02:39:57.590 --> 02:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
difficult question to answer because
 
02:40:00.309 --> 02:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
um building the rainy day fund to the
 
02:40:02.790 --> 02:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
highest level uh perhaps will give us a
 
02:40:06.150 --> 02:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
better rating um but at the same time um
 
02:40:07.349 --> 02:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
you know that is a challenge for
 
02:40:10.389 --> 02:40:10.399 align:start position:0%
legislators really for policy makers um
 
02:40:11.750 --> 02:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
you know do you really put all your
 
02:40:13.790 --> 02:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
money into this savings account
 
02:40:15.870 --> 02:40:15.880 align:start position:0%
essentially or do you really want to
 
02:40:19.309 --> 02:40:19.319 align:start position:0%
spend your funds and um and and and and
 
02:40:21.790 --> 02:40:21.800 align:start position:0%
programs um that are needed and and
 
02:40:23.469 --> 02:40:23.479 align:start position:0%
invest in you know a variety of
 
02:40:25.790 --> 02:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
communities and and all of those policy
 
02:40:28.870 --> 02:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
initiatives that you know legislators
 
02:40:31.150 --> 02:40:31.160 align:start position:0%
and and and perhaps the governor will
 
02:40:33.309 --> 02:40:33.319 align:start position:0%
have and so that is that is a challenge
 
02:40:35.510 --> 02:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
that really is a a challenge and and is
 
02:40:37.469 --> 02:40:37.479 align:start position:0%
a good question uh I think it's a
 
02:40:40.510 --> 02:40:40.520 align:start position:0%
balancing act um again trying to uh
 
02:40:43.510 --> 02:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
maximize our savings and our reserves uh
 
02:40:44.950 --> 02:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
at the same time trying to meet the
 
02:40:47.110 --> 02:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
obligations of the state so I know for
 
02:40:49.630 --> 02:40:49.640 align:start position:0%
example my predecessor uh used to say
 
02:40:51.830 --> 02:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
directly to the rating agencies um you
 
02:40:53.670 --> 02:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
know this is the challenge and and and
 
02:40:55.630 --> 02:40:55.640 align:start position:0%
and the state is doing a great job
 
02:40:58.590 --> 02:40:58.600 align:start position:0%
providing some Aid to municipalities and
 
02:41:00.670 --> 02:41:00.680 align:start position:0%
and and providing some more you know
 
02:41:02.550 --> 02:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
assistance with infrastructure and all
 
02:41:05.990 --> 02:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
of those um programs that the state has
 
02:41:08.870 --> 02:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
done over the last few years um but at
 
02:41:11.190 --> 02:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
the same time obviously um you know
 
02:41:13.110 --> 02:41:13.120 align:start position:0%
increasing the balance in the r the
 
02:41:14.910 --> 02:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
levels in the ring the funds is
 
02:41:17.670 --> 02:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
important it's especially again you know
 
02:41:19.990 --> 02:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
in a year like this one in a time like
 
02:41:21.910 --> 02:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
this one we do want to have some
 
02:41:24.870 --> 02:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
reserves in order to meet those
 
02:41:27.429 --> 02:41:27.439 align:start position:0%
obligations well thank you Monica for

Department of Business and economic

Affairs is really sort of I think
 
02:43:55.750 --> 02:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
developed over the last couple of years
 
02:43:59.269 --> 02:43:59.279 align:start position:0%
now as uh Mr chairman uh recognized now
 
02:44:01.670 --> 02:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
we're coming up to four years of that
 
02:44:03.910 --> 02:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
and really we're becoming I think above
 
02:44:05.710 --> 02:44:05.720 align:start position:0%
all else kind of a One-Stop
 
02:44:07.990 --> 02:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
functionality for our business Community
 
02:44:10.269 --> 02:44:10.279 align:start position:0%
but also in working with other
 
02:44:12.950 --> 02:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
departments and other agencies and uh
 
02:44:14.910 --> 02:44:14.920 align:start position:0%
collaborating on business expansion
 
02:44:17.590 --> 02:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
efforts and initiatives of of the like
 
02:44:19.469 --> 02:44:19.479 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to talk about those at any
 
02:44:20.910 --> 02:44:20.920 align:start position:0%
point but a good example of course would
 
02:44:23.469 --> 02:44:23.479 align:start position:0%
be on the workforce side and the uh the
 
02:44:25.870 --> 02:44:25.880 align:start position:0%
developing relationship that we've uh
 
02:44:28.030 --> 02:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
really engaged in with the New Hampshire
 
02:44:29.830 --> 02:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
employment services who I know you're
 
02:44:32.950 --> 02:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
hearing from later today uh especially
 
02:44:34.630 --> 02:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
over the course of the last couple of
 
02:44:36.950 --> 02:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
months uh but we do all of the state's
 
02:44:39.190 --> 02:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
business uh recruitment uh we work with
 
02:44:40.230 --> 02:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
companies that want to come to New
 
02:44:41.469 --> 02:44:41.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire companies that are in New
 
02:44:44.309 --> 02:44:44.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that seek to expand uh a lot
 
02:44:45.950 --> 02:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
of the work that we do in our travel and
 
02:44:47.990 --> 02:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
tourism industry side we're increasingly
 
02:44:50.950 --> 02:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
using as well uh to help butus those
 
02:44:54.230 --> 02:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
recruitment efforts um even talking
 
02:44:57.190 --> 02:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
about Workforce recruitment uh as is is
 
02:44:58.790 --> 02:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
a big issue as we just heard about with
 
02:45:01.870 --> 02:45:01.880 align:start position:0%
Monica and uh and student recruitment is
 
02:45:03.150 --> 02:45:03.160 align:start position:0%
another area where we've been working
 
02:45:06.190 --> 02:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
with our University system and others uh
 
02:45:07.910 --> 02:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
to uh to bring those students to New
 
02:45:09.510 --> 02:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and hopefully sell them on the
 
02:45:10.830 --> 02:45:10.840 align:start position:0%
idea of staying here and working here
 
02:45:13.269 --> 02:45:13.279 align:start position:0%
over a period of time uh the last piece
 
02:45:15.590 --> 02:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
that we also manage is the States
 
02:45:17.670 --> 02:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
international relations and and trade
 
02:45:19.990 --> 02:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
and Export work so we have a division at
 
02:45:22.309 --> 02:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
the office of international Commerce
 
02:45:23.910 --> 02:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
that does a lot of that activity and
 
02:45:26.110 --> 02:45:26.120 align:start position:0%
that has actually been a reasonably um
 
02:45:28.030 --> 02:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
busy space for us over the last couple
 
02:45:28.040 --> 02:45:28.990 align:start position:0%
busy space for us over the last couple
of

02:45:28.990 --> 02:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:45:31.230 --> 02:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
months over the last couple of months
 
02:45:33.389 --> 02:45:33.399 align:start position:0%
through the covid response uh ba has
 
02:45:35.070 --> 02:45:35.080 align:start position:0%
been really sort of put into a position
 
02:45:37.469 --> 02:45:37.479 align:start position:0%
of response and working with businesses
 
02:45:39.790 --> 02:45:39.800 align:start position:0%
to get them what they need we acted very
 
02:45:43.550 --> 02:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
early on uh during the whole essential
 
02:45:45.710 --> 02:45:45.720 align:start position:0%
business uh period of time there in
 
02:45:48.309 --> 02:45:48.319 align:start position:0%
March and April of last year helping
 
02:45:49.750 --> 02:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
businesses understand what the
 
02:45:50.950 --> 02:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
requirements were going to be going
 
02:45:53.110 --> 02:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
forward and then the governor formed the
 
02:45:56.349 --> 02:45:56.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh uh economic reopening
 
02:45:59.389 --> 02:45:59.399 align:start position:0%
task force with which I was the co-chair
 
02:46:01.150 --> 02:46:01.160 align:start position:0%
uh with DJ B cour and the governor's
 
02:46:03.230 --> 02:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
office and we've we continue to meet to
 
02:46:06.349 --> 02:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
this day on a regular basis uh trying
 
02:46:08.389 --> 02:46:08.399 align:start position:0%
very hard to find sort of that balance
 
02:46:11.389 --> 02:46:11.399 align:start position:0%
between public health and the uh in the
 
02:46:14.790 --> 02:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
ongoing uh goal of limiting transmission
 
02:46:17.510 --> 02:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
and now getting people vaccinated along
 
02:46:21.070 --> 02:46:21.080 align:start position:0%
with maintaining uh economic VI you know
 
02:46:22.830 --> 02:46:22.840 align:start position:0%
the degree of economic Vitality that we
 
02:46:25.230 --> 02:46:25.240 align:start position:0%
can uh for businesses during that time
 
02:46:27.830 --> 02:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
provide jobs for people and continue to
 
02:46:27.840 --> 02:46:28.910 align:start position:0%
provide jobs for people and continue to
make

02:46:28.910 --> 02:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
make
 
02:46:31.389 --> 02:46:31.399 align:start position:0%
investments uh as I mentioned we we did
 
02:46:33.389 --> 02:46:33.399 align:start position:0%
a lot of uh technical assistance I would
 
02:46:36.349 --> 02:46:36.359 align:start position:0%
say well over 10,000 individual emails
 
02:46:39.710 --> 02:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
and U uh and phone calls uh and web
 
02:46:41.990 --> 02:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
inquiries came into the department over
 
02:46:44.349 --> 02:46:44.359 align:start position:0%
the last several months uh and we've
 
02:46:46.070 --> 02:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
worked with all those businesses over
 
02:46:47.429 --> 02:46:47.439 align:start position:0%
that time to get them hopefully what
 
02:46:49.309 --> 02:46:49.319 align:start position:0%
they needed the other thing I wanted to
 
02:46:51.910 --> 02:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
mention uh was a relationship that
 
02:46:53.830 --> 02:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
really developed through this with the
 
02:46:55.790 --> 02:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
uh with the Chambers of Commerce around
 
02:46:58.190 --> 02:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
the state this really emerged as being a
 
02:47:00.950 --> 02:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
very important relationship for us uh
 
02:47:02.710 --> 02:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
and I think for for members of the
 
02:47:06.230 --> 02:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
chamber Community as well in really um
 
02:47:08.750 --> 02:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
being able to focus in on what were the
 
02:47:10.870 --> 02:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
individual specific needs either in a
 
02:47:13.590 --> 02:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
locality or in a region and provide some
 
02:47:16.349 --> 02:47:16.359 align:start position:0%
resources uh in collaboration with our
 
02:47:19.230 --> 02:47:19.240 align:start position:0%
department to to help businesses in
 
02:47:22.630 --> 02:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
those regions um be in position to come
 
02:47:24.349 --> 02:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
out of this in the strongest possible
 
02:47:27.830 --> 02:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
way that they can uh we were uh we were
 
02:47:30.150 --> 02:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
we utilize some of the cares act funds
 
02:47:32.750 --> 02:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
to provide some resources to our
 
02:47:34.830 --> 02:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
Chambers to be able to continue to play
 
02:47:36.910 --> 02:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
the role that they play uh and we
 
02:47:39.630 --> 02:47:39.640 align:start position:0%
arranged that in a regional uh context
 
02:47:42.469 --> 02:47:42.479 align:start position:0%
which ended up being very successful and
 
02:47:44.910 --> 02:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
allowed for um several things to come
 
02:47:46.910 --> 02:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
from it not the least of which is as I
 
02:47:48.670 --> 02:47:48.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned our relationship with
 
02:47:50.429 --> 02:47:50.439 align:start position:0%
Employment Services we did a number of
 
02:47:52.990 --> 02:47:53.000 align:start position:0%
virtual job fairs around the state and
 
02:47:54.670 --> 02:47:54.680 align:start position:0%
those continue that were extremely
 
02:47:56.990 --> 02:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
successful I'm sure George and Rich will
 
02:48:00.510 --> 02:48:00.520 align:start position:0%
speak to you about later um but uh one
 
02:48:02.429 --> 02:48:02.439 align:start position:0%
of the benefits that came from that was
 
02:48:04.110 --> 02:48:04.120 align:start position:0%
uh on the New Hampshire employment
 
02:48:07.030 --> 02:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
services job portal typically if you
 
02:48:08.830 --> 02:48:08.840 align:start position:0%
were looking for a job and a lot of jobs
 
02:48:10.870 --> 02:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
are listed there if you haven't seen it
 
02:48:13.349 --> 02:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
you should check it out uh but they were
 
02:48:16.269 --> 02:48:16.279 align:start position:0%
by town and what we find is that a lot
 
02:48:18.190 --> 02:48:18.200 align:start position:0%
of people obviously want to search in a
 
02:48:19.750 --> 02:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
certain region where they might live and
 
02:48:21.429 --> 02:48:21.439 align:start position:0%
so we were able to work with the
 
02:48:23.550 --> 02:48:23.560 align:start position:0%
employment services in the chambers to
 
02:48:26.190 --> 02:48:26.200 align:start position:0%
make that small adjustment to uh to the
 
02:48:27.790 --> 02:48:27.800 align:start position:0%
job portal which I think in the end has
 
02:48:29.590 --> 02:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
made a pretty big difference for people
 
02:48:30.990 --> 02:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
that have been looking for jobs so if
 
02:48:33.030 --> 02:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
they want to look for a job in the North
 
02:48:34.870 --> 02:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
Country they don't have to know each
 
02:48:36.309 --> 02:48:36.319 align:start position:0%
individual community that they have to
 
02:48:39.190 --> 02:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
search under they can search U you so a
 
02:48:41.030 --> 02:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
small thing but I think a good example
 
02:48:42.309 --> 02:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
of some of the stuff that we've been
 
02:48:46.510 --> 02:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
working on in the background listen
 
02:48:49.269 --> 02:48:49.279 align:start position:0%
um I I would say again I know you're
 
02:48:50.590 --> 02:48:50.600 align:start position:0%
going to hear from them in terms of the
 
02:48:52.910 --> 02:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
unemployment numbers uh I'm sure all of
 
02:48:54.469 --> 02:48:54.479 align:start position:0%
you are very aware of how we've been on
 
02:48:56.870 --> 02:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
a bit of a roller coaster in that regard
 
02:48:59.070 --> 02:48:59.080 align:start position:0%
over the last couple of months uh and
 
02:49:01.710 --> 02:49:01.720 align:start position:0%
I'll let them speak to that uh but in
 
02:49:04.469 --> 02:49:04.479 align:start position:0%
terms of biggest impacts that we've seen
 
02:49:06.110 --> 02:49:06.120 align:start position:0%
I don't think I need to tell any of you
 
02:49:07.670 --> 02:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
that that's pretty clearly been in our
 
02:49:10.670 --> 02:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
hospitality and in our tourism industry
 
02:49:13.309 --> 02:49:13.319 align:start position:0%
uh they've really uh I think had to Bear
 
02:49:17.550 --> 02:49:17.560 align:start position:0%
the burden of the double whammy of the
 
02:49:19.630 --> 02:49:19.640 align:start position:0%
uh the pandemic itself and I think now
 
02:49:22.990 --> 02:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
more so in the areas of um customer
 
02:49:24.389 --> 02:49:24.399 align:start position:0%
confidence and
 
02:49:26.670 --> 02:49:26.680 align:start position:0%
people their willingness of people to go
 
02:49:30.229 --> 02:49:30.239 align:start position:0%
out uh stay in a hotel or uh or visit a
 
02:49:32.429 --> 02:49:32.439 align:start position:0%
restaurant has H has been a challenge
 
02:49:34.550 --> 02:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
that's faced by all uh the tourism
 
02:49:36.150 --> 02:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
industry and the hospitality industry
 
02:49:37.550 --> 02:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
Nationwide not just here in New
 
02:49:39.710 --> 02:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh but due to the importance
 
02:49:42.469 --> 02:49:42.479 align:start position:0%
of that industry here it's one that
 
02:49:44.190 --> 02:49:44.200 align:start position:0%
we're paying a good amount of attention
 
02:49:46.710 --> 02:49:46.720 align:start position:0%
to and we work very closely with uh
 
02:49:47.990 --> 02:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
their representatives and they're
 
02:49:49.830 --> 02:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
members of the reopening task force and
 
02:49:52.229 --> 02:49:52.239 align:start position:0%
we've made almost constant adjustments
 
02:49:53.550 --> 02:49:53.560 align:start position:0%
to the guidance to be able to
 
02:49:55.349 --> 02:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
accommodate different uh requests where
 
02:49:59.429 --> 02:49:59.439 align:start position:0%
we can to that industry um I I I I
 
02:50:01.510 --> 02:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
really want to emphasize the role that
 
02:50:03.150 --> 02:50:03.160 align:start position:0%
that plays not just because of the
 
02:50:06.030 --> 02:50:06.040 align:start position:0%
number of jobs that are out there um but
 
02:50:08.030 --> 02:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
also obviously in terms of state revenue
 
02:50:10.309 --> 02:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
and the meals and rents tax and the role
 
02:50:12.590 --> 02:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
that they play in uh in that particular
 
02:50:15.670 --> 02:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
line item uh but I would also say as I
 
02:50:17.469 --> 02:50:17.479 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier a big part of what
 
02:50:19.750 --> 02:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
we're doing at the department here at
 
02:50:22.229 --> 02:50:22.239 align:start position:0%
business and economic Affairs is the
 
02:50:24.510 --> 02:50:24.520 align:start position:0%
recruitment piece and I will tell you
 
02:50:26.229 --> 02:50:26.239 align:start position:0%
that no matter who we're talking to
 
02:50:28.630 --> 02:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
whether it's businesses or potential
 
02:50:31.349 --> 02:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
Workforce or or students or whoever
 
02:50:33.990 --> 02:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
tourists or whoever it is uh one of our
 
02:50:37.429 --> 02:50:37.439 align:start position:0%
biggest advantages is the fact that we
 
02:50:40.110 --> 02:50:40.120 align:start position:0%
live in a beautiful state and we have a
 
02:50:42.750 --> 02:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
very high quality of life and the the
 
02:50:45.030 --> 02:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
messages across all of those various
 
02:50:47.670 --> 02:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
audiences are increasingly consistent
 
02:50:51.070 --> 02:50:51.080 align:start position:0%
and one that we really um value in terms
 
02:50:52.309 --> 02:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
of being able to do the work that we
 
02:50:55.510 --> 02:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
need to be doing uh with with that with
 
02:50:58.870 --> 02:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
regard to that so the the the need to
 
02:51:01.750 --> 02:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
continue to support the the tourism
 
02:51:05.229 --> 02:51:05.239 align:start position:0%
industry is multifaceted and not extreme
 
02:51:06.750 --> 02:51:06.760 align:start position:0%
not just limited to the jobs and the
 
02:51:08.950 --> 02:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
revenue numbers I think it is obviously
 
02:51:10.670 --> 02:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
a big part of what we have here in
 
02:51:11.910 --> 02:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and a big part of what we
 
02:51:14.229 --> 02:51:14.239 align:start position:0%
offer to all those that we need to be
 
02:51:18.630 --> 02:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
able to come here um other sectors that
 
02:51:20.790 --> 02:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
we have seen uh continue to do
 
02:51:22.670 --> 02:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
reasonably well through this process
 
02:51:23.630 --> 02:51:23.640 align:start position:0%
under the
 
02:51:26.830 --> 02:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
circumstances uh manufacturing industry
 
02:51:29.870 --> 02:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
uh you know we we've seen increasing
 
02:51:32.309 --> 02:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
investment um and I will say I don't
 
02:51:34.630 --> 02:51:34.640 align:start position:0%
know if I mentioned this earlier but um
 
02:51:36.389 --> 02:51:36.399 align:start position:0%
the level of activity we have in our
 
02:51:37.630 --> 02:51:37.640 align:start position:0%
recruitment team our business
 
02:51:39.349 --> 02:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
recruitment team is probably as high as
 
02:51:41.750 --> 02:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
I've seen it um throughout this whole
 
02:51:44.229 --> 02:51:44.239 align:start position:0%
this whole period of time uh we've seen
 
02:51:46.469 --> 02:51:46.479 align:start position:0%
some pretty substantial uh Investments
 
02:51:49.190 --> 02:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
made in New Hampshire uh liddol in
 
02:51:52.030 --> 02:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
Rochester made a substantial uh uh
 
02:51:55.190 --> 02:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
investment and expansion we saw milor
 
02:51:58.590 --> 02:51:58.600 align:start position:0%
Sigma in Jaffrey as well also make
 
02:52:01.030 --> 02:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
recent announcements lonza and
 
02:52:04.190 --> 02:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth is actually in uh is is
 
02:52:06.190 --> 02:52:06.200 align:start position:0%
working with madna right now and they're
 
02:52:09.269 --> 02:52:09.279 align:start position:0%
actually manufacturing the vaccine that
 
02:52:11.389 --> 02:52:11.399 align:start position:0%
is one of the two that are approved in
 
02:52:14.910 --> 02:52:14.920 align:start position:0%
the United States and are extremely uh
 
02:52:16.870 --> 02:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
that they've I think re reconfigured
 
02:52:19.630 --> 02:52:19.640 align:start position:0%
their entire operation to do just that
 
02:52:22.269 --> 02:52:22.279 align:start position:0%
um up in up in representative Tucker NE
 
02:52:24.670 --> 02:52:24.680 align:start position:0%
of the woods we just saw a purchase of
 
02:52:26.790 --> 02:52:26.800 align:start position:0%
the gorm paper and tissue company there
 
02:52:28.790 --> 02:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
by a new firm which we're very
 
02:52:31.429 --> 02:52:31.439 align:start position:0%
encouraged to see that uh we're we've
 
02:52:33.349 --> 02:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
already started working with them uh
 
02:52:34.790 --> 02:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
regularly and getting them hopefully
 
02:52:37.070 --> 02:52:37.080 align:start position:0%
what they need to continue to retain
 
02:52:39.150 --> 02:52:39.160 align:start position:0%
those jobs and grow and uh they've got
 
02:52:40.790 --> 02:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
some interesting ideas on what they can
 
02:52:43.870 --> 02:52:43.880 align:start position:0%
do there and Hallelujah for that um and
 
02:52:45.309 --> 02:52:45.319 align:start position:0%
the other thing I would mention as well
 
02:52:48.070 --> 02:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
is the the uh you're going to I think
 
02:52:49.429 --> 02:52:49.439 align:start position:0%
probably over the course of the next
 
02:52:51.550 --> 02:52:51.560 align:start position:0%
year see a lot more activity around the
 
02:52:54.110 --> 02:52:54.120 align:start position:0%
offshore wind industry development in
 
02:52:55.870 --> 02:52:55.880 align:start position:0%
the Gulf of Maine we're working with the
 
02:52:58.469 --> 02:52:58.479 align:start position:0%
federal government and with um
 
02:53:00.630 --> 02:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts in Maine in that regard in
 
02:53:02.429 --> 02:53:02.439 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of ocean ocean Energy
 
02:53:03.710 --> 02:53:03.720 align:start position:0%
Management in
 
02:53:06.229 --> 02:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
Washington uh it's an area that we've
 
02:53:08.550 --> 02:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
been highly committed to and we see that
 
02:53:10.670 --> 02:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
a great opportunity for growth not just
 
02:53:12.150 --> 02:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
in the new Industries but in our
 
02:53:14.870 --> 02:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
existing Industries um to be able to
 
02:53:16.790 --> 02:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
find additional markets and Supply
 
02:53:18.910 --> 02:53:18.920 align:start position:0%
chains that they can
 
02:53:23.150 --> 02:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
supply um the um in terms of where we're
 
02:53:25.910 --> 02:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
headed and uh the position that we're in
 
02:53:27.910 --> 02:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
I I would Point once again as I think I
 
02:53:32.110 --> 02:53:32.120 align:start position:0%
did last time we met UNH and the Cary
 
02:53:34.030 --> 02:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
Institute does their regular net
 
02:53:36.269 --> 02:53:36.279 align:start position:0%
migration updates and they did one in
 
02:53:38.469 --> 02:53:38.479 align:start position:0%
December and again we continue to see
 
02:53:41.309 --> 02:53:41.319 align:start position:0%
very very positive news on the net
 
02:53:43.150 --> 02:53:43.160 align:start position:0%
migration numbers into New Hampshire we
 
02:53:46.150 --> 02:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
are um the fastest growing state in that
 
02:53:48.030 --> 02:53:48.040 align:start position:0%
regard in the northeastern United States
 
02:53:50.510 --> 02:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
we have been now for a couple of years
 
02:53:52.110 --> 02:53:52.120 align:start position:0%
and most of the growth is coming in
 
02:53:54.389 --> 02:53:54.399 align:start position:0%
those key demographic areas that we've
 
02:53:56.510 --> 02:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
been targeting which is uh the younger
 
02:54:00.070 --> 02:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
generation I would say 25 to 35 roughly
 
02:54:02.150 --> 02:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
range we are seeing some pretty pretty
 
02:54:04.670 --> 02:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
decent expansion in that area and growth
 
02:54:06.389 --> 02:54:06.399 align:start position:0%
and that's obviously really important to
 
02:54:08.590 --> 02:54:08.600 align:start position:0%
the long-term ability to supply
 
02:54:10.550 --> 02:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
Workforce as well as to keep our
 
02:54:13.389 --> 02:54:13.399 align:start position:0%
communities vibrant uh access to
 
02:54:16.030 --> 02:54:16.040 align:start position:0%
technology you obviously we are going to
 
02:54:19.349 --> 02:54:19.359 align:start position:0%
continue to see uh a work space and a
 
02:54:21.309 --> 02:54:21.319 align:start position:0%
work environment that's very different
 
02:54:22.670 --> 02:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
and very similar to the one that we're
 
02:54:24.750 --> 02:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
engaging in right now where there's a
 
02:54:26.870 --> 02:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
lot of virtual and remote activity
 
02:54:29.110 --> 02:54:29.120 align:start position:0%
that's going on presents all sorts of
 
02:54:32.190 --> 02:54:32.200 align:start position:0%
new opportunities for companies and for
 
02:54:35.590 --> 02:54:35.600 align:start position:0%
employees uh to uh to choose much more
 
02:54:38.110 --> 02:54:38.120 align:start position:0%
to place I would say a lot more priority
 
02:54:39.790 --> 02:54:39.800 align:start position:0%
on the choice of where they're going to
 
02:54:42.630 --> 02:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
live that isn't necessarily tied to the
 
02:54:44.790 --> 02:54:44.800 align:start position:0%
place they're going to work uh it may be
 
02:54:46.309 --> 02:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
ultimately but I think that that
 
02:54:48.950 --> 02:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
presents a u a pretty
 
02:54:51.670 --> 02:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
substantial um opportunity you i' I've
 
02:54:52.870 --> 02:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned this in a couple of other
 
02:54:56.990 --> 02:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
forums but um it was I think back in the
 
02:54:59.950 --> 02:54:59.960 align:start position:0%
late summer that the REI the big company
 
02:55:02.950 --> 02:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
out in the west coast um had built a
 
02:55:04.790 --> 02:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
whole new headquarters building I
 
02:55:06.309 --> 02:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
believe in Washington state that they
 
02:55:07.630 --> 02:55:07.640 align:start position:0%
were getting ready to move into but
 
02:55:10.190 --> 02:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
their experience in managing a remote
 
02:55:13.070 --> 02:55:13.080 align:start position:0%
Workforce was so positive uh both in
 
02:55:14.910 --> 02:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
terms of uh the ability to run the
 
02:55:16.830 --> 02:55:16.840 align:start position:0%
company but also in terms to recruit and
 
02:55:19.030 --> 02:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
retain Workforce that they ended up
 
02:55:20.630 --> 02:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
selling the building before they even
 
02:55:23.110 --> 02:55:23.120 align:start position:0%
got in it um I'm not suggested that's
 
02:55:24.590 --> 02:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
happening at a large scale but I do
 
02:55:27.309 --> 02:55:27.319 align:start position:0%
think that it's a good example of the
 
02:55:31.750 --> 02:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
type of new um uh uh Viewpoint that
 
02:55:33.389 --> 02:55:33.399 align:start position:0%
we're going to see a lot of employers
 
02:55:35.950 --> 02:55:35.960 align:start position:0%
have and given New Hampshire's proximity
 
02:55:39.030 --> 02:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
to urban areas proximity to Quality
 
02:55:43.070 --> 02:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
Workforce proximity to decent technology
 
02:55:44.950 --> 02:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh availability
 
02:55:47.070 --> 02:55:47.080 align:start position:0%
to do that remote work I think that
 
02:55:49.830 --> 02:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to be in a reasonably strong
 
02:55:53.150 --> 02:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
position I think I would also mention in
 
02:55:55.950 --> 02:55:55.960 align:start position:0%
terms of uh opportunities uh going back
 
02:55:58.389 --> 02:55:58.399 align:start position:0%
again to the tourism industry we track
 
02:56:01.229 --> 02:56:01.239 align:start position:0%
things like U upcoming reservations that
 
02:56:02.950 --> 02:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
have been made at different hotels in
 
02:56:06.110 --> 02:56:06.120 align:start position:0%
the State uh and other I would say more
 
02:56:09.229 --> 02:56:09.239 align:start position:0%
anecdotal news but uh if we are able to
 
02:56:11.070 --> 02:56:11.080 align:start position:0%
have more people vaccinated as we're
 
02:56:12.910 --> 02:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
expecting by late spring and early
 
02:56:15.190 --> 02:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
summer we can expect a pretty
 
02:56:18.309 --> 02:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
substantial tourism season I have a I
 
02:56:20.910 --> 02:56:20.920 align:start position:0%
have a sneaking suspicion that there are
 
02:56:22.790 --> 02:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
lots and lots of people in Boston
 
02:56:24.990 --> 02:56:25.000 align:start position:0%
Hartford Providence in New York that are
 
02:56:27.870 --> 02:56:27.880 align:start position:0%
just itching to get uh into the uh into
 
02:56:29.910 --> 02:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
the outdoors and find some opportunities
 
02:56:32.389 --> 02:56:32.399 align:start position:0%
to uh get away from the city and we want
 
02:56:34.229 --> 02:56:34.239 align:start position:0%
to be in a very strong position to be
 
02:56:37.030 --> 02:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
able to accommodate them at that time
 
02:56:38.670 --> 02:56:38.680 align:start position:0%
and take advantage of all that I've
 
02:56:41.389 --> 02:56:41.399 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh that we that we need to
 
02:56:43.070 --> 02:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
with our tourism
 
02:56:45.469 --> 02:56:45.479 align:start position:0%
industry the final thing uh and then
 
02:56:47.550 --> 02:56:47.560 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll be quiet for a few minutes is
 
02:56:50.349 --> 02:56:50.359 align:start position:0%
uh we have made a number of Investments
 
02:56:52.389 --> 02:56:52.399 align:start position:0%
as you are well aware over the last
 
02:56:54.990 --> 02:56:55.000 align:start position:0%
several months using the cares act funds
 
02:56:56.870 --> 02:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh for our business community and in
 
02:56:58.910 --> 02:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
fact if you count all the Main Street
 
02:57:01.110 --> 02:57:01.120 align:start position:0%
relief funds the self program the gap
 
02:57:02.830 --> 02:57:02.840 align:start position:0%
program and a couple of other smaller
 
02:57:05.429 --> 02:57:05.439 align:start position:0%
programs uh we we provided in excess of
 
02:57:08.070 --> 02:57:08.080 align:start position:0%
$500 million worth of business support
 
02:57:09.830 --> 02:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
programming through the governor's
 
02:57:12.710 --> 02:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
office for economic relief and Recovery
 
02:57:15.030 --> 02:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
um over the past several months and I
 
02:57:16.070 --> 02:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
think that that's made a very
 
02:57:17.710 --> 02:57:17.720 align:start position:0%
substantial difference in the ability
 
02:57:19.590 --> 02:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
for a lot of businesses to continue
 
02:57:21.630 --> 02:57:21.640 align:start position:0%
operating uh we've had some ups and
 
02:57:23.150 --> 02:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
downs with the federal programming
 
02:57:25.469 --> 02:57:25.479 align:start position:0%
through the SBA and the the payroll
 
02:57:28.229 --> 02:57:28.239 align:start position:0%
Protection Program and the economic
 
02:57:31.229 --> 02:57:31.239 align:start position:0%
injury disaster Loan program both of
 
02:57:32.670 --> 02:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
which are now back up and running
 
02:57:35.229 --> 02:57:35.239 align:start position:0%
thankfully with some new um
 
02:57:37.349 --> 02:57:37.359 align:start position:0%
administrative uh functions and with
 
02:57:39.469 --> 02:57:39.479 align:start position:0%
some new priorities all of which I think
 
02:57:41.630 --> 02:57:41.640 align:start position:0%
are very positive but I do think that
 
02:57:43.070 --> 02:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
those Investments and the speed with
 
02:57:44.349 --> 02:57:44.359 align:start position:0%
which we made them were were pretty
 
02:57:46.550 --> 02:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
important enabl to helping a lot of our
 
02:57:49.070 --> 02:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
industry particularly last summer really
 
02:57:51.269 --> 02:57:51.279 align:start position:0%
um really weather the storm of of the
 
02:57:53.590 --> 02:57:53.600 align:start position:0%
pandemic the other important piece to
 
02:57:55.469 --> 02:57:55.479 align:start position:0%
really mention here and I again I know
 
02:57:57.110 --> 02:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
George and Rich will probably mention
 
02:57:59.190 --> 02:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
this later but the investment that we
 
02:58:00.750 --> 02:58:00.760 align:start position:0%
made in the unemployment insurance trust
 
02:58:02.150 --> 02:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
fund is one that's going to have a
 
02:58:03.830 --> 02:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
benefit to all businesses around the
 
02:58:07.950 --> 02:58:07.960 align:start position:0%
state um our the the uh the use of
 
02:58:09.990 --> 02:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
around $50 million to make sure that
 
02:58:12.190 --> 02:58:12.200 align:start position:0%
that trust fund remained very solvent is
 
02:58:14.830 --> 02:58:14.840 align:start position:0%
going to pay off going forward in 2021
 
02:58:17.950 --> 02:58:17.960 align:start position:0%
for a lot of obvious reasons but I think
 
02:58:19.710 --> 02:58:19.720 align:start position:0%
the reason from my standpoint that I
 
02:58:22.750 --> 02:58:22.760 align:start position:0%
that I raise it is fact that uh we're
 
02:58:24.389 --> 02:58:24.399 align:start position:0%
going to be able we're going to be able
 
02:58:26.429 --> 02:58:26.439 align:start position:0%
I think uh employers will be much more
 
02:58:28.790 --> 02:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
willing to rehire and bring people uh
 
02:58:30.429 --> 02:58:30.439 align:start position:0%
back into the workforce if they're not
 
02:58:32.750 --> 02:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
having to cover the the cost that would
 
02:58:35.309 --> 02:58:35.319 align:start position:0%
have been befallen them if we wouldn't
 
02:58:37.590 --> 02:58:37.600 align:start position:0%
have made this investment under as you
 
02:58:40.110 --> 02:58:40.120 align:start position:0%
well know under under the under law this
 
02:58:42.630 --> 02:58:42.640 align:start position:0%
the state uh employers have to help
 
02:58:44.429 --> 02:58:44.439 align:start position:0%
reimburse that trust fund when it gets
 
02:58:46.469 --> 02:58:46.479 align:start position:0%
to a certain level and we're able to
 
02:58:48.590 --> 02:58:48.600 align:start position:0%
avoid a good portion of that and make
 
02:58:50.750 --> 02:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
rehiring um something that is a little
 
02:58:52.710 --> 02:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
less painful for our employers as we
 
02:58:54.710 --> 02:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
start to come out of this I do think
 
02:58:56.269 --> 02:58:56.279 align:start position:0%
that that's an important investment that
 
02:58:58.510 --> 02:58:58.520 align:start position:0%
occasionally gets overlooked uh we made
 
02:59:01.190 --> 02:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
a similar investment uh with Car Act
 
02:59:03.110 --> 02:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
dollars for the nonprofit Community as
 
02:59:05.469 --> 02:59:05.479 align:start position:0%
well who also have to pay for their
 
02:59:08.150 --> 02:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
employees into the trust fund uh we
 
02:59:10.190 --> 02:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
dedicated I think as I recall about $15
 
02:59:13.269 --> 02:59:13.279 align:start position:0%
million for that purpose to help give
 
02:59:15.750 --> 02:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
them that SAR benefit I do think that
 
02:59:17.630 --> 02:59:17.640 align:start position:0%
those are some important points to raise
 
02:59:21.429 --> 02:59:21.439 align:start position:0%
here as well um I I would finally say
 
02:59:23.830 --> 02:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
that if we do end up seeing some
 
02:59:26.150 --> 02:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
additional stimulus from Washington over
 
02:59:28.229 --> 02:59:28.239 align:start position:0%
the next couple of months and or maybe
 
02:59:30.630 --> 02:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
even weeks which seems increasingly
 
02:59:32.510 --> 02:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
likely based on the reports that we're
 
02:59:35.790 --> 02:59:35.800 align:start position:0%
seeing uh those will be resources that
 
02:59:37.469 --> 02:59:37.479 align:start position:0%
we will be able to hopefully direct
 
02:59:40.950 --> 02:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
towards the long-term Investments um as
 
02:59:43.229 --> 02:59:43.239 align:start position:0%
a result of the of the way that we
 
02:59:45.790 --> 02:59:45.800 align:start position:0%
managed our cares act funds uh in sort
 
02:59:47.309 --> 02:59:47.319 align:start position:0%
of what we'll say the first round of all
 
02:59:49.349 --> 02:59:49.359 align:start position:0%
of H all of this Federal money that's
 
02:59:51.830 --> 02:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
made available so with that Mr chairman
 
02:59:54.150 --> 02:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to to pause and and entertain
 
03:00:00.550 --> 03:00:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:03.590 --> 03:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
have uh thank you thank you commissioner
 
03:00:09.750 --> 03:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:15.670 --> 03:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
um I'll get back to it representa Aly
 
03:00:21.190 --> 03:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um Taylor we've um
 
03:00:26.269 --> 03:00:26.279 align:start position:0%
this is the revenue committees and we
 
03:00:29.750 --> 03:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
need to raise the revenues for the
 
03:00:32.190 --> 03:00:32.200 align:start position:0%
services of the state without which the
 
03:00:35.670 --> 03:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
businesses as well as the citizens um
 
03:00:38.590 --> 03:00:38.600 align:start position:0%
are going to have a very hard time here
 
03:00:43.030 --> 03:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
on I'm worried about the increasing
 
03:00:43.040 --> 03:00:44.670 align:start position:0%
on I'm worried about the increasing
depend

03:00:44.670 --> 03:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
depend
 
03:00:50.030 --> 03:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
uh of on on businesses that are selling
 
03:00:53.389 --> 03:00:53.399 align:start position:0%
things outside the state at a time that
 
03:00:55.550 --> 03:00:55.560 align:start position:0%
we are talking about going to the single
 
03:00:58.309 --> 03:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
sales factor for apportionment which
 
03:01:01.150 --> 03:01:01.160 align:start position:0%
would mean that most of those businesses
 
03:01:03.590 --> 03:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
that have been paying the most into
 
03:01:06.349 --> 03:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
state coffers are not going to be
 
03:01:10.590 --> 03:01:10.600 align:start position:0%
paying on do you have any thoughts on
 
03:01:13.750 --> 03:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
the relationship between our Revenue
 
03:01:15.269 --> 03:01:15.279 align:start position:0%
structure and the
 
03:01:20.830 --> 03:01:20.840 align:start position:0%
mix of um businesses that we're we're
 
03:01:23.590 --> 03:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
recruiting I would say that um
 
03:01:25.550 --> 03:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
representative uh with regard to the
 
03:01:27.870 --> 03:01:27.880 align:start position:0%
single sales Factor
 
03:01:30.670 --> 03:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
issue my experience over the last couple
 
03:01:32.269 --> 03:01:32.279 align:start position:0%
of years has been a lot of the companies
 
03:01:34.429 --> 03:01:34.439 align:start position:0%
that we see growth in and I would say
 
03:01:37.229 --> 03:01:37.239 align:start position:0%
these are in higher technology areas uh
 
03:01:40.510 --> 03:01:40.520 align:start position:0%
life science Industry Advanced
 
03:01:43.269 --> 03:01:43.279 align:start position:0%
manufacturing those sorts of companies
 
03:01:45.710 --> 03:01:45.720 align:start position:0%
are used to a single sales Factor
 
03:01:48.870 --> 03:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
environment and in fact when we are in
 
03:01:51.190 --> 03:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
often in competition for a lot of these
 
03:01:53.590 --> 03:01:53.600 align:start position:0%
businesses to be in New Hampshire uh we
 
03:01:55.309 --> 03:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
are competing with states that have made
 
03:01:58.349 --> 03:01:58.359 align:start position:0%
that transition uh and and it does put
 
03:02:00.229 --> 03:02:00.239 align:start position:0%
us in the eyes of those particular
 
03:02:03.510 --> 03:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
companies at a bit of a disadvantage I I
 
03:02:05.389 --> 03:02:05.399 align:start position:0%
really I'm GNA have to say that it's up
 
03:02:08.309 --> 03:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
to members of this these committees as
 
03:02:10.990 --> 03:02:11.000 align:start position:0%
well as others uh and Dr and others on
 
03:02:13.910 --> 03:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
the revenue side of things my real role
 
03:02:15.550 --> 03:02:15.560 align:start position:0%
here is to continue to be able to grow
 
03:02:17.590 --> 03:02:17.600 align:start position:0%
the economy and the the trajectory that
 
03:02:21.309 --> 03:02:21.319 align:start position:0%
I see I would say for the most part is
 
03:02:24.429 --> 03:02:24.439 align:start position:0%
that companies that are looking to take
 
03:02:27.030 --> 03:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
advantage of a high Highly Educated
 
03:02:28.990 --> 03:02:29.000 align:start position:0%
Workforce which is in a lot of ways one
 
03:02:31.190 --> 03:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
of our major selling points are
 
03:02:34.030 --> 03:02:34.040 align:start position:0%
companies that are typically um
 
03:02:38.070 --> 03:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
favorable to a single sales Factor um
 
03:02:41.030 --> 03:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
environment commission it means they
 
03:02:44.469 --> 03:02:44.479 align:start position:0%
don't have to pay
 
03:02:48.349 --> 03:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
into our services I I I I you could ask
 
03:02:50.229 --> 03:02:50.239 align:start position:0%
them exactly why they like that better I
 
03:02:51.309 --> 03:02:51.319 align:start position:0%
think a lot of it has to do with
 
03:02:53.550 --> 03:02:53.560 align:start position:0%
consistency among other states that they
 
03:02:56.389 --> 03:02:56.399 align:start position:0%
operate thank you commissioner you
 
03:02:59.309 --> 03:02:59.319 align:start position:0%
covered an awful lot in your
 
03:03:02.510 --> 03:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
presentation um you identified a lot of
 
03:03:04.309 --> 03:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
issues a lot of good things that going
 
03:03:08.790 --> 03:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
on things that we need to be uh aware of
 
03:03:10.710 --> 03:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
do you have a document that you could
 
03:03:13.030 --> 03:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
share with the committee that covers
 
03:03:14.429 --> 03:03:14.439 align:start position:0%
these points
 
03:03:17.950 --> 03:03:17.960 align:start position:0%
either in bullet forms or that there's a
 
03:03:20.990 --> 03:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
lot of good information there and well
 
03:03:23.030 --> 03:03:23.040 align:start position:0%

you about
 
03:56:29.670 --> 03:56:29.680 align:start position:0%

03:56:37.750 --> 03:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
Economist he's the one I was talking
 
03:56:40.110 --> 03:56:40.120 align:start position:0%
about figured out the relationship
 
03:56:43.790 --> 03:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
between the tobacco tax and the the
 
03:56:47.910 --> 03:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
gas gasoline ta uh gasoline price yeah

03:56:56.389 --> 03:56:56.399 align:start position:0%
relationship is part of our problem with
 
03:56:58.269 --> 03:56:58.279 align:start position:0%
that right
 
03:56:58.279 --> 03:57:00.429 align:start position:0%
that right
now

03:57:00.429 --> 03:57:00.439 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:57:03.870 --> 03:57:03.880 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah that's uh that's a interesting
 
03:57:05.510 --> 03:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
I haven't looked at those numbers in a
 
03:57:07.670 --> 03:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
while I know the tobacco tax had been up
 
03:57:09.590 --> 03:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
for a while
 
03:57:12.990 --> 03:57:13.000 align:start position:0%
um I don't know recently how it's been
 
03:57:17.389 --> 03:57:17.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:21.030 --> 03:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic tobacco tax is doing real well
 
03:57:22.469 --> 03:57:22.479 align:start position:0%
thanks to
 
03:57:22.479 --> 03:57:24.309 align:start position:0%
thanks to
Massachusetts

03:57:24.309 --> 03:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
03:57:26.830 --> 03:57:26.840 align:start position:0%
yes all the
 
03:57:30.389 --> 03:57:30.399 align:start position:0%
mentholated cigarette smokers have come
 
03:57:34.710 --> 03:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
over here I wonder whether they really
 
03:57:37.269 --> 03:57:37.279 align:start position:0%
have me we were told they were going to
 
03:57:40.510 --> 03:57:40.520 align:start position:0%
do it before it happened I know and
 
03:57:43.630 --> 03:57:43.640 align:start position:0%
mentholated cigarettes are primarily
 
03:57:46.309 --> 03:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
promoted to black and brown
 
03:57:48.110 --> 03:57:48.120 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods and
 
03:57:52.950 --> 03:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
females and maybe females and so I
 
03:57:55.110 --> 03:57:55.120 align:start position:0%
wonder whether if you went to the
 
03:57:57.750 --> 03:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
parking lots of where they sell these
 
03:58:00.990 --> 03:58:01.000 align:start position:0%
you would see a difference in the
 
03:58:04.550 --> 03:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
clientele I live right on the border and
 
03:58:08.590 --> 03:58:08.600 align:start position:0%
the sale of methyl cigarettes really
 
03:58:10.510 --> 03:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
Point Sky High once
 
03:58:13.870 --> 03:58:13.880 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts stop them well I wonder
 
03:58:15.630 --> 03:58:15.640 align:start position:0%
whether the targeted groups are coming
 
03:58:16.670 --> 03:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
to New
 
03:58:19.510 --> 03:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's an interesting
 
03:58:19.520 --> 03:58:22.110 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's an interesting
question

03:58:22.110 --> 03:58:22.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:58:25.070 --> 03:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
beyond my question was also going to be
 
03:58:27.110 --> 03:58:27.120 align:start position:0%
how many of them were already coming to
 
03:58:27.120 --> 03:58:28.070 align:start position:0%
how many of them were already coming to
New

03:58:28.070 --> 03:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
New
 
03:58:28.080 --> 03:58:32.389 align:start position:0%
New
Hampshire

03:58:32.389 --> 03:58:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:35.790 --> 03:58:35.800 align:start position:0%
so well except they some somewhere the
 
03:58:39.750 --> 03:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
spike has to be accounted for
 
03:58:42.790 --> 03:58:42.800 align:start position:0%
it shows it my
 
03:58:46.110 --> 03:58:46.120 align:start position:0%
RS it's a terrible way to make a
 
03:58:48.349 --> 03:58:48.359 align:start position:0%
living it
 
03:58:55.030 --> 03:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:58.309 --> 03:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
remember we could part of it people are
 
03:58:59.630 --> 03:58:59.640 align:start position:0%
staying home and
 
03:59:01.870 --> 03:59:01.880 align:start position:0%
smoking yeah we could always depend on
 
03:59:05.469 --> 03:59:05.479 align:start position:0%
our revenue from tobacco taxes to to
 
03:59:09.750 --> 03:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
slowly drop but one massachus was raised
 
03:59:13.389 --> 03:59:13.399 align:start position:0%
got rid of methal right they went
 
03:59:17.870 --> 03:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
quickly higher so it's one
 
03:59:21.630 --> 03:59:21.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:26.630 --> 03:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
o'clock we have two presenters from the

Security so I'm joined today by Brian
 
04:00:02.070 --> 04:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
golob who many of you um have seen
 
04:00:03.990 --> 04:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
before and have heard from before and
 
04:00:07.229 --> 04:00:07.239 align:start position:0%
today he's um in his current role fairly
 
04:00:10.550 --> 04:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
new um um although with the experience
 
04:00:12.189 --> 04:00:12.199 align:start position:0%
we've had over the last 10 months it
 
04:00:15.349 --> 04:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
feels like a lot more in terms of years
 
04:00:17.630 --> 04:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
um that's gone by but Brian is our
 
04:00:19.950 --> 04:00:19.960 align:start position:0%
current director of our economic and
 
04:00:22.790 --> 04:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
labor market information Bureau so what
 
04:00:26.510 --> 04:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
we thought we would do uh for the uh
 
04:00:29.030 --> 04:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
presentation today um we have some
 
04:00:31.189 --> 04:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
slides that we'll be able to share I
 
04:00:33.750 --> 04:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
believe they were promoted up to the
 
04:00:36.550 --> 04:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
website earlier today but we'll share
 
04:00:39.469 --> 04:00:39.479 align:start position:0%
our screen um you'll hear from both uh
 
04:00:42.229 --> 04:00:42.239 align:start position:0%
Brian and myself mostly uh from Brian
 
04:00:44.790 --> 04:00:44.800 align:start position:0%
this is really his wheelhouse um and
 
04:00:47.389 --> 04:00:47.399 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about Workforce uh we'll talk
 
04:00:50.990 --> 04:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
about pandemic and we'll also be able to
 
04:00:53.469 --> 04:00:53.479 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about uh what we've
 
04:00:55.790 --> 04:00:55.800 align:start position:0%
been doing outside of the unemployment
 
04:00:59.349 --> 04:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
program that commissioner Caswell had uh
 
04:01:01.710 --> 04:01:01.720 align:start position:0%
described earlier in his presentation as
 
04:01:04.429 --> 04:01:04.439 align:start position:0%
well with some of our virtual services
 
04:01:06.189 --> 04:01:06.199 align:start position:0%
that we've been providing to help
 
04:01:10.110 --> 04:01:10.120 align:start position:0%
employers connect with job Seekers so um
 
04:01:12.870 --> 04:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
without further Ado I'll um try not to
 
04:01:20.389 --> 04:01:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:25.229 --> 04:01:25.239 align:start position:0%
here and hopefully everyone can um see
 
04:01:30.110 --> 04:01:30.120 align:start position:0%
um slides good job everything looked
 
04:01:32.590 --> 04:01:32.600 align:start position:0%
good okay so I'm I'm gonna be in the
 
04:01:35.950 --> 04:01:35.960 align:start position:0%
driver's seat which uh means that
 
04:01:38.790 --> 04:01:38.800 align:start position:0%
depending on how Mr golob has been
 
04:01:40.630 --> 04:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
behaving and how well he and I have been
 
04:01:43.070 --> 04:01:43.080 align:start position:0%
getting along uh will determine how much
 
04:01:45.590 --> 04:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
I screw around with the presentation um
 
04:01:48.110 --> 04:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
when he thinks he's on one slide and uh
 
04:01:51.670 --> 04:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
I'll move him on to the next uh but um
 
04:01:54.030 --> 04:01:54.040 align:start position:0%
we will uh start with a with an overview
 
04:01:57.030 --> 04:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
of what we'll be what we'll be covering
 
04:01:59.910 --> 04:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
then I'll provide some perspective on
 
04:02:02.950 --> 04:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
some of the claim numbers uh some of the
 
04:02:05.590 --> 04:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
the programs by uh Source in terms of
 
04:02:08.269 --> 04:02:08.279 align:start position:0%
the dollars that we've been paying out
 
04:02:10.590 --> 04:02:10.600 align:start position:0%
uh then we'll transition back to Brian
 
04:02:11.870 --> 04:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
uh then we'll talk a little bit about
 
04:02:15.070 --> 04:02:15.080 align:start position:0%
the trust fund and um then we'll have
 
04:02:17.510 --> 04:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
some more information that Mr gotab will
 
04:02:20.030 --> 04:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
be sharing and obviously look forward to
 
04:02:23.229 --> 04:02:23.239 align:start position:0%
uh questions from the members um as well
 
04:02:27.309 --> 04:02:27.319 align:start position:0%
so um we'll start here with our with our
 
04:02:29.710 --> 04:02:29.720 align:start position:0%
overview um and I'll turn it over to
 
04:02:32.309 --> 04:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
Brian terrific thank you Richard and I'm
 
04:02:34.269 --> 04:02:34.279 align:start position:0%
going to apologize upfront I'm I'm
 
04:02:36.030 --> 04:02:36.040 align:start position:0%
working from home I don't typically do
 
04:02:39.670 --> 04:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
that I have a heating issue um and I
 
04:02:41.790 --> 04:02:41.800 align:start position:0%
also have a dog that loves to bark at
 
04:02:44.229 --> 04:02:44.239 align:start position:0%
the mailman or anybody that walks by the
 
04:02:47.630 --> 04:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
house so unfortunately I may you may
 
04:02:51.110 --> 04:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
hear him barking um so you can all hear
 
04:02:54.870 --> 04:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
me yes all right terrific so uh just as
 
04:02:57.309 --> 04:02:57.319 align:start position:0%
an overview um I think it's pretty clear
 
04:02:59.790 --> 04:02:59.800 align:start position:0%
that the US economy is struggling right
 
04:03:01.830 --> 04:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
now and because New Hampshire's a small
 
04:03:04.030 --> 04:03:04.040 align:start position:0%
economy we are subject to those National
 
04:03:06.269 --> 04:03:06.279 align:start position:0%
forces so we're not immune from the
 
04:03:09.990 --> 04:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
larger National and Regional Trends um
 
04:03:13.389 --> 04:03:13.399 align:start position:0%
so things have taken a step back in the
 
04:03:17.030 --> 04:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
recent months um I said this a couple of
 
04:03:18.750 --> 04:03:18.760 align:start position:0%
months ago that employment possibly
 
04:03:20.429 --> 04:03:20.439 align:start position:0%
could fall in the coming months as the
 
04:03:23.030 --> 04:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic surges last Friday we heard the
 
04:03:24.950 --> 04:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
report or two Fridays ago we heard the
 
04:03:27.830 --> 04:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
report nationally that employment
 
04:03:29.870 --> 04:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
actually declined in the month of
 
04:03:31.790 --> 04:03:31.800 align:start position:0%
December for the first time in seven
 
04:03:34.149 --> 04:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
months and I would expect that that's
 
04:03:36.229 --> 04:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
possible in New Hampshire so the short
 
04:03:38.110 --> 04:03:38.120 align:start position:0%
term is going to be really difficult
 
04:03:40.950 --> 04:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
certainly nationally um but the Outlook
 
04:03:44.110 --> 04:03:44.120 align:start position:0%
is is reasonably weak in New Hampshire
 
04:03:46.349 --> 04:03:46.359 align:start position:0%
as well for the next few months but
 
04:03:49.389 --> 04:03:49.399 align:start position:0%
longer term um very bullish on the New
 
04:03:51.870 --> 04:03:51.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire forecast and most of the risk
 
04:03:55.349 --> 04:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
um in the forecast is to the upside um
 
04:03:58.870 --> 04:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
the national legislators passed a $900
 
04:04:01.070 --> 04:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
million stimulus and that has been
 
04:04:04.670 --> 04:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
important it provided additional PPP uh
 
04:04:07.429 --> 04:04:07.439 align:start position:0%
loans to businesses provided an
 
04:04:09.030 --> 04:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
extension of unemployment benefits a
 
04:04:10.950 --> 04:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
number of other things and I believe
 
04:04:13.950 --> 04:04:13.960 align:start position:0%
that will Stave off us falling back into
 
04:04:16.189 --> 04:04:16.199 align:start position:0%
another recession and there's going to
 
04:04:18.469 --> 04:04:18.479 align:start position:0%
be a new stimulus and that will has
 
04:04:21.830 --> 04:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
caused my forecast to to improve a bit
 
04:04:23.830 --> 04:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
um there's a high probability and I hate
 
04:04:25.670 --> 04:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
to be I'm not pessimistic but there's a
 
04:04:27.189 --> 04:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
high probability that it will be at
 
04:04:31.149 --> 04:04:31.159 align:start position:0%
least 2022 in the second half of 2022
 
04:04:33.349 --> 04:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
before New Hampshire recovers all of the
 
04:04:36.950 --> 04:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
jobs that we've lost uh during the
 
04:04:39.750 --> 04:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
pandemic New Hampshire's again downside
 
04:04:41.750 --> 04:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
risk are mostly short-term and it's
 
04:04:43.830 --> 04:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
related to the path of the pandemic if
 
04:04:45.670 --> 04:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
we can get that under control quicker
 
04:04:47.469 --> 04:04:47.479 align:start position:0%
the forecast looks better in the shorter
 
04:04:50.670 --> 04:04:50.680 align:start position:0%
term but businesses like Hospitality
 
04:04:53.110 --> 04:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
retail anything that uh requires a lot
 
04:04:55.070 --> 04:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
of direct contact personto person
 
04:04:57.510 --> 04:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
contact are going to suffer longer term
 
04:04:59.830 --> 04:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
the risks are much more to the upside we
 
04:05:02.229 --> 04:05:02.239 align:start position:0%
are having improving migration I know
 
04:05:04.830 --> 04:05:04.840 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear from Dr Johnson
 
04:05:06.990 --> 04:05:07.000 align:start position:0%
after this presentation but migration
 
04:05:08.510 --> 04:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
Trends have been Improv improving for a
 
04:05:10.309 --> 04:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
couple of years I think the pandemic if
 
04:05:12.429 --> 04:05:12.439 align:start position:0%
there's one good thing will improve them
 
04:05:15.389 --> 04:05:15.399 align:start position:0%
further and we're seeing a real increase
 
04:05:17.670 --> 04:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
in Innovative and Technology Industries
 
04:05:20.149 --> 04:05:20.159 align:start position:0%
in the State uh there are a lot of
 
04:05:22.030 --> 04:05:22.040 align:start position:0%
challenges there are no there's no doubt
 
04:05:23.590 --> 04:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
and some of the charts that I'm going to
 
04:05:26.349 --> 04:05:26.359 align:start position:0%
show you will present a pretty dire
 
04:05:28.429 --> 04:05:28.439 align:start position:0%
picture of what we've been through and
 
04:05:30.790 --> 04:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
and really where we are right now um so
 
04:05:32.990 --> 04:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
we've got some challenges coming out of
 
04:05:35.830 --> 04:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
the pandemic but I firmly believe that
 
04:05:37.910 --> 04:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
this is going to be better than when we
 
04:05:39.750 --> 04:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
came out of the financial crisis it took
 
04:05:42.149 --> 04:05:42.159 align:start position:0%
us almost a decade to get all those jobs
 
04:05:45.389 --> 04:05:45.399 align:start position:0%
back we'll get the jobs back a lot
 
04:05:49.110 --> 04:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
faster I think that the real issues and
 
04:05:52.790 --> 04:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
and I know I I work for an organization
 
04:05:54.510 --> 04:05:54.520 align:start position:0%
now that that deals with these issues
 
04:05:56.630 --> 04:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
but it it's labor force it's going to be
 
04:05:58.830 --> 04:05:58.840 align:start position:0%
training and retraining and reallocating
 
04:06:00.910 --> 04:06:00.920 align:start position:0%
the labor from the jobs that are no
 
04:06:02.750 --> 04:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
longer in demand that are really going
 
04:06:04.910 --> 04:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
to be the key to getting us back to that
 
04:06:07.389 --> 04:06:07.399 align:start position:0%
level of of employment that we saw pre
 
04:06:07.399 --> 04:06:09.349 align:start position:0%
level of of employment that we saw pre
pandemic

04:06:09.349 --> 04:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
04:06:12.710 --> 04:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
and lastly um rich is going to talk
 
04:06:14.750 --> 04:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
about these but we've taken actions to
 
04:06:16.830 --> 04:06:16.840 align:start position:0%
keep the the unemployment trust fund
 
04:06:19.710 --> 04:06:19.720 align:start position:0%
solvent a lot of States haven't aren't
 
04:06:22.590 --> 04:06:22.600 align:start position:0%
solvent right now and while minimizing
 
04:06:25.189 --> 04:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
the negative impacts um that higher
 
04:06:27.429 --> 04:06:27.439 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance taxes could have
 
04:06:30.189 --> 04:06:30.199 align:start position:0%
on employers during uh a time when most
 
04:06:32.030 --> 04:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
businesses have been financially weaken
 
04:06:33.550 --> 04:06:33.560 align:start position:0%
and with that I'll turn that back over
 
04:06:33.560 --> 04:06:34.429 align:start position:0%
and with that I'll turn that back over
to

04:06:34.429 --> 04:06:34.439 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:06:37.349 --> 04:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
Rich all right thank you Brian so
 
04:06:41.070 --> 04:06:41.080 align:start position:0%
certainly uh uh an aggressive agenda for
 
04:06:43.830 --> 04:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
what we're looking to address here and
 
04:06:46.309 --> 04:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
just to kind of set the stage with what
 
04:06:49.750 --> 04:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
we've experienced during the pandemic um
 
04:06:53.750 --> 04:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
what you see here is just a review of
 
04:06:56.269 --> 04:06:56.279 align:start position:0%
where we were right prior to the
 
04:06:57.910 --> 04:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
pandemic and when I say right prior I
 
04:07:00.710 --> 04:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
mean the week prior uh to starting to
 
04:07:04.870 --> 04:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
get slammed by claims um and what we saw
 
04:07:06.670 --> 04:07:06.680 align:start position:0%
during the height and where we are
 
04:07:08.269 --> 04:07:08.279 align:start position:0%
currently so
 
04:07:10.349 --> 04:07:10.359 align:start position:0%
um continued claims so these are the
 
04:07:14.149 --> 04:07:14.159 align:start position:0%
claims the claims that individuals file
 
04:07:15.750 --> 04:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
um in order to receive weekly
 
04:07:18.830 --> 04:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits this includes all
 
04:07:22.510 --> 04:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
programs available um at the time for
 
04:07:24.830 --> 04:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
each of these uh snapshots that we're
 
04:07:28.670 --> 04:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
providing here so the week prior to uh
 
04:07:32.349 --> 04:07:32.359 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency um and uh prior
 
04:07:35.349 --> 04:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
to the um large demand for unemployment
 
04:07:37.389 --> 04:07:37.399 align:start position:0%
benefits um New Hampshire we were at
 
04:07:43.269 --> 04:07:43.279 align:start position:0%
about 3,900 weekly claims um take a uh
 
04:07:45.510 --> 04:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
step forward to the height of the
 
04:07:48.109 --> 04:07:48.119 align:start position:0%
pandemic um at the beginning of May or
 
04:07:49.790 --> 04:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
at least the current height of the
 
04:07:52.670 --> 04:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
pandemic we all hope right um we were at
 
04:07:55.469 --> 04:07:55.479 align:start position:0%
close to
 
04:07:59.870 --> 04:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
177,000 weekly claims um and now we come
 
04:08:03.510 --> 04:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
to where we are today with um the claims
 
04:08:06.990 --> 04:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
data for the weekending January 2nd and
 
04:08:09.950 --> 04:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
you see that were just over 45,000
 
04:08:13.189 --> 04:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
claims we'll be getting into more of the
 
04:08:16.670 --> 04:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
detail on this in terms of sectors um
 
04:08:18.910 --> 04:08:18.920 align:start position:0%
rate of recovery uh compared to the
 
04:08:20.790 --> 04:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
country as a whole but I thought this
 
04:08:24.910 --> 04:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
was a good um snapshot to see um and get
 
04:08:28.309 --> 04:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
a a good idea of the severity of the
 
04:08:30.870 --> 04:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
impact how quickly it hit and the
 
04:08:33.109 --> 04:08:33.119 align:start position:0%
recovery that we've experienced in a
 
04:08:35.950 --> 04:08:35.960 align:start position:0%
very short period of
 
04:08:39.229 --> 04:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
time um moving on on um when we talk
 
04:08:41.910 --> 04:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
about uh claims just the number of
 
04:08:44.349 --> 04:08:44.359 align:start position:0%
claims we also need to talk about the
 
04:08:48.149 --> 04:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
dollars paid out so we have paid out
 
04:08:52.550 --> 04:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
over uh a billion and a half dollars in
 
04:08:55.229 --> 04:08:55.239 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits during the course
 
04:08:57.550 --> 04:08:57.560 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic to put that into
 
04:08:59.590 --> 04:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
perspective that is more than we paid
 
04:09:04.030 --> 04:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
out in total during the prior decade um
 
04:09:07.070 --> 04:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
and the uh the short period of time that
 
04:09:09.349 --> 04:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
we've been able to get those dollars
 
04:09:12.790 --> 04:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
paid out I think says a lot um of the
 
04:09:15.070 --> 04:09:15.080 align:start position:0%
men and women here at the department who
 
04:09:18.950 --> 04:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
have been uh working incredible hours to
 
04:09:20.830 --> 04:09:20.840 align:start position:0%
make sure those benefits can get out the
 
04:09:23.109 --> 04:09:23.119 align:start position:0%
door and support our communities and
 
04:09:26.149 --> 04:09:26.159 align:start position:0%
support our families uh during the
 
04:09:28.389 --> 04:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic when we look at the
 
04:09:31.309 --> 04:09:31.319 align:start position:0%
breakdown of programs here in the source
 
04:09:33.189 --> 04:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
of those payments I'll run through these
 
04:09:35.550 --> 04:09:35.560 align:start position:0%
sources real quick so folks can get an
 
04:09:37.309 --> 04:09:37.319 align:start position:0%
understanding of where the dollars are
 
04:09:40.510 --> 04:09:40.520 align:start position:0%
coming coming from the first um Source
 
04:09:44.149 --> 04:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
the largest source over $800 million
 
04:09:46.830 --> 04:09:46.840 align:start position:0%
that's been paid out in the form of
 
04:09:50.030 --> 04:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
federal uh uh pandemic unemployment
 
04:09:52.790 --> 04:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
compensation or FPU payments these were
 
04:09:55.309 --> 04:09:55.319 align:start position:0%
originally created by the cares act they
 
04:09:57.109 --> 04:09:57.119 align:start position:0%
originally paid out in the form of a
 
04:10:00.910 --> 04:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
$600 plus up payment that any individual
 
04:10:03.109 --> 04:10:03.119 align:start position:0%
regardless of State program or federal
 
04:10:05.269 --> 04:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
program that they would receive on top
 
04:10:08.149 --> 04:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
of their regular base benefit
 
04:10:10.790 --> 04:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
those went from April through the end of
 
04:10:14.670 --> 04:10:14.680 align:start position:0%
July um that program um Ended as of the
 
04:10:17.590 --> 04:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
end of July and now that program is back
 
04:10:20.910 --> 04:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
so with the uh continuing assistance act
 
04:10:23.710 --> 04:10:23.720 align:start position:0%
that was uh recently passed enacted on
 
04:10:26.910 --> 04:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
December 27th those payments are back at
 
04:10:30.349 --> 04:10:30.359 align:start position:0%
a lower amount they are now $300 a week
 
04:10:32.309 --> 04:10:32.319 align:start position:0%
and those payments uh New Hampshire
 
04:10:34.910 --> 04:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
started paying those uh for weekending
 
04:10:37.670 --> 04:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
January 2nd I believe we were the first
 
04:10:39.830 --> 04:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
state in New England to start getting
 
04:10:42.030 --> 04:10:42.040 align:start position:0%
those new dollars out the door to
 
04:10:44.870 --> 04:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
individuals um and those payments will
 
04:10:49.229 --> 04:10:49.239 align:start position:0%
continue until weekending uh March 13th
 
04:10:51.990 --> 04:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
unless they are further extended uh with
 
04:10:55.630 --> 04:10:55.640 align:start position:0%
a a subsequent relief bill the Second
 
04:10:58.189 --> 04:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
Source here is Pua that is pandemic
 
04:11:00.469 --> 04:11:00.479 align:start position:0%
unemployment assistance that is a
 
04:11:03.189 --> 04:11:03.199 align:start position:0%
another program created by the cares act
 
04:11:05.389 --> 04:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
provides eligibility to those that would
 
04:11:07.870 --> 04:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
not traditionally find them eles
 
04:11:10.309 --> 04:11:10.319 align:start position:0%
eligible for unemployment benefits so
 
04:11:12.469 --> 04:11:12.479 align:start position:0%
these are your self-employed these are
 
04:11:14.389 --> 04:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
your gig workers so you're traditionally
 
04:11:16.710 --> 04:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
non-covered employees but it also
 
04:11:18.870 --> 04:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
includes those people that have been
 
04:11:21.910 --> 04:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
impacted by a recognized covid related
 
04:11:24.229 --> 04:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
scenario where they've had to remove
 
04:11:26.389 --> 04:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
themselves from the labor force and are
 
04:11:28.830 --> 04:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
now eligible for unemployment benefits
 
04:11:31.870 --> 04:11:31.880 align:start position:0%
all paid out of the uh federal dollars
 
04:11:33.790 --> 04:11:33.800 align:start position:0%
that have made made available to New
 
04:11:35.750 --> 04:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so again neither of those
 
04:11:38.389 --> 04:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
first two sources impact to the New
 
04:11:40.910 --> 04:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire trust fund our third Source
 
04:11:43.149 --> 04:11:43.159 align:start position:0%
here uh that we've included in red
 
04:11:44.870 --> 04:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
because that does impact to the New
 
04:11:46.750 --> 04:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire trust fund is State
 
04:11:48.910 --> 04:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance we've paid out
 
04:11:48.920 --> 04:11:49.790 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance we've paid out
about

04:11:49.790 --> 04:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:11:52.790 --> 04:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
$278 million in state unemployment
 
04:11:55.309 --> 04:11:55.319 align:start position:0%
insurance during the pandemic that has
 
04:11:56.990 --> 04:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
come out of the trust fund we have some
 
04:11:59.389 --> 04:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
slides coming up to show where the trust
 
04:12:02.429 --> 04:12:02.439 align:start position:0%
fund um has been going um and where uh
 
04:12:06.149 --> 04:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
we are forecasting it to go during 2021
 
04:12:09.109 --> 04:12:09.119 align:start position:0%
our last two sources is here our lwa
 
04:12:11.429 --> 04:12:11.439 align:start position:0%
this is lost wages assistance this was
 
04:12:13.790 --> 04:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
the program created by Presidential
 
04:12:18.269 --> 04:12:18.279 align:start position:0%
memorandum uh back um in uh August uh
 
04:12:22.349 --> 04:12:22.359 align:start position:0%
paid benefits um in uh during September
 
04:12:24.269 --> 04:12:24.279 align:start position:0%
this was all federally paid this was a
 
04:12:28.189 --> 04:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
$300 add-on U that was provided by the
 
04:12:30.309 --> 04:12:30.319 align:start position:0%
federal government administered through
 
04:12:34.189 --> 04:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
FEMA when the $600 program first expired
 
04:12:36.750 --> 04:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
so we've paid out a total of $88 million
 
04:12:39.149 --> 04:12:39.159 align:start position:0%
there those those weeks um that program
 
04:12:42.349 --> 04:12:42.359 align:start position:0%
has since expired the last program here
 
04:12:45.469 --> 04:12:45.479 align:start position:0%
is PE this is federally paid this is
 
04:12:47.269 --> 04:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
pandemic Emergency Unemployment
 
04:12:50.830 --> 04:12:50.840 align:start position:0%
Compensation we've paid out $27 million
 
04:12:52.389 --> 04:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
these are the benefits paid to
 
04:12:55.750 --> 04:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
individuals that exhaust their 26 weeks
 
04:12:58.950 --> 04:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
of state unemployment insurance so folks
 
04:13:01.990 --> 04:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
first start on UI there in the red uh
 
04:13:03.750 --> 04:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
for those traditional types of
 
04:13:07.189 --> 04:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
employment losses more um we looking at
 
04:13:09.950 --> 04:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
temporary and permanent layoffs um then
 
04:13:12.790 --> 04:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
when those 26 weeks expire those folks
 
04:13:15.429 --> 04:13:15.439 align:start position:0%
then move over to the federally uh
 
04:13:17.790 --> 04:13:17.800 align:start position:0%
provided extension of 13 weeks which is
 
04:13:22.189 --> 04:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
the PE so we would expect um as um those
 
04:13:24.790 --> 04:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
impacts continue um more of those folks
 
04:13:27.830 --> 04:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
are going to be transitioning onto onto
 
04:13:30.950 --> 04:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
PE as uh depending on the nature of
 
04:13:33.870 --> 04:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
their employment loss and um their um
 
04:13:35.750 --> 04:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
prospects for
 
04:13:39.109 --> 04:13:39.119 align:start position:0%
returning now move it I'll move it back
 
04:13:45.510 --> 04:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:48.950 --> 04:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
Brian now I'm unmuted Thank you Rich um
 
04:13:50.870 --> 04:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
this chart just shows where we've come
 
04:13:54.189 --> 04:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
from and puts the pandemic related
 
04:13:56.710 --> 04:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
unemployment in perspective compared to
 
04:13:58.790 --> 04:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
the Great Recession my charts where I
 
04:14:00.469 --> 04:14:00.479 align:start position:0%
have comparisons New Hampshire will
 
04:14:02.830 --> 04:14:02.840 align:start position:0%
always be the red line Massachusetts I
 
04:14:05.189 --> 04:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
use the blue line and a black line
 
04:14:07.269 --> 04:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
either a dashed or solid black line for
 
04:14:09.630 --> 04:14:09.640 align:start position:0%
the us and this just Compares what we've
 
04:14:13.109 --> 04:14:13.119 align:start position:0%
been through in the pandemic recession
 
04:14:14.750 --> 04:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
with the Great Recession which we all
 
04:14:16.750 --> 04:14:16.760 align:start position:0%
thought was the worst recession we
 
04:14:20.910 --> 04:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
encountered in decades um to put it into
 
04:14:23.510 --> 04:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
perspective we lost about three times
 
04:14:26.510 --> 04:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
the number of jobs um during the
 
04:14:29.469 --> 04:14:29.479 align:start position:0%
pandemic recession and we lost them in a
 
04:14:32.670 --> 04:14:32.680 align:start position:0%
period of just a few months compared to
 
04:14:34.750 --> 04:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
about a year and a half in the over the
 
04:14:37.710 --> 04:14:37.720 align:start position:0%
Great Recession it also shows you where
 
04:14:40.910 --> 04:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
we've come back and this data stops at
 
04:14:44.389 --> 04:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
November um I will tell you that our
 
04:14:46.269 --> 04:14:46.279 align:start position:0%
employment estimates will be coming out
 
04:14:48.149 --> 04:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
tomorrow from the Department I cannot
 
04:14:51.229 --> 04:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
discuss them now um but tomorrow we'll
 
04:14:54.030 --> 04:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
have new numbers but it shows where we
 
04:14:56.910 --> 04:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
are in relation to our neighbors and by
 
04:14:58.590 --> 04:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
the way most we're doing better than
 
04:15:01.229 --> 04:15:01.239 align:start position:0%
most of most of our neighbors um but we
 
04:15:03.349 --> 04:15:03.359 align:start position:0%
haven't come we didn't we fell a little
 
04:15:04.910 --> 04:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
bit further than the us and we haven't
 
04:15:07.630 --> 04:15:07.640 align:start position:0%
come back quite as far
 
04:15:09.670 --> 04:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
so next slide and again just for
 
04:15:11.309 --> 04:15:11.319 align:start position:0%
perspective this just shows what's
 
04:15:14.550 --> 04:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
happened to initial unemployment claims
 
04:15:17.229 --> 04:15:17.239 align:start position:0%
um during the pandemic um and just to
 
04:15:19.870 --> 04:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
put put into perspective uh Rich talked
 
04:15:21.870 --> 04:15:21.880 align:start position:0%
about the hard work and the and the
 
04:15:24.269 --> 04:15:24.279 align:start position:0%
extra hours that people put in um I was
 
04:15:26.189 --> 04:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
not one of those people but I can tell
 
04:15:28.149 --> 04:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
you that the hours that people put in
 
04:15:30.510 --> 04:15:30.520 align:start position:0%
trying to process these claims was just
 
04:15:32.910 --> 04:15:32.920 align:start position:0%
incredible people were were working
 
04:15:35.109 --> 04:15:35.119 align:start position:0%
incredible hours um and I think our
 
04:15:37.990 --> 04:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
state did a great job um continued
 
04:15:39.950 --> 04:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
weekly unemployment claims the ones that
 
04:15:43.189 --> 04:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
are paid on a regular weekly basis um
 
04:15:45.510 --> 04:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
this just shows you the trend line um we
 
04:15:48.269 --> 04:15:48.279 align:start position:0%
were falling uh considerably faster than
 
04:15:52.469 --> 04:15:52.479 align:start position:0%
the the US um during the earlier part of
 
04:15:55.269 --> 04:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
the of the pandemic uh during the summer
 
04:15:57.149 --> 04:15:57.159 align:start position:0%
you can see where where we were these
 
04:15:59.349 --> 04:15:59.359 align:start position:0%
are index numbers so we can look at them
 
04:16:01.590 --> 04:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
on the same scale but more recently
 
04:16:03.670 --> 04:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
we've kind of flattened out and the US
 
04:16:05.389 --> 04:16:05.399 align:start position:0%
has flattened out a bit as well but
 
04:16:07.429 --> 04:16:07.439 align:start position:0%
we've flattened out a little bit more
 
04:16:09.309 --> 04:16:09.319 align:start position:0%
so we haven't made the same progress
 
04:16:11.870 --> 04:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
over the last couple of months still and
 
04:16:14.710 --> 04:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
I think this is important um comparing
 
04:16:18.389 --> 04:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
us to the rest of the region um this
 
04:16:20.990 --> 04:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
chart shows every state and the
 
04:16:23.309 --> 04:16:23.319 align:start position:0%
percentage of individuals who are
 
04:16:25.750 --> 04:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
collecting one of those different forms
 
04:16:27.990 --> 04:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
of unemployment compensation that Rich
 
04:16:31.910 --> 04:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
talked about Pua um Regular
 
04:16:36.070 --> 04:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
uip as a percentage of the preco labor
 
04:16:38.750 --> 04:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
force and a lot of difficulty in
 
04:16:41.389 --> 04:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
assessing actually the the labor force
 
04:16:44.309 --> 04:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
numbers so I like to start with the
 
04:16:48.510 --> 04:16:48.520 align:start position:0%
February numbers and show how many as
 
04:16:49.950 --> 04:16:49.960 align:start position:0%
how many people are collecting
 
04:16:51.870 --> 04:16:51.880 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits in our state
 
04:16:53.630 --> 04:16:53.640 align:start position:0%
compared to all the other states and
 
04:16:55.309 --> 04:16:55.319 align:start position:0%
what you see is that we are better than
 
04:16:57.910 --> 04:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
every other state in the Northeast and
 
04:17:00.349 --> 04:17:00.359 align:start position:0%
every other state in New
 
04:17:02.710 --> 04:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
England so I'll turn it back over to
 
04:17:04.229 --> 04:17:04.239 align:start position:0%
Rich and he can talk a little bit about
 
04:17:08.469 --> 04:17:08.479 align:start position:0%
some of the impacts on the trust fund
 
04:17:10.870 --> 04:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Brian so and looking at at
 
04:17:14.670 --> 04:17:14.680 align:start position:0%
trust fund impact um you'll see I'll
 
04:17:17.550 --> 04:17:17.560 align:start position:0%
just um go through and include all of
 
04:17:20.349 --> 04:17:20.359 align:start position:0%
the information on this slide um I think
 
04:17:22.670 --> 04:17:22.680 align:start position:0%
it's important to distinguish here with
 
04:17:24.630 --> 04:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
trust fund impact not only with the
 
04:17:27.070 --> 04:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
experience of other states um and
 
04:17:29.189 --> 04:17:29.199 align:start position:0%
experience of other New England states
 
04:17:33.109 --> 04:17:33.119 align:start position:0%
but also to compare and contrast the
 
04:17:36.349 --> 04:17:36.359 align:start position:0%
experience that employers have had uh
 
04:17:38.550 --> 04:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
thus far are what we're projecting that
 
04:17:41.309 --> 04:17:41.319 align:start position:0%
they will have through the rest of 2021
 
04:17:42.990 --> 04:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
and we compare that back to the
 
04:17:45.510 --> 04:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
experience of employers in the Great
 
04:17:48.389 --> 04:17:48.399 align:start position:0%
Recession um so so right now um you'll
 
04:17:51.349 --> 04:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
see this first bullet 18 states have
 
04:17:54.149 --> 04:17:54.159 align:start position:0%
depleted their unemployment trust funds
 
04:17:55.790 --> 04:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
they are currently borrowing from the
 
04:17:58.109 --> 04:17:58.119 align:start position:0%
federal treasury in order to pay their
 
04:18:00.429 --> 04:18:00.439 align:start position:0%
weekly unemployment benefits I believe
 
04:18:03.469 --> 04:18:03.479 align:start position:0%
we have 21 states that are are lined up
 
04:18:05.630 --> 04:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
in the queue so another three that are
 
04:18:08.790 --> 04:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
about to join that group um and and here
 
04:18:11.070 --> 04:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
in New England uh we have Connecticut
 
04:18:13.750 --> 04:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
and uh Massachusetts uh that are both
 
04:18:16.790 --> 04:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
borrowing uh from the uh from the um
 
04:18:18.990 --> 04:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
Federal uh treasury in order to pay
 
04:18:21.109 --> 04:18:21.119 align:start position:0%
their unemployment benefits as folks
 
04:18:23.189 --> 04:18:23.199 align:start position:0%
remember New Hampshire did borrow back
 
04:18:25.349 --> 04:18:25.359 align:start position:0%
during the Great Recession uh we
 
04:18:27.790 --> 04:18:27.800 align:start position:0%
borrowed uh two times during the the
 
04:18:30.429 --> 04:18:30.439 align:start position:0%
Great Recession for a total of about
 
04:18:30.439 --> 04:18:32.030 align:start position:0%
Great Recession for a total of about
10020

04:18:32.030 --> 04:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
10020
 
04:18:36.790 --> 04:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
million um and uh there were uh 30 to
 
04:18:40.109 --> 04:18:40.119 align:start position:0%
believe 32 states uh that borrowed
 
04:18:43.910 --> 04:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
during the Great Recession um so what we
 
04:18:45.910 --> 04:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
what we've seen here and what have
 
04:18:48.750 --> 04:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
employers have experienced and I and I
 
04:18:52.269 --> 04:18:52.279 align:start position:0%
don't want to minimize the impact on
 
04:18:55.030 --> 04:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
employers um by getting to the the good
 
04:18:57.109 --> 04:18:57.119 align:start position:0%
news here about search charges that have
 
04:19:00.109 --> 04:19:00.119 align:start position:0%
been removed um dollars that have been
 
04:19:02.750 --> 04:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
infused into the trust fund um because I
 
04:19:04.790 --> 04:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
I think we need to talk about the the
 
04:19:06.149 --> 04:19:06.159 align:start position:0%
experience that they've had and what
 
04:19:08.389 --> 04:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
they've seen in their tax rates for
 
04:19:11.149 --> 04:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
unemployment compensation purposes uh
 
04:19:14.590 --> 04:19:14.600 align:start position:0%
but with the onslaught of the pandemic
 
04:19:17.189 --> 04:19:17.199 align:start position:0%
and how quickly it hit the immediate
 
04:19:21.149 --> 04:19:21.159 align:start position:0%
impact on employers was with the loss of
 
04:19:23.269 --> 04:19:23.279 align:start position:0%
what the statute refers to as the fund
 
04:19:26.189 --> 04:19:26.199 align:start position:0%
balance reduction um we have set in
 
04:19:28.830 --> 04:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
statute all of our solvency controls for
 
04:19:32.030 --> 04:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
the unemployment trust fund um employers
 
04:19:35.630 --> 04:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
leading up to the pandemic they had a
 
04:19:35.640 --> 04:19:37.189 align:start position:0%
leading up to the pandemic they had a
1.5%

04:19:37.189 --> 04:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
1.5%
 
04:19:40.229 --> 04:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
uh fund balance reduction so that is a
 
04:19:43.469 --> 04:19:43.479 align:start position:0%
uh reduction on their earned rate um to
 
04:19:45.710 --> 04:19:45.720 align:start position:0%
put that into perspective a new employer
 
04:19:47.710 --> 04:19:47.720 align:start position:0%
coming into New Hampshire starts with a
 
04:19:49.790 --> 04:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
earned rate of
 
04:19:53.469 --> 04:19:53.479 align:start position:0%
2.7% uh they pay that on the first
 
04:19:57.790 --> 04:19:57.800 align:start position:0%
$144,000 in annual wages per employee
 
04:19:59.670 --> 04:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
and so a
 
04:20:03.189 --> 04:20:03.199 align:start position:0%
1.5% reduction on that is a significant
 
04:20:07.229 --> 04:20:07.239 align:start position:0%
impact on that overall uh payment from
 
04:20:11.189 --> 04:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
that employer based on the annual um
 
04:20:14.349 --> 04:20:14.359 align:start position:0%
compensation to each of their employees
 
04:20:18.830 --> 04:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
um the uh uh thresholds that the statute
 
04:20:21.990 --> 04:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
sets for those fund balance reductions
 
04:20:24.950 --> 04:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
um will work backwards on this so um the
 
04:20:28.870 --> 04:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
$300 Mark when the fund is above that
 
04:20:31.109 --> 04:20:31.119 align:start position:0%
that's where the statute sets the
 
04:20:33.309 --> 04:20:33.319 align:start position:0%
highest reduction to employers that's
 
04:20:36.229 --> 04:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
what employers had prior to the pandemic
 
04:20:39.349 --> 04:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
they had had that 1.5% reduction when
 
04:20:41.590 --> 04:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
the fund fell below
 
04:20:44.510 --> 04:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
300 that reduction went from
 
04:20:47.030 --> 04:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
1.5% to
 
04:20:51.109 --> 04:20:51.119 align:start position:0%
1.0% then when the fund fell below 100
 
04:20:52.790 --> 04:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
um uh sorry
 
04:20:57.630 --> 04:20:57.640 align:start position:0%
$275 million that reduction went from 1%
 
04:20:57.640 --> 04:20:58.990 align:start position:0%
$275 million that reduction went from 1%
to

04:20:58.990 --> 04:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:21:02.149 --> 04:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
0.5% and then when the fund fell below
 
04:21:05.990 --> 04:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
$250 million employers went back to
 
04:21:09.429 --> 04:21:09.439 align:start position:0%
neutral so they are at their earned rate
 
04:21:12.389 --> 04:21:12.399 align:start position:0%
without a fund balance reduction now as
 
04:21:15.269 --> 04:21:15.279 align:start position:0%
Brian had just described and you saw in
 
04:21:19.070 --> 04:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
those uh charts thus far the the speed
 
04:21:21.950 --> 04:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
with which the pandemic hit um we were
 
04:21:25.269 --> 04:21:25.279 align:start position:0%
receiving um the same number of initial
 
04:21:28.109 --> 04:21:28.119 align:start position:0%
claims per week as we had previously
 
04:21:31.870 --> 04:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
been receiving in an entire year so the
 
04:21:35.590 --> 04:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
impact was Swift and it was significant
 
04:21:38.590 --> 04:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
um so what happened was along with that
 
04:21:41.710 --> 04:21:41.720 align:start position:0%
loss of the 1 and a 12% fund balance
 
04:21:45.630 --> 04:21:45.640 align:start position:0%
reduction employers also had a statutory
 
04:21:48.870 --> 04:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
search charge of a half percent that was
 
04:21:51.630 --> 04:21:51.640 align:start position:0%
added to their earned rate so this first
 
04:21:55.229 --> 04:21:55.239 align:start position:0%
went on in the third quarter of 2020
 
04:21:58.510 --> 04:21:58.520 align:start position:0%
that's calendar quarter um and it stayed
 
04:22:02.070 --> 04:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
on for the fourth quarter of calendar
 
04:22:02.080 --> 04:22:03.109 align:start position:0%
on for the fourth quarter of calendar
year

04:22:03.109 --> 04:22:03.119 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:22:06.750 --> 04:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
2020 now getting to the the the good
 
04:22:08.670 --> 04:22:08.680 align:start position:0%
news the good part about this for
 
04:22:10.590 --> 04:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
employers and where we really
 
04:22:12.950 --> 04:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
differentiate ourselves from the
 
04:22:15.630 --> 04:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
experiences during the Great Recession
 
04:22:19.149 --> 04:22:19.159 align:start position:0%
um was that because of steps that have
 
04:22:21.750 --> 04:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
been taken throughout the pandemic to
 
04:22:24.910 --> 04:22:24.920 align:start position:0%
try to ease the impact on employers
 
04:22:26.630 --> 04:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
we've been able to do some things that
 
04:22:30.510 --> 04:22:30.520 align:start position:0%
weren't done previously um one is that
 
04:22:33.269 --> 04:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
the sech charge that had been applied in
 
04:22:35.710 --> 04:22:35.720 align:start position:0%
the third and fourth quarter we have
 
04:22:37.670 --> 04:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
been able to to remove that for the
 
04:22:39.550 --> 04:22:39.560 align:start position:0%
current quarter that we in that we are
 
04:22:41.670 --> 04:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
in that is the and for most employers
 
04:22:44.030 --> 04:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
that's their most expensive quarter
 
04:22:45.630 --> 04:22:45.640 align:start position:0%
because again you're you're paying at
 
04:22:48.590 --> 04:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
your earned rate on the first $14,000 in
 
04:22:51.710 --> 04:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
annual wages paid to your
 
04:22:54.189 --> 04:22:54.199 align:start position:0%
employees um and we've been able to do
 
04:22:57.710 --> 04:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
that because of that $50 million that
 
04:23:00.070 --> 04:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
was infused into the New Hampshire trust
 
04:23:03.870 --> 04:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
fund from the federal cares act um Flex
 
04:23:06.349 --> 04:23:06.359 align:start position:0%
funds that commissioner Caswell had
 
04:23:09.149 --> 04:23:09.159 align:start position:0%
talked about earlier today during his
 
04:23:11.750 --> 04:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
presentation so that allowed us to
 
04:23:15.030 --> 04:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
remove the sear charge uh for the first
 
04:23:19.149 --> 04:23:19.159 align:start position:0%
quarter um it allowed us not to ever
 
04:23:23.109 --> 04:23:23.119 align:start position:0%
Implement at least to date um to not
 
04:23:26.950 --> 04:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
implement the second 0.5% search charge
 
04:23:30.389 --> 04:23:30.399 align:start position:0%
that is contained within statute um so
 
04:23:33.510 --> 04:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
those two measures um provide a
 
04:23:36.830 --> 04:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
significant amount of relief to employer
 
04:23:39.469 --> 04:23:39.479 align:start position:0%
um and taken together that's about a $65
 
04:23:43.670 --> 04:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
million Savings in tax payments for
 
04:23:47.109 --> 04:23:47.119 align:start position:0%
employers um because of that infusion
 
04:23:50.590 --> 04:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
from the uh Flex funds um that we talked
 
04:23:53.109 --> 04:23:53.119 align:start position:0%
about and and finally the last bullet
 
04:23:55.710 --> 04:23:55.720 align:start position:0%
here something that um often doesn't get
 
04:23:58.870 --> 04:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned is that another significant
 
04:24:02.309 --> 04:24:02.319 align:start position:0%
factor that's keeping employer their tax
 
04:24:05.469 --> 04:24:05.479 align:start position:0%
rates lower during the pandemic as
 
04:24:08.070 --> 04:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
compared to Great Recession is that all
 
04:24:11.109 --> 04:24:11.119 align:start position:0%
of the benefits that we are paying out
 
04:24:13.149 --> 04:24:13.159 align:start position:0%
um that those numbers that we previously
 
04:24:15.149 --> 04:24:15.159 align:start position:0%
saw for the amount coming out of the
 
04:24:17.349 --> 04:24:17.359 align:start position:0%
state unemployment trust fund those
 
04:24:19.550 --> 04:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
would normally be charged against the
 
04:24:21.790 --> 04:24:21.800 align:start position:0%
experience of employers so that would
 
04:24:23.590 --> 04:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
have a negative impact on the
 
04:24:26.710 --> 04:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
calculation of their rates going forward
 
04:24:29.030 --> 04:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh because of a provision that Governor
 
04:24:32.630 --> 04:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
sununu included in the original um
 
04:24:36.229 --> 04:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
emergency um order that was issued back
 
04:24:39.109 --> 04:24:39.119 align:start position:0%
in March emergency order five those
 
04:24:41.349 --> 04:24:41.359 align:start position:0%
benefits are being direct charged to the
 
04:24:44.109 --> 04:24:44.119 align:start position:0%
trust fund and those employers are not
 
04:24:46.030 --> 04:24:46.040 align:start position:0%
having a negative impact on their
 
04:24:51.389 --> 04:24:51.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:54.830 --> 04:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
that and with this slide we now see what
 
04:24:58.109 --> 04:24:58.119 align:start position:0%
the projection uh both what the actual
 
04:25:00.389 --> 04:25:00.399 align:start position:0%
experience and what the projection looks
 
04:25:04.469 --> 04:25:04.479 align:start position:0%
like for the trust fund going through
 
04:25:07.550 --> 04:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
2021 um this includes obviously the 50
 
04:25:10.070 --> 04:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
million that has been infused and there
 
04:25:12.229 --> 04:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
are a lot of assumptions that Brian and
 
04:25:14.710 --> 04:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
his team make um and and trying to
 
04:25:17.510 --> 04:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
forecast out the performance of the fund
 
04:25:19.630 --> 04:25:19.640 align:start position:0%
the the speed and the severity of the
 
04:25:21.790 --> 04:25:21.800 align:start position:0%
pandemic really make that difficult to
 
04:25:24.670 --> 04:25:24.680 align:start position:0%
do um um and certainly make it almost
 
04:25:27.349 --> 04:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
impossible to do much further out than
 
04:25:31.429 --> 04:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
2021 with any degree of accuracy U but
 
04:25:34.590 --> 04:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
what we are looking at here is that um
 
04:25:36.750 --> 04:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
we're looking to stay solvent through
 
04:25:38.109 --> 04:25:38.119 align:start position:0%
the end of
 
04:25:41.550 --> 04:25:41.560 align:start position:0%
2021 um again those other 21 states that
 
04:25:43.550 --> 04:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
are currently borrowing we are not
 
04:25:46.870 --> 04:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
looking to join them right now um and
 
04:25:48.750 --> 04:25:48.760 align:start position:0%
we'll continue to obviously be
 
04:25:52.229 --> 04:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
monitoring this um and obviously the
 
04:25:56.109 --> 04:25:56.119 align:start position:0%
impact that the extensions of programs
 
04:25:58.790 --> 04:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
and federally paid benefits have on this
 
04:26:03.109 --> 04:26:03.119 align:start position:0%
projection is enormous um both um with
 
04:26:05.510 --> 04:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
those that uh were providing the
 
04:26:09.590 --> 04:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
additional $300 uh dollar um that can
 
04:26:13.030 --> 04:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
have an impact of prolonging uh the
 
04:26:14.950 --> 04:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
duration of of an employment of an
 
04:26:17.309 --> 04:26:17.319 align:start position:0%
unemployment claim but also on the flip
 
04:26:20.349 --> 04:26:20.359 align:start position:0%
side of that uh by the um extension of
 
04:26:23.429 --> 04:26:23.439 align:start position:0%
those federally paid programs with Pua
 
04:26:26.710 --> 04:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
and PE EU that is preventing um a
 
04:26:28.670 --> 04:26:28.680 align:start position:0%
certain percentage of those individuals
 
04:26:30.389 --> 04:26:30.399 align:start position:0%
from falling back onto the state
 
04:26:33.950 --> 04:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
unemployment fund so both a positive and
 
04:26:36.990 --> 04:26:37.000 align:start position:0%
negative impact um on
 
04:26:39.830 --> 04:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
the state trust fund and now we'll turn
 
04:26:41.309 --> 04:26:41.319 align:start position:0%
it back over to
 
04:26:45.309 --> 04:26:45.319 align:start position:0%
Brian sure um just getting back to where
 
04:26:48.070 --> 04:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
we have where we were and where we are
 
04:26:50.670 --> 04:26:50.680 align:start position:0%
now this chart I like this chart because
 
04:26:53.229 --> 04:26:53.239 align:start position:0%
it's one done by an independent group uh
 
04:26:55.870 --> 04:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
Moody's Analytics and and CNN business
 
04:26:58.630 --> 04:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
put together a what they call a back to
 
04:27:00.830 --> 04:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
normal index and it basically is looking
 
04:27:03.429 --> 04:27:03.439 align:start position:0%
to track the progress that each State's
 
04:27:05.710 --> 04:27:05.720 align:start position:0%
economy and the nation's economy has
 
04:27:08.030 --> 04:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
made made uh during the pandemic and
 
04:27:10.550 --> 04:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
progressing back to what their pre
 
04:27:13.309 --> 04:27:13.319 align:start position:0%
pandemic economic activity level of
 
04:27:15.469 --> 04:27:15.479 align:start position:0%
economic activity was and what you see
 
04:27:16.990 --> 04:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
from this chart again New Hampshire's
 
04:27:19.469 --> 04:27:19.479 align:start position:0%
the red line you see how much further
 
04:27:21.950 --> 04:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
and faster we were
 
04:27:25.550 --> 04:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
progressing um in recovering from the
 
04:27:29.510 --> 04:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
pandemic until um relatively early in
 
04:27:34.710 --> 04:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
the fall um September and October um it
 
04:27:36.189 --> 04:27:36.199 align:start position:0%
since that time we've really really
 
04:27:38.510 --> 04:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
taken uh a couple of steps back and when
 
04:27:40.630 --> 04:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
you think about why would that be well
 
04:27:43.790 --> 04:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
the one factor that's really changed um
 
04:27:45.590 --> 04:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
was is the progress in the in the
 
04:27:48.070 --> 04:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
pandemic in the speed the Resurgence of
 
04:27:50.309 --> 04:27:50.319 align:start position:0%
the of the pandemic which has restricted
 
04:27:52.590 --> 04:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
people's economic activity and it really
 
04:27:57.149 --> 04:27:57.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't have um a lot to do with any
 
04:27:59.269 --> 04:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
mandated restrictions it's just that
 
04:28:01.550 --> 04:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
people are reluctant to do and and
 
04:28:03.389 --> 04:28:03.399 align:start position:0%
engage in a lot of the economic
 
04:28:05.550 --> 04:28:05.560 align:start position:0%
activities that they normally normally
 
04:28:07.950 --> 04:28:07.960 align:start position:0%
would engageing even if there weren't
 
04:28:10.830 --> 04:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
any restrictions we would still see
 
04:28:13.349 --> 04:28:13.359 align:start position:0%
people being reluctant to engage in
 
04:28:15.630 --> 04:28:15.640 align:start position:0%
their normal economic activities and we
 
04:28:17.550 --> 04:28:17.560 align:start position:0%
would be seeing a similar kind of of
 
04:28:19.389 --> 04:28:19.399 align:start position:0%
trend line
 
04:28:22.149 --> 04:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
here um just to make that point a little
 
04:28:24.750 --> 04:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
bit clear this is um the red line again
 
04:28:27.750 --> 04:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
is that Moody's back to normal index and
 
04:28:31.710 --> 04:28:31.720 align:start position:0%
the blue line is a an indicator that was
 
04:28:33.910 --> 04:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
put together by the Dallas Federal
 
04:28:36.389 --> 04:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
Reserve Bank um
 
04:28:38.950 --> 04:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
one of the challenges that we have faced
 
04:28:41.670 --> 04:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic is getting uh
 
04:28:44.269 --> 04:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
information and data on a realtime basis
 
04:28:46.429 --> 04:28:46.439 align:start position:0%
a lot of the data that we produce that
 
04:28:48.309 --> 04:28:48.319 align:start position:0%
all government agencies federal and
 
04:28:50.830 --> 04:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
state produce comes with a pretty
 
04:28:53.070 --> 04:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
significant lag so I've looked at things
 
04:28:56.349 --> 04:28:56.359 align:start position:0%
like um Google mobility and open table
 
04:28:58.990 --> 04:28:59.000 align:start position:0%
which are done by private sector sources
 
04:29:01.309 --> 04:29:01.319 align:start position:0%
um but are presented on a much more
 
04:29:05.149 --> 04:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
timely basis this looks at the Dallas
 
04:29:07.389 --> 04:29:07.399 align:start position:0%
fed Mobility IND looks at a number of
 
04:29:08.630 --> 04:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
different measures and I don't want to
 
04:29:10.469 --> 04:29:10.479 align:start position:0%
get into the weeds here but basically it
 
04:29:12.630 --> 04:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
measures how mobile people are in a
 
04:29:15.149 --> 04:29:15.159 align:start position:0%
state or the nation compared to how much
 
04:29:17.790 --> 04:29:17.800 align:start position:0%
they moved about in prior to the
 
04:29:20.149 --> 04:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
pandemic so that Mobility includes trips
 
04:29:24.510 --> 04:29:24.520 align:start position:0%
to workplaces trips to for shopping um
 
04:29:26.429 --> 04:29:26.439 align:start position:0%
how much time they spend away from their
 
04:29:29.269 --> 04:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
home a whole host about seven or eight
 
04:29:31.590 --> 04:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh metrics that they combined into it so
 
04:29:33.990 --> 04:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
I looked at that and compared how New
 
04:29:35.710 --> 04:29:35.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was moving about our res
 
04:29:37.710 --> 04:29:37.720 align:start position:0%
residents were moving about compared to
 
04:29:40.389 --> 04:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
the economic uh back to normal index and
 
04:29:42.229 --> 04:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
what you see is almost a perfect
 
04:29:44.389 --> 04:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
correlation there so the fact that
 
04:29:47.830 --> 04:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
people are not moving about um is really
 
04:29:50.389 --> 04:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
the reason why that back to normal index
 
04:29:52.670 --> 04:29:52.680 align:start position:0%
isn't there so when we get the pandemic
 
04:29:55.670 --> 04:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
more fully under control as vaccines
 
04:29:57.950 --> 04:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
become more widely available hopefully
 
04:29:59.790 --> 04:29:59.800 align:start position:0%
during the summer when almost everyone
 
04:30:01.830 --> 04:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
is vaccinated everyone who wants to be
 
04:30:04.030 --> 04:30:04.040 align:start position:0%
vaccinated um the economy should
 
04:30:06.189 --> 04:30:06.199 align:start position:0%
definitely pick up at a much uh more
 
04:30:06.199 --> 04:30:07.990 align:start position:0%
definitely pick up at a much uh more
rapid

04:30:07.990 --> 04:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
rapid
 
04:30:11.030 --> 04:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
Pace this chart again data will be
 
04:30:12.910 --> 04:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
coming out tomorrow but it shows the
 
04:30:15.269 --> 04:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
progress in regaining private sector
 
04:30:18.349 --> 04:30:18.359 align:start position:0%
jobs in New Hampshire um pre-pandemic
 
04:30:21.550 --> 04:30:21.560 align:start position:0%
post pandemic or we're not post pandemic
 
04:30:23.870 --> 04:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
yet unfortunately but we peaked at about
 
04:30:26.990 --> 04:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
just over 600,000 private sector jobs
 
04:30:31.070 --> 04:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
early in 2020 we lost over a 100,000 of
 
04:30:32.950 --> 04:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
those jobs during the pandemic at one
 
04:30:35.070 --> 04:30:35.080 align:start position:0%
point in the pandemic and we've regained
 
04:30:37.349 --> 04:30:37.359 align:start position:0%
about half of them so we thought we were
 
04:30:42.229 --> 04:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
heading for a v-shaped recovery um when
 
04:30:45.950 --> 04:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
it when covid cases were at a very low
 
04:30:48.750 --> 04:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
level we know there's been a Resurgence
 
04:30:51.830 --> 04:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
and a concomitant U kind of flattening
 
04:30:54.790 --> 04:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
out of of the jobs
 
04:30:57.229 --> 04:30:57.239 align:start position:0%
recovery taking a look at where the
 
04:30:59.149 --> 04:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
industries in the industries that have
 
04:31:00.870 --> 04:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
been most affect and again this is
 
04:31:04.389 --> 04:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
through November um and it compares the
 
04:31:07.109 --> 04:31:07.119 align:start position:0%
November number of employed individuals
 
04:31:08.790 --> 04:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire in these industries
 
04:31:11.990 --> 04:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
with the November of 2019 number and
 
04:31:14.070 --> 04:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
what you see if there's one thing that
 
04:31:16.030 --> 04:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
really jumps out is when you look at the
 
04:31:19.710 --> 04:31:19.720 align:start position:0%
bottom four those are all industries
 
04:31:23.750 --> 04:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
that have a high degree of contact in in
 
04:31:26.510 --> 04:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
the industry personal contact so retail
 
04:31:29.750 --> 04:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
trade with the exception of of online
 
04:31:32.309 --> 04:31:32.319 align:start position:0%
shopping which uh people are moving
 
04:31:34.349 --> 04:31:34.359 align:start position:0%
accelerating the the trend to online
 
04:31:37.149 --> 04:31:37.159 align:start position:0%
retailing but retailing requires
 
04:31:39.670 --> 04:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
face-to-face interactions with cashiers
 
04:31:43.229 --> 04:31:43.239 align:start position:0%
Etc Educational Services obviously and
 
04:31:45.229 --> 04:31:45.239 align:start position:0%
accommodations and Food Services
 
04:31:47.109 --> 04:31:47.119 align:start position:0%
restaurants have been particularly hard
 
04:31:48.710 --> 04:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
hit but also Arts entertainment
 
04:31:51.229 --> 04:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
Recreation any place where people
 
04:31:53.910 --> 04:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
agglomerate where they where they come
 
04:31:55.950 --> 04:31:55.960 align:start position:0%
together or where the interaction
 
04:31:58.030 --> 04:31:58.040 align:start position:0%
economic interaction is face to face has
 
04:32:00.070 --> 04:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
been hardest hit the other end you see
 
04:32:02.750 --> 04:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
real estate real estate has been booming
 
04:32:04.830 --> 04:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
um part of that has to do with greater
 
04:32:07.309 --> 04:32:07.319 align:start position:0%
interest of people people in um areas
 
04:32:09.550 --> 04:32:09.560 align:start position:0%
with less dense populations like New
 
04:32:11.429 --> 04:32:11.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but several Industries have
 
04:32:15.710 --> 04:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
been really modestly at best affected uh
 
04:32:18.990 --> 04:32:19.000 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic um and you can see
 
04:32:21.109 --> 04:32:21.119 align:start position:0%
those and those all of the industries
 
04:32:22.670 --> 04:32:22.680 align:start position:0%
with the exception of Health Care and
 
04:32:25.030 --> 04:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
social assistance um most of those don't
 
04:32:28.830 --> 04:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
require much in the way of face-to-face
 
04:32:31.670 --> 04:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
contact um just comparing uh New
 
04:32:33.750 --> 04:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and a couple of industries
 
04:32:36.309 --> 04:32:36.319 align:start position:0%
that have been especially hard hit this
 
04:32:38.469 --> 04:32:38.479 align:start position:0%
looks at uh Food Services and
 
04:32:40.590 --> 04:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
accommodations basically a surrogate for
 
04:32:43.710 --> 04:32:43.720 align:start position:0%
hospitality and you see all 50 states
 
04:32:45.309 --> 04:32:45.319 align:start position:0%
but you see all the New England states
 
04:32:47.189 --> 04:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
there are labeled and we're all pretty
 
04:32:48.670 --> 04:32:48.680 align:start position:0%
much affected
 
04:32:51.030 --> 04:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
similarly um New Hampshire's a little
 
04:32:53.550 --> 04:32:53.560 align:start position:0%
bit more um has been a little bit more
 
04:32:55.269 --> 04:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
affected and I attribute that to the
 
04:32:58.030 --> 04:32:58.040 align:start position:0%
fact that not only do we have a tourism
 
04:33:00.870 --> 04:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
related economy but we also have um a
 
04:33:03.590 --> 04:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
lot of business related travel e
 
04:33:05.470 --> 04:33:05.480 align:start position:0%
expenditures travel and entertainment
 
04:33:07.310 --> 04:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
expenditures business related
 
04:33:09.910 --> 04:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
expenditures um unlike Vermont and Maine
 
04:33:11.590 --> 04:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
who don't have quite as much of that so
 
04:33:13.590 --> 04:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
we get the double whammy the fact that
 
04:33:17.429 --> 04:33:17.439 align:start position:0%
businesses aren't um aren't uh engaging
 
04:33:19.590 --> 04:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
in the same kind of uh activities as
 
04:33:22.029 --> 04:33:22.039 align:start position:0%
they have in the past and we know that
 
04:33:24.750 --> 04:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
that individuals aren't um aren't dining
 
04:33:27.789 --> 04:33:27.799 align:start position:0%
as much um for their personal purposes
 
04:33:31.830 --> 04:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
so the combination has has done that um
 
04:33:33.590 --> 04:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
another industry that's dramatically
 
04:33:35.029 --> 04:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
affected and we know New Hampshire is
 
04:33:37.429 --> 04:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
really the retail Mecca of New England
 
04:33:39.949 --> 04:33:39.959 align:start position:0%
so this really isn't a surprise we have
 
04:33:41.990 --> 04:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
very high percentage of per capita
 
04:33:43.670 --> 04:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
retail expenditures and it's because so
 
04:33:45.510 --> 04:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
many people come and Shop in New
 
04:33:48.189 --> 04:33:48.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because of our no retail
 
04:33:51.590 --> 04:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
General retail sales tax status so we've
 
04:33:56.869 --> 04:33:56.879 align:start position:0%
seen this um seen us fall further than
 
04:33:59.869 --> 04:33:59.879 align:start position:0%
other states and again we've got the two
 
04:34:03.709 --> 04:34:03.719 align:start position:0%
really the the the double whammy we have
 
04:34:06.709 --> 04:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
less tourism activity and Retail is a
 
04:34:08.390 --> 04:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
part of tourism in New Hampshire it's a
 
04:34:10.189 --> 04:34:10.199 align:start position:0%
substantial aspect of tourism in New
 
04:34:12.510 --> 04:34:12.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we have the general
 
04:34:15.109 --> 04:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
decline in in retail activity that's
 
04:34:16.750 --> 04:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
been associated with the pandemic which
 
04:34:19.709 --> 04:34:19.719 align:start position:0%
has accelerated the movement to to to
 
04:34:22.510 --> 04:34:22.520 align:start position:0%
online retailing so those in combination
 
04:34:25.070 --> 04:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
have affected us to a greater
 
04:34:27.629 --> 04:34:27.639 align:start position:0%
degree the one really interesting fact
 
04:34:29.189 --> 04:34:29.199 align:start position:0%
if there's a lot of interesting facts
 
04:34:32.310 --> 04:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
but um when we look at the help wanted
 
04:34:34.709 --> 04:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
ads um in New Hampshire during the
 
04:34:34.719 --> 04:34:35.869 align:start position:0%
ads um in New Hampshire during the
pandemic

04:34:35.869 --> 04:34:35.879 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
04:34:39.429 --> 04:34:39.439 align:start position:0%
what we found is that there were um for
 
04:34:41.949 --> 04:34:41.959 align:start position:0%
most of the pandemic at least as many
 
04:34:45.109 --> 04:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
online job advertisements as there was
 
04:34:47.830 --> 04:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
in the same month of the prior year and
 
04:34:50.310 --> 04:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
this shows you Compares several months
 
04:34:56.869 --> 04:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
of 200 uh 19 and 2020 so April of 2019
 
04:34:59.590 --> 04:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
and April of 2020 there were more jobs
 
04:35:00.830 --> 04:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
listed in
 
04:35:04.349 --> 04:35:04.359 align:start position:0%
2020 um October the same situation but
 
04:35:07.070 --> 04:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
when we get to DEC number we see that
 
04:35:10.150 --> 04:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
that number has below what it was in
 
04:35:12.830 --> 04:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
2019 and there's a a couple of reasons
 
04:35:16.390 --> 04:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
why I think we see this chart one is
 
04:35:17.910 --> 04:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
that there was a lot of people who
 
04:35:20.429 --> 04:35:20.439 align:start position:0%
stepped out of the labor force health
 
04:35:24.629 --> 04:35:24.639 align:start position:0%
issues um Child Care issues um other
 
04:35:28.390 --> 04:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
care issues um and as a result of that
 
04:35:30.629 --> 04:35:30.639 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of need to replace
 
04:35:33.789 --> 04:35:33.799 align:start position:0%
workers even though we were shedding
 
04:35:37.470 --> 04:35:37.480 align:start position:0%
some jobs at at the very same time um as
 
04:35:40.310 --> 04:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
we move forward to November and December
 
04:35:41.910 --> 04:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
what we're starting to see and what
 
04:35:45.269 --> 04:35:45.279 align:start position:0%
we've seen in the recent past is that
 
04:35:46.869 --> 04:35:46.879 align:start position:0%
the longer the pandemic goes the more
 
04:35:49.029 --> 04:35:49.039 align:start position:0%
Industries are affected so um we're
 
04:35:51.910 --> 04:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
starting to see fewer of the jobs um
 
04:35:54.429 --> 04:35:54.439 align:start position:0%
advertised in in Industries and
 
04:35:56.590 --> 04:35:56.600 align:start position:0%
occupations that normally we would see
 
04:36:00.390 --> 04:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
there's also been no almost no um not
 
04:36:03.629 --> 04:36:03.639 align:start position:0%
the same degree of uh of the the holiday
 
04:36:06.310 --> 04:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
season hiring again because retail has
 
04:36:08.789 --> 04:36:08.799 align:start position:0%
been affected so dramatically so
 
04:36:11.869 --> 04:36:11.879 align:start position:0%
combination of of impacts looking at the
 
04:36:14.310 --> 04:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
occupations um is interesting and these
 
04:36:17.189 --> 04:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
are very broad groupings of
 
04:36:19.269 --> 04:36:19.279 align:start position:0%
occupations um and how they've been
 
04:36:22.429 --> 04:36:22.439 align:start position:0%
affected and some of these uh
 
04:36:24.269 --> 04:36:24.279 align:start position:0%
occupations don't have a tremendous
 
04:36:26.629 --> 04:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
number of of individuals in them however
 
04:36:28.510 --> 04:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
healthc care is one where we do have a
 
04:36:30.670 --> 04:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
very substantial employment base and
 
04:36:33.390 --> 04:36:33.400 align:start position:0%
health care and that has gone um you
 
04:36:37.189 --> 04:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
know there's been tremendous need for um
 
04:36:39.269 --> 04:36:39.279 align:start position:0%
hiring in the healthc care Industries
 
04:36:42.150 --> 04:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
throughout the pandemic um
 
04:36:45.551 --> 04:36:45.561 align:start position:0%
again nursing has been a an an
 
04:36:48.670 --> 04:36:48.680 align:start position:0%
occupation in demand for some time um
 
04:36:51.349 --> 04:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
that didn't stop during the pandemic if
 
04:36:52.949 --> 04:36:52.959 align:start position:0%
people stepped out of the labor force
 
04:36:55.150 --> 04:36:55.160 align:start position:0%
and there was a need to to replace them
 
04:36:57.949 --> 04:36:57.959 align:start position:0%
Etc um at the other end you see
 
04:36:59.869 --> 04:36:59.879 align:start position:0%
Information Technology and Engineering
 
04:37:02.990 --> 04:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
what I attribute this to is one there's
 
04:37:05.429 --> 04:37:05.439 align:start position:0%
not a tremendous number of employees in
 
04:37:08.029 --> 04:37:08.039 align:start position:0%
these occupations um so it's easier to
 
04:37:10.949 --> 04:37:10.959 align:start position:0%
get a large percentage change but the
 
04:37:13.230 --> 04:37:13.240 align:start position:0%
again the longer the pandemic goes the
 
04:37:15.830 --> 04:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
more Industries get effective the other
 
04:37:17.390 --> 04:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
thing I think interesting about this is
 
04:37:18.910 --> 04:37:18.920 align:start position:0%
what's happening in manufacturing and
 
04:37:21.150 --> 04:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
production manufacturing and production
 
04:37:23.510 --> 04:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
jobs despite the fact that over a couple
 
04:37:26.429 --> 04:37:26.439 align:start position:0%
of decades we've seen um a fairly
 
04:37:28.910 --> 04:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
consistent decline in manufacturing
 
04:37:30.551 --> 04:37:30.561 align:start position:0%
employment although we've had recent
 
04:37:33.349 --> 04:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
years where it's increased there's still
 
04:37:36.990 --> 04:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
strong demand because that Workforce is
 
04:37:38.629 --> 04:37:38.639 align:start position:0%
for the most part is an older Workforce
 
04:37:40.551 --> 04:37:40.561 align:start position:0%
you have a lot of people stepping out so
 
04:37:42.310 --> 04:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
even though there may not be a lot of
 
04:37:44.750 --> 04:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
net job growth there's still going to be
 
04:37:47.510 --> 04:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
demand for workers and that's true in
 
04:37:50.029 --> 04:37:50.039 align:start position:0%
almost every industry by the way even if
 
04:37:53.269 --> 04:37:53.279 align:start position:0%
we're not adding a lot of net new jobs
 
04:37:54.789 --> 04:37:54.799 align:start position:0%
the fact that so many people are going
 
04:37:57.269 --> 04:37:57.279 align:start position:0%
to be leaving the labor force the issue
 
04:37:59.590 --> 04:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
is not going to be job availability
 
04:38:02.869 --> 04:38:02.879 align:start position:0%
there will be jobs it will be getting
 
04:38:05.750 --> 04:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
people um into the occup Pati that are
 
04:38:08.070 --> 04:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
in demand and getting them the training
 
04:38:10.510 --> 04:38:10.520 align:start position:0%
um to do
 
04:38:10.520 --> 04:38:12.109 align:start position:0%
um to do
so

04:38:12.109 --> 04:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:38:14.990 --> 04:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
um again one reason why so many job
 
04:38:17.629 --> 04:38:17.639 align:start position:0%
openings is that the labor force H has
 
04:38:19.830 --> 04:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
been shrinking and it's you know New
 
04:38:22.789 --> 04:38:22.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's big challenge um has been
 
04:38:25.470 --> 04:38:25.480 align:start position:0%
labor force it was the challenge that we
 
04:38:28.070 --> 04:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
faced prior to the pandemic we had very
 
04:38:30.990 --> 04:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
low unemployment rates and we had um a
 
04:38:33.390 --> 04:38:33.400 align:start position:0%
labor force that wasn't growing like
 
04:38:35.310 --> 04:38:35.320 align:start position:0%
most of the Northeast the labor forces
 
04:38:37.750 --> 04:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
aren't growing as as fast as the nation
 
04:38:39.789 --> 04:38:39.799 align:start position:0%
overall what has happened during the
 
04:38:42.150 --> 04:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
pandemic is so many people have stepped
 
04:38:46.230 --> 04:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
out of the labor force um if you look at
 
04:38:48.590 --> 04:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
um filings for Social Security they're
 
04:38:50.551 --> 04:38:50.561 align:start position:0%
up they're up Nationwide New Hampshire
 
04:38:52.830 --> 04:38:52.840 align:start position:0%
has an older Workforce so we would
 
04:38:54.670 --> 04:38:54.680 align:start position:0%
expect that we would be harder hit by
 
04:38:56.551 --> 04:38:56.561 align:start position:0%
that um people who are concerned about
 
04:38:58.429 --> 04:38:58.439 align:start position:0%
their health maybe it's time to step out
 
04:39:00.830 --> 04:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
of labor for child care issues big
 
04:39:04.230 --> 04:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
reason um I looked at the data and I
 
04:39:06.830 --> 04:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
think our female labor force is down by
 
04:39:06.840 --> 04:39:08.029 align:start position:0%
think our female labor force is down by
about

04:39:08.029 --> 04:39:08.039 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:39:11.510 --> 04:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
1.5% um currently um male labor force
 
04:39:14.470 --> 04:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
has has come back not fully but it's
 
04:39:15.990 --> 04:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
been the female labor force has been
 
04:39:19.390 --> 04:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
more greatly affected so the combination
 
04:39:21.830 --> 04:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
of older workers female workers where we
 
04:39:24.789 --> 04:39:24.799 align:start position:0%
have a high high percentage of women in
 
04:39:27.230 --> 04:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
in our labor force those factors have
 
04:39:29.869 --> 04:39:29.879 align:start position:0%
combined to to hit us pretty hard in our
 
04:39:31.949 --> 04:39:31.959 align:start position:0%
labor force
 
04:39:35.551 --> 04:39:35.561 align:start position:0%
shrinkage um I just I mentioned earlier
 
04:39:38.230 --> 04:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
that I look a lot now um for timely
 
04:39:40.670 --> 04:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
indicators and this is a daily indicator
 
04:39:42.030 --> 04:39:42.040 align:start position:0%
of trips to
 
04:39:44.590 --> 04:39:44.600 align:start position:0%
workplaces um and it com it's an index
 
04:39:47.708 --> 04:39:47.718 align:start position:0%
number that compares the percentage um
 
04:39:50.430 --> 04:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
change in trips to workplaces from their
 
04:39:53.150 --> 04:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
prepandemic levels so what you see is
 
04:39:56.628 --> 04:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
during the early stages of the pandemic
 
04:39:58.510 --> 04:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
trips to workplaces in New Hampshire and
 
04:40:02.310 --> 04:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
this is done by Google Mobility um
 
04:40:04.788 --> 04:40:04.798 align:start position:0%
reports so basically your cell phone
 
04:40:06.390 --> 04:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
tracks you it doesn't track me because I
 
04:40:09.230 --> 04:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
keep my location off so I'm not in here
 
04:40:11.990 --> 04:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
um but you see trips to workplaces were
 
04:40:15.510 --> 04:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
off by about half now they've
 
04:40:18.830 --> 04:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
recovered and they've recovered to uh
 
04:40:20.948 --> 04:40:20.958 align:start position:0%
about 20% down and that's the function
 
04:40:23.868 --> 04:40:23.878 align:start position:0%
of one people who have been laid off or
 
04:40:27.190 --> 04:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
are on Furlow but it's also a function
 
04:40:30.070 --> 04:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
of the trend toward remote working and
 
04:40:31.590 --> 04:40:31.600 align:start position:0%
that Trend isn't going to completely go
 
04:40:33.868 --> 04:40:33.878 align:start position:0%
away we're going to see more people um
 
04:40:35.788 --> 04:40:35.798 align:start position:0%
working remotely that has a number of
 
04:40:38.708 --> 04:40:38.718 align:start position:0%
impacts and a number of implications for
 
04:40:41.430 --> 04:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
um occupation and Industry employment so
 
04:40:43.230 --> 04:40:43.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to see some occupations that
 
04:40:45.550 --> 04:40:45.560 align:start position:0%
are not going to be as strong in demand
 
04:40:48.470 --> 04:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
because of that remote work um I
 
04:40:51.270 --> 04:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned that that uh it's it's not
 
04:40:55.948 --> 04:40:55.958 align:start position:0%
likely to get back to full um trips to
 
04:40:59.788 --> 04:40:59.798 align:start position:0%
workplaces but there's one if there is a
 
04:41:01.628 --> 04:41:01.638 align:start position:0%
benefit and I don't I hate to say that
 
04:41:03.590 --> 04:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
there's any benefit but maybe one thing
 
04:41:05.510 --> 04:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
we can take from this is that I think
 
04:41:07.868 --> 04:41:07.878 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and the trend toward remote
 
04:41:11.510 --> 04:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
working will benefit our um labor force
 
04:41:13.230 --> 04:41:13.240 align:start position:0%
and demographic Trends and this chart
 
04:41:15.270 --> 04:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
just shows you the the states that have
 
04:41:17.948 --> 04:41:17.958 align:start position:0%
had the greatest percentage increase in
 
04:41:20.590 --> 04:41:20.600 align:start position:0%
their businesses that have indicated
 
04:41:22.070 --> 04:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
they've stepped up or increased their
 
04:41:23.990 --> 04:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
telea workking for employees and what
 
04:41:25.390 --> 04:41:25.400 align:start position:0%
you see is a couple of our neighbors
 
04:41:27.628 --> 04:41:27.638 align:start position:0%
we're High New Hampshire's number four
 
04:41:30.350 --> 04:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
but Massachusetts is number two and
 
04:41:32.550 --> 04:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
Connecticut is number five so those are
 
04:41:34.948 --> 04:41:34.958 align:start position:0%
states that we often draw a lot of
 
04:41:39.590 --> 04:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
people from and I think um the fact that
 
04:41:43.750 --> 04:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
we separating the work that people do
 
04:41:45.708 --> 04:41:45.718 align:start position:0%
from the location of the business means
 
04:41:48.190 --> 04:41:48.200 align:start position:0%
that a lot of those people would prefer
 
04:41:51.910 --> 04:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
to live other than in um you know maybe
 
04:41:54.350 --> 04:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
a major major metropolitan area or area
 
04:41:57.910 --> 04:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
that costs more so we're starting to see
 
04:42:00.550 --> 04:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
anecdotally um the fact that more people
 
04:42:02.230 --> 04:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
have shown an interest in purchasing
 
04:42:04.830 --> 04:42:04.840 align:start position:0%
homes or living in New Hampshire so I
 
04:42:06.948 --> 04:42:06.958 align:start position:0%
think it will impact our demographic
 
04:42:09.910 --> 04:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
Trends positively and that's reflected
 
04:42:13.750 --> 04:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
in this this chart is um both a historic
 
04:42:15.470 --> 04:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
and I know again I don't want to step on
 
04:42:17.670 --> 04:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
Dr Johnson's toes but I've been tracking
 
04:42:21.310 --> 04:42:21.320 align:start position:0%
this for decades um shows the net
 
04:42:23.030 --> 04:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
state-to-state migration in New
 
04:42:25.390 --> 04:42:25.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you know those of us who who
 
04:42:28.150 --> 04:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
have been here longer remember years
 
04:42:31.310 --> 04:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
where we had almost 20,000 people move
 
04:42:33.110 --> 04:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
into more people move into the state
 
04:42:35.350 --> 04:42:35.360 align:start position:0%
from another state than moved out
 
04:42:37.670 --> 04:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
what we saw during the Great Recession
 
04:42:40.788 --> 04:42:40.798 align:start position:0%
and the immediate years after was more
 
04:42:41.868 --> 04:42:41.878 align:start position:0%
net out
 
04:42:44.788 --> 04:42:44.798 align:start position:0%
migration um than in migration that has
 
04:42:48.110 --> 04:42:48.120 align:start position:0%
picked up again um we re resumed
 
04:42:50.750 --> 04:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
positive net migration so my forecast
 
04:42:53.830 --> 04:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
because of the the the desire for Less
 
04:42:56.030 --> 04:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
density um the fact that there's more
 
04:42:57.670 --> 04:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
remote working means that we're going to
 
04:43:00.628 --> 04:43:00.638 align:start position:0%
step up see a bit of an increase in our
 
04:43:04.310 --> 04:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
um domestic uh migration so just to wrap
 
04:43:04.320 --> 04:43:05.030 align:start position:0%
um domestic uh migration so just to wrap
up

04:43:05.030 --> 04:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:43:09.110 --> 04:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
um my forecast for um the next two years
 
04:43:10.788 --> 04:43:10.798 align:start position:0%
in terms of employment growth again I
 
04:43:14.190 --> 04:43:14.200 align:start position:0%
don't see much um job growth the first
 
04:43:16.390 --> 04:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
half and could continue to see some
 
04:43:20.230 --> 04:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
losses but 2021 I just up up this by the
 
04:43:23.150 --> 04:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
way the new um the likelihood that
 
04:43:24.990 --> 04:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
there'll be an additional stimulus I
 
04:43:27.990 --> 04:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
think will uh boost um some of the the
 
04:43:30.990 --> 04:43:31.000 align:start position:0%
employment numbers so this shows a
 
04:43:36.510 --> 04:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
forecast of 1.3% in 2021 3 3 in 2022 and
 
04:43:38.510 --> 04:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
if you work through those the math of
 
04:43:41.550 --> 04:43:41.560 align:start position:0%
that it would suggest very late in 2022
 
04:43:44.190 --> 04:43:44.200 align:start position:0%
or early in 2023 that we would get back
 
04:43:45.788 --> 04:43:45.798 align:start position:0%
all of the jobs that we lost in the
 
04:43:47.788 --> 04:43:47.798 align:start position:0%
pandemic and with that I'll stop and
 
04:43:50.230 --> 04:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
turn it back to rich thank
 
04:43:53.830 --> 04:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
you all right thank you I'll just stop
 
04:43:55.750 --> 04:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
the share
 
04:44:00.868 --> 04:44:00.878 align:start position:0%
here okay um and one other point um I
 
04:44:03.150 --> 04:44:03.160 align:start position:0%
would I would like to make in um
 
04:44:05.070 --> 04:44:05.080 align:start position:0%
something that commissioner aswell had
 
04:44:06.788 --> 04:44:06.798 align:start position:0%
touched upon earlier with the the
 
04:44:09.590 --> 04:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
collaboration that we've had with Bea
 
04:44:10.990 --> 04:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
that we've expanded throughout this
 
04:44:14.150 --> 04:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
pandemic has been in uh two areas that
 
04:44:17.310 --> 04:44:17.320 align:start position:0%
we've had to Pivot very quickly in order
 
04:44:19.990 --> 04:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
to help with that demand that Brian had
 
04:44:23.150 --> 04:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
showed in his slide with employers uh
 
04:44:25.470 --> 04:44:25.480 align:start position:0%
that continue to seek to hire but
 
04:44:27.670 --> 04:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
obviously right now it's a it's a tough
 
04:44:30.270 --> 04:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
time to make those connections uh so two
 
04:44:32.550 --> 04:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
things that we've done one we created a
 
04:44:36.270 --> 04:44:36.280 align:start position:0%
new micro site for a jobs portal where
 
04:44:38.750 --> 04:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
individuals are able to search by region
 
04:44:40.110 --> 04:44:40.120 align:start position:0%
for instance you could search by the
 
04:44:41.868 --> 04:44:41.878 align:start position:0%
North Country you could search by Sea
 
04:44:43.590 --> 04:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
Coast you could search by the madok
 
04:44:45.708 --> 04:44:45.718 align:start position:0%
region um you can also search by
 
04:44:47.910 --> 04:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
individual community and you can search
 
04:44:50.150 --> 04:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
by um occupational type so you can
 
04:44:52.708 --> 04:44:52.718 align:start position:0%
really have that search as broad or as
 
04:44:55.708 --> 04:44:55.718 align:start position:0%
narrow as you want it started as a tool
 
04:44:58.310 --> 04:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
for the long-term care industry we
 
04:45:00.230 --> 04:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
quickly broaden that to include
 
04:45:02.750 --> 04:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturing education and now it
 
04:45:05.590 --> 04:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
includes all sectors with about 400
 
04:45:08.270 --> 04:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
employers that have signed up for that
 
04:45:10.990 --> 04:45:11.000 align:start position:0%
um and it's a a tool that individuals
 
04:45:14.350 --> 04:45:14.360 align:start position:0%
coming into the unemployment site see on
 
04:45:17.628 --> 04:45:17.638 align:start position:0%
a daily basis visually before they do
 
04:45:20.070 --> 04:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
anything with their unemployment claim
 
04:45:22.510 --> 04:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
um the other tool that we've um we've
 
04:45:24.948 --> 04:45:24.958 align:start position:0%
launched and we've embraced has been
 
04:45:27.670 --> 04:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
with virtual job fairs uh the department
 
04:45:29.670 --> 04:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic we would do
 
04:45:32.750 --> 04:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 25 to 30 in-person job
 
04:45:34.708 --> 04:45:34.718 align:start position:0%
fairs most of those were big events at
 
04:45:36.990 --> 04:45:37.000 align:start position:0%
community college campuses and their
 
04:45:38.990 --> 04:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
gymnasiums and we Rec cover the entire
 
04:45:42.390 --> 04:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
floor um we quickly changed in with a
 
04:45:44.750 --> 04:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
partnership with the New Hampshire Tech
 
04:45:48.628 --> 04:45:48.638 align:start position:0%
Alliance and with Bea we've done uh I
 
04:45:51.550 --> 04:45:51.560 align:start position:0%
think we're now now at about 12 virtual
 
04:45:54.070 --> 04:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
job fairs that we've been able to do
 
04:45:56.670 --> 04:45:56.680 align:start position:0%
we've had them for uh different regions
 
04:45:58.310 --> 04:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
of the state we've had them for
 
04:46:01.670 --> 04:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
different sectors uh the past two weeks
 
04:46:04.430 --> 04:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
we focused on healthc care we did four
 
04:46:07.150 --> 04:46:07.160 align:start position:0%
healthc care virtual job fairs where we
 
04:46:10.948 --> 04:46:10.958 align:start position:0%
had about 200 job Seekers um having an
 
04:46:13.510 --> 04:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
interest in um Healthcare positions came
 
04:46:15.430 --> 04:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
on to talk with Healthcare employers so
 
04:46:16.910 --> 04:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's something we're going to
 
04:46:19.270 --> 04:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
continue to do not just because we think
 
04:46:20.510 --> 04:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
it's a good thing to do it's because
 
04:46:22.868 --> 04:46:22.878 align:start position:0%
employers are telling us that they they
 
04:46:25.270 --> 04:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
enjoy it as a way to connect with
 
04:46:27.830 --> 04:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
Workforce or potential Workforce uh so
 
04:46:29.430 --> 04:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
that's something we'll continue to do
 
04:46:31.190 --> 04:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
and those some of the new tools that
 
04:46:35.390 --> 04:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
we've um um launched to ad adapt uh to
 
04:46:37.230 --> 04:46:37.240 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and continuing to try to
 
04:46:41.390 --> 04:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
help um uh expand uh Workforce here in
 
04:46:43.150 --> 04:46:43.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um with all that being
 
04:46:46.670 --> 04:46:46.680 align:start position:0%

businesses approaching them for certain
 
04:48:05.230 --> 04:48:05.240 align:start position:0%
skills they aren't being taught there
 
04:48:08.190 --> 04:48:08.200 align:start position:0%
that they would like to see taught there
 
04:48:10.628 --> 04:48:10.638 align:start position:0%
um and I know our community college
 
04:48:11.670 --> 04:48:11.680 align:start position:0%

Nimble um but do you have any insight on
 
04:48:16.868 --> 04:48:16.878 align:start position:0%
that rich or
 
04:48:19.868 --> 04:48:19.878 align:start position:0%
uh yeah in the so the the community
 
04:48:22.190 --> 04:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
college system and Susan hu are are part
 
04:48:25.750 --> 04:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
of all of the the conversations that we
 
04:48:27.590 --> 04:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
have with business all of those are
 
04:48:30.230 --> 04:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
really spearheaded by by Taylor in
 
04:48:32.670 --> 04:48:32.680 align:start position:0%
organizing a team um that works with
 
04:48:34.628 --> 04:48:34.638 align:start position:0%
those groups uh so we've been talking
 
04:48:37.030 --> 04:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
with with employers uh throughout the
 
04:48:41.030 --> 04:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
the pandemic um um the Community College
 
04:48:42.670 --> 04:48:42.680 align:start position:0%
obviously is a critical component of
 
04:48:44.430 --> 04:48:44.440 align:start position:0%
that because they they are the ones that
 
04:48:47.628 --> 04:48:47.638 align:start position:0%
are delivering that Workforce training
 
04:48:51.070 --> 04:48:51.080 align:start position:0%
um we've worked with them closely um and
 
04:48:52.670 --> 04:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
you know in the decade that I've been
 
04:48:54.910 --> 04:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
here with the Department uh we've always
 
04:48:56.270 --> 04:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
worked closely with the community
 
04:48:58.830 --> 04:48:58.840 align:start position:0%
college and with the expansion of the
 
04:49:01.470 --> 04:49:01.480 align:start position:0%
job training fund that the legislature
 
04:49:04.708 --> 04:49:04.718 align:start position:0%
um had implemented with the last uh
 
04:49:06.390 --> 04:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
where they they increase the job
 
04:49:08.070 --> 04:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
training front from 2 million to 6
 
04:49:12.070 --> 04:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
million one of the uh um directives in
 
04:49:13.788 --> 04:49:13.798 align:start position:0%
that expansion was that we needed to do
 
04:49:16.390 --> 04:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
to more to work with individuals um
 
04:49:18.708 --> 04:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
which we've been doing and most of that
 
04:49:20.868 --> 04:49:20.878 align:start position:0%
training uh is delivered by the
 
04:49:22.948 --> 04:49:22.958 align:start position:0%
community college system so individuals
 
04:49:25.470 --> 04:49:25.480 align:start position:0%
that we have that we focused on
 
04:49:26.590 --> 04:49:26.600 align:start position:0%
individuals that are enrolled in
 
04:49:28.628 --> 04:49:28.638 align:start position:0%

04:49:34.868 --> 04:49:34.878 align:start position:0%
that training is delivered by the
 
04:49:37.070 --> 04:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
community college system and from what
 
04:49:38.990 --> 04:49:39.000 align:start position:0%

Tucker yes I was very interested in your
 
04:50:03.548 --> 04:50:03.558 align:start position:0%
talking about training we and and that
 
04:50:05.628 --> 04:50:05.638 align:start position:0%
uh representative AB brami's question of
 
04:50:11.270 --> 04:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
course uh was in that area but on the
 
04:50:15.510 --> 04:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
toring how what percentage of jobs can
 
04:50:19.868 --> 04:50:19.878 align:start position:0%
people take and start working from home
 
04:50:23.310 --> 04:50:23.320 align:start position:0%
or tele workking where do they get the
 
04:50:26.628 --> 04:50:26.638 align:start position:0%
training how does that work uh is there
 
04:50:28.910 --> 04:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
hybrid system in which people work on
 
04:50:30.310 --> 04:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
site under a
 
04:50:34.110 --> 04:50:34.120 align:start position:0%
mentor just it's hard for me to Envision
 
04:50:37.750 --> 04:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
someone who's just been hired starting
 
04:50:41.628 --> 04:50:41.638 align:start position:0%
right away from from working at home
 
04:50:44.910 --> 04:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
when pandemic is when the P pandemic is
 
04:50:47.548 --> 04:50:47.558 align:start position:0%
over what do you see as the model well I
 
04:50:49.270 --> 04:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
don't know that there is a single model
 
04:50:51.390 --> 04:50:51.400 align:start position:0%
representative Tucker um you know
 
04:50:52.990 --> 04:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
businesses are implementing it
 
04:50:54.830 --> 04:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
differently and a lot depends on the
 
04:50:56.708 --> 04:50:56.718 align:start position:0%
type of Industry um but you're
 
04:50:58.270 --> 04:50:58.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely right it is difficult to
 
04:50:58.280 --> 04:50:59.590 align:start position:0%
absolutely right it is difficult to
onboard

04:50:59.590 --> 04:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
onboard
 
04:51:03.990 --> 04:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
somebody um tele via telework um so I
 
04:51:06.150 --> 04:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
know that we have the answer to how each
 
04:51:08.788 --> 04:51:08.798 align:start position:0%
individual business um is going to or
 
04:51:10.070 --> 04:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
individual Industries are going to
 
04:51:12.910 --> 04:51:12.920 align:start position:0%
handle that but I will say um that
 
04:51:15.070 --> 04:51:15.080 align:start position:0%
businesses have learned a lot and that's
 
04:51:18.030 --> 04:51:18.040 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why I believe that um
 
04:51:22.110 --> 04:51:22.120 align:start position:0%
teleworking is is going to not disappear
 
04:51:24.110 --> 04:51:24.120 align:start position:0%
um you know they've one they've
 
04:51:26.670 --> 04:51:26.680 align:start position:0%
invested uh money in doing it they've
 
04:51:29.190 --> 04:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
invested um you know training in it
 
04:51:30.830 --> 04:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of sunk costs there's
 
04:51:32.750 --> 04:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge that's in involved in it plus
 
04:51:33.708 --> 04:51:33.718 align:start position:0%
I think they've learned something
 
04:51:36.110 --> 04:51:36.120 align:start position:0%
something about their productivity um
 
04:51:38.628 --> 04:51:38.638 align:start position:0%
and the number you know how it can be
 
04:51:40.270 --> 04:51:40.280 align:start position:0%
done the number of workers that will
 
04:51:43.628 --> 04:51:43.638 align:start position:0%
maximize their productivity so um there
 
04:51:46.670 --> 04:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
is no one model for sure but you can be
 
04:51:48.190 --> 04:51:48.200 align:start position:0%
sure that it's going to increase and as
 
04:51:50.788 --> 04:51:50.798 align:start position:0%
far as the numbers go um I've seen some
 
04:51:52.670 --> 04:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
studies that have been done by uh
 
04:51:56.230 --> 04:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
different groups um and the the numbers
 
04:51:59.030 --> 04:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
that I've seen puts New Hampshire
 
04:52:01.910 --> 04:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the upper
 
04:52:06.070 --> 04:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
30% um of occupation based on
 
04:52:09.310 --> 04:52:09.320 align:start position:0%
occupations that could conceivably work
 
04:52:11.430 --> 04:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
from home I don't believe we'll get to
 
04:52:13.310 --> 04:52:13.320 align:start position:0%
that point I would expect it would be
 
04:52:15.230 --> 04:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the order of half of that
 
04:52:19.670 --> 04:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
15% maybe um somewhere 10 to 15% maybe a
 
04:52:21.150 --> 04:52:21.160 align:start position:0%
little bit higher on a on a more
 
04:52:24.190 --> 04:52:24.200 align:start position:0%
permanent basis but um there's no one
 
04:52:26.030 --> 04:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
model and I will say because you
 
04:52:27.590 --> 04:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
represent the North Country
 
04:52:31.150 --> 04:52:31.160 align:start position:0%
representative Tucker is that it puts a
 
04:52:35.270 --> 04:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh an onus on things like um high-speed
 
04:52:38.310 --> 04:52:38.320 align:start position:0%
internet the ability it it it if we
 
04:52:40.430 --> 04:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
don't get that right and we don't
 
04:52:42.708 --> 04:52:42.718 align:start position:0%
provide access or have access available
 
04:52:46.788 --> 04:52:46.798 align:start position:0%
to to more um rural areas it adds a
 
04:52:49.788 --> 04:52:49.798 align:start position:0%
disadvantage um the challenges that your
 
04:52:51.270 --> 04:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
region and other regions are going to
 
04:52:53.230 --> 04:52:53.240 align:start position:0%
face is that a lot a lot of the jobs
 
04:52:55.310 --> 04:52:55.320 align:start position:0%
that are going to disappear that are not
 
04:52:57.590 --> 04:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
going to come back ret some of the
 
04:53:01.110 --> 04:53:01.120 align:start position:0%
retail jobs some of the hospitality jobs
 
04:53:04.190 --> 04:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
um those people will need some sort of
 
04:53:05.548 --> 04:53:05.558 align:start position:0%
re retraining and there'll be
 
04:53:07.590 --> 04:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
opportunities in remote working and
 
04:53:08.910 --> 04:53:08.920 align:start position:0%
whatnot so they're going to need the
 
04:53:10.910 --> 04:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
training and they're going to need um
 
04:53:13.190 --> 04:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
you know the have the ability to work uh
 
04:53:16.430 --> 04:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
telework as well we we had adequate in
 
04:53:18.628 --> 04:53:18.638 align:start position:0%
where I live in the Southern Tier of
 
04:53:21.670 --> 04:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
Coos we had adequate Broadband in most
 
04:53:26.990 --> 04:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
of the areas until both students K12
 
04:53:29.470 --> 04:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
were working from home college students
 
04:53:32.190 --> 04:53:32.200 align:start position:0%
were not going off to college but
 
04:53:34.430 --> 04:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
working at home and and the parents were
 
04:53:37.470 --> 04:53:37.480 align:start position:0%
trying to work at home and the there is
 
04:53:40.830 --> 04:53:40.840 align:start position:0%
no incentive for the uh companies that
 
04:53:44.110 --> 04:53:44.120 align:start position:0%
provide the service to add to
 
04:53:46.750 --> 04:53:46.760 align:start position:0%
their Wireless or whatever it is they
 
04:53:50.948 --> 04:53:50.958 align:start position:0%
have and so areas where had adequate
 
04:53:53.708 --> 04:53:53.718 align:start position:0%
service now have inadequate service in
 
04:53:55.670 --> 04:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
other words the service remained the
 
04:53:59.110 --> 04:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
same the number of users doubled or
 
04:54:02.548 --> 04:54:02.558 align:start position:0%
tripled and people on Randolph Hill
 
04:54:06.270 --> 04:54:06.280 align:start position:0%
where I live many of them work different
 
04:54:09.390 --> 04:54:09.400 align:start position:0%
hours get up at strange hours in the
 
04:54:13.670 --> 04:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
night to do work because students are on
 
04:54:18.390 --> 04:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
crowding in on the U daytime use of of
 
04:54:21.510 --> 04:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
tele it's very very difficult so what
 
04:54:25.150 --> 04:54:25.160 align:start position:0%
seemed adequate is not adequate now and
 
04:54:28.868 --> 04:54:28.878 align:start position:0%
I hope someone's tracking that problem
 
04:54:31.110 --> 04:54:31.120 align:start position:0%
because you know New Hampshire thinks
 
04:54:33.788 --> 04:54:33.798 align:start position:0%
you have adequate Broadband if you have
 
04:54:37.548 --> 04:54:37.558 align:start position:0%
it in your town at all and it doesn't
 
04:54:40.948 --> 04:54:40.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:44.868 --> 04:54:44.878 align:start position:0%
quantity so boil that down into a
 
04:54:48.910 --> 04:54:48.920 align:start position:0%
question no that's a comment okay I'm
 
04:54:54.628 --> 04:54:54.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:58.190 --> 04:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
alme you need to unmute yourself I I was
 
04:55:03.510 --> 04:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
getting there thank you um last year we
 
04:55:06.830 --> 04:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
started to to uh reach out for the first
 
04:55:10.628 --> 04:55:10.638 align:start position:0%
time to the Chambers of Commerce on
 
04:55:14.948 --> 04:55:14.958 align:start position:0%
which hadn't been as reaching out very
 
04:55:19.670 --> 04:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
often to the legislature as a whole and
 
04:55:21.868 --> 04:55:21.878 align:start position:0%
on we were trying to find out what was
 
04:55:23.910 --> 04:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
going on on the ground when there
 
04:55:28.390 --> 04:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
weren't when there was a lag in data and
 
04:55:32.548 --> 04:55:32.558 align:start position:0%
they they had started to do a lot more
 
04:55:35.990 --> 04:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
serious re out themselves to to the
 
04:55:40.270 --> 04:55:40.280 align:start position:0%
businesses the smaller businesses the um
 
04:55:43.030 --> 04:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
startup businesses that become large
 
04:55:47.190 --> 04:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
businesses um that usually aren't
 
04:55:52.350 --> 04:55:52.360 align:start position:0%
contacted and um I heard from Taylor
 
04:55:54.750 --> 04:55:54.760 align:start position:0%
Caswell this morning he's he told us
 
04:55:59.030 --> 04:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
that on these job fairs were in
 
04:56:01.390 --> 04:56:01.400 align:start position:0%
collaboration with the
 
04:56:04.150 --> 04:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
chambers and I was wondering whether you
 
04:56:06.310 --> 04:56:06.320 align:start position:0%
considered that a serious link for the
 
04:56:09.270 --> 04:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
future because I think that the
 
04:56:09.280 --> 04:56:10.788 align:start position:0%
future because I think that the
combination

04:56:10.788 --> 04:56:10.798 align:start position:0%
combination
 
04:56:14.390 --> 04:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
of having those resources more
 
04:56:16.670 --> 04:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
available themselves would cause the
 
04:56:20.310 --> 04:56:20.320 align:start position:0%
chambers to spend more time with their
 
04:56:20.320 --> 04:56:21.628 align:start position:0%
chambers to spend more time with their
existing

04:56:21.628 --> 04:56:21.638 align:start position:0%
existing
 
04:56:25.830 --> 04:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
businesses on and help to develop things
 
04:56:28.190 --> 04:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
across New Hampshire a lot more than
 
04:56:30.868 --> 04:56:30.878 align:start position:0%
we've been able to concentrating on the
 
04:56:30.878 --> 04:56:32.110 align:start position:0%
we've been able to concentrating on the
mega

04:56:32.110 --> 04:56:32.120 align:start position:0%
mega
 
04:56:34.390 --> 04:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
businesses yeah representative that's a
 
04:56:36.390 --> 04:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
it's a very good point and I was glad
 
04:56:37.830 --> 04:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
that commissioner Caswell brought that
 
04:56:40.910 --> 04:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
up earlier today as well um you know we
 
04:56:42.670 --> 04:56:42.680 align:start position:0%
we're reluctant as Brian had indicated
 
04:56:44.150 --> 04:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
earlier we're reluctant to say there are
 
04:56:46.590 --> 04:56:46.600 align:start position:0%
any Silver Linings in the pandemic but
 
04:56:48.990 --> 04:56:49.000 align:start position:0%
certainly one of um the good
 
04:56:51.948 --> 04:56:51.958 align:start position:0%
collaborations has been our increased
 
04:56:54.270 --> 04:56:54.280 align:start position:0%
work that we've done with the chambers
 
04:56:57.910 --> 04:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
um and again with Bea facilitating that
 
04:57:00.190 --> 04:57:00.200 align:start position:0%
um the the whole concept of the regional
 
04:57:02.708 --> 04:57:02.718 align:start position:0%
search feature on our new jobs portal at
 
04:57:06.430 --> 04:57:06.440 align:start position:0%
NH jobs. nh.gov that was really brought
 
04:57:09.708 --> 04:57:09.718 align:start position:0%
To Us by the chambers um so it's just
 
04:57:11.708 --> 04:57:11.718 align:start position:0%
that's one example of the work that
 
04:57:14.070 --> 04:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
we've been able to do and they were
 
04:57:17.390 --> 04:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
instrumental in organizing employers and
 
04:57:21.150 --> 04:57:21.160 align:start position:0%
getting employer interest in all of the
 
04:57:23.150 --> 04:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
uh job fairs that we did throughout the
 
04:57:27.150 --> 04:57:27.160 align:start position:0%
fall um and thus far in the winter so um
 
04:57:29.270 --> 04:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
there are uh that's going to be a
 
04:57:32.470 --> 04:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
collaboration I think and I hope um that
 
04:57:34.230 --> 04:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
we will continue to
 
04:57:37.270 --> 04:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
have and um it's really it's a great
 
04:57:39.470 --> 04:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
match thank you that's
 
04:57:41.868 --> 04:57:41.878 align:start position:0%
terrific representa
 
04:57:44.990 --> 04:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
a oh thank you
 
04:57:48.510 --> 04:57:48.520 align:start position:0%
um yeah the uh in your presentation uh
 
04:57:51.110 --> 04:57:51.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner leers uh the
 
04:57:54.430 --> 04:57:54.440 align:start position:0%
uh you you showed us how you've managed
 
04:57:59.190 --> 04:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
to avoid U becoming in need of the
 
04:58:01.708 --> 04:58:01.718 align:start position:0%
federal to borrow from the F federal
 
04:58:05.190 --> 04:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
government for cover our un
 
04:58:09.590 --> 04:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
unemployment claims um going forward and
 
04:58:12.190 --> 04:58:12.200 align:start position:0%
uh that sounds very good and it's
 
04:58:14.030 --> 04:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
amazing that you've been able to do that
 
04:58:15.910 --> 04:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
thanks to the cares act I guess as much
 
04:58:19.430 --> 04:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
as anything but uh what I'm wondering is
 
04:58:22.590 --> 04:58:22.600 align:start position:0%
what what would be the consequence for
 
04:58:22.600 --> 04:58:23.470 align:start position:0%
what what would be the consequence for
New

04:58:23.470 --> 04:58:23.480 align:start position:0%
New
 
04:58:26.470 --> 04:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as it has been for the 21
 
04:58:29.708 --> 04:58:29.718 align:start position:0%
states that have moved to that to borrow
 
04:58:31.990 --> 04:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
from federal government what what does
 
04:58:34.150 --> 04:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
that entail
 
04:58:35.548 --> 04:58:35.558 align:start position:0%
yeah so that that's a it's a great
 
04:58:38.470 --> 04:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
question and it's a it's a complicated
 
04:58:42.590 --> 04:58:42.600 align:start position:0%
series of impacts right so the the the
 
04:58:44.750 --> 04:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
easiest way to simplify it is that for
 
04:58:46.628 --> 04:58:46.638 align:start position:0%
every dollar that you borrow from the
 
04:58:48.548 --> 04:58:48.558 align:start position:0%
feds in order to pay out benefits is a
 
04:58:50.350 --> 04:58:50.360 align:start position:0%
dollar that your employers will have to
 
04:58:52.990 --> 04:58:53.000 align:start position:0%
pay back to the federal government in
 
04:58:54.948 --> 04:58:54.958 align:start position:0%
addition to building up your own
 
04:58:58.110 --> 04:58:58.120 align:start position:0%
reserves in your trust fund currently
 
04:59:00.510 --> 04:59:00.520 align:start position:0%
there's no cost associated with
 
04:59:02.708 --> 04:59:02.718 align:start position:0%
borrowing or at least an immediate cost
 
04:59:05.510 --> 04:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
as those are interest free dollars that
 
04:59:07.470 --> 04:59:07.480 align:start position:0%
the treasury is making available to
 
04:59:10.270 --> 04:59:10.280 align:start position:0%
states that is only interest free right
 
04:59:14.470 --> 04:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
now until March 13th um at that point um
 
04:59:16.868 --> 04:59:16.878 align:start position:0%
if unless that's changed uh those
 
04:59:18.628 --> 04:59:18.638 align:start position:0%
dollars being borrowed would start to
 
04:59:20.430 --> 04:59:20.440 align:start position:0%
acrew interest so they would start to
 
04:59:23.110 --> 04:59:23.120 align:start position:0%
have some real expenses what we saw
 
04:59:24.830 --> 04:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
during the Great Recession was the
 
04:59:27.708 --> 04:59:27.718 align:start position:0%
states that had borrowed the most um so
 
04:59:29.628 --> 04:59:29.638 align:start position:0%
you know the the the biggest of those
 
04:59:32.230 --> 04:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
was California um California never
 
04:59:35.190 --> 04:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
really paid back the funds that they
 
04:59:38.670 --> 04:59:38.680 align:start position:0%
borrowed from the US Treasury um they
 
04:59:41.430 --> 04:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
they bonded that debt and the reason why
 
04:59:43.350 --> 04:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
they bonded that debt from the Great
 
04:59:44.948 --> 04:59:44.958 align:start position:0%
Recession which they're still paying
 
04:59:47.070 --> 04:59:47.080 align:start position:0%
back now as they're borrowing again from
 
04:59:49.990 --> 04:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
the US Treasury um they bonded that to
 
04:59:53.590 --> 04:59:53.600 align:start position:0%
avoid some of the negative impacts on
 
04:59:56.110 --> 04:59:56.120 align:start position:0%
Employers in their state because of the
 
04:59:57.510 --> 04:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
length of time that they had an
 
04:59:59.788 --> 04:59:59.798 align:start position:0%
outstanding balance so what would happen
 
05:00:01.510 --> 05:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire if New Hampshire had to
 
05:00:04.390 --> 05:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
start to borrow is that the longer we
 
05:00:07.190 --> 05:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
have a debt outstanding to the federal
 
05:00:09.350 --> 05:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
government then Employers in the state
 
05:00:12.868 --> 05:00:12.878 align:start position:0%
start to lose more and more of their
 
05:00:15.150 --> 05:00:15.160 align:start position:0%
reduction in their federal unemployment
 
05:00:16.990 --> 05:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
taxes their Federal Unemployment
 
05:00:20.070 --> 05:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
Compensation taxes separate and distinct
 
05:00:22.430 --> 05:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
from their state unemployment taxes
 
05:00:24.750 --> 05:00:24.760 align:start position:0%
right now Employers in the state because
 
05:00:27.390 --> 05:00:27.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is considered to be um in
 
05:00:30.590 --> 05:00:30.600 align:start position:0%
alignment with Federal requirements um
 
05:00:33.990 --> 05:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
employers get a 90% disc discount on
 
05:00:35.910 --> 05:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
what they pay for their federal
 
05:00:38.788 --> 05:00:38.798 align:start position:0%
unemployment taxes that's about a $200
 
05:00:42.548 --> 05:00:42.558 align:start position:0%
million a year savings to New Hampshire
 
05:00:44.910 --> 05:00:44.920 align:start position:0%
businesses the longer if we had to
 
05:00:47.510 --> 05:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
borrow and it took us a l a longer
 
05:00:50.628 --> 05:00:50.638 align:start position:0%
period of time to repay that debt then
 
05:00:52.708 --> 05:00:52.718 align:start position:0%
that reduction is going to start to come
 
05:00:55.910 --> 05:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
down resulting in higher taxes for New
 
05:00:57.990 --> 05:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire businesses uh for their
 
05:01:00.510 --> 05:01:00.520 align:start position:0%
federal unemployment comp tax and we're
 
05:01:02.868 --> 05:01:02.878 align:start position:0%
still going to be having to rebuild our
 
05:01:04.910 --> 05:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
TR fund here in the state so there's
 
05:01:06.750 --> 05:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot that goes into that
 
05:01:09.350 --> 05:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
calculation but some some significant
 
05:01:11.590 --> 05:01:11.600 align:start position:0%
consequences for Employers in the state
 
05:01:12.430 --> 05:01:12.440 align:start position:0%
when you
 
05:01:16.070 --> 05:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
borrow good thank you that's very
 
05:01:19.190 --> 05:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
helpful um Rick and
 
05:01:22.310 --> 05:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
Brian I read an article earlier this
 
05:01:25.190 --> 05:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
morning on the construction
 
05:01:28.270 --> 05:01:28.280 align:start position:0%
industry especially the building uh
 
05:01:31.270 --> 05:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
construction industry on home building
 
05:01:33.788 --> 05:01:33.798 align:start position:0%
there's a lack of uh
 
05:01:37.150 --> 05:01:37.160 align:start position:0%
workers and they're paying premiums to
 
05:01:40.628 --> 05:01:40.638 align:start position:0%
get them not the entry level ones but
 
05:01:42.470 --> 05:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
people have experienced are we
 
05:01:47.230 --> 05:01:47.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:50.270 --> 05:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
too no and I I'll uh I'll start and and
 
05:01:53.670 --> 05:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
Brian can come in um that's been one of
 
05:01:56.110 --> 05:01:56.120 align:start position:0%
the the the contrasts that we've been
 
05:01:58.590 --> 05:01:58.600 align:start position:0%
talking about right with the the the
 
05:02:01.670 --> 05:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
sector impact um during the the pandemic
 
05:02:03.470 --> 05:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
recession versus the great recession
 
05:02:06.708 --> 05:02:06.718 align:start position:0%
whereas the Great Recession was um a
 
05:02:08.510 --> 05:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
percentage wise of people claiming
 
05:02:11.230 --> 05:02:11.240 align:start position:0%
unemployment much heavier within
 
05:02:12.590 --> 05:02:12.600 align:start position:0%
construction and
 
05:02:16.110 --> 05:02:16.120 align:start position:0%
Manufacturing um now um with the
 
05:02:18.190 --> 05:02:18.200 align:start position:0%
pandemic recession the the impacts are
 
05:02:23.548 --> 05:02:23.558 align:start position:0%
much um heavier on Hospitality retail
 
05:02:26.030 --> 05:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
Health Care uh but you know that that
 
05:02:29.628 --> 05:02:29.638 align:start position:0%
continues to be an area of demand U we
 
05:02:33.310 --> 05:02:33.320 align:start position:0%
still we have uh some folks from from
 
05:02:35.190 --> 05:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
the trades and from construction that
 
05:02:38.788 --> 05:02:38.798 align:start position:0%
are currently filing but percentage wise
 
05:02:41.750 --> 05:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
it's a much much smaller percentage than
 
05:02:44.750 --> 05:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
some of those those heavier um hit
 
05:02:47.350 --> 05:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
sectors like Health Care like
 
05:02:50.590 --> 05:02:50.600 align:start position:0%
Hospitality like retail um Brian what do
 
05:02:55.150 --> 05:02:55.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:57.948 --> 05:02:57.958 align:start position:0%
that when you're talking about um uh
 
05:02:59.830 --> 05:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
skilled trades people that's been an
 
05:03:02.750 --> 05:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
issue for some time um You Know Rich
 
05:03:04.390 --> 05:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned the Great Recession we saw a
 
05:03:07.070 --> 05:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
lot of people exit the uh the
 
05:03:09.190 --> 05:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
construction industry because
 
05:03:12.070 --> 05:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
construction was down for so long um it
 
05:03:16.230 --> 05:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
has been an area that um has not
 
05:03:18.750 --> 05:03:18.760 align:start position:0%
attracted a lot of young workers over
 
05:03:21.270 --> 05:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
the last decade or more um you know
 
05:03:23.190 --> 05:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
we've come through a period of time for
 
05:03:25.830 --> 05:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
decades where we've told every young
 
05:03:27.470 --> 05:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
person that they needed a four-year
 
05:03:29.350 --> 05:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
college degree in order to earn a decent
 
05:03:33.110 --> 05:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
living and that was a mistake um and and
 
05:03:36.070 --> 05:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
so it's been a struggle to get skilled
 
05:03:38.350 --> 05:03:38.360 align:start position:0%
trades people for some time I think that
 
05:03:40.670 --> 05:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
will probably continue there's greater
 
05:03:43.470 --> 05:03:43.480 align:start position:0%
efforts at the secondary school level to
 
05:03:46.270 --> 05:03:46.280 align:start position:0%
um to entice workers with apprenticeship
 
05:03:48.270 --> 05:03:48.280 align:start position:0%
programs and work different kinds of
 
05:03:50.030 --> 05:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
programs to get people interested I
 
05:03:51.948 --> 05:03:51.958 align:start position:0%
talked to people in the industry and
 
05:03:53.470 --> 05:03:53.480 align:start position:0%
they complain about it they have
 
05:03:55.628 --> 05:03:55.638 align:start position:0%
complained about it um and they've got
 
05:03:57.350 --> 05:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
campaigns in order to get more young
 
05:03:59.670 --> 05:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
people interested in the in the field
 
05:04:01.470 --> 05:04:01.480 align:start position:0%
but there is right now a seasonal
 
05:04:03.230 --> 05:04:03.240 align:start position:0%
slowdown Rich mentions we've seen an
 
05:04:05.708 --> 05:04:05.718 align:start position:0%
uptick um that's particularly in heavy
 
05:04:07.750 --> 05:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
construction you know things like roads
 
05:04:10.110 --> 05:04:10.120 align:start position:0%
and bridges and streets and sewer
 
05:04:12.830 --> 05:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
systems um that inevitably slows down
 
05:04:14.390 --> 05:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
this time of year so we're seeing kind
 
05:04:17.750 --> 05:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
of an uptick in um you know in claims in
 
05:04:17.760 --> 05:04:19.350 align:start position:0%
of an uptick in um you know in claims in
those

05:04:19.350 --> 05:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:04:22.110 --> 05:04:22.120 align:start position:0%
areas I'm talking about the building
 
05:04:27.230 --> 05:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
industry for homes and that's I I know I
 
05:04:29.948 --> 05:04:29.958 align:start position:0%
I know it's a small percentage but it's
 
05:04:33.150 --> 05:04:33.160 align:start position:0%
a catalyst for our economy it is
 
05:04:35.350 --> 05:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
without the housing availability we're
 
05:04:38.150 --> 05:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
not going to get people here to grow our
 
05:04:40.990 --> 05:04:41.000 align:start position:0%
economy right housing is a big issue
 
05:04:43.430 --> 05:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
Supply um I had some charts that I
 
05:04:45.030 --> 05:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
didn't include in this presentation
 
05:04:46.430 --> 05:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
because I didn't want to get too much
 
05:04:49.310 --> 05:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
into housing but there's two issues um
 
05:04:51.350 --> 05:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
you know there's a increase in demand
 
05:04:53.270 --> 05:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
part of that's pandemic related again
 
05:04:55.670 --> 05:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
Silver Lining if there is such a thing
 
05:04:59.470 --> 05:04:59.480 align:start position:0%
um but it it's also um a supply issue
 
05:05:01.670 --> 05:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
the supply has gone down consistently
 
05:05:04.750 --> 05:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
for almost a decade so months uh you
 
05:05:07.310 --> 05:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
know months to absorb the supply has
 
05:05:09.150 --> 05:05:09.160 align:start position:0%
gone down I have a chart that shows that
 
05:05:10.830 --> 05:05:10.840 align:start position:0%
so you've got a combination of both an
 
05:05:12.750 --> 05:05:12.760 align:start position:0%
increase in demand
 
05:05:15.750 --> 05:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
surprisingly um during a pandemic uh but
 
05:05:17.590 --> 05:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
interest rates are very low so there's
 
05:05:19.750 --> 05:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
there's demand for that and the supply
 
05:05:23.310 --> 05:05:23.320 align:start position:0%
has declined is has been declining I
 
05:05:26.230 --> 05:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
think that eventually it will get a
 
05:05:28.510 --> 05:05:28.520 align:start position:0%
little bit better we have a lot again we
 
05:05:31.350 --> 05:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
have a lot an older population and a lot
 
05:05:33.788 --> 05:05:33.798 align:start position:0%
of those individuals are aging in place
 
05:05:35.868 --> 05:05:35.878 align:start position:0%
they're staying in their homes but at a
 
05:05:38.310 --> 05:05:38.320 align:start position:0%
certain point those individuals tend to
 
05:05:40.830 --> 05:05:40.840 align:start position:0%
move to more um assisted living
 
05:05:43.670 --> 05:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
facilities or group kinds of of settings
 
05:05:45.990 --> 05:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
and that frees up some houses so I think
 
05:05:48.110 --> 05:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
probably over the next decade it'll be a
 
05:05:49.708 --> 05:05:49.718 align:start position:0%
little bit longer we'll start seeing
 
05:05:52.030 --> 05:05:52.040 align:start position:0%
more Supply come on and that will help
 
05:05:53.910 --> 05:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
ease some of it but the bottom line is
 
05:05:55.628 --> 05:05:55.638 align:start position:0%
we've got a lot of restrictions that are
 
05:05:58.190 --> 05:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
preventing and it it varies by Community
 
05:06:00.110 --> 05:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
some communities are very good and have
 
05:06:02.628 --> 05:06:02.638 align:start position:0%
allowed a lot and their communities that
 
05:06:04.230 --> 05:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
are seeing their demographics improve
 
05:06:05.670 --> 05:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
and I happen to live in one of those
 
05:06:08.230 --> 05:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
communities over where the you know the
 
05:06:10.670 --> 05:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
population has grown um the population
 
05:06:12.750 --> 05:06:12.760 align:start position:0%
of young people has grown and part of it
 
05:06:14.708 --> 05:06:14.718 align:start position:0%
has to do with the willingness to allow
 
05:06:16.750 --> 05:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
certain types of
 
05:06:19.990 --> 05:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
housing all right um we have two more
 
05:06:24.430 --> 05:06:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:28.670 --> 05:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
ralo you um a quick question about the
 
05:06:28.680 --> 05:06:29.708 align:start position:0%
ralo you um a quick question about the
uh

05:06:29.708 --> 05:06:29.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:06:32.590 --> 05:06:32.600 align:start position:0%
administrative contribution rate and
 
05:06:34.708 --> 05:06:34.718 align:start position:0%
where does that go I noticed that one up
 
05:06:34.718 --> 05:06:35.788 align:start position:0%
where does that go I noticed that one up
as

05:06:35.788 --> 05:06:35.798 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:06:40.110 --> 05:06:40.120 align:start position:0%
well yes representative so the the the
 
05:06:42.190 --> 05:06:42.200 align:start position:0%
administrative contribution rate so that
 
05:06:44.510 --> 05:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
is currently set at
 
05:06:48.390 --> 05:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
0.4% so that was essentially doubled as
 
05:06:50.230 --> 05:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
a part of that reform to the job
 
05:06:53.190 --> 05:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
training fund uh so uh the job training
 
05:06:55.590 --> 05:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
fund went from $2 million a year that
 
05:06:58.708 --> 05:06:58.718 align:start position:0%
was uh paid by New Hampshire employers
 
05:07:00.590 --> 05:07:00.600 align:start position:0%
but diverted from going into the trust
 
05:07:03.150 --> 05:07:03.160 align:start position:0%
fund and instead goes into job training
 
05:07:06.190 --> 05:07:06.200 align:start position:0%
fund now at that 6 million and in order
 
05:07:09.230 --> 05:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
to fund that additional increase the
 
05:07:12.310 --> 05:07:12.320 align:start position:0%
administrative contribution rate um was
 
05:07:16.070 --> 05:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
increased from 0.2 to 0.4 uh so right
 
05:07:19.150 --> 05:07:19.160 align:start position:0%
now the dollars generated by that uh
 
05:07:21.750 --> 05:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
they first go towards funding that $6
 
05:07:24.270 --> 05:07:24.280 align:start position:0%
million annually that goes into the job
 
05:07:27.590 --> 05:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
training fund then uh they uh then
 
05:07:30.270 --> 05:07:30.280 align:start position:0%
Supply New Hampshire employment security
 
05:07:33.230 --> 05:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
with administrative funding that which
 
05:07:35.628 --> 05:07:35.638 align:start position:0%
the federal government does not fund us
 
05:07:38.390 --> 05:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
to keep our our 12 New Hampshire Works
 
05:07:42.190 --> 05:07:42.200 align:start position:0%
offices open um we would have about six
 
05:07:44.470 --> 05:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
of those offices if we relied entirely
 
05:07:47.230 --> 05:07:47.240 align:start position:0%
on our federal uh Workforce dollars
 
05:07:49.670 --> 05:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
those AC dollars allow us to keep all 12
 
05:07:52.070 --> 05:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
of those offices open New Hampshire
 
05:07:55.310 --> 05:07:55.320 align:start position:0%
employment security is held harmless at
 
05:07:57.150 --> 05:07:57.160 align:start position:0%
the amount of administrative
 
05:07:58.948 --> 05:07:58.958 align:start position:0%
contribution funding that we received
 
05:08:01.708 --> 05:08:01.718 align:start position:0%
when the rate was 0.2 we received the
 
05:08:04.470 --> 05:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
same amount now even though the rate was
 
05:08:07.110 --> 05:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
increased to 04 so where does the rest
 
05:08:09.230 --> 05:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
of that go it then goes back into the
 
05:08:12.310 --> 05:08:12.320 align:start position:0%
trust fund so the the additional six the
 
05:08:14.750 --> 05:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
additional four million goes uh to bring
 
05:08:17.310 --> 05:08:17.320 align:start position:0%
that job training fund up to six million
 
05:08:19.190 --> 05:08:19.200 align:start position:0%
Employment Security is held harmless at
 
05:08:21.628 --> 05:08:21.638 align:start position:0%
what we had received for administrative
 
05:08:24.190 --> 05:08:24.200 align:start position:0%
funding in order to um Shore up that
 
05:08:26.430 --> 05:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
deficit from the Federal Grant and then
 
05:08:28.470 --> 05:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
the rest of it goes into the trust fund
 
05:08:30.830 --> 05:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
to try to reduce the impact on employer
 
05:08:34.510 --> 05:08:34.520 align:start position:0%
tax rates okay the last question is from
 
05:08:34.520 --> 05:08:38.390 align:start position:0%
tax rates okay the last question is from
representative

05:08:38.390 --> 05:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:42.150 --> 05:08:42.160 align:start position:0%
Alman thanks uh this is a followup on
 
05:08:45.708 --> 05:08:45.718 align:start position:0%
that question of Housing and we've
 
05:08:49.190 --> 05:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
got there are three people who know how
 
05:08:53.310 --> 05:08:53.320 align:start position:0%
to repair Wells within a 100 miles of
 
05:08:58.948 --> 05:08:58.958 align:start position:0%
me on they are almost impossible to
 
05:09:01.470 --> 05:09:01.480 align:start position:0%
get especially after the drought this
 
05:09:03.190 --> 05:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
last summer
 
05:09:07.590 --> 05:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
um and nobody else knows how to do that
 
05:09:10.910 --> 05:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
you can't you you you don't learn it
 
05:09:15.070 --> 05:09:15.080 align:start position:0%
growing up uh but it's just we don't
 
05:09:19.150 --> 05:09:19.160 align:start position:0%
have Carpenters we don't have plumbers
 
05:09:22.150 --> 05:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
on Carpenters can learn on the job
 
05:09:25.708 --> 05:09:25.718 align:start position:0%
usually plumbers electricians can't and
 
05:09:29.470 --> 05:09:29.480 align:start position:0%
you have to go a great distance from on
 
05:09:32.110 --> 05:09:32.120 align:start position:0%
the west of the state for instance to go
 
05:09:34.230 --> 05:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
to a place where you can get the
 
05:09:38.670 --> 05:09:38.680 align:start position:0%
training that you need on I'm just this
 
05:09:40.788 --> 05:09:40.798 align:start position:0%
has been a hobby horse of mine for some
 
05:09:45.070 --> 05:09:45.080 align:start position:0%
time to the Bia but um I just do you
 
05:09:50.510 --> 05:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
have any kind of data on on these kinds
 
05:09:53.470 --> 05:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
of jobs in different regions of the
 
05:09:56.948 --> 05:09:56.958 align:start position:0%
state is it I I had assumed this was a
 
05:09:58.628 --> 05:09:58.638 align:start position:0%
regional problem but you're talking
 
05:10:02.628 --> 05:10:02.638 align:start position:0%
about it as if it's a Statewide problem
 
05:10:05.670 --> 05:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
we do have data in terms of um job
 
05:10:08.150 --> 05:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
listings or both job listings that we
 
05:10:11.948 --> 05:10:11.958 align:start position:0%
have but also online job listings um by
 
05:10:13.830 --> 05:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
community at the community level so we
 
05:10:18.990 --> 05:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
can see um by any particular occupation
 
05:10:22.030 --> 05:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
what the demand is in a town or a county
 
05:10:24.548 --> 05:10:24.558 align:start position:0%
or a labor market area so we do have
 
05:10:27.990 --> 05:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
some idea um of that but that you know
 
05:10:28.000 --> 05:10:29.150 align:start position:0%
some idea um of that but that you know
that's

05:10:29.150 --> 05:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:10:31.708 --> 05:10:31.718 align:start position:0%
probably uh in the overall context a
 
05:10:34.390 --> 05:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
relative atively small number of
 
05:10:37.868 --> 05:10:37.878 align:start position:0%
individuals um and you know I don't know
 
05:10:39.430 --> 05:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
what the hiring practices of
 
05:10:41.430 --> 05:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
organizations that hire those folks
 
05:10:43.628 --> 05:10:43.638 align:start position:0%
whether they're used to using online job
 
05:10:47.310 --> 05:10:47.320 align:start position:0%
ads or whatnot so combination of factors
 
05:10:49.670 --> 05:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
and and I just
 
05:10:52.150 --> 05:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
subcontract these jobs that I was just
 
05:10:54.590 --> 05:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
talking about uh from a construction
 
05:10:56.628 --> 05:10:56.638 align:start position:0%
firm which is basically constructing the
 
05:10:59.030 --> 05:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
building and then they subcontract to
 
05:11:00.948 --> 05:11:00.958 align:start position:0%
the drainage expert can't find one of
 
05:11:03.990 --> 05:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
those either I a small
 
05:11:08.990 --> 05:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
complex and um so they probably don't
 
05:11:13.670 --> 05:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
appear in your files would be the yeah
 
05:11:17.030 --> 05:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
okay I'm I'm gonna wrap this up and want
 
05:11:20.270 --> 05:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
to thank both of Richard lers and Brian

I want to emphasize two points though
 
05:13:50.390 --> 05:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
number one demographic data the
 
05:13:52.030 --> 05:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
demographic data I'll present here
 
05:13:53.830 --> 05:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't include the period of the
 
05:13:57.390 --> 05:13:57.400 align:start position:0%
pandemic that data is not available yet
 
05:13:59.110 --> 05:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
from the Census Bureau or from anybody
 
05:14:00.190 --> 05:14:00.200 align:start position:0%
else for
 
05:14:03.190 --> 05:14:03.200 align:start position:0%
demography and ALS Al there's no data in
 
05:14:05.750 --> 05:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
this presentation from the 2020 census
 
05:14:08.270 --> 05:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
which has not no data from the 2020
 
05:14:10.910 --> 05:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
census has yet been released so we don't
 
05:14:14.788 --> 05:14:14.798 align:start position:0%
have access to that data yet either um
 
05:14:16.670 --> 05:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
it should the First Data from the 2020
 
05:14:18.948 --> 05:14:18.958 align:start position:0%
census will be released probably by
 
05:14:20.310 --> 05:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
March 1 and that'll be the
 
05:14:23.030 --> 05:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
reapportionment files uh which will be
 
05:14:25.230 --> 05:14:25.240 align:start position:0%
of great interest to everybody in New
 
05:14:27.590 --> 05:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and elsewhere in the United
 
05:14:29.948 --> 05:14:29.958 align:start position:0%
States but let me talk to you about the
 
05:14:33.150 --> 05:14:33.160 align:start position:0%
data that we do have and uh this first
 
05:14:34.948 --> 05:14:34.958 align:start position:0%
slide is the only one that goes all the
 
05:14:37.430 --> 05:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
way through July of
 
05:14:40.070 --> 05:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
2020 and it shows population change this
 
05:14:41.670 --> 05:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
one shows population change in New
 
05:14:44.350 --> 05:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the rest of New England
 
05:14:47.110 --> 05:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
and you can see here that the population
 
05:14:49.150 --> 05:14:49.160 align:start position:0%
estimates suggests that New Hampshire's
 
05:14:51.430 --> 05:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
population gain in each of the last
 
05:14:53.110 --> 05:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
three years have been larger than
 
05:14:55.510 --> 05:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
population gains in any other state in
 
05:14:57.510 --> 05:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
New England and actually in the
 
05:15:00.510 --> 05:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
Northeast um these are percentage gains
 
05:15:03.310 --> 05:15:03.320 align:start position:0%
though I caution to to remind you these
 
05:15:05.350 --> 05:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
are not number gains because of of
 
05:15:07.590 --> 05:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
course Massachusetts and Connecticut are
 
05:15:09.470 --> 05:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
much bigger States than New Hampshire is
 
05:15:12.150 --> 05:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
but in any event in the Northeast New
 
05:15:14.350 --> 05:15:14.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is actually doing reasonably
 
05:15:16.350 --> 05:15:16.360 align:start position:0%
well in terms of population change in
 
05:15:18.628 --> 05:15:18.638 align:start position:0%
the last few years although the growth
 
05:15:20.948 --> 05:15:20.958 align:start position:0%
in the Northeast and in New Hampshire is
 
05:15:22.750 --> 05:15:22.760 align:start position:0%
considerably slower than it is in other
 
05:15:24.190 --> 05:15:24.200 align:start position:0%
parts of the country in the South and
 
05:15:24.200 --> 05:15:25.070 align:start position:0%
parts of the country in the South and
the

05:15:25.070 --> 05:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:15:28.110 --> 05:15:28.120 align:start position:0%
West this begins to give you some idea
 
05:15:29.948 --> 05:15:29.958 align:start position:0%
and I'll come back to this theme at a
 
05:15:31.868 --> 05:15:31.878 align:start position:0%
number of points these SE are the
 
05:15:34.070 --> 05:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
different drivers of population change
 
05:15:36.548 --> 05:15:36.558 align:start position:0%
the blue bar here is how much population
 
05:15:39.110 --> 05:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
change there was in absolute numbers
 
05:15:41.670 --> 05:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
annually the red bar is the amount of
 
05:15:43.750 --> 05:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
natural increase natural increase is the
 
05:15:45.110 --> 05:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
difference between the number of births
 
05:15:47.548 --> 05:15:47.558 align:start position:0%
and the number of deaths in New
 
05:15:48.868 --> 05:15:48.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or elsewhere in the United
 
05:15:50.708 --> 05:15:50.718 align:start position:0%
States and then the green bar is
 
05:15:52.948 --> 05:15:52.958 align:start position:0%
migration and you can see if you look
 
05:15:56.270 --> 05:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
back over the last several decades that
 
05:15:57.990 --> 05:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of New Hampshire's growth is a
 
05:16:00.470 --> 05:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
function of net migration that is people
 
05:16:02.510 --> 05:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
moving into the state more people moving
 
05:16:05.030 --> 05:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
into the state than leave as you can see
 
05:16:06.788 --> 05:16:06.798 align:start position:0%
as we get closer to the more recent
 
05:16:09.150 --> 05:16:09.160 align:start position:0%
periods migration to New Hampshire has
 
05:16:11.708 --> 05:16:11.718 align:start position:0%
slowed and for a while natural increase
 
05:16:14.548 --> 05:16:14.558 align:start position:0%
the red bar again in the 1990s and the
 
05:16:17.590 --> 05:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
2000s actually contributed slightly more
 
05:16:21.070 --> 05:16:21.080 align:start position:0%
to the population growth since 2010
 
05:16:22.708 --> 05:16:22.718 align:start position:0%
natural increase in New Hampshire has
 
05:16:25.110 --> 05:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
slowed down quite a bit there are and in
 
05:16:26.868 --> 05:16:26.878 align:start position:0%
the last couple of years actually more
 
05:16:28.548 --> 05:16:28.558 align:start position:0%
people are dying in New Hampshire than
 
05:16:31.548 --> 05:16:31.558 align:start position:0%
being born so all the growth in New
 
05:16:33.430 --> 05:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in the last few years as I'll
 
05:16:35.670 --> 05:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
show you on this next slide have come
 
05:16:38.110 --> 05:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
from migration so if New Hampshire is
 
05:16:40.470 --> 05:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
going to grow it's going to grow through
 
05:16:42.948 --> 05:16:42.958 align:start position:0%
migration because the excess of births
 
05:16:45.230 --> 05:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
over deaths which used to help fuel the
 
05:16:47.510 --> 05:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
growth in New Hampshire no longer
 
05:16:50.590 --> 05:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
exists and obviously the covid epidemic
 
05:16:52.350 --> 05:16:52.360 align:start position:0%
is not going to make things any better
 
05:16:56.070 --> 05:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:59.390 --> 05:16:59.400 align:start position:0%
regard so again this shows you for the
 
05:17:01.830 --> 05:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
most recent periods and and I tried to
 
05:17:04.270 --> 05:17:04.280 align:start position:0%
characterize the periods here in
 
05:17:06.390 --> 05:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
relation to the Great Recession so you
 
05:17:08.628 --> 05:17:08.638 align:start position:0%
can see in 2010 to 2012 the great
 
05:17:10.628 --> 05:17:10.638 align:start position:0%
recession's effect was pretty
 
05:17:13.230 --> 05:17:13.240 align:start position:0%
substantial in New Hampshire and just as
 
05:17:14.990 --> 05:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
Brian mentioned in the earlier talk
 
05:17:17.990 --> 05:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
there was net outmigration of domestic
 
05:17:19.990 --> 05:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
migrants the orange bar here is
 
05:17:22.390 --> 05:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
immigrants the gray bar is domestic
 
05:17:24.230 --> 05:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
migration people moving to New Hampshire
 
05:17:25.708 --> 05:17:25.718 align:start position:0%
from other us
 
05:17:27.948 --> 05:17:27.958 align:start position:0%
destinations as the effect of the
 
05:17:30.270 --> 05:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
recession began to WAN and particularly
 
05:17:34.110 --> 05:17:34.120 align:start position:0%
in the last several years migration
 
05:17:36.150 --> 05:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
particularly domestic migration has been
 
05:17:38.230 --> 05:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
an important factor in the growth of New
 
05:17:40.150 --> 05:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in other words domestic
 
05:17:41.948 --> 05:17:41.958 align:start position:0%
migration has again started to
 
05:17:44.670 --> 05:17:44.680 align:start position:0%
contribute to the growth in the
 
05:17:48.390 --> 05:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
state just I want I want to give you a
 
05:17:50.708 --> 05:17:50.718 align:start position:0%
feeling for how these things change
 
05:17:53.270 --> 05:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
because when you look at this net change
 
05:17:56.190 --> 05:17:56.200 align:start position:0%
for example in migration it's 30,000
 
05:17:58.628 --> 05:17:58.638 align:start position:0%
people that's not very much in a state
 
05:18:01.708 --> 05:18:01.718 align:start position:0%
of 1 Point almost four million people
 
05:18:04.590 --> 05:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
but just to understand what's happening
 
05:18:06.150 --> 05:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
this is the number of people that moved
 
05:18:08.230 --> 05:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire in that period that
 
05:18:11.868 --> 05:18:11.878 align:start position:0%
fiveyear period about 245,000 people
 
05:18:14.190 --> 05:18:14.200 align:start position:0%
moved into New Hampshire
 
05:18:18.070 --> 05:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
214,000 left for a net change of 30,000
 
05:18:20.628 --> 05:18:20.638 align:start position:0%
what I want you to appreciate here is
 
05:18:23.750 --> 05:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
how much movement there was to produce
 
05:18:27.110 --> 05:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
this relatively modest change so the the
 
05:18:29.190 --> 05:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
actual people in New Hampshire a lot of
 
05:18:30.910 --> 05:18:30.920 align:start position:0%
them changed as a result of people
 
05:18:33.670 --> 05:18:33.680 align:start position:0%
moving in and out you can also see
 
05:18:36.470 --> 05:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
immigration and births and deaths but
 
05:18:38.510 --> 05:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
you can see the powerful influence of
 
05:18:41.470 --> 05:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
migration on change in the size of the
 
05:18:44.190 --> 05:18:44.200 align:start position:0%
population and in the actual people who
 
05:18:46.830 --> 05:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
are in the state this is natural
 
05:18:48.350 --> 05:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
increase this is the difference between
 
05:18:51.310 --> 05:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
births and deaths over the last 50 years
 
05:18:52.910 --> 05:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
and you can see New Hampshire used to
 
05:18:55.390 --> 05:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
have a fairly significantly higher
 
05:18:57.430 --> 05:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
number of births than deaths but in the
 
05:18:59.150 --> 05:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
period since the Great Recession that's
 
05:19:01.590 --> 05:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
dramatically changed and those Chang are
 
05:19:04.030 --> 05:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
driven by changes in the age structure
 
05:19:05.670 --> 05:19:05.680 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire population is getting
 
05:19:07.830 --> 05:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
older and that means that there are more
 
05:19:09.990 --> 05:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
people at risk of mortality and there
 
05:19:11.390 --> 05:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
are also fewer women in their
 
05:19:13.788 --> 05:19:13.798 align:start position:0%
childbearing years to produce children
 
05:19:15.548 --> 05:19:15.558 align:start position:0%
the birth rates have also diminished
 
05:19:17.070 --> 05:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
both in New Hampshire and in the United
 
05:19:19.948 --> 05:19:19.958 align:start position:0%
States generally and so the result has
 
05:19:22.430 --> 05:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
been that in the last three or four
 
05:19:23.910 --> 05:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
years New Hampshire actually has had
 
05:19:26.310 --> 05:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
more people die in it than be born and
 
05:19:28.030 --> 05:19:28.040 align:start position:0%
you can imagine now what's going to
 
05:19:31.510 --> 05:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
happen in 2020 when the effect of the co
 
05:19:34.830 --> 05:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
mortality wave starts to hit New
 
05:19:37.190 --> 05:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and many demographers
 
05:19:40.070 --> 05:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
including me also expect that in 2021
 
05:19:41.670 --> 05:19:41.680 align:start position:0%
this year there's going to be a
 
05:19:43.230 --> 05:19:43.240 align:start position:0%
significant decline in the number of
 
05:19:46.190 --> 05:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
births because as you would know of
 
05:19:47.948 --> 05:19:47.958 align:start position:0%
course you understand nine months have
 
05:19:50.030 --> 05:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
to elapse between a conception and a
 
05:19:53.990 --> 05:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
birth so as the pandemic began to be a
 
05:19:56.868 --> 05:19:56.878 align:start position:0%
bigger factor it's my expectation as
 
05:19:58.470 --> 05:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
well as that of lot of other
 
05:20:00.590 --> 05:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
demographers that probably the number of
 
05:20:02.430 --> 05:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
people who decided to have children
 
05:20:05.070 --> 05:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
diminished that it wasn't a good time to
 
05:20:08.150 --> 05:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
be having children and so I'm expecting
 
05:20:10.030 --> 05:20:10.040 align:start position:0%
the number of births to diminish next
 
05:20:12.708 --> 05:20:12.718 align:start position:0%
year uh this year as well as the number
 
05:20:15.628 --> 05:20:15.638 align:start position:0%
of deaths to remain high because of
 
05:20:18.750 --> 05:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
Co so in other words New Hampshire's
 
05:20:21.750 --> 05:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
future and its labor market mostly
 
05:20:23.110 --> 05:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
depend on
 
05:20:26.150 --> 05:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
migration so this is demestic migration
 
05:20:27.510 --> 05:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
this is the number of people moving to
 
05:20:30.788 --> 05:20:30.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire from other states in each
 
05:20:33.270 --> 05:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
year from 2005 before the Great
 
05:20:34.948 --> 05:20:34.958 align:start position:0%
Recession through the period of the
 
05:20:36.990 --> 05:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
Great Recession and then on into the
 
05:20:39.150 --> 05:20:39.160 align:start position:0%
recovery from the Great Recession and
 
05:20:41.350 --> 05:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
notice in particular the green bars are
 
05:20:43.510 --> 05:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
net migration so the blue bar is how
 
05:20:45.470 --> 05:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
many people moved into the state the red
 
05:20:47.830 --> 05:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
bar is how many people move out of the
 
05:20:51.910 --> 05:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
state and nor recently we've got had
 
05:20:53.548 --> 05:20:53.558 align:start position:0%
significantly more people moving into
 
05:20:55.868 --> 05:20:55.878 align:start position:0%
the state than out just as we did before
 
05:20:57.868 --> 05:20:57.878 align:start position:0%
the recession and if you could see the
 
05:21:00.390 --> 05:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
70s and the 80s and the 90s the blue bar
 
05:21:02.110 --> 05:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
would be remark markably High compared
 
05:21:04.430 --> 05:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
to the Red Bar you can see the exception
 
05:21:06.510 --> 05:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
to that was during the Great Recession
 
05:21:08.788 --> 05:21:08.798 align:start position:0%
when more people actually left New
 
05:21:11.670 --> 05:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire then came to it mostly because
 
05:21:13.430 --> 05:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
the number of people coming to New
 
05:21:15.510 --> 05:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire diminished you notice that the
 
05:21:18.788 --> 05:21:18.798 align:start position:0%
red bars don't change very much here
 
05:21:20.548 --> 05:21:20.558 align:start position:0%
what changes is the height of the blue
 
05:21:22.270 --> 05:21:22.280 align:start position:0%
bar which is the number of people coming
 
05:21:24.390 --> 05:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire so what's happened
 
05:21:26.548 --> 05:21:26.558 align:start position:0%
recently as the number of people coming
 
05:21:30.030 --> 05:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire has increased
 
05:21:30.040 --> 05:21:31.788 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire has increased
again

05:21:31.788 --> 05:21:31.798 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:21:34.310 --> 05:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
where do the de the migrants come to New
 
05:21:37.110 --> 05:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from the left Circle shows you
 
05:21:38.628 --> 05:21:38.638 align:start position:0%
where people moving to New Hampshire
 
05:21:40.708 --> 05:21:40.718 align:start position:0%
come from and as you probably aren't
 
05:21:43.350 --> 05:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
surprised the largest single source of
 
05:21:45.750 --> 05:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
Migrant migrants to New Hampshire are
 
05:21:49.110 --> 05:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
from Massachusetts uh almost 23% of the
 
05:21:51.190 --> 05:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
people living in Massachusetts were act
 
05:21:53.270 --> 05:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
or I'm sorry living in New Hampshire
 
05:21:54.910 --> 05:21:54.920 align:start position:0%
were actually born in
 
05:21:57.110 --> 05:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh including I suspect
 
05:21:59.910 --> 05:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
some of you on the right hand side is
 
05:22:01.670 --> 05:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
where people go to when they leave New
 
05:22:04.430 --> 05:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and you can see again that
 
05:22:06.510 --> 05:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is a big attractor but
 
05:22:08.270 --> 05:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
notice how much more attractive the
 
05:22:10.788 --> 05:22:10.798 align:start position:0%
south is and a lot of this is retirement
 
05:22:13.350 --> 05:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
migration to the South so just a feeling
 
05:22:14.910 --> 05:22:14.920 align:start position:0%
for where people are coming to and going
 
05:22:18.070 --> 05:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
from this represents about 53,000 in
 
05:22:20.110 --> 05:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
migrants to New Hampshire this
 
05:22:23.230 --> 05:22:23.240 align:start position:0%
represents about 42,000 out migrants and
 
05:22:25.190 --> 05:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
then I haven't shown in this graph but
 
05:22:27.990 --> 05:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
another 6,400 people moved into New
 
05:22:30.270 --> 05:22:30.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from abroad they came either
 
05:22:31.470 --> 05:22:31.480 align:start position:0%
as immigrants
 
05:22:33.310 --> 05:22:33.320 align:start position:0%
or they came as people coming back to
 
05:22:35.548 --> 05:22:35.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire who'd been away and at
 
05:22:39.150 --> 05:22:39.160 align:start position:0%
school or working in jobs
 
05:22:41.590 --> 05:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
overseas now New
 
05:22:45.910 --> 05:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire un is unusual in the sense
 
05:22:49.270 --> 05:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
that much more of its population is a
 
05:22:51.750 --> 05:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
result of domestic migration others
 
05:22:52.910 --> 05:22:52.920 align:start position:0%
these are people who live in New
 
05:22:54.430 --> 05:22:54.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who were not born in New
 
05:22:56.670 --> 05:22:56.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire these are immigrants to New
 
05:22:58.470 --> 05:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire these are people living in New
 
05:23:00.270 --> 05:23:00.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who were born in New Hampshire
 
05:23:01.868 --> 05:23:01.878 align:start position:0%
and you can see how New Hampshire is
 
05:23:04.310 --> 05:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
different either than massachus
 
05:23:05.510 --> 05:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and the rest of New
 
05:23:07.750 --> 05:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
England or than the United States more
 
05:23:10.510 --> 05:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
generally in that it has a much smaller
 
05:23:12.470 --> 05:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
proportion of its population born in the
 
05:23:14.670 --> 05:23:14.680 align:start position:0%
state and a much higher proportion of
 
05:23:18.670 --> 05:23:18.680 align:start position:0%
its population born in another US state
 
05:23:21.030 --> 05:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
about 42% of New Hampshire's whole
 
05:23:24.230 --> 05:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
population was born in another
 
05:23:26.670 --> 05:23:26.680 align:start position:0%
state if you look at the age structure
 
05:23:28.590 --> 05:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
of the population this not may not be
 
05:23:28.600 --> 05:23:29.470 align:start position:0%
of the population this not may not be
too

05:23:29.470 --> 05:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
too
 
05:23:31.990 --> 05:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
surprising among children more of them
 
05:23:33.548 --> 05:23:33.558 align:start position:0%
were born in New Hampshire but as soon
 
05:23:36.190 --> 05:23:36.200 align:start position:0%
as you get into the adult population you
 
05:23:38.390 --> 05:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
can see that a substantially larger
 
05:23:40.670 --> 05:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
proportion of the people living in New
 
05:23:43.390 --> 05:23:43.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire were born in other states and
 
05:23:45.430 --> 05:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
again I emphasize this to you because I
 
05:23:48.070 --> 05:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
want you to see how important migration
 
05:23:49.548 --> 05:23:49.558 align:start position:0%
is to New Hampshire particularly
 
05:23:52.628 --> 05:23:52.638 align:start position:0%
domestic migration from other us
 
05:23:54.628 --> 05:23:54.638 align:start position:0%
destinations and it's important in more
 
05:23:57.868 --> 05:23:57.878 align:start position:0%
ways than one New Hampshire benefits
 
05:24:00.590 --> 05:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
from migration into the state in terms
 
05:24:03.190 --> 05:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
of intellectual Capital that is the
 
05:24:05.510 --> 05:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
population moving into New Hampshire
 
05:24:07.548 --> 05:24:07.558 align:start position:0%
tends to be better educated and you can
 
05:24:10.190 --> 05:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
see that here in the orange bar which is
 
05:24:11.750 --> 05:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
the number of people who were born in
 
05:24:14.510 --> 05:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
another state who are college graduates
 
05:24:17.750 --> 05:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
nor that note that New Hampshire gains
 
05:24:19.430 --> 05:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
from that as well as it does from
 
05:24:21.548 --> 05:24:21.558 align:start position:0%
foreign born population in New Hampshire
 
05:24:23.190 --> 05:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
but that's just a small part of the
 
05:24:25.150 --> 05:24:25.160 align:start position:0%
population compared to the number of
 
05:24:27.470 --> 05:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
people born in the other state both of
 
05:24:29.110 --> 05:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
those groups are more likely to be
 
05:24:31.110 --> 05:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
college educated than the people
 
05:24:33.230 --> 05:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
residing in new who were born in New
 
05:24:35.990 --> 05:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at some college level you can
 
05:24:37.910 --> 05:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
see the patterns a little bit different
 
05:24:40.150 --> 05:24:40.160 align:start position:0%
and among less well educated people the
 
05:24:42.390 --> 05:24:42.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents tend to be a
 
05:24:45.270 --> 05:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
larger proportion than the college than
 
05:24:47.430 --> 05:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
the people moving from other
 
05:24:50.788 --> 05:24:50.798 align:start position:0%
places even during the recession these
 
05:24:52.990 --> 05:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
are the migration streams of different
 
05:24:54.948 --> 05:24:54.958 align:start position:0%
education levels into and out of New
 
05:24:57.948 --> 05:24:57.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire note that the New Hampshire
 
05:25:00.948 --> 05:25:00.958 align:start position:0%
still gained from from migration this is
 
05:25:02.150 --> 05:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
the number of people during the
 
05:25:04.310 --> 05:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
recession who moved out of New Hampshire
 
05:25:06.708 --> 05:25:06.718 align:start position:0%
who were college graduates annually on
 
05:25:08.350 --> 05:25:08.360 align:start position:0%
an average these are the number of
 
05:25:10.470 --> 05:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
people who moved in you can see that in
 
05:25:12.510 --> 05:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
a more recent period we have
 
05:25:14.990 --> 05:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
substantially more people moving in than
 
05:25:17.070 --> 05:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
moving out who are well educated so New
 
05:25:19.788 --> 05:25:19.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire benefits from an inflow of
 
05:25:22.470 --> 05:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
migrants it gains educated people from
 
05:25:25.470 --> 05:25:25.480 align:start position:0%
that these are age specific migration
 
05:25:27.590 --> 05:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
pattern showing you how different age
 
05:25:29.270 --> 05:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
groups move into and out of New
 
05:25:31.350 --> 05:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire these are older data from the
 
05:25:34.390 --> 05:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
1990s and the 2000s I'll show you some
 
05:25:36.590 --> 05:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
new data in just a minute but notice
 
05:25:38.948 --> 05:25:38.958 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire tends to gain people
 
05:25:42.150 --> 05:25:42.160 align:start position:0%
in their 30s and 40s and their children
 
05:25:44.948 --> 05:25:44.958 align:start position:0%
who would come with them it has in some
 
05:25:48.030 --> 05:25:48.040 align:start position:0%
decades it's had modest losses of people
 
05:25:50.310 --> 05:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
in their 20s and then it has modest
 
05:25:52.750 --> 05:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
gains in of older adults into the state
 
05:25:56.628 --> 05:25:56.638 align:start position:0%
as well so it's not as if everybody
 
05:25:58.830 --> 05:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
retires and moves to New Hampshire in
 
05:26:01.230 --> 05:26:01.240 align:start position:0%
fact New Hampshire tends to get more
 
05:26:04.830 --> 05:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
people in their 30s and 40s and again
 
05:26:06.230 --> 05:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
children with
 
05:26:08.830 --> 05:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
them this is the most recent data we
 
05:26:11.510 --> 05:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
have for I showed you two periods 2010
 
05:26:13.390 --> 05:26:13.400 align:start position:0%
to 14 when the states still recovering
 
05:26:16.070 --> 05:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
from the Great Recession and 15 to 19
 
05:26:18.070 --> 05:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
which is the newest data available and
 
05:26:20.830 --> 05:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
again you can see this inflow of people
 
05:26:22.948 --> 05:26:22.958 align:start position:0%
in their 30s together with their
 
05:26:25.230 --> 05:26:25.240 align:start position:0%
children the most recent data show an
 
05:26:27.830 --> 05:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
influx of people in their 20s as well
 
05:26:29.628 --> 05:26:29.638 align:start position:0%
again these are sample estimate data
 
05:26:31.070 --> 05:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
they're good samples they're from the
 
05:26:34.948 --> 05:26:34.958 align:start position:0%
ACs a big uh survey that the uh Census
 
05:26:36.868 --> 05:26:36.878 align:start position:0%
Bureau does but they are sample data
 
05:26:38.948 --> 05:26:38.958 align:start position:0%
they're not like having the census and
 
05:26:40.868 --> 05:26:40.878 align:start position:0%
so you can see that many of the trends
 
05:26:43.270 --> 05:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
that we see in the longer term data are
 
05:26:44.948 --> 05:26:44.958 align:start position:0%
continuing although it looks like we may
 
05:26:47.750 --> 05:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
be getting more young adults right
 
05:26:50.310 --> 05:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
now just to give you a feeling of New
 
05:26:52.070 --> 05:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire compared to another state this
 
05:26:55.070 --> 05:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
is Massachusetts Massachusetts tends to
 
05:26:58.590 --> 05:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
gain people in their 20s and again think
 
05:27:00.628 --> 05:27:00.638 align:start position:0%
of all the universities and colleges and
 
05:27:02.190 --> 05:27:02.200 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts who would
 
05:27:04.830 --> 05:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
attract uh people to them young people
 
05:27:07.590 --> 05:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
to them but Massachusetts tends to lose
 
05:27:10.510 --> 05:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
population in their 30s and 40s where
 
05:27:13.510 --> 05:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire gains those people and
 
05:27:15.470 --> 05:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
again given the big flow between New
 
05:27:17.788 --> 05:27:17.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Massachusetts you can see
 
05:27:19.910 --> 05:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
how this would play out so here's New
 
05:27:21.350 --> 05:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire gaining people in their 30s
 
05:27:24.350 --> 05:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
and 40s and their children whereas
 
05:27:26.310 --> 05:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is losing these young
 
05:27:28.510 --> 05:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
adults and some children and then I mean
 
05:27:30.510 --> 05:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
is gaining I'm sorry people in their 20s
 
05:27:31.830 --> 05:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
but it's losing people in all these
 
05:27:33.948 --> 05:27:33.958 align:start position:0%
other age
 
05:27:37.190 --> 05:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
groups just to give you one more idea of
 
05:27:39.030 --> 05:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
this and why it might be relevant in New
 
05:27:41.270 --> 05:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this is the number of children
 
05:27:43.628 --> 05:27:43.638 align:start position:0%
born in New Hampshire the blue bar and
 
05:27:45.230 --> 05:27:45.240 align:start position:0%
this is the number of children who begin
 
05:27:47.628 --> 05:27:47.638 align:start position:0%
the first grade six years later in New
 
05:27:50.708 --> 05:27:50.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so you'll notice in every
 
05:27:53.590 --> 05:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
year although it slowed during the
 
05:27:56.510 --> 05:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
recession but picked up a little bit
 
05:27:59.670 --> 05:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
near the end and every year more people
 
05:28:01.510 --> 05:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
begin the first grade more children
 
05:28:03.230 --> 05:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
began the first grade in New Hampshire
 
05:28:05.750 --> 05:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
than were born in New Hampshire six
 
05:28:08.788 --> 05:28:08.798 align:start position:0%
years earlier now this happens because
 
05:28:11.270 --> 05:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
those people who are moving into New
 
05:28:13.390 --> 05:28:13.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire those people in their 30s and
 
05:28:15.708 --> 05:28:15.718 align:start position:0%
40s are bringing their children with
 
05:28:18.868 --> 05:28:18.878 align:start position:0%
them and as a result New Hampshire gains
 
05:28:21.270 --> 05:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
children in its school system because of
 
05:28:24.270 --> 05:28:24.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:27.190 --> 05:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
people now as you well know demographic
 
05:28:30.070 --> 05:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
change varies across New Hampshire this
 
05:28:33.030 --> 05:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
just shows you for the 2010 to
 
05:28:36.310 --> 05:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
209 period on the right and for 2000
 
05:28:39.548 --> 05:28:39.558 align:start position:0%
to20 it shows the relative annual growth
 
05:28:41.830 --> 05:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
rate in different parts of the state so
 
05:28:44.948 --> 05:28:44.958 align:start position:0%
Reds and pinks are places that lost
 
05:28:47.788 --> 05:28:47.798 align:start position:0%
population greens and blues particularly
 
05:28:51.470 --> 05:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
Blues are places that gain population uh
 
05:28:53.750 --> 05:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
during the 10 the nine-year period from
 
05:28:57.350 --> 05:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
2010 to 19 given our census estimates so
 
05:29:00.070 --> 05:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
you can see that the general trend is
 
05:29:02.868 --> 05:29:02.878 align:start position:0%
the same usually it's the northern part
 
05:29:04.948 --> 05:29:04.958 align:start position:0%
of the
 
05:29:07.590 --> 05:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
state which has the smaller population
 
05:29:10.510 --> 05:29:10.520 align:start position:0%
gains or actually loses populations and
 
05:29:12.628 --> 05:29:12.638 align:start position:0%
then in the southern part of the state
 
05:29:15.708 --> 05:29:15.718 align:start position:0%
especially just beyond the Boston uh
 
05:29:18.150 --> 05:29:18.160 align:start position:0%
metropolitan area Edge are areas that
 
05:29:19.350 --> 05:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
are gaining
 
05:29:21.910 --> 05:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
population so even though there's less
 
05:29:25.788 --> 05:29:25.798 align:start position:0%
population gain 2010 to 2019 generally
 
05:29:28.990 --> 05:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
the patterns of how that gain occurs are
 
05:29:31.868 --> 05:29:31.878 align:start position:0%
very similar let me give you an example
 
05:29:34.150 --> 05:29:34.160 align:start position:0%
this is for three different counties in
 
05:29:37.150 --> 05:29:37.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire here's Coos County Carrol
 
05:29:38.910 --> 05:29:38.920 align:start position:0%
County a big recreational County in the
 
05:29:40.390 --> 05:29:40.400 align:start position:0%
middle part of the state and then
 
05:29:43.030 --> 05:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County and you can see that in
 
05:29:45.788 --> 05:29:45.798 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County population growth has
 
05:29:48.788 --> 05:29:48.798 align:start position:0%
occurred between 2010 and 2019 both
 
05:29:50.670 --> 05:29:50.680 align:start position:0%
because of natural increase the Red Bar
 
05:29:53.590 --> 05:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
Bar and because of migration into the
 
05:29:57.310 --> 05:29:57.320 align:start position:0%
state mostly immigration into this uh
 
05:30:00.430 --> 05:30:00.440 align:start position:0%
area but not all of it Carroll County
 
05:30:03.030 --> 05:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
the recreational County actually has
 
05:30:05.350 --> 05:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
more people die than be born in it
 
05:30:07.270 --> 05:30:07.280 align:start position:0%
because it attracts
 
05:30:09.390 --> 05:30:09.400 align:start position:0%
migrants who are attracted by its
 
05:30:11.190 --> 05:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
amenities and opportunities for
 
05:30:13.670 --> 05:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
recreation and many of them had owned
 
05:30:15.150 --> 05:30:15.160 align:start position:0%
second homes and moved to them
 
05:30:17.230 --> 05:30:17.240 align:start position:0%
eventually and there may be more of that
 
05:30:19.910 --> 05:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
going on because of the covid epidemic
 
05:30:21.708 --> 05:30:21.718 align:start position:0%
people who are it appears that people
 
05:30:23.590 --> 05:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
who have second homes are using them
 
05:30:27.150 --> 05:30:27.160 align:start position:0%
more now than they have in the past so
 
05:30:29.430 --> 05:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
that migration into Carol County is
 
05:30:31.990 --> 05:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
enough to offset the natural decrease
 
05:30:35.230 --> 05:30:35.240 align:start position:0%
Coos County has a substantial amount of
 
05:30:37.470 --> 05:30:37.480 align:start position:0%
natural decrease so considerably more
 
05:30:39.868 --> 05:30:39.878 align:start position:0%
deaths than birs and a very modest
 
05:30:42.788 --> 05:30:42.798 align:start position:0%
amount of migration into the county
 
05:30:45.070 --> 05:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
which partially but can't totally offset
 
05:30:46.990 --> 05:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
this natural increase to produce
 
05:30:50.270 --> 05:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
population decline so even within the
 
05:30:52.868 --> 05:30:52.878 align:start position:0%
state there's quite a bit of variation
 
05:30:55.310 --> 05:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
and then this is just Hillsboro County
 
05:30:57.350 --> 05:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
and i' broken it up into the city of
 
05:31:00.548 --> 05:31:00.558 align:start position:0%
Manchester the city of NASA and then the
 
05:31:01.990 --> 05:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
rest of the county which I'm calling
 
05:31:04.830 --> 05:31:04.840 align:start position:0%
Suburban Hillsboro County and you can
 
05:31:07.750 --> 05:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
see even at this narrower
 
05:31:10.948 --> 05:31:10.958 align:start position:0%
view in man both Manchester and NASA
 
05:31:12.830 --> 05:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
what growth there is is coming from
 
05:31:14.708 --> 05:31:14.718 align:start position:0%
natural increase it's become because
 
05:31:16.910 --> 05:31:16.920 align:start position:0%
there are more births and deaths in the
 
05:31:20.948 --> 05:31:20.958 align:start position:0%
city Manchester has lost po has lost
 
05:31:23.830 --> 05:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
population throughout migration NASA is
 
05:31:26.628 --> 05:31:26.638 align:start position:0%
just about holding even in contrast in
 
05:31:29.310 --> 05:31:29.320 align:start position:0%
the Suburban part of the county there's
 
05:31:30.868 --> 05:31:30.878 align:start position:0%
natural increase but there's also a
 
05:31:32.590 --> 05:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
significant amount of migration into
 
05:31:34.430 --> 05:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
these areas which is fueling population
 
05:31:36.390 --> 05:31:36.400 align:start position:0%
increase now I emphasize again to you
 
05:31:38.788 --> 05:31:38.798 align:start position:0%
these are estimates we won't know some
 
05:31:42.230 --> 05:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
of these numbers for sure until the 2020
 
05:31:46.110 --> 05:31:46.120 align:start position:0%
census um and so it's just to give you a
 
05:31:48.868 --> 05:31:48.878 align:start position:0%
feel for how much variability there is
 
05:31:51.470 --> 05:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
in demographic change around the state
 
05:31:53.750 --> 05:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
both from County to County but even
 
05:31:56.190 --> 05:31:56.200 align:start position:0%
within a county between place to place
 
05:31:58.670 --> 05:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
now these patterns that you see with the
 
05:32:01.590 --> 05:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
cities gaining population mostly through
 
05:32:03.390 --> 05:32:03.400 align:start position:0%
natural increase and the suburban area
 
05:32:05.510 --> 05:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
is experiencing both migration and
 
05:32:07.708 --> 05:32:07.718 align:start position:0%
natural increase these same patterns
 
05:32:09.628 --> 05:32:09.638 align:start position:0%
would play out in almost any
 
05:32:11.708 --> 05:32:11.718 align:start position:0%
Metropolitan county in the United States
 
05:32:14.628 --> 05:32:14.638 align:start position:0%
if you went to you know Boston metro
 
05:32:18.430 --> 05:32:18.440 align:start position:0%
area if you went to Denver or Chicago
 
05:32:20.548 --> 05:32:20.558 align:start position:0%
you would see similar patterns of the
 
05:32:22.310 --> 05:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
Cities growing mostly for natural
 
05:32:24.788 --> 05:32:24.798 align:start position:0%
increase and the suburbs growing a lot
 
05:32:26.750 --> 05:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
from that
 
05:32:28.910 --> 05:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
migration you've heard already about how
 
05:32:31.070 --> 05:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is aging let's let me just
 
05:32:33.230 --> 05:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
show you the latest data that we have on
 
05:32:35.830 --> 05:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
that here's the demographic change in
 
05:32:38.150 --> 05:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire by age so these are 0 to9
 
05:32:41.390 --> 05:32:41.400 align:start position:0%
year olds 10 to 19 year olds 60 to 69
 
05:32:43.628 --> 05:32:43.638 align:start position:0%
year olds this is the
 
05:32:46.830 --> 05:32:46.840 align:start position:0%
1990s this is the 2ou I'm sorry this is
 
05:32:50.548 --> 05:32:50.558 align:start position:0%
the 1990s the blue this is the 2000s
 
05:32:53.470 --> 05:32:53.480 align:start position:0%
this is the period since 2010 and you
 
05:32:57.350 --> 05:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
can see that New Hampshire has tended to
 
05:33:01.190 --> 05:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
lose younger people because of age much
 
05:33:04.070 --> 05:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
of it because of aging and gain people
 
05:33:06.990 --> 05:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
in these older age groups much of this
 
05:33:08.750 --> 05:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
is the Aging of the baby boom New
 
05:33:11.110 --> 05:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a very large Baby Boom age
 
05:33:13.470 --> 05:33:13.480 align:start position:0%
population and as they've aged from the
 
05:33:17.270 --> 05:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
90s to the 2000s to the
 
05:33:19.868 --> 05:33:19.878 align:start position:0%
2010s the population is essentially
 
05:33:22.030 --> 05:33:22.040 align:start position:0%
shifting this way as a lot of New
 
05:33:24.868 --> 05:33:24.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's population ages in place so
 
05:33:28.510 --> 05:33:28.520 align:start position:0%
the population is Aging in the state and
 
05:33:30.030 --> 05:33:30.040 align:start position:0%
there are the number of children in the
 
05:33:31.948 --> 05:33:31.958 align:start position:0%
the state is
 
05:33:34.470 --> 05:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
diminishing this is a population pyramid
 
05:33:36.070 --> 05:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
that demographers use to look at how the
 
05:33:38.470 --> 05:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
population is changing these are men in
 
05:33:40.990 --> 05:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
blue and women in red these are the
 
05:33:42.548 --> 05:33:42.558 align:start position:0%
youngest this is
 
05:33:46.110 --> 05:33:46.120 align:start position:0%
1990 so this is the youngest age group z
 
05:33:48.868 --> 05:33:48.878 align:start position:0%
to four year olds in 1990 these babies
 
05:33:51.868 --> 05:33:51.878 align:start position:0%
would have been born in 1986 to
 
05:33:54.350 --> 05:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
90 you might see your children or your
 
05:33:58.110 --> 05:33:58.120 align:start position:0%
grandchildren in this group up here is
 
05:34:01.628 --> 05:34:01.638 align:start position:0%
in their 30s in 1990 30 to 34 year olds
 
05:34:03.390 --> 05:34:03.400 align:start position:0%
is the very heart of the baby boom the
 
05:34:05.310 --> 05:34:05.320 align:start position:0%
largest cohorts of the baby boom are
 
05:34:07.830 --> 05:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
right here so that bulge you see right
 
05:34:09.948 --> 05:34:09.958 align:start position:0%
there with the smaller bulges on either
 
05:34:12.470 --> 05:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
side of it that's the baby boom and you
 
05:34:14.548 --> 05:34:14.558 align:start position:0%
could look in any state in the United
 
05:34:16.230 --> 05:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
States you could look at the United
 
05:34:19.390 --> 05:34:19.400 align:start position:0%
States data as a whole in 1990 you would
 
05:34:23.470 --> 05:34:23.480 align:start position:0%
see this big bulge there's the baby boom
 
05:34:25.070 --> 05:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
here's where the baby boom should have
 
05:34:27.590 --> 05:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
had their children but they delayed
 
05:34:29.990 --> 05:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
having children that is where the baby
 
05:34:31.628 --> 05:34:31.638 align:start position:0%
boom mothers the mothers of the baby
 
05:34:33.548 --> 05:34:33.558 align:start position:0%
boom mostly had their babies when they
 
05:34:37.590 --> 05:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
were 20 or 21 or 22 in their early 20s
 
05:34:40.708 --> 05:34:40.718 align:start position:0%
the Baby Boomers themselves didn't have
 
05:34:42.110 --> 05:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
their children until they were a little
 
05:34:46.110 --> 05:34:46.120 align:start position:0%
bit older this Gap is where these
 
05:34:48.470 --> 05:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
mothers these women should have had
 
05:34:50.788 --> 05:34:50.798 align:start position:0%
their children but here they are instead
 
05:34:52.750 --> 05:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
having their children further down so
 
05:34:56.430 --> 05:34:56.440 align:start position:0%
this Notch is partially a relate a
 
05:34:58.548 --> 05:34:58.558 align:start position:0%
function of the delayed fertility among
 
05:35:00.788 --> 05:35:00.798 align:start position:0%
the baby boom Okay so this is
 
05:35:03.390 --> 05:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
1990 average age of the New Hampshire's
 
05:35:06.430 --> 05:35:06.440 align:start position:0%
population the median age was 32.8 these
 
05:35:08.948 --> 05:35:08.958 align:start position:0%
red bars represent the working ages from
 
05:35:11.990 --> 05:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
18 to 65 now I'm going to move
 
05:35:15.430 --> 05:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
forward this is 2000 see the baby boom
 
05:35:18.430 --> 05:35:18.440 align:start position:0%
moving up and that Notch that we
 
05:35:21.948 --> 05:35:21.958 align:start position:0%
saw uh is now the 20 to 24 year olds in
 
05:35:23.868 --> 05:35:23.878 align:start position:0%
2000 one of the big worries in New
 
05:35:25.548 --> 05:35:25.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was that there weren't very
 
05:35:27.910 --> 05:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
many young people and there was a lot of
 
05:35:31.030 --> 05:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
concern about why that was one school of
 
05:35:32.868 --> 05:35:32.878 align:start position:0%
thought was that those that lots of
 
05:35:34.948 --> 05:35:34.958 align:start position:0%
young people were leaving New Hampshire
 
05:35:36.750 --> 05:35:36.760 align:start position:0%
in fact what happened is they were
 
05:35:39.628 --> 05:35:39.638 align:start position:0%
really never born because of the delay
 
05:35:41.190 --> 05:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
in the mothers of the CH of the baby
 
05:35:42.788 --> 05:35:42.798 align:start position:0%
boom in having their
 
05:35:46.430 --> 05:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
children so this is 19 this is 200000
 
05:35:49.830 --> 05:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
the median age has gone up here's
 
05:35:52.830 --> 05:35:52.840 align:start position:0%
2010 so now everybody's 10 years older
 
05:35:56.868 --> 05:35:56.878 align:start position:0%
so those baby boomers are now in their
 
05:36:01.150 --> 05:36:01.160 align:start position:0%
50s or right and here are
 
05:36:03.190 --> 05:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
that that little notched group that we
 
05:36:05.270 --> 05:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
had talked about before born in the 70
 
05:36:07.788 --> 05:36:07.798 align:start position:0%
early 70s or mid '70s and then this was
 
05:36:10.430 --> 05:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
the babies who were just born in 1990
 
05:36:11.590 --> 05:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
now they're in their
 
05:36:14.150 --> 05:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
20s and then finally here's the most
 
05:36:18.390 --> 05:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
recent data for 29 20 2019 you can see
 
05:36:21.548 --> 05:36:21.558 align:start position:0%
the big bulges now of older adults in
 
05:36:24.310 --> 05:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire this is the baby boom
 
05:36:28.350 --> 05:36:28.360 align:start position:0%
aging into their older age groups and
 
05:36:30.350 --> 05:36:30.360 align:start position:0%
when Brian was saying before or you've
 
05:36:32.190 --> 05:36:32.200 align:start position:0%
heard in other places that the older
 
05:36:33.750 --> 05:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
population in New Hampshire is going to
 
05:36:36.190 --> 05:36:36.200 align:start position:0%
gain very rapidly or grow very rapidly
 
05:36:39.190 --> 05:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
here it is these are people who are
 
05:36:42.430 --> 05:36:42.440 align:start position:0%
aging into the older age groups
 
05:36:44.030 --> 05:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
including the baby that heart of the
 
05:36:47.910 --> 05:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
baby boom which in 2019 is now in their
 
05:36:50.708 --> 05:36:50.718 align:start position:0%
60s and the cohorts above them who are
 
05:36:52.548 --> 05:36:52.558 align:start position:0%
baby boomers too and are still big
 
05:36:54.948 --> 05:36:54.958 align:start position:0%
cohorts but you can see these very large
 
05:36:57.230 --> 05:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
cohorts and then behind them are much
 
05:37:00.670 --> 05:37:00.680 align:start position:0%
smaller cohorts so this is of the issues
 
05:37:03.030 --> 05:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire CH faces is this
 
05:37:05.670 --> 05:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
aging of its population the median age
 
05:37:07.910 --> 05:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
is now up to
 
05:37:12.868 --> 05:37:12.878 align:start position:0%
43 now this aging is is varies across
 
05:37:15.350 --> 05:37:15.360 align:start position:0%
the state these are population
 
05:37:16.990 --> 05:37:17.000 align:start position:0%
projections I didn't make these
 
05:37:19.230 --> 05:37:19.240 align:start position:0%
population projections but somebody else
 
05:37:21.430 --> 05:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
did for the New Hampshire office of
 
05:37:23.628 --> 05:37:23.638 align:start position:0%
strategic initiatives and what it's
 
05:37:24.910 --> 05:37:24.920 align:start position:0%
showing you is different age groups
 
05:37:28.190 --> 05:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
these are 0 to 19 year olds 20 to 39
 
05:37:30.910 --> 05:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
year olds 40 to 64 year olds the older
 
05:37:32.270 --> 05:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
part of the labor force and then these
 
05:37:33.470 --> 05:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
are older
 
05:37:36.750 --> 05:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
adults this is their age distribution
 
05:37:39.788 --> 05:37:39.798 align:start position:0%
through 2020 and these are EST these are
 
05:37:41.948 --> 05:37:41.958 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire offic of strategic
 
05:37:43.548 --> 05:37:43.558 align:start position:0%
initiatives estimates of what the
 
05:37:46.270 --> 05:37:46.280 align:start position:0%
population will look like in the next
 
05:37:49.470 --> 05:37:49.480 align:start position:0%
this is 2030 2035 and so forth you can
 
05:37:51.868 --> 05:37:51.878 align:start position:0%
see again the Aging of the
 
05:37:54.430 --> 05:37:54.440 align:start position:0%
population the number of people in their
 
05:37:58.310 --> 05:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
40s to 60s stays relatively stable but
 
05:38:00.990 --> 05:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
the older population inre inrees in size
 
05:38:03.110 --> 05:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
so this is just one estimate it it's
 
05:38:05.230 --> 05:38:05.240 align:start position:0%
subject to considerable error we
 
05:38:07.230 --> 05:38:07.240 align:start position:0%
whenever we make projections there's
 
05:38:10.628 --> 05:38:10.638 align:start position:0%
always a chance of mistakes or errors in
 
05:38:12.990 --> 05:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
changes in situations for example this
 
05:38:16.350 --> 05:38:16.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:18.990 --> 05:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic the population distribution by
 
05:38:21.830 --> 05:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
age in New Hampshire varies as well some
 
05:38:23.948 --> 05:38:23.958 align:start position:0%
parts of New Hampshire have larger
 
05:38:26.708 --> 05:38:26.718 align:start position:0%
proportions of children so the these
 
05:38:29.990 --> 05:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
gold towns or tracks are are places
 
05:38:31.708 --> 05:38:31.718 align:start position:0%
where there are lots of
 
05:38:33.990 --> 05:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
children a lot and not only are there
 
05:38:35.590 --> 05:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
lots of children as you can see over
 
05:38:36.868 --> 05:38:36.878 align:start position:0%
here because it's showing how many
 
05:38:39.548 --> 05:38:39.558 align:start position:0%
children and where they are but also the
 
05:38:42.628 --> 05:38:42.638 align:start position:0%
proportion of children is high so these
 
05:38:44.030 --> 05:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
are the kind of areas that might be
 
05:38:46.270 --> 05:38:46.280 align:start position:0%
concerned about things like should we
 
05:38:48.708 --> 05:38:48.718 align:start position:0%
build a new school should we add a wing
 
05:38:50.270 --> 05:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
to the school so we'll have room for
 
05:38:50.280 --> 05:38:52.990 align:start position:0%
to the school so we'll have room for
more

05:38:52.990 --> 05:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:55.708 --> 05:38:55.718 align:start position:0%
children in other parts of the state
 
05:38:58.030 --> 05:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
where the child population is relatively
 
05:39:00.070 --> 05:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
small the issue
 
05:39:01.948 --> 05:39:01.958 align:start position:0%
for the schools might be different
 
05:39:04.150 --> 05:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
should we consol do we have to
 
05:39:06.548 --> 05:39:06.558 align:start position:0%
consolidate can we are we going to have
 
05:39:08.628 --> 05:39:08.638 align:start position:0%
to close one of our schools because we
 
05:39:10.310 --> 05:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
don't have room we don't have enough
 
05:39:13.110 --> 05:39:13.120 align:start position:0%
children anymore so again even in a
 
05:39:14.670 --> 05:39:14.680 align:start position:0%
state like New Hampshire which is small
 
05:39:17.230 --> 05:39:17.240 align:start position:0%
in size there's considerable variability
 
05:39:19.990 --> 05:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
in the age structure of the population
 
05:39:22.868 --> 05:39:22.878 align:start position:0%
this is the working age population again
 
05:39:24.990 --> 05:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
you can see the large concentrations of
 
05:39:28.230 --> 05:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
people in the working ages down here and
 
05:39:30.270 --> 05:39:30.280 align:start position:0%
then in other parts of the St State a
 
05:39:32.110 --> 05:39:32.120 align:start position:0%
smaller proportion of the population in
 
05:39:34.948 --> 05:39:34.958 align:start position:0%
the labor force age group and again
 
05:39:36.948 --> 05:39:36.958 align:start position:0%
here's the actual numbers these are
 
05:39:39.190 --> 05:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
percentages so this is giving you a
 
05:39:41.548 --> 05:39:41.558 align:start position:0%
feeling of the relative size this is the
 
05:39:44.030 --> 05:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
absolute numbers so you can see the
 
05:39:45.990 --> 05:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
concentration of working age population
 
05:39:50.030 --> 05:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
here for example this then is the older
 
05:39:52.750 --> 05:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
population and again you can see that
 
05:39:54.868 --> 05:39:54.878 align:start position:0%
proportionally the population tends to
 
05:39:56.310 --> 05:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
be older in the northern part of the
 
05:39:57.830 --> 05:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
state than it does in the southern part
 
05:40:00.590 --> 05:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
of the state but the vast majority of
 
05:40:02.468 --> 05:40:02.478 align:start position:0%
older adults are in the southern part of
 
05:40:02.478 --> 05:40:03.430 align:start position:0%
older adults are in the southern part of
the

05:40:03.430 --> 05:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:40:03.440 --> 05:40:05.350 align:start position:0%
the
state

05:40:05.350 --> 05:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:40:08.350 --> 05:40:08.360 align:start position:0%
so again I I just want you to see that
 
05:40:10.468 --> 05:40:10.478 align:start position:0%
there's more than one way to think about
 
05:40:13.230 --> 05:40:13.240 align:start position:0%
these data the percentage distributions
 
05:40:16.468 --> 05:40:16.478 align:start position:0%
tell you one thing where are seniors a
 
05:40:18.990 --> 05:40:19.000 align:start position:0%
large part of the population but another
 
05:40:20.510 --> 05:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
question is where are there a lot of
 
05:40:22.868 --> 05:40:22.878 align:start position:0%
seniors and you can see that that's more
 
05:40:24.270 --> 05:40:24.280 align:start position:0%
likely to be in the southern part of the
 
05:40:27.670 --> 05:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:30.110 --> 05:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
is in terms of racial and ethnic
 
05:40:32.230 --> 05:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
diversity New Hampshire remains far less
 
05:40:33.708 --> 05:40:33.718 align:start position:0%
diverse than the rest of the country but
 
05:40:35.548 --> 05:40:35.558 align:start position:0%
it's growing in a diversity just like
 
05:40:37.788 --> 05:40:37.798 align:start position:0%
the rest of the country this is the
 
05:40:40.110 --> 05:40:40.120 align:start position:0%
racial diversity of the United States in
 
05:40:44.468 --> 05:40:44.478 align:start position:0%
each County and the measure here is if
 
05:40:46.788 --> 05:40:46.798 align:start position:0%
you ran into another random individual
 
05:40:48.590 --> 05:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
in this County what are the chances that
 
05:40:51.948 --> 05:40:51.958 align:start position:0%
they're of the same race and ethnicity
 
05:40:53.590 --> 05:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
as you or of A different race in
 
05:40:56.868 --> 05:40:56.878 align:start position:0%
ethnicity in the oranges and reds are
 
05:40:58.628 --> 05:40:58.638 align:start position:0%
places where the chances that somebody
 
05:40:59.990 --> 05:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
you run into in the street is going to
 
05:41:02.990 --> 05:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
be different than you is higher in the
 
05:41:05.070 --> 05:41:05.080 align:start position:0%
areas that are Blues especially the
 
05:41:07.670 --> 05:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
darker Blues are places where if you run
 
05:41:09.868 --> 05:41:09.878 align:start position:0%
into somebody on the street they're
 
05:41:11.868 --> 05:41:11.878 align:start position:0%
likely to be the same race and ethnicity
 
05:41:14.350 --> 05:41:14.360 align:start position:0%
as you so you can see the remarkable
 
05:41:17.070 --> 05:41:17.080 align:start position:0%
diversity within the United States but
 
05:41:18.990 --> 05:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
you can also see how it varies from
 
05:41:21.390 --> 05:41:21.400 align:start position:0%
place to place here's a closeup of New
 
05:41:23.670 --> 05:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
England just so you can see New England
 
05:41:25.230 --> 05:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
and again you can see the level of
 
05:41:27.510 --> 05:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
diversity in New England is far lower
 
05:41:28.948 --> 05:41:28.958 align:start position:0%
than in other parts of the state I know
 
05:41:30.628 --> 05:41:30.638 align:start position:0%
this is is no news to you but I just
 
05:41:34.868 --> 05:41:34.878 align:start position:0%
wanted you to see it graphically but
 
05:41:37.948 --> 05:41:37.958 align:start position:0%
even though that's the case in New
 
05:41:40.788 --> 05:41:40.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire about 10% of the population
 
05:41:44.230 --> 05:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
10.2% of the population is minority but
 
05:41:45.830 --> 05:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
here's the key thing I want you to see
 
05:41:48.910 --> 05:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
in this most of the growth in New
 
05:41:52.230 --> 05:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's population 93% of the growth
 
05:41:54.350 --> 05:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
in the population of New Hampshire since
 
05:41:57.910 --> 05:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
2010 has been of minority people the
 
05:41:59.708 --> 05:41:59.718 align:start position:0%
minority PE population
 
05:42:02.190 --> 05:42:02.200 align:start position:0%
is growing more rapidly than the white
 
05:42:04.030 --> 05:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
population is so even though it
 
05:42:05.948 --> 05:42:05.958 align:start position:0%
represents a very Modest part of the
 
05:42:09.750 --> 05:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
state it's a growing part of the
 
05:42:12.350 --> 05:42:12.360 align:start position:0%
state and if you want to look at what
 
05:42:14.030 --> 05:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
parts of the population this is
 
05:42:16.750 --> 05:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
happening in here's the white population
 
05:42:18.590 --> 05:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
this is non-hispanic Whites Whites who
 
05:42:21.190 --> 05:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
are not Hispanic here's the white
 
05:42:23.788 --> 05:42:23.798 align:start position:0%
population and then here is the uh
 
05:42:25.708 --> 05:42:25.718 align:start position:0%
minority population so you can see that
 
05:42:27.270 --> 05:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
the number of white children in New
 
05:42:29.110 --> 05:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire declined quite tremend
 
05:42:31.350 --> 05:42:31.360 align:start position:0%
dramatically since 2000 the number of
 
05:42:34.788 --> 05:42:34.798 align:start position:0%
minority children increased modestly not
 
05:42:37.390 --> 05:42:37.400 align:start position:0%
enough to offset the loss of children
 
05:42:40.270 --> 05:42:40.280 align:start position:0%
who are white in the in the working age
 
05:42:42.468 --> 05:42:42.478 align:start position:0%
or adult age groups the minority
 
05:42:45.628 --> 05:42:45.638 align:start position:0%
population in absolute numbers grew more
 
05:42:47.590 --> 05:42:47.600 align:start position:0%
than the minority population and then
 
05:42:49.430 --> 05:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
among seniors almost all the growth of
 
05:42:51.548 --> 05:42:51.558 align:start position:0%
the older population in New Hampshire is
 
05:42:55.070 --> 05:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
of whites So within the age structure
 
05:42:56.350 --> 05:42:56.360 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of
 
05:42:58.468 --> 05:42:58.478 align:start position:0%
variability one thing to remember about
 
05:43:00.030 --> 05:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
the age structure of New Hampshire and
 
05:43:04.468 --> 05:43:04.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:07.310 --> 05:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
state the US population has becoming
 
05:43:10.590 --> 05:43:10.600 align:start position:0%
more diverse from youngest to oldest the
 
05:43:12.788 --> 05:43:12.798 align:start position:0%
most diverse part of the population of
 
05:43:14.750 --> 05:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
the United States are the babies that
 
05:43:17.510 --> 05:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
were born last year the least diverse
 
05:43:19.948 --> 05:43:19.958 align:start position:0%
part of the United States population are
 
05:43:22.750 --> 05:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
the oldest adults and you can see that
 
05:43:23.830 --> 05:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
in New
 
05:43:27.030 --> 05:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire about 10% of the population of
 
05:43:31.350 --> 05:43:31.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire 10.2% is minority but
 
05:43:34.468 --> 05:43:34.478 align:start position:0%
15.7% of the child population is
 
05:43:37.190 --> 05:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
minority and about 9% of the adult
 
05:43:40.510 --> 05:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
population so you can see the diversity
 
05:43:42.310 --> 05:43:42.320 align:start position:0%
coming from the bottom up in New
 
05:43:44.468 --> 05:43:44.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's population just like it is
 
05:43:46.190 --> 05:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
in every other US
 
05:43:48.830 --> 05:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
state so the first institutions that
 
05:43:50.788 --> 05:43:50.798 align:start position:0%
have to deal with a growingly diverse
 
05:43:53.510 --> 05:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
population are the hospitals where the
 
05:43:55.628 --> 05:43:55.638 align:start position:0%
babies are born and then the school
 
05:43:57.510 --> 05:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
systems which have to deal with an
 
05:44:00.628 --> 05:44:00.638 align:start position:0%
increasingly diverse population
 
05:44:02.628 --> 05:44:02.638 align:start position:0%
now as you're well aware diversity
 
05:44:05.190 --> 05:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
varies dramatically across New Hampshire
 
05:44:07.030 --> 05:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
there are parts of New Hampshire which
 
05:44:10.350 --> 05:44:10.360 align:start position:0%
have very small minority populations and
 
05:44:12.030 --> 05:44:12.040 align:start position:0%
I show you here the whole minority
 
05:44:14.868 --> 05:44:14.878 align:start position:0%
population of all ages which again is
 
05:44:17.750 --> 05:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
10.2% at the state average and then this
 
05:44:20.590 --> 05:44:20.600 align:start position:0%
is the child population and you can see
 
05:44:23.670 --> 05:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
even in places where the population is
 
05:44:25.830 --> 05:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
not very diverse it's the child
 
05:44:30.868 --> 05:44:30.878 align:start position:0%
population that's the most diverse
 
05:44:34.270 --> 05:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
if we focus in more this is the the uh
 
05:44:37.788 --> 05:44:37.798 align:start position:0%
NASA to conquered Corridor you can see
 
05:44:39.910 --> 05:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
the diversity of the population is
 
05:44:42.430 --> 05:44:42.440 align:start position:0%
greater here Hillsboro County has the
 
05:44:44.830 --> 05:44:44.840 align:start position:0%
most diverse population of any of the of
 
05:44:47.270 --> 05:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire counties and then you
 
05:44:48.990 --> 05:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
can see again this is the whole
 
05:44:50.548 --> 05:44:50.558 align:start position:0%
population this is the minority
 
05:44:53.830 --> 05:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
population again you can see places in
 
05:44:56.510 --> 05:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
these count in this Corridor where there
 
05:44:58.510 --> 05:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
are fairly substantial minority
 
05:45:00.030 --> 05:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
population ations particularly of
 
05:45:03.070 --> 05:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
children this is a closeup now of just
 
05:45:05.190 --> 05:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
Manchester and you can see that there
 
05:45:08.548 --> 05:45:08.558 align:start position:0%
are considerable neighborhoods in New
 
05:45:11.590 --> 05:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
hampsh in in Manchester which have
 
05:45:13.868 --> 05:45:13.878 align:start position:0%
minority populations of children of 40
 
05:45:15.190 --> 05:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
or more
 
05:45:19.030 --> 05:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
percent so even in a state which isn't
 
05:45:21.750 --> 05:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
very diverse there are places where
 
05:45:23.708 --> 05:45:23.718 align:start position:0%
there are quite diverse populations in
 
05:45:26.070 --> 05:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and it's primarily
 
05:45:28.190 --> 05:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
children where the population is going
 
05:45:29.468 --> 05:45:29.478 align:start position:0%
to be the most
 
05:45:31.628 --> 05:45:31.638 align:start position:0%
diverse let me give you just one more
 
05:45:33.990 --> 05:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
example this is the minority population
 
05:45:36.910 --> 05:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
in Manchester and I picked out three
 
05:45:38.990 --> 05:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
census tracks which are the small areas
 
05:45:41.270 --> 05:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
that the Census Bureau measures data for
 
05:45:43.230 --> 05:45:43.240 align:start position:0%
and I wanted you to see the difference
 
05:45:46.750 --> 05:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
between this track just on the edge of
 
05:45:48.910 --> 05:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
Manchester which is virtually all
 
05:45:52.750 --> 05:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
non-hispanic white and then this
 
05:45:56.230 --> 05:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
track which is strikingly diverse this
 
05:45:58.390 --> 05:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
is of the whole population not just
 
05:46:00.670 --> 05:46:00.680 align:start position:0%
children its child population is over
 
05:46:04.150 --> 05:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
40% minority so you can see whether
 
05:46:05.390 --> 05:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the state as a
 
05:46:08.468 --> 05:46:08.478 align:start position:0%
whole about the region or about the
 
05:46:10.708 --> 05:46:10.718 align:start position:0%
individual town There's dramatic
 
05:46:12.590 --> 05:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
variation in the amount of diversity in
 
05:46:14.830 --> 05:46:14.840 align:start position:0%
this state and I think that's important
 
05:46:17.948 --> 05:46:17.958 align:start position:0%
for you to recognize as you address all
 
05:46:19.910 --> 05:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
the many policy issues that you have to
 
05:46:22.990 --> 05:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
deal with so even in a state like New
 
05:46:24.310 --> 05:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which is not particularly
 
05:46:26.548 --> 05:46:26.558 align:start position:0%
diverse there is remark there are
 
05:46:28.430 --> 05:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
remarkable pockets of diversity within
 
05:46:30.390 --> 05:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
the state
 
05:46:32.948 --> 05:46:32.958 align:start position:0%
and it's not just on
 
05:46:37.430 --> 05:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
race this is income and uh education
 
05:46:39.070 --> 05:46:39.080 align:start position:0%
this is all of New England just so you
 
05:46:40.948 --> 05:46:40.958 align:start position:0%
could see how New Hampshire compares to
 
05:46:43.150 --> 05:46:43.160 align:start position:0%
other places you can see it has a
 
05:46:45.708 --> 05:46:45.718 align:start position:0%
relatively High median income compared
 
05:46:48.708 --> 05:46:48.718 align:start position:0%
to the rest of uh New England and also a
 
05:46:49.910 --> 05:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
particularly in the southern part of the
 
05:46:52.390 --> 05:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
state a particularly well-educated
 
05:46:54.788 --> 05:46:54.798 align:start position:0%
population here's a closeup of the
 
05:46:57.310 --> 05:46:57.320 align:start position:0%
census tracks in New Hampshire and so
 
05:47:00.708 --> 05:47:00.718 align:start position:0%
you can see that the diversity about 37%
 
05:47:02.990 --> 05:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
of the population adult population over
 
05:47:05.150 --> 05:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
the age of 25 of New Hampshire have
 
05:47:07.230 --> 05:47:07.240 align:start position:0%
college degrees or more but you can see
 
05:47:09.350 --> 05:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
it varies a lot from in parts of the
 
05:47:11.708 --> 05:47:11.718 align:start position:0%
state the median family income in New
 
05:47:13.190 --> 05:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is about
 
05:47:15.750 --> 05:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
95,000 but you can see the variation in
 
05:47:17.670 --> 05:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
median family income as well this is
 
05:47:19.830 --> 05:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
again just I'm just trying to emphasize
 
05:47:22.030 --> 05:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
to you and I know you really know this
 
05:47:23.468 --> 05:47:23.478 align:start position:0%
but I thought you might like to see it
 
05:47:25.590 --> 05:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
empirically that there's a considerable
 
05:47:27.910 --> 05:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
amount of variation in this state on a
 
05:47:30.468 --> 05:47:30.478 align:start position:0%
lot of different Dimensions another one
 
05:47:33.350 --> 05:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
is poverty New Hampshire is blessed by
 
05:47:35.230 --> 05:47:35.240 align:start position:0%
having one of the lowest often the
 
05:47:38.590 --> 05:47:38.600 align:start position:0%
lowest poverty rate of any US state but
 
05:47:39.868 --> 05:47:39.878 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean that there aren't
 
05:47:41.310 --> 05:47:41.320 align:start position:0%
parts of New Hampshire where there's
 
05:47:43.670 --> 05:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
significant amounts of poverty here we
 
05:47:45.750 --> 05:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
look at the state as a whole at the
 
05:47:47.750 --> 05:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
census tracks in the state and then
 
05:47:50.030 --> 05:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
another closeup of Manchester so you
 
05:47:52.230 --> 05:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
could see it in the Manchester area
 
05:47:55.070 --> 05:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
where there's more poverty uh than in
 
05:47:57.190 --> 05:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
many other parts of the state this is
 
05:47:59.430 --> 05:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
children again poverty tend to be higher
 
05:48:01.590 --> 05:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
among children although fortunately New
 
05:48:03.510 --> 05:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's child poverty rate again is
 
05:48:06.070 --> 05:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
one of the lowest if not the lowest in
 
05:48:08.310 --> 05:48:08.320 align:start position:0%
the United States but that doesn't mean
 
05:48:09.948 --> 05:48:09.958 align:start position:0%
there aren't places where there are poor
 
05:48:12.150 --> 05:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
children in New Hampshire and you can
 
05:48:14.430 --> 05:48:14.440 align:start position:0%
see that both at the state level and
 
05:48:17.910 --> 05:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
then in the in the uh in the Manchester
 
05:48:20.750 --> 05:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
area and finally this is poverty among
 
05:48:23.350 --> 05:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
older adults older adults tend to have
 
05:48:25.948 --> 05:48:25.958 align:start position:0%
lower poverty rates than other groups
 
05:48:27.310 --> 05:48:27.320 align:start position:0%
and you can see that's true in New
 
05:48:29.868 --> 05:48:29.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but again there are places
 
05:48:32.390 --> 05:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
where there are poor older adults in the
 
05:48:34.868 --> 05:48:34.878 align:start position:0%
state so again I'm just trying to I I
 
05:48:37.190 --> 05:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
just want you to see how remarkably
 
05:48:40.110 --> 05:48:40.120 align:start position:0%
diverse on many dimensions the state of
 
05:48:42.468 --> 05:48:42.478 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
05:48:45.110 --> 05:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
is why do people move to New Hampshire
 
05:48:46.670 --> 05:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
and why do they stay in New Hampshire
 
05:48:49.110 --> 05:48:49.120 align:start position:0%
this is based on some of my most recent
 
05:48:51.230 --> 05:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
research with one of my graduate
 
05:48:54.788 --> 05:48:54.798 align:start position:0%
students and we asked a substantial
 
05:48:56.590 --> 05:48:56.600 align:start position:0%
sample of people from New England or
 
05:48:59.030 --> 05:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire why they chose to
 
05:49:00.750 --> 05:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
move to New Hampshire if they' moved
 
05:49:03.510 --> 05:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
recently or why they like to stay in the
 
05:49:05.150 --> 05:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
state if they've lived here for a long
 
05:49:07.468 --> 05:49:07.478 align:start position:0%
time and again I I mentioned to you
 
05:49:09.910 --> 05:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
before and I emphasized to you again how
 
05:49:12.670 --> 05:49:12.680 align:start position:0%
important migration is to New Hampshire
 
05:49:13.990 --> 05:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
again these are the most some of the
 
05:49:16.430 --> 05:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
most recent data here's natural increase
 
05:49:18.628 --> 05:49:18.638 align:start position:0%
again the state is has more deaths than
 
05:49:20.510 --> 05:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
births so it's not growing from that
 
05:49:22.628 --> 05:49:22.638 align:start position:0%
here's migration into the state both
 
05:49:25.628 --> 05:49:25.638 align:start position:0%
immigration and domestic migration when
 
05:49:29.030 --> 05:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
we ask people why do they move to New
 
05:49:31.788 --> 05:49:31.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or why do they live in New
 
05:49:35.230 --> 05:49:35.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire here's what we found the
 
05:49:37.670 --> 05:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
single largest reason both for the blue
 
05:49:39.548 --> 05:49:39.558 align:start position:0%
people who are recent migrants to the
 
05:49:40.830 --> 05:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
state who've come to New Hampshire in
 
05:49:43.230 --> 05:49:43.240 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years and for people who
 
05:49:44.750 --> 05:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
have lived in New Hampshire for 10 years
 
05:49:47.590 --> 05:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
and more the most important reason for
 
05:49:49.070 --> 05:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
staying in New Hampshire or moving to
 
05:49:50.910 --> 05:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is
 
05:49:53.270 --> 05:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
family they care that carries great
 
05:49:56.190 --> 05:49:56.200 align:start position:0%
weight with both of these groups the
 
05:49:59.190 --> 05:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
natural environment the beauty the ities
 
05:50:01.390 --> 05:50:01.400 align:start position:0%
the lakes and the mountains the Clean
 
05:50:04.190 --> 05:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
Air of New Hampshire is the second most
 
05:50:04.200 --> 05:50:06.110 align:start position:0%
Air of New Hampshire is the second most
important

05:50:06.110 --> 05:50:06.120 align:start position:0%
important
 
05:50:09.350 --> 05:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
factor uh for long-term residents of the
 
05:50:13.590 --> 05:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
state and almost and uh also important
 
05:50:17.750 --> 05:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
to recent migrants to the state quality
 
05:50:19.788 --> 05:50:19.798 align:start position:0%
of life you know which is about
 
05:50:22.830 --> 05:50:22.840 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods and relationships and the
 
05:50:24.750 --> 05:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
little towns that they live in or the
 
05:50:26.910 --> 05:50:26.920 align:start position:0%
interaction that they're involved with
 
05:50:28.548 --> 05:50:28.558 align:start position:0%
are other measures that are very
 
05:50:30.390 --> 05:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
important both to establish residents
 
05:50:32.628 --> 05:50:32.638 align:start position:0%
and to recent migrants they do differ as
 
05:50:34.910 --> 05:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
you would expect on employment
 
05:50:36.788 --> 05:50:36.798 align:start position:0%
employment is a much more important
 
05:50:39.310 --> 05:50:39.320 align:start position:0%
factor to recent migrants than it is to
 
05:50:40.590 --> 05:50:40.600 align:start position:0%
people who've lived in the state for a
 
05:50:42.548 --> 05:50:42.558 align:start position:0%
long time and again you when you think
 
05:50:44.150 --> 05:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
about it one of the reasons people would
 
05:50:46.750 --> 05:50:46.760 align:start position:0%
come to New Hampshire would be for a new
 
05:50:51.990 --> 05:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:54.548 --> 05:50:54.558 align:start position:0%
activities taxes which I know is a big
 
05:50:56.590 --> 05:50:56.600 align:start position:0%
issue in New Hampshire are mentioned by
 
05:50:59.190 --> 05:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
some people but they're not nearly as
 
05:51:02.350 --> 05:51:02.360 align:start position:0%
important as things like family art
 
05:51:04.830 --> 05:51:04.840 align:start position:0%
lifestyle and culture the kind of rural
 
05:51:07.670 --> 05:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
feel of New Hampshire the close
 
05:51:10.030 --> 05:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
relationships is another and then people
 
05:51:12.708 --> 05:51:12.718 align:start position:0%
answered about the general economy too
 
05:51:14.830 --> 05:51:14.840 align:start position:0%
so when you're thinking about what
 
05:51:16.670 --> 05:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
attracts people to New Hampshire or what
 
05:51:19.110 --> 05:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
keeps people in New Hampshire these are
 
05:51:22.310 --> 05:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
important factors and this we looked at
 
05:51:24.830 --> 05:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
this both for people under 50 and older
 
05:51:27.110 --> 05:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
50 and you can see the patterns are
 
05:51:28.948 --> 05:51:28.958 align:start position:0%
quite similar it's f family that's
 
05:51:31.868 --> 05:51:31.878 align:start position:0%
important employment is more important
 
05:51:34.230 --> 05:51:34.240 align:start position:0%
especially to younger people which again
 
05:51:36.750 --> 05:51:36.760 align:start position:0%
is what we would expect these are recent
 
05:51:38.948 --> 05:51:38.958 align:start position:0%
migrants to the state these are people
 
05:51:41.190 --> 05:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
who've lived here for a long
 
05:51:43.750 --> 05:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
time same thing these are people moving
 
05:51:45.190 --> 05:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
to or staying in New Hampshire with
 
05:51:47.868 --> 05:51:47.878 align:start position:0%
college degrees or not college degrees
 
05:51:50.110 --> 05:51:50.120 align:start position:0%
you can see the differential importance
 
05:51:52.310 --> 05:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
of factors now again if anybody's
 
05:51:54.030 --> 05:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
interested in this in more detail we
 
05:51:56.510 --> 05:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
wrote a research piece on this that is
 
05:51:58.788 --> 05:51:58.798 align:start position:0%
on the car SE website and if anybody
 
05:52:00.590 --> 05:52:00.600 align:start position:0%
wants it you're certainly welcome to go
 
05:52:02.390 --> 05:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
to the car SE website and download it or
 
05:52:04.110 --> 05:52:04.120 align:start position:0%
you can send me a note and I'll be happy
 
05:52:06.110 --> 05:52:06.120 align:start position:0%
to send it to you so I don't have time
 
05:52:07.510 --> 05:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
to talk about them in detail today I
 
05:52:12.030 --> 05:52:12.040 align:start position:0%
just wanted you to see uh so migration
 
05:52:13.390 --> 05:52:13.400 align:start position:0%
as I've said is important to New
 
05:52:16.190 --> 05:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's future when you think about
 
05:52:18.430 --> 05:52:18.440 align:start position:0%
what's important for New Hampshire and
 
05:52:21.510 --> 05:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
for making New Hampshire a good place to
 
05:52:25.030 --> 05:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
live bear in mind there's a lot of focus
 
05:52:27.150 --> 05:52:27.160 align:start position:0%
on attracting people to New Hampshire
 
05:52:29.310 --> 05:52:29.320 align:start position:0%
and I think that's certainly relevant
 
05:52:30.868 --> 05:52:30.878 align:start position:0%
but the other thing I would point out to
 
05:52:33.468 --> 05:52:33.478 align:start position:0%
you is it's important to retain the
 
05:52:35.868 --> 05:52:35.878 align:start position:0%
population that New Hampshire has and so
 
05:52:38.390 --> 05:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
when you think about the kinds of
 
05:52:40.990 --> 05:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
policies and factors that you might be
 
05:52:44.628 --> 05:52:44.638 align:start position:0%
able to impact in your work recognize
 
05:52:48.190 --> 05:52:48.200 align:start position:0%
that retaining population is important
 
05:52:50.708 --> 05:52:50.718 align:start position:0%
just like attracting migrants sometimes
 
05:52:53.628 --> 05:52:53.638 align:start position:0%
so much focuses on attraction that you
 
05:52:55.670 --> 05:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
don't think as much about I'm not saying
 
05:52:58.590 --> 05:52:58.600 align:start position:0%
you I'm saying demographers too don't
 
05:53:00.670 --> 05:53:00.680 align:start position:0%
think about the people who stay they
 
05:53:01.990 --> 05:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
only think about the people who leave
 
05:53:03.990 --> 05:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
and the people who come and you could
 
05:53:06.350 --> 05:53:06.360 align:start position:0%
see again how important
 
05:53:08.430 --> 05:53:08.440 align:start position:0%
family and again when you think about
 
05:53:10.190 --> 05:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
family think about things like good
 
05:53:12.390 --> 05:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
quality K12
 
05:53:15.830 --> 05:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
education uh access to playgrounds and
 
05:53:18.150 --> 05:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
things like that preserving the natural
 
05:53:20.030 --> 05:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
environment which is also important to a
 
05:53:22.628 --> 05:53:22.638 align:start position:0%
lot of people and the quality of life
 
05:53:24.750 --> 05:53:24.760 align:start position:0%
factors that we might be able to
 
05:53:27.670 --> 05:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
contribute to uh and then of course
 
05:53:29.270 --> 05:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
employment opportunities are important
 
05:53:31.590 --> 05:53:31.600 align:start position:0%
as well so just to close because I know
 
05:53:34.430 --> 05:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
I'm running out of time just some key
 
05:53:35.830 --> 05:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
points population growth in New
 
05:53:38.350 --> 05:53:38.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire slowed compared to what it
 
05:53:40.708 --> 05:53:40.718 align:start position:0%
used to be in the 80s and 90s but it's
 
05:53:45.030 --> 05:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
picked up in the last few years and it
 
05:53:47.708 --> 05:53:47.718 align:start position:0%
may well be I think probably this is the
 
05:53:50.788 --> 05:53:50.798 align:start position:0%
result of the recession's impact finally
 
05:53:53.150 --> 05:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
beginning to diminish only the
 
05:53:54.628 --> 05:53:54.638 align:start position:0%
economists think that the recession
 
05:53:57.270 --> 05:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
ended in 2010 certainly demographers
 
05:53:57.280 --> 05:53:59.510 align:start position:0%
ended in 2010 certainly demographers
don't

05:53:59.510 --> 05:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
don't
 
05:54:01.430 --> 05:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
there are now fewer births and deaths in
 
05:54:03.510 --> 05:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and covid is going to
 
05:54:06.110 --> 05:54:06.120 align:start position:0%
exacerbate that so migration is going to
 
05:54:08.670 --> 05:54:08.680 align:start position:0%
become even more important as I showed
 
05:54:10.910 --> 05:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
you demographic change is uneven about
 
05:54:12.750 --> 05:54:12.760 align:start position:0%
across the state some areas are growing
 
05:54:14.910 --> 05:54:14.920 align:start position:0%
some aren't New Hampshire's population
 
05:54:18.468 --> 05:54:18.478 align:start position:0%
is aging and diversity is growing from
 
05:54:20.190 --> 05:54:20.200 align:start position:0%
the youngest to the oldest in the state
 
05:54:22.150 --> 05:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire so I think I'll stop
 
05:54:23.510 --> 05:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
there I've got a couple other slides but
 
05:54:25.390 --> 05:54:25.400 align:start position:0%
I think I'll stop there so that there's
 
05:54:28.548 --> 05:54:28.558 align:start position:0%
time for questions thank you well thank
 
05:54:32.110 --> 05:54:32.120 align:start position:0%
you Dr Johnson again
 
05:54:34.868 --> 05:54:34.878 align:start position:0%
you had an excellent
 
05:54:38.230 --> 05:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
presentation uh the first person with
 
05:54:42.070 --> 05:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
questions is representative
 
05:54:46.110 --> 05:54:46.120 align:start position:0%
Ames thank you um and just to Echo at
 
05:54:49.070 --> 05:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
the beginning representative Major's
 
05:54:50.948 --> 05:54:50.958 align:start position:0%
comment that was truly an excellent
 
05:54:54.510 --> 05:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
presentation so thank you for that um so
 
05:54:56.990 --> 05:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
I I really had two two-pronged question
 
05:54:58.670 --> 05:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
one is
 
05:55:01.310 --> 05:55:01.320 align:start position:0%
um about the data and particularly the
 
05:55:05.390 --> 05:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
data on poverty and uh median family
 
05:55:07.430 --> 05:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
income or household income whatever
 
05:55:10.070 --> 05:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
you're using and your sources for that
 
05:55:13.750 --> 05:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
and how good it is how how much we can
 
05:55:16.990 --> 05:55:17.000 align:start position:0%
rely on it for example in uh school
 
05:55:19.708 --> 05:55:19.718 align:start position:0%
funding formulas or other ways we have
 
05:55:21.590 --> 05:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
Distributing state aid do we have good
 
05:55:25.390 --> 05:55:25.400 align:start position:0%
enough data that uh identify population
 
05:55:30.310 --> 05:55:30.320 align:start position:0%
by income level and then uh the other I
 
05:55:32.510 --> 05:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
guess uh quite different question but
 
05:55:35.190 --> 05:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
I'll put it in so you can just respond
 
05:55:40.430 --> 05:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
is uh the uh schools the K to2
 
05:55:42.788 --> 05:55:42.798 align:start position:0%
educational system that we have and its
 
05:55:44.628 --> 05:55:44.638 align:start position:0%
strengths and weaknesses from Community
 
05:55:46.750 --> 05:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
to community varies a great deal as you
 
05:55:49.430 --> 05:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
know and uh whether you have information
 
05:55:52.468 --> 05:55:52.478 align:start position:0%
on the degree to which uh uh people
 
05:55:54.868 --> 05:55:54.878 align:start position:0%
considering coming to New Hampshire or
 
05:55:56.468 --> 05:55:56.478 align:start position:0%
considering leaving New
 
05:56:00.788 --> 05:56:00.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um are uh stirred to move in
 
05:56:03.190 --> 05:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
One Direction or the other by the
 
05:56:05.548 --> 05:56:05.558 align:start position:0%
equality of the local
 
05:56:07.948 --> 05:56:07.958 align:start position:0%
school so first with reference to the
 
05:56:10.510 --> 05:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
information on income and poverty this
 
05:56:12.310 --> 05:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
comes from the Census bureau's American
 
05:56:14.310 --> 05:56:14.320 align:start position:0%
Community survey which is an ongoing
 
05:56:16.070 --> 05:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
survey done by the Census Bureau of
 
05:56:18.670 --> 05:56:18.680 align:start position:0%
about four million households a year and
 
05:56:23.070 --> 05:56:23.080 align:start position:0%
it it keeps rolling all the time and so
 
05:56:27.190 --> 05:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
the data is as good as we have is it
 
05:56:28.548 --> 05:56:28.558 align:start position:0%
does it give us a a good idea of what's
 
05:56:30.548 --> 05:56:30.558 align:start position:0%
going on at the state level certainly at
 
05:56:32.948 --> 05:56:32.958 align:start position:0%
the county level yes when you get down
 
05:56:35.830 --> 05:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
to these individual tracks or smaller
 
05:56:38.708 --> 05:56:38.718 align:start position:0%
places this is sample data so there are
 
05:56:41.548 --> 05:56:41.558 align:start position:0%
errors I mean there is a sampling error
 
05:56:44.110 --> 05:56:44.120 align:start position:0%
around any one of those measures the
 
05:56:45.868 --> 05:56:45.878 align:start position:0%
data I presented to you and that I use
 
05:56:48.670 --> 05:56:48.680 align:start position:0%
is five years of data so I don't rely on
 
05:56:51.150 --> 05:56:51.160 align:start position:0%
single year data even though it
 
05:56:54.070 --> 05:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
exists does it have the I mean if it
 
05:56:57.070 --> 05:56:57.080 align:start position:0%
said that Manchester's median income was
 
05:56:59.230 --> 05:56:59.240 align:start position:0%
87 ,
 
05:57:01.830 --> 05:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
255 would I be confident that that's
 
05:57:04.070 --> 05:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
exactly what it is no would I be
 
05:57:07.390 --> 05:57:07.400 align:start position:0%
confident that it's between 95 and
 
05:57:10.030 --> 05:57:10.040 align:start position:0%
80,000 and that that's one of the would
 
05:57:12.110 --> 05:57:12.120 align:start position:0%
I yes I would be confident of that would
 
05:57:15.468 --> 05:57:15.478 align:start position:0%
I be confident that the places
 
05:57:18.430 --> 05:57:18.440 align:start position:0%
that the Census Bureau says have higher
 
05:57:20.548 --> 05:57:20.558 align:start position:0%
incomes really do have higher incomes
 
05:57:22.628 --> 05:57:22.638 align:start position:0%
and the places that the census buau has
 
05:57:25.468 --> 05:57:25.478 align:start position:0%
low incomes really do have lower incomes
 
05:57:28.230 --> 05:57:28.240 align:start position:0%
yes I would not I mean I wouldn't I
 
05:57:30.830 --> 05:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
would be hesitant to use a formula that
 
05:57:33.390 --> 05:57:33.400 align:start position:0%
relied on the absolute
 
05:57:38.030 --> 05:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
number okay um so again those are the
 
05:57:40.230 --> 05:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
some of those datas used to be asked in
 
05:57:42.310 --> 05:57:42.320 align:start position:0%
the desial census the one that's done
 
05:57:44.670 --> 05:57:44.680 align:start position:0%
every 10 years the census buau does not
 
05:57:46.948 --> 05:57:46.958 align:start position:0%
ask those questions in the desial census
 
05:57:50.750 --> 05:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
anymore so the data do not have as large
 
05:57:53.150 --> 05:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
a representation as they would in the
 
05:57:55.150 --> 05:57:55.160 align:start position:0%
census when it would have been asked
 
05:57:57.270 --> 05:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
like 18% of the households rather than
 
05:58:00.708 --> 05:58:00.718 align:start position:0%
about 4 % but it's continuous whereas
 
05:58:02.590 --> 05:58:02.600 align:start position:0%
the decennial Census Data would only be
 
05:58:05.350 --> 05:58:05.360 align:start position:0%
asked once every 10 years so there are
 
05:58:07.350 --> 05:58:07.360 align:start position:0%
tradeoffs involved but it is it's the
 
05:58:09.430 --> 05:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
best data that's available as what it
 
05:58:12.190 --> 05:58:12.200 align:start position:0%
boils down to your other
 
05:58:15.270 --> 05:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
question uh I don't have
 
05:58:18.788 --> 05:58:18.798 align:start position:0%
data on migration decision making at
 
05:58:21.350 --> 05:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
that small level of geography as a
 
05:58:24.910 --> 05:58:24.920 align:start position:0%
school district or uh our data was I
 
05:58:27.910 --> 05:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
mean we had a sample of around four
 
05:58:30.468 --> 05:58:30.478 align:start position:0%
th000 from the whole state which is a
 
05:58:33.788 --> 05:58:33.798 align:start position:0%
substantial sample but would not allow
 
05:58:37.350 --> 05:58:37.360 align:start position:0%
us to make comments about what's
 
05:58:39.948 --> 05:58:39.958 align:start position:0%
happening at individual Town levels for
 
05:58:43.270 --> 05:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
example we do in the one thing about
 
05:58:44.868 --> 05:58:44.878 align:start position:0%
this survey that's different than ones
 
05:58:47.150 --> 05:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
that are usually used is we actually ask
 
05:58:49.948 --> 05:58:49.958 align:start position:0%
the people for the top three reasons why
 
05:58:51.750 --> 05:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
they chose to live in New Hampshire or
 
05:58:53.868 --> 05:58:53.878 align:start position:0%
come to New Hampshire they told us in
 
05:58:56.190 --> 05:58:56.200 align:start position:0%
their own words this wasn't a check the
 
05:58:59.548 --> 05:58:59.558 align:start position:0%
little box next to educ ation or income
 
05:59:01.868 --> 05:59:01.878 align:start position:0%
uh and then we had to translate all of
 
05:59:04.788 --> 05:59:04.798 align:start position:0%
those I think it was 8,000 responses
 
05:59:08.350 --> 05:59:08.360 align:start position:0%
into category so that we could show the
 
05:59:11.510 --> 05:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
summary data but my point is that we let
 
05:59:13.590 --> 05:59:13.600 align:start position:0%
them answer in their own words and
 
05:59:15.350 --> 05:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
education was certainly something that
 
05:59:20.750 --> 05:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
was mentioned by some people so uh again
 
05:59:22.670 --> 05:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
we're pretty pleased with the data this
 
05:59:24.948 --> 05:59:24.958 align:start position:0%
is for one set we did it for two
 
05:59:27.030 --> 05:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
different periods one during the Great
 
05:59:29.468 --> 05:59:29.478 align:start position:0%
Recession one after the patterns are
 
05:59:31.948 --> 05:59:31.958 align:start position:0%
almost identical between the two and
 
05:59:33.510 --> 05:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
again if you want more detail I'd be
 
05:59:36.628 --> 05:59:36.638 align:start position:0%
happy to to send you the question I mean
 
05:59:38.750 --> 05:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
to send you the study we did and you can
 
05:59:39.830 --> 05:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
read it for
 
05:59:42.430 --> 05:59:42.440 align:start position:0%
yourself thank you so much
 
05:59:46.948 --> 05:59:46.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:50.150 --> 05:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
Brony thank you Dr Johnson good
 
05:59:53.110 --> 05:59:53.120 align:start position:0%
presentation uh the first slide that you
 
05:59:55.110 --> 05:59:55.120 align:start position:0%
showed you showed the net outflow and
 
05:59:56.910 --> 05:59:56.920 align:start position:0%
net inflow for all the New England
 
05:59:59.788 --> 05:59:59.798 align:start position:0%
states uh um in Connecticut was not
 
06:00:02.910 --> 06:00:02.920 align:start position:0%
doing very well the last four years uh
 
06:00:05.590 --> 06:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
that kind of correlates with three new
 
06:00:07.230 --> 06:00:07.240 align:start position:0%
people that moved into my town that I
 
06:00:08.788 --> 06:00:08.798 align:start position:0%
talked to when I was campaigning this
 
06:00:11.350 --> 06:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
year who said they escaped
 
06:00:13.990 --> 06:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and their their main reasons
 
06:00:17.030 --> 06:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
was what tax tax policies in Connecticut
 
06:00:17.910 --> 06:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
are out of
 
06:00:20.270 --> 06:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
control we know from ways and means when
 
06:00:23.110 --> 06:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
we talk about casinos for instance that
 
06:00:25.670 --> 06:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
casino revenues were off and the state
 
06:00:27.510 --> 06:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
in of Connecticut was looking for other
 
06:00:30.468 --> 06:00:30.478 align:start position:0%
places to to go and obviously they've
 
06:00:33.070 --> 06:00:33.080 align:start position:0%
been increasing uh taxes and other
 
06:00:36.430 --> 06:00:36.440 align:start position:0%
things they characterize Connecticut is
 
06:00:38.910 --> 06:00:38.920 align:start position:0%
in a death spiral because large
 
06:00:41.430 --> 06:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
corporations are moving out uh they just
 
06:00:43.150 --> 06:00:43.160 align:start position:0%
can't take it anymore one of my
 
06:00:46.670 --> 06:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
constituents had 500 a business of 500
 
06:00:49.310 --> 06:00:49.320 align:start position:0%
people that he he actually he and his
 
06:00:51.310 --> 06:00:51.320 align:start position:0%
sun in business they moved they moved to
 
06:00:54.030 --> 06:00:54.040 align:start position:0%
to Texas and he moved and retired up
 
06:00:56.990 --> 06:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
here um so I guess what I'm getting at
 
06:00:58.468 --> 06:00:58.478 align:start position:0%
is that it seems like there's a
 
06:01:00.990 --> 06:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
correlation even though your what you
 
06:01:03.150 --> 06:01:03.160 align:start position:0%
show in the last slide didn't indicate
 
06:01:04.270 --> 06:01:04.280 align:start position:0%
it but it seems like there's a
 
06:01:07.948 --> 06:01:07.958 align:start position:0%
correlation between tax policy and
 
06:01:12.350 --> 06:01:12.360 align:start position:0%
migration in and out of a state um if I
 
06:01:13.788 --> 06:01:13.798 align:start position:0%
maybe this is more of a comment I guess
 
06:01:15.708 --> 06:01:15.718 align:start position:0%
but you know it would seem interesting
 
06:01:17.310 --> 06:01:17.320 align:start position:0%
if we want to focus on a state to look
 
06:01:19.948 --> 06:01:19.958 align:start position:0%
at maybe Connecticut maybe there's an
 
06:01:22.468 --> 06:01:22.478 align:start position:0%
example there of a state that's policies
 
06:01:25.948 --> 06:01:25.958 align:start position:0%
are counter to increasing flow into the
 
06:01:28.910 --> 06:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
state just from my an total uh
 
06:01:30.468 --> 06:01:30.478 align:start position:0%
conversations that I've
 
06:01:32.948 --> 06:01:32.958 align:start position:0%
had well I appreciate that we certainly
 
06:01:35.190 --> 06:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
got some comments in the in the survey
 
06:01:36.750 --> 06:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
about people moving to New Hampshire
 
06:01:40.510 --> 06:01:40.520 align:start position:0%
because of taxes um I have not done
 
06:01:42.670 --> 06:01:42.680 align:start position:0%
in-depth research on this so I really
 
06:01:44.230 --> 06:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
can't address the issue of the
 
06:01:46.788 --> 06:01:46.798 align:start position:0%
relationship between tax policy and
 
06:01:49.270 --> 06:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
migration there I would say to you that
 
06:01:51.070 --> 06:01:51.080 align:start position:0%
there that one of the things we learned
 
06:01:52.830 --> 06:01:52.840 align:start position:0%
from that survey and from other research
 
06:01:54.910 --> 06:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
we've done is people don't move for a
 
06:01:57.910 --> 06:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
single reason there's usually multiple
 
06:02:00.468 --> 06:02:00.478 align:start position:0%
reasons that underly people's decision
 
06:02:03.350 --> 06:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
either to move or to stay in a given
 
06:02:03.360 --> 06:02:04.788 align:start position:0%
either to move or to stay in a given
place

06:02:04.788 --> 06:02:04.798 align:start position:0%
place
 
06:02:07.070 --> 06:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
so than
 
06:02:09.830 --> 06:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
06:02:14.070 --> 06:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
janigan thank you Mr chairman um good
 
06:02:17.390 --> 06:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
presentation Dr Johnson um my question
 
06:02:19.628 --> 06:02:19.638 align:start position:0%
centers around the fact that uh the
 
06:02:22.788 --> 06:02:22.798 align:start position:0%
birth rate in New Hampshire is so low is
 
06:02:25.468 --> 06:02:25.478 align:start position:0%
that how does that compare with with
 
06:02:26.468 --> 06:02:26.478 align:start position:0%
other states I don't know if you
 
06:02:28.468 --> 06:02:28.478 align:start position:0%
mentioned that or I missed but is that
 
06:02:30.590 --> 06:02:30.600 align:start position:0%
are we much lower than than other states
 
06:02:32.830 --> 06:02:32.840 align:start position:0%
is there a concern that New Hampshire
 
06:02:37.150 --> 06:02:37.160 align:start position:0%
for some reason has a very low birth
 
06:02:41.030 --> 06:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
rate um so there are at least three
 
06:02:43.708 --> 06:02:43.718 align:start position:0%
factors that go into the birth
 
06:02:46.468 --> 06:02:46.478 align:start position:0%
rate uh one
 
06:02:49.310 --> 06:02:49.320 align:start position:0%
is the number of women of childbearing
 
06:02:51.708 --> 06:02:51.718 align:start position:0%
age so that affects how many births
 
06:02:54.110 --> 06:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
there are and indirectly affects the
 
06:02:55.510 --> 06:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
birth rate depending on how it's
 
06:02:58.030 --> 06:02:58.040 align:start position:0%
measured but um
 
06:03:01.190 --> 06:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire has a relatively small
 
06:03:03.548 --> 06:03:03.558 align:start position:0%
proportion of women of childbearing age
 
06:03:06.510 --> 06:03:06.520 align:start position:0%
because its population is
 
06:03:09.830 --> 06:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
older the birth rates in New Hampshire
 
06:03:12.830 --> 06:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
are relatively low compared to other
 
06:03:15.350 --> 06:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
states but not dramatically lower than
 
06:03:17.990 --> 06:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
in other states New Hampshire's
 
06:03:20.030 --> 06:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
population as I showed you is largely
 
06:03:21.830 --> 06:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
non-hispanic white although that is
 
06:03:23.948 --> 06:03:23.958 align:start position:0%
changing the non-hispanic white
 
06:03:26.150 --> 06:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
population generally tends to have lower
 
06:03:28.590 --> 06:03:28.600 align:start position:0%
birth rates than other age groups
 
06:03:30.788 --> 06:03:30.798 align:start position:0%
although that's less true in New
 
06:03:35.628 --> 06:03:35.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because the um the largest
 
06:03:37.750 --> 06:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
minority group in New Hampshire is
 
06:03:40.150 --> 06:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
Hispanics but they don't tend to be
 
06:03:42.590 --> 06:03:42.600 align:start position:0%
immigrants that have come directly from
 
06:03:45.150 --> 06:03:45.160 align:start position:0%
Mexico or other places the next largest
 
06:03:46.750 --> 06:03:46.760 align:start position:0%
immigrant group in New Hampshire are
 
06:03:49.390 --> 06:03:49.400 align:start position:0%
Asians Asian fertility rates especially
 
06:03:52.190 --> 06:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
among well educated Asians tend to be
 
06:03:53.948 --> 06:03:53.958 align:start position:0%
lower than they do among even
 
06:03:56.468 --> 06:03:56.478 align:start position:0%
non-hispanic whites so it's partially
 
06:03:59.150 --> 06:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
the mix the population in New Hampshire
 
06:04:02.350 --> 06:04:02.360 align:start position:0%
the racial and ethnic mix that is a
 
06:04:04.990 --> 06:04:05.000 align:start position:0%
factor as well and then the birth rates
 
06:04:08.510 --> 06:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
are affected by uh lots of other kinds
 
06:04:10.830 --> 06:04:10.840 align:start position:0%
of factors like we expect Co is going to
 
06:04:14.110 --> 06:04:14.120 align:start position:0%
have a big effect and I as I said to you
 
06:04:15.708 --> 06:04:15.718 align:start position:0%
we're demographers are mostly expecting
 
06:04:18.708 --> 06:04:18.718 align:start position:0%
the birth rates to go down just like the
 
06:04:20.868 --> 06:04:20.878 align:start position:0%
guy who just mentioned anot anecdotal
 
06:04:22.788 --> 06:04:22.798 align:start position:0%
Trends I've had three people in the last
 
06:04:24.430 --> 06:04:24.440 align:start position:0%
day tell me that they're going to have a
 
06:04:27.190 --> 06:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
child in the next six or eight months so
 
06:04:31.910 --> 06:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
so I hope I'm I'm happy for them but I
 
06:04:33.190 --> 06:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
suspect that's not going to be the
 
06:04:34.830 --> 06:04:34.840 align:start position:0%
generalized Trend so anyway I mean
 
06:04:36.468 --> 06:04:36.478 align:start position:0%
that's just an as side if you want to
 
06:04:38.150 --> 06:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
know more about fertility I could I have
 
06:04:39.590 --> 06:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
a whole class on it that I'm going to
 
06:04:41.310 --> 06:04:41.320 align:start position:0%
teach in a couple weeks you're you're
 
06:04:43.788 --> 06:04:43.798 align:start position:0%
certainly invited to come and talk to
 
06:04:48.230 --> 06:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
us I'm not being factious I just yes New
 
06:04:50.230 --> 06:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does tend to have a relatively
 
06:04:53.110 --> 06:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
low birth rate it has a lot of it has a
 
06:04:54.670 --> 06:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
relatively small proportion of its
 
06:04:56.548 --> 06:04:56.558 align:start position:0%
population of childbearing age and its
 
06:04:59.190 --> 06:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
racial ethnic mix would also tend to
 
06:05:01.670 --> 06:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
cause the birth rate to be lower in the
 
06:05:05.590 --> 06:05:05.600 align:start position:0%
state okay thank you do Dr Johnson when
 
06:05:09.628 --> 06:05:09.638 align:start position:0%
do you anticipate having the 2020 census
 
06:05:11.548 --> 06:05:11.558 align:start position:0%
information and the result of the
 
06:05:14.310 --> 06:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
pandemic that you can roll into your
 
06:05:16.430 --> 06:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
presentation right
 
06:05:19.030 --> 06:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
so the Census
 
06:05:22.150 --> 06:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
Bureau generally would have released the
 
06:05:23.750 --> 06:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
first of the Census Data the
 
06:05:28.830 --> 06:05:28.840 align:start position:0%
reapportionment file by December 31st of
 
06:05:31.190 --> 06:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
2020 so it should have already been
 
06:05:33.590 --> 06:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
released but because of the
 
06:05:36.190 --> 06:05:36.200 align:start position:0%
pandemic um everything in the census has
 
06:05:38.708 --> 06:05:38.718 align:start position:0%
been slowed down the expectation is that
 
06:05:40.670 --> 06:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
that first number which will only tell
 
06:05:42.750 --> 06:05:42.760 align:start position:0%
you the state's
 
06:05:45.030 --> 06:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
population and the number of people over
 
06:05:47.910 --> 06:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
the age of 18 is supposed to now be
 
06:05:50.750 --> 06:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
released probably in late
 
06:05:54.150 --> 06:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
March probably in March is the current
 
06:05:57.110 --> 06:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
expectation the more detailed data about
 
06:05:58.590 --> 06:05:58.600 align:start position:0%
what's going on in different parts of
 
06:06:00.030 --> 06:06:00.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and among different age
 
06:06:02.070 --> 06:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
groups in New Hampshire those data will
 
06:06:06.310 --> 06:06:06.320 align:start position:0%
be released over time over the next year
 
06:06:08.548 --> 06:06:08.558 align:start position:0%
and so probably if you invite me back to
 
06:06:10.788 --> 06:06:10.798 align:start position:0%
talk to you again in a year we'll have
 
06:06:13.110 --> 06:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
be able to incorporate a lot of the 2020
 
06:06:16.150 --> 06:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
Census Data into that conversation we
 
06:06:20.270 --> 06:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
probably will be doing that
 
06:06:24.548 --> 06:06:24.558 align:start position:0%
okay I don't see any other questions and
 
06:06:27.390 --> 06:06:27.400 align:start position:0%
again we thank you Dr Johnson those nor
 
06:06:30.830 --> 06:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
nor Norm yes Senator dandre was trying
 
06:06:34.948 --> 06:06:34.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:38.350 --> 06:06:38.360 align:start position:0%
Oh not pushing the button to rise okay
 
06:06:41.670 --> 06:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
Senator D oh thank you thank you
 
06:06:45.230 --> 06:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
do Mr Johnson really appreciate your
 
06:06:48.830 --> 06:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
presentation uh a few years ago I I I
 
06:06:52.190 --> 06:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
was I was working uh doing a job for the
 
06:06:55.910 --> 06:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
University and and I did a a study that
 
06:06:58.468 --> 06:06:58.478 align:start position:0%
resembles some of the work that you did
 
06:07:02.190 --> 06:07:02.200 align:start position:0%
obviously but my question is the
 
06:07:04.310 --> 06:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
southern the Southern Tier of New
 
06:07:06.910 --> 06:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire what I found in my study was
 
06:07:09.230 --> 06:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
it really had a Massachusetts
 
06:07:11.910 --> 06:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
orientation that they lived lived in New
 
06:07:14.310 --> 06:07:14.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but from a social standpoint
 
06:07:17.910 --> 06:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
they did their social uh activities in
 
06:07:20.468 --> 06:07:20.478 align:start position:0%
in in Massachusetts and many of them
 
06:07:22.548 --> 06:07:22.558 align:start position:0%
worked in Massachusetts but lived in New
 
06:07:24.948 --> 06:07:24.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and and that's what drove that
 
06:07:27.868 --> 06:07:27.878 align:start position:0%
income up uh so high is that still the
 
06:07:31.150 --> 06:07:31.160 align:start position:0%
case it it is a case that a substantial
 
06:07:33.548 --> 06:07:33.558 align:start position:0%
portion of the population that that
 
06:07:35.788 --> 06:07:35.798 align:start position:0%
lives in the southern part of New
 
06:07:40.350 --> 06:07:40.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh does commute to work in in
 
06:07:44.030 --> 06:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts in fact um Rockingham and
 
06:07:45.590 --> 06:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
Stratford counties are actually
 
06:07:47.350 --> 06:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
considered to be part of the Boston
 
06:07:51.190 --> 06:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
metropolitan area so and that that
 
06:07:52.990 --> 06:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
decision on how to classify those
 
06:07:54.708 --> 06:07:54.718 align:start position:0%
counties depends significantly on
 
06:07:58.390 --> 06:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
commuting data and so that reflects the
 
06:08:01.110 --> 06:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
the kind of thing that you're seeing uh
 
06:08:04.190 --> 06:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
in your in the research you did as
 
06:08:06.670 --> 06:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
well thank thank
 
06:08:09.628 --> 06:08:09.638 align:start position:0%
you does anybody else have any questions
 
06:08:12.788 --> 06:08:12.798 align:start position:0%
I don't see any hands
 
06:08:16.430 --> 06:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
raised all right again we want to thank
 
06:08:19.590 --> 06:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
