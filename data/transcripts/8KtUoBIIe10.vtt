I've been on this side of the table
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
uh prior to that I was uh uh I spent
 
00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:36.680 align:start position:0%
about better part of my adult life as a

workers comp Unemployment uh and a whole
 
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
variety of uh of issues and much of
 
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
which when I was reviewing yesterday uh
 
00:10:06.269 --> 00:10:06.279 align:start position:0%
the before this bill uh many of the
 
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
placards that were refer to today are
 
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
some of the uh many of the uh pieces I
 
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
worked on um over the course of the
 
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:16.120 align:start position:0%
years so this morning I appeared before
 
00:10:17.829 --> 00:10:17.839 align:start position:0%
the committee uh and asked for your
 
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:20.440 align:start position:0%
support in House Bill
 
00:10:24.069 --> 00:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
one7 uh and it is a disc Begins the
 
00:10:25.829 --> 00:10:25.839 align:start position:0%
discussion around the issue of remote
 
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
work and implications uh that has for
 
00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.110 align:start position:0%
work and implications uh that has for
the

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:32.680 align:start position:0%
workforce remote work is something that
 
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
is growing in New Hampshire uh here we
 
00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:38.360 align:start position:0%
are on the other side of Co and many
 
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
people uh many people have taken
 
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:45.160 align:start position:0%
advantage of of this particular um uh
 
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
you know option in workplaces around the
 
00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:51.519 align:start position:0%
around the state uh I probably need my
 
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:53.160 align:start position:0%
paper over there by way because I think
 
00:10:55.069 --> 00:10:55.079 align:start position:0%
I gave
 
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
everybody yeah I think I gave it all
 
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
out my test testimony actually thank you
 
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
so the question uh the question before
 
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
before this committee is uh is this
 
00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
something we're going to start to look
 
00:11:11.949 --> 00:11:11.959 align:start position:0%
at remote work and this is the beginning
 
00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:14.120 align:start position:0%
of I think a discussion around it so
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
with this particular Bill uh does is
 
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
pretty benign in the sense that all it
 
00:11:21.949 --> 00:11:21.959 align:start position:0%
requires is that the employer uh write
 
00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:24.200 align:start position:0%
down what the terms are uh under which
 
00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
the employee will work and to share it
 
00:11:28.629 --> 00:11:28.639 align:start position:0%
with them there's no negotiations that
 
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
go on there are no uh opportunities to
 
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
appeal it uh it's simply a statement to
 
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
the employee now the employee once they
 
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
see what the deal is they have the
 
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
authority and the right U certainly to
 
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
say no this doesn't work for me and uh
 
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
they can either can either accept it or
 
00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:50.200 align:start position:0%
reject it and move on so I you know I've
 
00:11:52.509 --> 00:11:52.519 align:start position:0%
heard that uh there are many uh
 
00:11:54.269 --> 00:11:54.279 align:start position:0%
instances in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
where uh where employers uh have this
 
00:11:59.790 --> 00:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
written down and I give you some
 
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
examples of the policy but I think
 
00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
everybody should if they're going to be
 
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
doing remote work they should think
 
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
about it write it down and make sure the
 
00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
employee knows what's going
 
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:12.440 align:start position:0%
on now what we've seen in the past few
 
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:14.440 align:start position:0%
years and this is a handout from the uh
 
00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:17.839 align:start position:0%
labor market brief is that the has been
 
00:12:21.629 --> 00:12:21.639 align:start position:0%
a bit of a surge in uh in uh and if you
 
00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:23.800 align:start position:0%
look on page two you can look you can
 
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
see uh how the uh how it's trending up
 
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
the number of people who work in uh uh
 
00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
remotely is is is on its way up uh Co I
 
00:12:36.509 --> 00:12:36.519 align:start position:0%
think is responsible for that but it
 
00:12:39.069 --> 00:12:39.079 align:start position:0%
also is having impacts quite frankly on
 
00:12:41.389 --> 00:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
communities uh there's some there's some
 
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
indication according to this report that
 
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:46.360 align:start position:0%
things are being affected housing prices
 
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
are being affected and uh and the other
 
00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
thing is that it there is some evidence
 
00:12:52.949 --> 00:12:52.959 align:start position:0%
that uh remote work has some
 
00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
consequences for for the employees
 
00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:58.360 align:start position:0%
overall uh in that they uh The Social
 
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
Network and all those kinds of things uh
 
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
that come up but clearly it's it's it's
 
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
here it's here to stay uh and I think
 
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
that the responsibility uh that we have
 
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh as a labor committee is to start the
 
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
process of looking at this so many years
 
00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
ago when the federal government passed
 
00:13:20.279 --> 00:13:21.269 align:start position:0%
ago when the federal government passed
uh

00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
regulations uh they were put in place to
 
00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:27.519 align:start position:0%
deal with homework uh so there were many
 
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh there instances in the Federal W now
 
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
that was at a time when they were trying
 
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
to prevent people from making dresses in
 
00:13:35.949 --> 00:13:35.959 align:start position:0%
their garage or assembling things in
 
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
their basement and it was in many cases
 
00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
it was uh it was hazardous uh so the
 
00:13:43.949 --> 00:13:43.959 align:start position:0%
federal law was responded to that by
 
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
passing a legislation which basically
 
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
prohibited a lot of that stuff so so I I
 
00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
think that uh but I don't think that the
 
00:13:54.749 --> 00:13:54.759 align:start position:0%
remote work uh Arena we've caught up
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
with that is yet what um what I think uh
 
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
what I think makes sense uh for this uh
 
00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
is is as we start through this process
 
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
and you're going to hear probably
 
00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
testimony today um that we that we
 
00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:12.440 align:start position:0%
really think about what our role is for
 
00:14:13.949 --> 00:14:13.959 align:start position:0%
this that we think about how it is that
 
00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:15.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to deal with this new
 
00:14:18.189 --> 00:14:18.199 align:start position:0%
environment um because I don't think
 
00:14:19.949 --> 00:14:19.959 align:start position:0%
there's much on the books to deal with
 
00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:23.480 align:start position:0%
it now and the other part of this is uh
 
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
the other part of this is that that the
 
00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
current Law requires all this placarding
 
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
of workplaces and if you work out of
 
00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:31.839 align:start position:0%
your house then working out of your
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
house is uh is a workplace and as a
 
00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
result of that being a workplace you
 
00:14:40.069 --> 00:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
have you know you have access to work as
 
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
compensation you know wait of lunch
 
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
breaks of turning computers off of all
 
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
of those kinds of things but I'm not
 
00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:50.680 align:start position:0%
sure either the employees are sharing
 
00:14:53.069 --> 00:14:53.079 align:start position:0%
that with people or the people know that
 
00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:54.959 align:start position:0%
so the what we have done over the years
 
00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
is part of the law we said everything's
 
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
got to be placarded uh and and so I'm
 
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
not suggesting that we put placards over
 
00:15:04.269 --> 00:15:04.279 align:start position:0%
your house uh but I am suggesting this
 
00:15:06.749 --> 00:15:06.759 align:start position:0%
legislation would write the deal down
 
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
and include as part of that uh that
 
00:15:11.749 --> 00:15:11.759 align:start position:0%
agreement that Arrangement that they be
 
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
informed of the of the uh current um
 
00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
laws so that they have any pla cards be
 
00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:19.240 align:start position:0%
distributed electronically to the
 
00:15:21.189 --> 00:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
employees so they know that this is a
 
00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:25.480 align:start position:0%
real workplace now one I was over I
 
00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
started this discussion at the
 
00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services
 
00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh and they have a very comprehensive
 
00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
program uh for uh for remote work and if
 
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
you're got to do remote work I mean I
 
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
think that's kind of the direction
 
00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
you're moving in you want to have a good
 
00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
policy in place to do it but one of the
 
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
things that really struck me uh and they
 
00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:45.079 align:start position:0%
were they were wonderful they gave me a
 
00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
really good uh briefing of how that
 
00:15:48.749 --> 00:15:48.759 align:start position:0%
policy works but one thing really struck
 
00:15:51.069 --> 00:15:51.079 align:start position:0%
me is of the hundreds of people who are
 
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
covered by M D services it was only one
 
00:15:57.069 --> 00:15:57.079 align:start position:0%
they thought only one workers comp claim
 
00:15:59.949 --> 00:15:59.959 align:start position:0%
in the in the entire Workforce
 
00:16:02.949 --> 00:16:02.959 align:start position:0%
so that would be unusual to say the
 
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
least uh and I don't know quite frankly
 
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
I've served in the workers comp appeals
 
00:16:10.189 --> 00:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
board for many many years and we never
 
00:16:12.189 --> 00:16:12.199 align:start position:0%
had a case like that or very not that I
 
00:16:12.199 --> 00:16:13.110 align:start position:0%
had a case like that or very not that I
could

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
remember uh and I but I think it'd be
 
00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:18.279 align:start position:0%
difficult uh though it's that though
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
they're entitled to workers compensation
 
00:16:22.829 --> 00:16:22.839 align:start position:0%
it would be a difficult thing to prove
 
00:16:25.389 --> 00:16:25.399 align:start position:0%
uh some of this stuff is connected to
 
00:16:27.949 --> 00:16:27.959 align:start position:0%
your job sorting out whether or not you
 
00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
fell down the stairs as a result of work
 
00:16:31.749 --> 00:16:31.759 align:start position:0%
the work that you were doing whether or
 
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
not you got a backache or fell off the
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
chair or got CLE tunnel it's all the
 
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
workplace those are difficult issues in
 
00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:41.240 align:start position:0%
a normal workplace it's different we
 
00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
respond differently we we have different
 
00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:47.560 align:start position:0%
um um you know we have places and we
 
00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:50.360 align:start position:0%
have uh people that see it and and when
 
00:16:52.269 --> 00:16:52.279 align:start position:0%
that happens many times people will
 
00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:55.720 align:start position:0%
report it but remote work is different
 
00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
and the fact that you have
 
00:16:58.110 --> 00:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
administrative Services again who are
 
00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
Wonder ful and they got a great policy
 
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh there was one workers comp inury and
 
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
they thought the entire Workforce would
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
be really remarkable and so uh so again
 
00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
are the employees do the employees know
 
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
what they get they getting what the deal
 
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
is and again there's not negotiations
 
00:17:17.909 --> 00:17:17.919 align:start position:0%
not suggesting that are they uh are they
 
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
able to get the pla carding information
 
00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:21.640 align:start position:0%
that they they would normally get and
 
00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
see in a workplace and uh and finally
 
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
they exercise their own rights whether
 
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
or not they want that job that's the ENT
 
00:17:30.669 --> 00:17:30.679 align:start position:0%
of this legislation now I could have
 
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
gone further I didn't I decide not to do
 
00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
that I think it's one line it's pretty
 
00:17:37.549 --> 00:17:37.559 align:start position:0%
simple uh and so that's that's kind of
 
00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:41.720 align:start position:0%
my story uh about why I introduced this
 
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you for your testimony
 
00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
sponsor thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
you representative mckeny um one
 
00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
question I have is I understood
 
00:17:58.909 --> 00:17:58.919 align:start position:0%
everything you're saying I just want to
 
00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
get confirmation does this require or
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
will this be compelling employers to
 
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:08.440 align:start position:0%
offer uh the ability to work remotely no
 
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in this that's going to
 
00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:12.200 align:start position:0%
compel anybody to create a work remotely
 
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
environment for their employees thank
 
00:18:18.909 --> 00:18:18.919 align:start position:0%
you further questions represent stranger
 
00:18:20.789 --> 00:18:20.799 align:start position:0%
uh thank you U I just have a question uh
 
00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:23.039 align:start position:0%
so uh it says this act shall take uh
 
00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:25.720 align:start position:0%
effect 60 days after passage uh is is
 
00:18:27.149 --> 00:18:27.159 align:start position:0%
that an intentional decision or was that
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
just the default that was sort of stuck
 
00:18:30.789 --> 00:18:30.799 align:start position:0%
with I I actually think that was a
 
00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
result of the legislative Services
 
00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:34.280 align:start position:0%
writing it that way but I'm pretty
 
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
flexible in terms of okay I we would do
 
00:18:42.149 --> 00:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
sponsor seeing none thank you very much
 
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank you I have one
 
00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:51.880 align:start position:0%
card today so far uh from Dave juv he is
 
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
speaking in opposition to the bill
 
00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.310 align:start position:0%
speaking in opposition to the bill
representing

00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:06.909 align:start position:0%
 
Bia

00:19:06.909 --> 00:19:06.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:08.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
committee uh Happy
 
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
2024 uh for the record my name is Dave
 
00:19:15.549 --> 00:19:15.559 align:start position:0%
juv I'm a senior vice president for
 
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
public policy with the business and
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
industry Association we're a Statewide
 
00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
trade Association we have approximately
 
00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
400 employer members with over 990,000
 
00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
Granite State Employees
 
00:19:30.149 --> 00:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
um I had
 
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:32.440 align:start position:0%
to sign up in
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
opposition um I didn't feel right
 
00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
signing up supporting
 
00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
but in many instances I agree with the
 
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
sponsor I think this is relatively
 
00:19:46.909 --> 00:19:46.919 align:start position:0%
benign I don't think it will create or
 
00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:51.400 align:start position:0%
hamper um employers if the legislature
 
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
feels in its wisdom that this is a
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
problem that needs to be addressed and
 
00:19:58.710 --> 00:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
passes the bill employers will will add
 
00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
this to their list of uh notices that
 
00:20:03.909 --> 00:20:03.919 align:start position:0%
they're already required to
 
00:20:06.909 --> 00:20:06.919 align:start position:0%
do I question whether this is really a
 
00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
problem or whether it could be a problem
 
00:20:12.149 --> 00:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
in order for there to be any type of
 
00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:15.400 align:start position:0%
remote work arrangement for it to work
 
00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:18.440 align:start position:0%
the employer has to somehow communicate
 
00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:21.400 align:start position:0%
how that's going to work to the employee
 
00:20:23.669 --> 00:20:23.679 align:start position:0%
um if they're smart it'll be a part of
 
00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
their employee manual but in in any
 
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
event they I don't understand how a
 
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
remote work Arrangement could work
 
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
without there being a clear
 
00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
understanding of how that will work
 
00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
between the employer and the employee
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
having said that um I think again it's
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
relatively benign and I'd be happy to
 
00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:46.280 align:start position:0%
answer any questions the committee may
 
00:20:48.029 --> 00:20:48.039 align:start position:0%
have all right thank you are there
 
00:20:52.909 --> 00:20:52.919 align:start position:0%
questions for uh Mr duvet yes represent
 
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
real Qui yeah thank you for your
 
00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
testimony Mr dubet if you don't think
 
00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
that it's really
 
00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
you know if you think it's you're going
 
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
to have that agreement with your
 
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
employer why not just make it so that
 
00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
you do have to have that agreement with
 
00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
your employer it's just protecting both
 
00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:13.480 align:start position:0%
parties I think yeah as I said we I
 
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
signed up opposing the bill we're not
 
00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
going to the mat on this one I think
 
00:21:20.149 --> 00:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
it's relatively benign I don't believe
 
00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
it's a problem here in New Hampshire if
 
00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
you feel is the legislature it's in the
 
00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
best interest of the state and uh
 
00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
employees to get this far into the weeds
 
00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:33.400 align:start position:0%
so be it um I will
 
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
say remote work agreements could shift a
 
00:21:41.909 --> 00:21:41.919 align:start position:0%
lot from from uh the time of year to the
 
00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:43.720 align:start position:0%
number of employees to the type of work
 
00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
being done so it is fluid but under any
 
00:21:49.789 --> 00:21:49.799 align:start position:0%
of those circumstances the employer is
 
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
going to have to make sure there's a
 
00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:53.320 align:start position:0%
clear understanding of of how that
 
00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:55.559 align:start position:0%
Arrangement is going to take place yeah
 
00:21:58.669 --> 00:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
all right thank you further question
 
00:22:01.269 --> 00:22:01.279 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative
 
00:22:03.909 --> 00:22:03.919 align:start position:0%
kill thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
00:22:06.149 --> 00:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
juv for taking my question I I think
 
00:22:09.549 --> 00:22:09.559 align:start position:0%
we're in agreement as so often happens
 
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
that uh that uh remote work is a good
 
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
thing it's good for the employer it's
 
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
good for the employee and obviously you
 
00:22:18.669 --> 00:22:18.679 align:start position:0%
can't do that if you're fixing cars in
 
00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
the garage or seeing pay well so sorry
 
00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
you can do tele telephonic seeing
 
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
patients but there's a number of things
 
00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
where it's appropriate and really
 
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
practical and other places it isn't so I
 
00:22:31.149 --> 00:22:31.159 align:start position:0%
don't know if the employee manual but
 
00:22:33.909 --> 00:22:33.919 align:start position:0%
you know maybe sort of in the uh job
 
00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:36.200 align:start position:0%
offer letter but someplace uh I would
 
00:22:39.549 --> 00:22:39.559 align:start position:0%
agree that it would be um appropriate to
 
00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
say this is how many days we'd like you
 
00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:44.360 align:start position:0%
to be in this in the shop and how many
 
00:22:46.909 --> 00:22:46.919 align:start position:0%
days subject to change you know so that
 
00:22:49.149 --> 00:22:49.159 align:start position:0%
everyone understands and that it might
 
00:22:51.789 --> 00:22:51.799 align:start position:0%
also help with our uh Child Care crisis
 
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
if you have kids that don't need your
 
00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
attention every minute and you could be
 
00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
working while they're you know there so
 
00:23:02.669 --> 00:23:02.679 align:start position:0%
my question is um do you think that this
 
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
included with the other things that you
 
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
say that we employers and employees
 
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
should communicate about might be worth
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
our legislative time to pass this and
 
00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:14.799 align:start position:0%
and include our vacation time and other
 
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
things that we should explain thoroughly
 
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
so that uh everyone's on the same
 
00:23:22.909 --> 00:23:22.919 align:start position:0%
page um as I testify if you and your
 
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
wisdom think this is a significant issue
 
00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
that needs to be addressed I don't think
 
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
it's going to create a huge hardship
 
00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
among employers I personally don't know
 
00:23:36.029 --> 00:23:36.039 align:start position:0%
that this is a big problem or how it
 
00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
could possibly be a big problem but I'll
 
00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:40.679 align:start position:0%
leave it up to your uh wisdom as
 
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
legislators to make that determination
 
00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
J representative kulum thank you thanks
 
00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:52.360 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so um in the past
 
00:23:54.269 --> 00:23:54.279 align:start position:0%
have you had experience where maybe
 
00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:55.720 align:start position:0%
employers and employees have had
 
00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:57.320 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a handshake agreement a
 
00:23:58.789 --> 00:23:58.799 align:start position:0%
verbal agreement agement on it's okay
 
00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
for you to do this and then somewhere
 
00:24:03.549 --> 00:24:03.559 align:start position:0%
along the lines somebody changed the
 
00:24:06.789 --> 00:24:06.799 align:start position:0%
changed the deal or misinterpreted the
 
00:24:09.149 --> 00:24:09.159 align:start position:0%
the the idea of it so do you think maybe
 
00:24:10.909 --> 00:24:10.919 align:start position:0%
instead of having a handshake deal or a
 
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:12.440 align:start position:0%
verbal agreement that maybe putting
 
00:24:14.029 --> 00:24:14.039 align:start position:0%
something in writing so that it's pretty
 
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
clear and concise helps both parties so
 
00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
that one can't come back to the other
 
00:24:21.549 --> 00:24:21.559 align:start position:0%
saying that's not what you
 
00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
said uh the direct answer to your
 
00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
question is I am not aware of that ever
 
00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:32.200 align:start position:0%
having happen doesn't mean it hasn't and
 
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
if you feel that it is something that
 
00:24:38.549 --> 00:24:38.559 align:start position:0%
would improve understanding between
 
00:24:40.269 --> 00:24:40.279 align:start position:0%
employers and
 
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
employees I feel this is relatively
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
benign I can tell you with my employer
 
00:24:49.149 --> 00:24:49.159 align:start position:0%
this is something that is a part of our
 
00:24:51.389 --> 00:24:51.399 align:start position:0%
employee manual and it clearly
 
00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:56.440 align:start position:0%
stipulates how it will work so I suspect
 
00:24:59.350 --> 00:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
with most uh more sophisticated
 
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
employers that have employee manuals
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
that also have some type of remote work
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
Arrangement I'd be surprised if it's not
 
00:25:10.029 --> 00:25:10.039 align:start position:0%
mentioned in there but I have not
 
00:25:12.909 --> 00:25:12.919 align:start position:0%
surveyed our members to find out about
 
00:25:15.549 --> 00:25:15.559 align:start position:0%
that I am think it's in everybody's best
 
00:25:18.549 --> 00:25:18.559 align:start position:0%
interest for that type of thing to be
 
00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
clarified and and another thing I would
 
00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
agree along the lines with what
 
00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
representative kahill was asking and
 
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
what the um sponsor of the bill said
 
00:25:31.269 --> 00:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
said remote work is here to stay it was
 
00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:34.760 align:start position:0%
here before covid probably not as common
 
00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
as it is now um it works for a lot of
 
00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:41.320 align:start position:0%
employers obviously there are some
 
00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:49.240 align:start position:0%
Hospitality manufacturing you know
 
00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:51.919 align:start position:0%
retail that it's not going to be very
 
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
practical but there are all kinds of
 
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799 align:start position:0%
other employers and jobs where remote
 
00:25:59.909 --> 00:25:59.919 align:start position:0%
work is feasible and it's something we
 
00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:03.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
Bia any further questions yes
 
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.269 align:start position:0%
Bia any further questions yes
representative

00:26:09.269 --> 00:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:15.320 align:start position:0%
St my question is about um location um
 
00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:17.000 align:start position:0%
for example my daughter is in
 
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and they actually have one
 
00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
of those placards hanging in their
 
00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:24.559 align:start position:0%
kitchen and um but the company that she
 
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
works for is in another state so when
 
00:26:30.909 --> 00:26:30.919 align:start position:0%
you are providing this um these this
 
00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
information about um employee rights do
 
00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:36.760 align:start position:0%
you use the state where the worker is
 
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
located or is it the state where the
 
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
company is located and how does that um
 
00:26:46.909 --> 00:26:46.919 align:start position:0%
how how are the connections made between
 
00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:50.360 align:start position:0%
the employer and the um and the worker
 
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that's an excellent
 
00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:54.520 align:start position:0%
question I feel like I should know the
 
00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
answer to that but I don't feel
 
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
comfortable enough to give it if there's
 
00:26:59.870 --> 00:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
someone here from Department of Labor
 
00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:01.640 align:start position:0%
that might be a good question for them
 
00:27:04.389 --> 00:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
there's got to be some way because as as
 
00:27:05.789 --> 00:27:05.799 align:start position:0%
we all know there are number of
 
00:27:08.669 --> 00:27:08.679 align:start position:0%
notifications that are already in law
 
00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:10.799 align:start position:0%
that would be impacted by that I just
 
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
don't feel comfortable answering the
 
00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
question without being completely sure
 
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
and I see our representative from the
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
Department filling out a card so when
 
00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
you're done we'll ask her to come up and
 
00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
and respond to that thank you Mr
 
00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
chair any further questions for the this
 
00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.909 align:start position:0%
chair any further questions for the this
Witness

00:27:28.909 --> 00:27:28.919 align:start position:0%
Witness
 
00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:33.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
testimony and I'll let her go first so
 
00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
she can respond to that question and
 
00:27:48.029 --> 00:27:48.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:50.360 align:start position:0%
that if I move this back a little bit I
 
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:56.519 align:start position:0%
walking yeah she'll be okay see
 
00:27:56.519 --> 00:28:07.389 align:start position:0%
walking yeah she'll be okay see
better

00:28:07.389 --> 00:28:07.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:10.559 align:start position:0%
so red is on um my name is Tracy McGraw
 
00:28:11.669 --> 00:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
and I'm an attorney for the New
 
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Labor thank you
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
for having me and I'm glad to ask uh
 
00:28:19.389 --> 00:28:19.399 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that you have um to
 
00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
go back to the question that was just
 
00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:22.990 align:start position:0%
go back to the question that was just
recently

00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:23.000 align:start position:0%
recently
 
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
discussed I believe representative stav
 
00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
you asked what laws would apply
 
00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
I can tell you in the reverse because
 
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
that's what we deal with a lot of in New
 
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a lot of people when they went
 
00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
remote we're working for companies that
 
00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
were outside of New Hampshire primarily
 
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts or Main and so then we
 
00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
would have a remote worker who is now
 
00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:45.640 align:start position:0%
working from home but still working for
 
00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
that Massachusetts or Maine or other
 
00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:51.880 align:start position:0%
state and the issue that came up was
 
00:28:54.029 --> 00:28:54.039 align:start position:0%
workers compensation insurance
 
00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:56.360 align:start position:0%
coverage and so New Hampshire has a
 
00:28:59.149 --> 00:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
requirement for three 3A coverage New
 
00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:00.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire must be listed on the
 
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
information page of a workers comp
 
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
policy under 3A if it is not then it is
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
not a valid New Hampshire workers comp
 
00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
policy so I can speak to it from that
 
00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
perspective because I can speak on
 
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
behalf of any of the other surrounding
 
00:29:18.029 --> 00:29:18.039 align:start position:0%
states but if a a Massachusetts for
 
00:29:21.029 --> 00:29:21.039 align:start position:0%
example company had remote workers they
 
00:29:23.389 --> 00:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
would then have to apply for and obtain
 
00:29:24.909 --> 00:29:24.919 align:start position:0%
valid New Hampshire workers comp
 
00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
coverage under 3A for those remote
 
00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:29.240 align:start position:0%
workers ERS the information would be
 
00:29:31.509 --> 00:29:31.519 align:start position:0%
provided to the insurance carrier as to
 
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
who they are what they did and payroll
 
00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:35.960 align:start position:0%
gets factored into what the premiums may
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
be charged for that um when that remote
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
worker is back to working in the actual
 
00:29:46.509 --> 00:29:46.519 align:start position:0%
office that's in Massachusetts in this
 
00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:48.760 align:start position:0%
example then that New Hampshire coverage
 
00:29:50.509 --> 00:29:50.519 align:start position:0%
may or may not be continue to be
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
required at all depends on whether or
 
00:29:53.789 --> 00:29:53.799 align:start position:0%
not there's anyone left in New Hampshire
 
00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
working for that
 
00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
company so I hope that answered that
 
00:29:59.669 --> 00:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
that question to the extent that I can
 
00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
because again I can't speak on behalf of
 
00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts or any of the other states
 
00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:05.960 align:start position:0%
that's how New Hampshire would handle
 
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
it I have a follow-up question on that
 
00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:13.640 align:start position:0%
so if that Massachusetts company has no
 
00:30:17.509 --> 00:30:17.519 align:start position:0%
presence in New Hampshire except that a
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
worker lives here um what is the
 
00:30:23.549 --> 00:30:23.559 align:start position:0%
mechanism by which the New Hampshire of
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor can
 
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
enforce in this case the provisions of
 
00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:32.200 align:start position:0%
the workers comp law so what happens
 
00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
when you have someone from out ofate an
 
00:30:35.549 --> 00:30:35.559 align:start position:0%
employer from out of state that has no
 
00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
connection theoretically to New
 
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it just has an employee that's
 
00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:42.440 align:start position:0%
working remotely in New Hampshire that
 
00:30:44.509 --> 00:30:44.519 align:start position:0%
employees payroll must be reported to
 
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire employment security and
 
00:30:48.909 --> 00:30:48.919 align:start position:0%
then New Hampshire employment security
 
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
obviously detects that New Hampshire
 
00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:53.080 align:start position:0%
payroll is being reported and the next
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
question is is is there New Hampshire
 
00:30:57.269 --> 00:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
coverage New Hampshire employment
 
00:30:58.990 --> 00:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
security would then generate what we
 
00:31:01.269 --> 00:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
call a questionnaire that will be
 
00:31:03.149 --> 00:31:03.159 align:start position:0%
delivered from the Department of Labor
 
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
goes out to the employer and asks is
 
00:31:07.629 --> 00:31:07.639 align:start position:0%
this your correct Federal employer
 
00:31:09.629 --> 00:31:09.639 align:start position:0%
identification number do you have
 
00:31:11.909 --> 00:31:11.919 align:start position:0%
employees that are working in New
 
00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and if so please provide us
 
00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:16.360 align:start position:0%
with the insurance
 
00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
information I'd say 80% of the time we
 
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
do not get responses and it ends up
 
00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
coming to legal for petition and for
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
hearings at which time we do get
 
00:31:26.159 --> 00:31:27.870 align:start position:0%
hearings at which time we do get
responses

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
responses
 
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
um and it has happened a significant
 
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
amount of times because when the
 
00:31:36.909 --> 00:31:36.919 align:start position:0%
pandemic hit a lot of people went remote
 
00:31:39.269 --> 00:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
very quickly and a lot of businesses
 
00:31:40.909 --> 00:31:40.919 align:start position:0%
were caught off guard as to what the
 
00:31:43.549 --> 00:31:43.559 align:start position:0%
requirements were and assumed because if
 
00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:45.880 align:start position:0%
anybody knows about workers compensation
 
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
insurance policies 3C on the information
 
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
page talks about all other states and
 
00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:52.760 align:start position:0%
they assumed that if New Hampshire was
 
00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:55.240 align:start position:0%
listed on all other states that that was
 
00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
a valid New Hampshire policy which
 
00:32:02.509 --> 00:32:02.519 align:start position:0%
obviously it is not so um in answer to
 
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
your question um New Hampshire
 
00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:07.480 align:start position:0%
employment security in tandem with the
 
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor would be able to
 
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
keep track of that
 
00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
information thank
 
00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:16.120 align:start position:0%
you go with representative
 
00:32:18.269 --> 00:32:18.279 align:start position:0%
Granger uh thank you I I didn't know I
 
00:32:20.269 --> 00:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
was going to go into this uh section of
 
00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
law today neither did
 
00:32:24.669 --> 00:32:24.679 align:start position:0%
I um I I I I forgive you if you don't
 
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
have any uh sources with you but why is
 
00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:30.200 align:start position:0%
it that New Hampshire's workers comp
 
00:32:31.509 --> 00:32:31.519 align:start position:0%
requirements are different from other
 
00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
states is is that listed in statute
 
00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:36.200 align:start position:0%
actually it is listed in statute if you
 
00:32:40.389 --> 00:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
look under Section 281a 5 and 7 that
 
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
talks about the workers comp
 
00:32:44.509 --> 00:32:44.519 align:start position:0%
requirements and that New Hampshire must
 
00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
be identified it doesn't specifically
 
00:32:48.789 --> 00:32:48.799 align:start position:0%
come out and say it must be 3A on the
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
policy but interpretation of the statute
 
00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:53.039 align:start position:0%
requires it to be listed as 3A
 
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
underneath the policy if you look at an
 
00:32:57.029 --> 00:32:57.039 align:start position:0%
information page on a workers
 
00:32:58.870 --> 00:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
compensation policy you'll see that
 
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
under 3C it actually lists I want to say
 
00:33:06.549 --> 00:33:06.559 align:start position:0%
five maybe Six States where those States
 
00:33:08.669 --> 00:33:08.679 align:start position:0%
actually provide workers compensation
 
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
for their employers so those particular
 
00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:14.120 align:start position:0%
States can't be just globally
 
00:33:16.389 --> 00:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
incorporated into a workers comp policy
 
00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:17.960 align:start position:0%
there's a special process in order to
 
00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
get in uh insurance for those States all
 
00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
other states that do not have any
 
00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
specific requirements like New Hampshire
 
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
has or those five to six states that I
 
00:33:29.629 --> 00:33:29.639 align:start position:0%
just mentioned they can be listed under
 
00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:32.440 align:start position:0%
3C on the policy are there any other
 
00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
states that list or require 3A I know
 
00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
there are I do not know what they
 
00:33:40.629 --> 00:33:40.639 align:start position:0%
are thank you for having that number
 
00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
just like in your head that's I
 
00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate it it's it's a sick thing
 
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
what can I
 
00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
say representative
 
00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:49.919 align:start position:0%
kahill thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:33:49.919 --> 00:33:50.629 align:start position:0%
kahill thank you Mr chair and thank you
Miss

00:33:50.629 --> 00:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
Miss
 
00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:54.200 align:start position:0%
mcra um I have actually had two if I may
 
00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:56.200 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you sir I'm gonna would I
 
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna ask you to speculate because
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
we talked about workers comp and is it
 
00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
likely that if people are working at
 
00:34:04.389 --> 00:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
home they're less susceptible to
 
00:34:06.909 --> 00:34:06.919 align:start position:0%
workplace injuries and there that's why
 
00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
we haven't had uh what you might expect
 
00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:11.919 align:start position:0%
for a normal range of complaints for a
 
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
large number of employees working at
 
00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
home I can't speak to whether or not
 
00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
they are less susceptible but the bottom
 
00:34:22.069 --> 00:34:22.079 align:start position:0%
line is is if you're working in an
 
00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:23.560 align:start position:0%
office and you're walking around the
 
00:34:25.069 --> 00:34:25.079 align:start position:0%
office but you're working at home and
 
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
you're walking around at home it would
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
appear that you have the same risks
 
00:34:33.869 --> 00:34:33.879 align:start position:0%
involved um you would go through if you
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
were trying to prove whether something
 
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
was a workers's compensation case for a
 
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:39.839 align:start position:0%
remote worker versus a workers's
 
00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
compensation case for someone who's
 
00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:43.399 align:start position:0%
actually working in the office you still
 
00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:45.839 align:start position:0%
have to go through the same questions
 
00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:47.919 align:start position:0%
and the same type of a hearing on
 
00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:50.200 align:start position:0%
causality uh just because they're
 
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
working at home doesn't negate the
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
possibility of a workers's compensation
 
00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
claim you still have have the repetitive
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
motion type injuries that can happen in
 
00:35:02.349 --> 00:35:02.359 align:start position:0%
a regular workplace but think about it
 
00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
from just this one example someone is
 
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
walking down a straight path there is no
 
00:35:11.349 --> 00:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
defects in the um the flooring there's
 
00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
no poles in the carpet there's no divots
 
00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
there's nothing and this is at work they
 
00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
trip and they fall that's probably going
 
00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:21.160 align:start position:0%
to lean more towards a worker's CL
 
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
injury depending upon the other facts
 
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
that go with it if they're at home and
 
00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:27.320 align:start position:0%
that's an issue
 
00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:29.480 align:start position:0%
and they're walking down and there's no
 
00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:30.670 align:start position:0%
and they're walking down and there's no
defects

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:30.680 align:start position:0%
defects
 
00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
no that can be the same problem a lot of
 
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
it depends on the facts behind it so if
 
00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
they're carrying something for work if
 
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
they're carrying a briefcase if they're
 
00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:41.720 align:start position:0%
lifting their laptop if what they're
 
00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:43.880 align:start position:0%
doing is a work-related activity
 
00:35:46.349 --> 00:35:46.359 align:start position:0%
requiring them to not have their hands
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
free requiring them to um I I can't
 
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
think of of different possibilities but
 
00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:54.440 align:start position:0%
handsfree seems to be the biggest issue
 
00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:55.960 align:start position:0%
when you're just walking on a flat
 
00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:57.790 align:start position:0%
when you're just walking on a flat
surface

00:35:57.790 --> 00:35:57.800 align:start position:0%
surface
 
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:00.760 align:start position:0%
that can be a comp comp case at off the
 
00:36:02.309 --> 00:36:02.319 align:start position:0%
office and it can be a workers's comp
 
00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
case at home it really comes down to
 
00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
facts okay my last my last question uh
 
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
on another related issue with remote
 
00:36:15.309 --> 00:36:15.319 align:start position:0%
work um is uh a colleague on the
 
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
committee told me that he was working
 
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
for a company located in Massachusetts
 
00:36:22.829 --> 00:36:22.839 align:start position:0%
which we know has Stellar laws regarding
 
00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
uh unused vacation pay UNF 10 and that
 
00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
person received his he had to contest it
 
00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:32.680 align:start position:0%
but he did receive his unused vacation
 
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:34.079 align:start position:0%
pay would that be something that would
 
00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
be uh addressed uh in our in remote work
 
00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
typically I think state lines yeah I I
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
think it would have to depend on what
 
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
the employer feels is appropriate to put
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
into it but if it's a Massachusetts
 
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
company and the Massachusetts company
 
00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:52.790 align:start position:0%
company and the Massachusetts company
has

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
specific uh contractual agreements with
 
00:36:58.630 --> 00:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
the employee yet yes we offer PTO yes we
 
00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
pay out PTO whether it's a percentage or
 
00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:02.870 align:start position:0%
pay out PTO whether it's a percentage or
or

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
whatever it can be done to make it
 
00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
perfectly clear and to remove all uh
 
00:37:10.349 --> 00:37:10.359 align:start position:0%
vagueness in any type of an agreement
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
have we had any of those issues come
 
00:37:15.069 --> 00:37:15.079 align:start position:0%
across I can't answer that question yeah
 
00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna add Maine to that list because
 
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
Maine also has this law that uh it
 
00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter what the circumstances
 
00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
were you get your vacation pay thank you
 
00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:29.720 align:start position:0%

Labor seeing none thank you and I oh yes
 
00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
and pass your card around when um and I
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
still have one final card uh Gary abbit
 
00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
is representing the associated general
 
00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
contractors um is going to speak in
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you chairman for the record
 
00:37:56.829 --> 00:37:56.839 align:start position:0%
my name's Gary Abbott I'm the executive
 
00:37:58.829 --> 00:37:58.839 align:start position:0%
vice president of the associated general
 
00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
contractors of New Hampshire and I
 
00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:03.160 align:start position:0%
apologize ahead of time because I'm
 
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
going to probably make this even more
 
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
confusing to you uh reading the bill I
 
00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
first read the bill and said you
 
00:38:14.309 --> 00:38:14.319 align:start position:0%
know employees and employers should
 
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
understand the terms and conditions but
 
00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
then when focusing on this one line uh
 
00:38:23.109 --> 00:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
the first thing that hit me was the end
 
00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
of the sentence reference to all
 
00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
applicable laws and regulations
 
00:38:29.589 --> 00:38:29.599 align:start position:0%
now I'm an employer I I don't know how I
 
00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
would write the terms and conditions
 
00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:34.760 align:start position:0%
with all applicable
 
00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:37.480 align:start position:0%
laws um I'm supposed to reference them
 
00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:40.280 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not so sure even with me being a
 
00:38:44.069 --> 00:38:44.079 align:start position:0%
lobbyist don't know all of the the laws
 
00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
the second part is
 
00:38:50.349 --> 00:38:50.359 align:start position:0%
the are we are we forcing contracts here
 
00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
with the terms and conditions I can tell
 
00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:54.200 align:start position:0%
you as an
 
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
employer we have remote work and I don't
 
00:38:59.230 --> 00:38:59.240 align:start position:0%
want to confuse things either I
 
00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:01.240 align:start position:0%
represent the construction industry and
 
00:39:03.069 --> 00:39:03.079 align:start position:0%
originally I thought we have nothing to
 
00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
do with remote work but what is the
 
00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
definition of remote work uh I hope it
 
00:39:13.589 --> 00:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't turn into a construction crew
 
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
working in a different town is remote I
 
00:39:18.069 --> 00:39:18.079 align:start position:0%
think you're trying to talk about
 
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
working from home but not everybody on
 
00:39:22.309 --> 00:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
remote work works from home so I think
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
we need a definition of what remote work
 
00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:28.280 align:start position:0%
is the the terms and conditions I can
 
00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:29.800 align:start position:0%
tell you as an
 
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
employer we're going through the process
 
00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
when covid hit my staff turned into
 
00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
working from home that became a norm for
 
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
most offices uh there were no written
 
00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
terms and conditions it was to try to
 
00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
perform your work that you were going to
 
00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
do in in office and I also talked about
 
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
the construction I I asked contractors
 
00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:53.839 align:start position:0%
and they said oh Gary we have offices
 
00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:55.640 align:start position:0%
that do all the payroll and all that
 
00:39:58.309 --> 00:39:58.319 align:start position:0%
stuff we have employees that that work
 
00:40:02.309 --> 00:40:02.319 align:start position:0%
remote so this bill does affect us but
 
00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
what I was getting to is I think the
 
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
normal Pro progression for a company is
 
00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:11.480 align:start position:0%
we're adopting position descriptions
 
00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
with what the employee does for remote
 
00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
and not remote when they can't be remote
 
00:40:20.109 --> 00:40:20.119 align:start position:0%
it's much more detailed you know trying
 
00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
to draft this this is a remote work
 
00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:24.200 align:start position:0%
where I get hired by Amazon to answer
 
00:40:26.109 --> 00:40:26.119 align:start position:0%
questions and I just stay home all the
 
00:40:26.119 --> 00:40:26.950 align:start position:0%
questions and I just stay home all the
time

00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:29.560 align:start position:0%
but there are situations like for me as
 
00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
an employer none of my employees whether
 
00:40:35.309 --> 00:40:35.319 align:start position:0%
they're part-time or full-time stay home
 
00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
all the time there's requirements to be
 
00:40:40.309 --> 00:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
in the office with Team meetings with
 
00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
different scenarios certain days you
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
have to be in the office well I want to
 
00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
make that clear in their position
 
00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
description I don't think we need a
 
00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
state law plugged in to start describing
 
00:40:56.309 --> 00:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
what I need to do to protect both the
 
00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
the employee and myself of what the work
 
00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
Arrangement is and that varies I mean
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
the remote work language I develop for
 
00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
my part-time people and my full-time
 
00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:11.720 align:start position:0%
staff is completely different regarding
 
00:41:15.069 --> 00:41:15.079 align:start position:0%
remote work and it is a thing of today
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
but this seems to run down a path
 
00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
where there's a lot of flexibility in
 
00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:24.440 align:start position:0%
drafting those specific to a position
 
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
and the details of what the person does
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
does and this how it's drafted seems to
 
00:41:32.829 --> 00:41:32.839 align:start position:0%
limit my flexibility as an employer
 
00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
because those those arrangements change
 
00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:37.720 align:start position:0%
they changed from back when it was covid
 
00:41:41.349 --> 00:41:41.359 align:start position:0%
to today it's much different situation
 
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
and the employer needs to have that
 
00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:46.280 align:start position:0%
availability to change things because
 
00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:48.200 align:start position:0%
our business changed different times of
 
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
the year we do different things so it's
 
00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:54.280 align:start position:0%
not a onesize make this language and
 
00:41:57.870 --> 00:41:57.880 align:start position:0%
done so that's why we oppose it is that
 
00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
this kind of sets up almost a state law
 
00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
that says you got to do this and I think
 
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
it's a field day for attorneys in the
 
00:42:08.589 --> 00:42:08.599 align:start position:0%
future my what I wrote was not good
 
00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
enough or the terms were not clear
 
00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
enough so we worry about the liability
 
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
from either side so I I there's a lot of
 
00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
questions here it's a great oneliner but
 
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not so sure I understand what the
 
00:42:25.309 --> 00:42:25.319 align:start position:0%
details and I can tell you coming here
 
00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:27.800 align:start position:0%
today I never even thought about the
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
workers comp not even on my radar um my
 
00:42:33.309 --> 00:42:33.319 align:start position:0%
employees don't live in other states so
 
00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
that doesn't apply to my company
 
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
but there's a lot here when you say all
 
00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:41.800 align:start position:0%
applicable laws which laws are we
 
00:42:44.549 --> 00:42:44.559 align:start position:0%
talking about so I would end my
 
00:42:46.549 --> 00:42:46.559 align:start position:0%
testimony there and just uh that's why
 
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
we oppose it I think there's either
 
00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:51.880 align:start position:0%
clarification or other options should be
 
00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:53.480 align:start position:0%
available to
 
00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
employers thank you very much uh are
 
00:42:58.630 --> 00:42:58.640 align:start position:0%
there questions for this
 
00:43:01.589 --> 00:43:01.599 align:start position:0%
witness representative lir thank you Mr
 
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Mr Abbott I
 
00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
think you might be making a little
 
00:43:08.829 --> 00:43:08.839 align:start position:0%
broader than it seems to be only because
 
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
I think what the bill was supposed to be
 
00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
is just for remote workers at
 
00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
home I mean you I know there's going to
 
00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
be issues with I mean times when they go
 
00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
to the office go to another job site
 
00:43:26.589 --> 00:43:26.599 align:start position:0%
perhaps but I believe and
 
00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh representative McKenzie can qu can uh
 
00:43:31.309 --> 00:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
correct me but I think it means only for
 
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
remote when you're at
 
00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
home or you know it might be at a
 
00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:37.640 align:start position:0%
restaurant or something I guess if
 
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
you're doing you know taking your
 
00:43:42.069 --> 00:43:42.079 align:start position:0%
computer with you but it's remote work
 
00:43:43.829 --> 00:43:43.839 align:start position:0%
um I've been in construction for a long
 
00:43:47.109 --> 00:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
time too I don't uh if I'm doing my work
 
00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:48.520 align:start position:0%
on my house I don't call that remote
 
00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:50.680 align:start position:0%
work because I'm doing it for myself but
 
00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
if I'm working for somebody I'm just
 
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
bringing up I I I I think I get the
 
00:43:57.870 --> 00:43:57.880 align:start position:0%
basis I think I think an easy thing for
 
00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
me would to agree with would be
 
00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:03.720 align:start position:0%
employers need to make sure that in some
 
00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:08.440 align:start position:0%
method that they're um relaying those
 
00:44:12.069 --> 00:44:12.079 align:start position:0%
those I mean I personally have done it
 
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
verbally uh the writing thing makes it
 
00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
more harder for me to quickly do
 
00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
something uh a person has a medical
 
00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
issue and you want them to continue to
 
00:44:25.589 --> 00:44:25.599 align:start position:0%
work uh I got to draft up a an agreement
 
00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:27.400 align:start position:0%
uh when that person can't come back to
 
00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
the office even though I want to keep
 
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:32.200 align:start position:0%
them employed I just I think we're on
 
00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:34.720 align:start position:0%
the same page it should be described as
 
00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
best they can and if you're trying to
 
00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
get away from verbal
 
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
agreements uh I I just think there needs
 
00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
more thank you are there other questions
 
00:44:48.309 --> 00:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
witness uh representative D
 
00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
sylvestra well yes uh when when this uh
 
00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
person is done I'd like to ask
 
00:44:58.950 --> 00:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie a question to
 
00:45:01.309 --> 00:45:01.319 align:start position:0%
come back that's all right and in the
 
00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
interest well we've gone beyond and
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
since we have the sponsor of the bill in
 
00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
um that it may be appropriate to discuss
 
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
it during our work session too uh I'll
 
00:45:18.109 --> 00:45:18.119 align:start position:0%
leave it up to you you can um but
 
00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
representative kill you had a question
 
00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair thank you Mr
 
00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:25.599 align:start position:0%
Abbott um I I I do sense that we are
 
00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
sort of near very near agreement on on
 
00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
the issue uh but it's the matter of uh
 
00:45:35.309 --> 00:45:35.319 align:start position:0%
writing all the all the possible rsas
 
00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
and sub references to this and that I we
 
00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
that probably wasn't isn't really
 
00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:43.880 align:start position:0%
required but uh would you say that uh
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
just adding subject to subject to
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
different conditions or changes uh this
 
00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:51.720 align:start position:0%
schedule this this this is how we'll do
 
00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:53.240 align:start position:0%
remote work would that be something that
 
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
would be reasonable to put in your
 
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
employee manual oh I think many
 
00:45:59.470 --> 00:45:59.480 align:start position:0%
employers would put that that you know
 
00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
this is the arrangement and subject to
 
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
change uh to deal with whatever changes
 
00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
in your office may may be I agree with
 
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
that that that would be in there um but
 
00:46:13.790 --> 00:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
where is the right place to put it and I
 
00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
guess it just says in writing in work
 
00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
Arrangement if you're just saying I can
 
00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
put that in a job description or in an
 
00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:24.440 align:start position:0%
office policy then I'm fine with that
 
00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:27.400 align:start position:0%
but keep in mind th this is going to be
 
00:46:29.309 --> 00:46:29.319 align:start position:0%
a big undertaking for a lot of
 
00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:31.240 align:start position:0%
businesses that don't have it in those
 
00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
policies that went through covid quickly
 
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
went into remote work and still have
 
00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:40.280 align:start position:0%
it just a quick followup would you agree
 
00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:42.520 align:start position:0%
Mr Abbott that a written agreement a
 
00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:43.960 align:start position:0%
veral agreement is worth the paper it's
 
00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:46.309 align:start position:0%
veral agreement is worth the paper it's
written

00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:49.309 --> 00:46:49.319 align:start position:0%
on uh I I guess I would agree with that
 
00:46:53.309 --> 00:46:53.319 align:start position:0%
thank you sir are there further
 
00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
questions and are you
 
00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:00.920 align:start position:0%
okay okay um so that's all the cards
 
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
that I have so unless there's someone
 
00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
else uh that wanted to speak I will
 
00:47:09.589 --> 00:47:09.599 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on this bill
 
00:47:11.549 --> 00:47:11.559 align:start position:0%
and representative McKenzie if you could
 
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
hand up the blue sheet while you're
 
00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
that and um while we're waiting at the
 
00:47:29.069 --> 00:47:29.079 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the next
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
bill I informed the
 
00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
chairman um that they are not going
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
they're going to ask us to itl this bill
 
00:47:43.309 --> 00:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
and the reason is that the the same or
 
00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:45.800 align:start position:0%
very similar language has been submitted
 
00:47:49.470 --> 00:47:49.480 align:start position:0%
both in the house and in the Senate and
 
00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
the sponsors want to concentrate on the
 
00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:55.160 align:start position:0%
Senate version rather than duplicate the
 
00:47:57.630 --> 00:47:57.640 align:start position:0%
work in both houses at the same
 
00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:03.750 align:start position:0%
work in both houses at the same
time

00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
is y so
 
00:48:16.829 --> 00:48:16.839 align:start position:0%
uh for the blue sheet on 10
 
00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
17 there were no um people signed up so
 
00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
there are no additional names for that
 
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
so uh with that the hearing on 107 is
 
00:48:31.829 --> 00:48:31.839 align:start position:0%
closed and I will open the hearing on
 
00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:35.240 align:start position:0%
10:23 and unless this somebody
 
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
sponsoring the bill is
 
00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
here um I would ask if there's a
 
00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:42.559 align:start position:0%
volunteer from the committee just to
 
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:54.599 --> 00:49:03.190 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:04.960 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair uh again
 
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
representative Michael Cahill
 
01:31:49.070 --> 01:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
representing the Rockingham 10 the towns
 
01:31:53.590 --> 01:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
of newfields and New Market um the topic
 
01:31:56.950 --> 01:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
is familiar to members of the committee
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about this for a
 
01:32:02.750 --> 01:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
little while now and as I've indicated
 
01:32:07.149 --> 01:32:07.159 align:start position:0%
in this uh slightly updated sheet from
 
01:32:10.430 --> 01:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
from last year it's an ongoing
 
01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
situation uh you in
 
01:32:17.830 --> 01:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
2023 of 250 wage claims
 
01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
uh that went to a decision that went to
 
01:32:25.030 --> 01:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
a hearing s 78% 78 or 31% involved this
 
01:32:28.109 --> 01:32:28.119 align:start position:0%
issue as a factor not not necessarily
 
01:32:29.950 --> 01:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
the only issue but it was it was part of
 
01:32:32.990 --> 01:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
it and I and I've seen from you know my
 
01:32:36.950 --> 01:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
reading of these decisions that the
 
01:32:39.310 --> 01:32:39.320 align:start position:0%
employers sometimes have a policy
 
01:32:41.910 --> 01:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes they don't and sometimes they
 
01:32:44.790 --> 01:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
say uh it's a case-by casee basis which
 
01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:48.239 align:start position:0%
you know is in Practical and
 
01:32:52.430 --> 01:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
um but we've narrowed this with 117 8
 
01:32:56.310 --> 01:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
we've narrowed it down to only two sit
 
01:32:59.270 --> 01:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
circumstances where we would agree that
 
01:33:01.830 --> 01:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
the employee has no control over this
 
01:33:03.109 --> 01:33:03.119 align:start position:0%
this is not him
 
01:33:05.950 --> 01:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
voluntarily uh leaving this is uh
 
01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lay you're calling into the
 
01:33:10.470 --> 01:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
breakroom and is a layoff today's your
 
01:33:14.550 --> 01:33:14.560 align:start position:0%
last day or the company's been sold and
 
01:33:17.910 --> 01:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
I may or may not have uh taken into
 
01:33:21.109 --> 01:33:21.119 align:start position:0%
account that you had two weeks vacation
 
01:33:24.590 --> 01:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
and you you know had requested it or you
 
01:33:26.830 --> 01:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
had this coming to you and I may or may
 
01:33:28.229 --> 01:33:28.239 align:start position:0%
not have included that with my
 
01:33:31.149 --> 01:33:31.159 align:start position:0%
negotiations with the new owner and what
 
01:33:33.149 --> 01:33:33.159 align:start position:0%
we're what we're trying to do here is
 
01:33:35.830 --> 01:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
see that uh in both these instances the
 
01:33:38.430 --> 01:33:38.440 align:start position:0%
employee does not lose what they've had
 
01:33:41.430 --> 01:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
what they've earned and had little or no
 
01:33:45.709 --> 01:33:45.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to make use of it um with
 
01:33:48.550 --> 01:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
the company either either um certainly
 
01:33:49.830 --> 01:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
if you're having difficulty thinking
 
01:33:51.109 --> 01:33:51.119 align:start position:0%
about a layoff you're probably not
 
01:33:53.550 --> 01:33:53.560 align:start position:0%
approving vacations you need everybody
 
01:33:56.629 --> 01:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
all hands on deck uh when you want to
 
01:33:58.109 --> 01:33:58.119 align:start position:0%
when you're thinking about selling the
 
01:34:00.350 --> 01:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
company you want to appear productive
 
01:34:02.950 --> 01:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
and you may not you may be withholding
 
01:34:05.270 --> 01:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh vacation time but in any case even if
 
01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
everything is going well someone's bound
 
01:34:11.310 --> 01:34:11.320 align:start position:0%
to have some hours that they have earned
 
01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
and this bill would ensure that they are
 
01:34:17.430 --> 01:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
that they don't forfeit that through no
 
01:34:21.229 --> 01:34:21.239 align:start position:0%
fault of their own um now I want to draw
 
01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
your attention as was just happened with
 
01:34:26.830 --> 01:34:26.840 align:start position:0%
me uh to something an improvement that
 
01:34:33.070 --> 01:34:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:36.590 --> 01:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
amendment uh credits credit to the team
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:43.270 --> 01:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
this section
 
01:34:47.669 --> 01:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
two uh for the purpose of this section
 
01:34:49.870 --> 01:34:49.880 align:start position:0%
the terms earn time vacation or vacation
 
01:34:51.910 --> 01:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
time and pay time off have the same Mee
 
01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
and their value as wages should be paid
 
01:34:54.910 --> 01:34:54.920 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:34:59.470 --> 01:34:59.480 align:start position:0%
employee um what we should have there is
 
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the employer's practice or
 
01:35:04.390 --> 01:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
policy added to that phrase as it is for
 
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
this sick time and sick days but again
 
01:35:10.229 --> 01:35:10.239 align:start position:0%
this the this would be pursuant to their
 
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
policy other than the instances Down
 
01:35:17.910 --> 01:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
Below in uh in SEC sure that was Roman
 
01:35:20.030 --> 01:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
two in section two where we talk about
 
01:35:23.189 --> 01:35:23.199 align:start position:0%
the circumstances a layoff or the
 
01:35:26.070 --> 01:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
company being sold uh in in
 
01:35:29.430 --> 01:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
this in in those in those circumstances
 
01:35:31.629 --> 01:35:31.639 align:start position:0%
then they the employee would be
 
01:35:34.790 --> 01:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
compensated for their earned time uh
 
01:35:36.629 --> 01:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
that's that's the wrinkle
 
01:35:39.470 --> 01:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
there but I I would agree with uh the
 
01:35:42.510 --> 01:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
gentleman behind me that
 
01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh that adding that brief uh section A
 
01:35:49.830 --> 01:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
Brief phrase to the end of uh Roman
 
01:35:52.709 --> 01:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
section one Roman 2
 
01:35:55.950 --> 01:35:55.960 align:start position:0%
uh would be clear and would avoid a
 
01:35:58.390 --> 01:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding and there are enough if
 
01:36:00.149 --> 01:36:00.159 align:start position:0%
you read those wage claims as I do there
 
01:36:02.070 --> 01:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
are enough misunderstandings now we
 
01:36:04.109 --> 01:36:04.119 align:start position:0%
don't need
 
01:36:06.790 --> 01:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
more gladly take any
 
01:36:08.790 --> 01:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
questions right thank you are there
 
01:36:10.950 --> 01:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
01:36:14.149 --> 01:36:14.159 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative love could you
 
01:36:16.870 --> 01:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
clarify that uh representative um you
 
01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
know the uh pursuant of PR practice of
 
01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
policies here the employer employers uh
 
01:36:23.790 --> 01:36:23.800 align:start position:0%
could you clarify what we were talking
 
01:36:24.629 --> 01:36:24.639 align:start position:0%
about yeah thank thank you
 
01:36:29.590 --> 01:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:32.669 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:36:32.669 --> 01:36:32.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:36.750 --> 01:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
so what the my my aim here with the the
 
01:36:39.189 --> 01:36:39.199 align:start position:0%
language pursuant to the employer policy
 
01:36:42.229 --> 01:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
is used with the sick time or sick days
 
01:36:43.870 --> 01:36:43.880 align:start position:0%
and in that sense I'm say what I'm
 
01:36:46.910 --> 01:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
saying is uh we hope that our employees
 
01:36:49.189 --> 01:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
don't get sick but the time is available
 
01:36:52.470 --> 01:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
if they do but if they don't get sick
 
01:36:54.430 --> 01:36:54.440 align:start position:0%
and they had good health I'm not
 
01:36:57.270 --> 01:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
suggesting that that those hours be paid
 
01:37:01.270 --> 01:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
out um but I could understand from the
 
01:37:03.629 --> 01:37:03.639 align:start position:0%
point of view uh that uh that this could
 
01:37:07.870 --> 01:37:07.880 align:start position:0%
be added um to the part above where
 
01:37:09.109 --> 01:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
we're talking
 
01:37:13.030 --> 01:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
about the vacation time earn time uh
 
01:37:16.669 --> 01:37:16.679 align:start position:0%
pursuant to that would be U had this so
 
01:37:18.270 --> 01:37:18.280 align:start position:0%
for the the same the same SE for the
 
01:37:20.590 --> 01:37:20.600 align:start position:0%
purpose of this section the uh these
 
01:37:22.470 --> 01:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
would not be paid out this would be
 
01:37:24.270 --> 01:37:24.280 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the employer's practice or
 
01:37:26.910 --> 01:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
policy but then that is
 
01:37:30.590 --> 01:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
superseded in uh the new section below
 
01:37:33.910 --> 01:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
where it's a layoff or the sale of the
 
01:37:36.830 --> 01:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
company that would uh pardon the
 
01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:37.950 align:start position:0%
company that would uh pardon the
expression

01:37:37.950 --> 01:37:37.960 align:start position:0%
expression
 
01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:39.510 align:start position:0%
expression
Trump

01:37:39.510 --> 01:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
Trump
 
01:37:44.790 --> 01:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:46.750 --> 01:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
practice and if I may I'm going to
 
01:37:49.070 --> 01:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
editorialize just a little bit more
 
01:37:51.030 --> 01:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
again from I spent the weekend reading
 
01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:54.360 align:start position:0%
the those 78 wage claims and while it's
 
01:37:58.229 --> 01:37:58.239 align:start position:0%
not part of this bill uh I think I would
 
01:38:01.229 --> 01:38:01.239 align:start position:0%
urge businesses to consider uh whether
 
01:38:03.589 --> 01:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
you would have all your things all PTO
 
01:38:06.270 --> 01:38:06.280 align:start position:0%
in one thing or sick time and earn time
 
01:38:08.790 --> 01:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
just to have everything acrude because a
 
01:38:10.350 --> 01:38:10.360 align:start position:0%
lot of the misunderstandings that I've
 
01:38:13.189 --> 01:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
seen are when people say you have all
 
01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
your hours January 1 your anniversary
 
01:38:17.270 --> 01:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
date you have all your hours they're all
 
01:38:20.070 --> 01:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
yours and then someone thinks I can take
 
01:38:22.189 --> 01:38:22.199 align:start position:0%
them even if I work for the company for
 
01:38:24.629 --> 01:38:24.639 align:start position:0%
a month or two and and you'll pay me all
 
01:38:24.639 --> 01:38:25.589 align:start position:0%
a month or two and and you'll pay me all
of

01:38:25.589 --> 01:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:38:29.310 --> 01:38:29.320 align:start position:0%
that believe me I've seen it or you know
 
01:38:30.990 --> 01:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
or when they when they're not clear on
 
01:38:33.629 --> 01:38:33.639 align:start position:0%
this so I I really think a cruel where
 
01:38:36.709 --> 01:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
you can say at you earn so many hours
 
01:38:39.950 --> 01:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
per week that you work is simpler it's
 
01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:43.360 align:start position:0%
understood it used to be the norm and
 
01:38:44.830 --> 01:38:44.840 align:start position:0%
you you could avoid all these troubles
 
01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
you had the option of course if someone
 
01:38:48.589 --> 01:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
says well I've got this special event
 
01:38:50.109 --> 01:38:50.119 align:start position:0%
coming and I don't have quite enough
 
01:38:53.589 --> 01:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
time to to uh Advance them to so go
 
01:38:56.430 --> 01:38:56.440 align:start position:0%
negative in the in the in on the payroll
 
01:38:59.310 --> 01:38:59.320 align:start position:0%
and then um the other part of this is
 
01:39:01.870 --> 01:39:01.880 align:start position:0%
right right now an employer who does
 
01:39:04.589 --> 01:39:04.599 align:start position:0%
advance something to the employee has to
 
01:39:06.430 --> 01:39:06.440 align:start position:0%
get it in writing that they agree to pay
 
01:39:08.550 --> 01:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
it back or I'll take it from their final
 
01:39:11.030 --> 01:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
paycheck uh one of the claims I read was
 
01:39:13.030 --> 01:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
somebody who the employer loaned the
 
01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
employee $1,000 it didn't say why but
 
01:39:18.149 --> 01:39:18.159 align:start position:0%
then wanted to take it from their P
 
01:39:20.350 --> 01:39:20.360 align:start position:0%
final paycheck and because he didn't
 
01:39:21.990 --> 01:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
have the written
 
01:39:24.350 --> 01:39:24.360 align:start position:0%
agreement that you know that so that's
 
01:39:27.109 --> 01:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
that's another bill another time uh
 
01:39:30.430 --> 01:39:30.440 align:start position:0%
maybe next year but for our purpose
 
01:39:34.310 --> 01:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
today um I just think that this this uh
 
01:39:36.750 --> 01:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
protects the workers in these rare
 
01:39:39.189 --> 01:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
circumstances uh where it's no fault of
 
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
their own and I've demonstrated
 
01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
previously that substantial sums of
 
01:39:47.709 --> 01:39:47.719 align:start position:0%
money have been forfeited and uh in
 
01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
those unique
 
01:39:52.910 --> 01:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
circumstances uh with employers of 15 or
 
01:39:55.310 --> 01:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
more which is a small again small number
 
01:39:58.189 --> 01:39:58.199 align:start position:0%
of employers in the state we would like
 
01:39:59.229 --> 01:39:59.239 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:40:04.270 --> 01:40:04.280 align:start position:0%
this thank you further questions for the
 
01:40:06.950 --> 01:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
sponsor seeing none thank you very much
 
01:40:11.270 --> 01:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
thank you I have a handful of cards here
 
01:40:14.189 --> 01:40:14.199 align:start position:0%
uh first up I would ask Gary Abbott of
 
01:40:16.430 --> 01:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
associate general contractors who has
 
01:40:19.950 --> 01:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
signed up opposed to the
 
01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:26.430 align:start position:0%
signed up opposed to the
bill

01:40:26.430 --> 01:40:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman uh labor committee
 
01:40:30.750 --> 01:40:30.760 align:start position:0%
members again for the record my name is
 
01:40:32.750 --> 01:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
Gary Abbott I'm the Executive Vice
 
01:40:35.070 --> 01:40:35.080 align:start position:0%
President of the associated general
 
01:40:37.830 --> 01:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
contractors of New Hampshire uh I know
 
01:40:39.870 --> 01:40:39.880 align:start position:0%
you all are aware we've had similar
 
01:40:43.030 --> 01:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
bills in the past the association's
 
01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
policy has been for me representing them
 
01:40:49.189 --> 01:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
that they want their office policies to
 
01:40:52.310 --> 01:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
dictate their benefit benefits of
 
01:40:54.589 --> 01:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
vacation and sick time however it's
 
01:40:58.270 --> 01:40:58.280 align:start position:0%
drafted for the company uh one of the
 
01:41:00.830 --> 01:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
things that we looked at at this bill as
 
01:41:03.790 --> 01:41:03.800 align:start position:0%
it it is different than previous bills
 
01:41:07.550 --> 01:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
but it still starts to write policy and
 
01:41:09.229 --> 01:41:09.239 align:start position:0%
I think that's what representative
 
01:41:11.470 --> 01:41:11.480 align:start position:0%
kahill's talking about the thing that I
 
01:41:16.310 --> 01:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
noticed in line 12 and 13 it didn't say
 
01:41:18.350 --> 01:41:18.360 align:start position:0%
in accordance with the office policy
 
01:41:20.629 --> 01:41:20.639 align:start position:0%
whether you had to give a a notice of
 
01:41:23.350 --> 01:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
your leaving to be eligible for vacation
 
01:41:25.950 --> 01:41:25.960 align:start position:0%
pay or whatever other conditions many
 
01:41:29.270 --> 01:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
companies ask for a proper notification
 
01:41:31.470 --> 01:41:31.480 align:start position:0%
or things that are contingent on getting
 
01:41:34.669 --> 01:41:34.679 align:start position:0%
those uh vacation pay and other things
 
01:41:37.629 --> 01:41:37.639 align:start position:0%
so it seems to divert away from what the
 
01:41:40.070 --> 01:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
company policy outlines as either the
 
01:41:43.109 --> 01:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
procedure to get it or who qualifies
 
01:41:45.709 --> 01:41:45.719 align:start position:0%
because the company policy really is the
 
01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
legal document that is used by the labor
 
01:41:51.070 --> 01:41:51.080 align:start position:0%
department if there's a contest uh with
 
01:41:52.910 --> 01:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
an employee saying I didn't get paid the
 
01:41:55.390 --> 01:41:55.400 align:start position:0%
proper amount they go look at the
 
01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
employer's policy how does it dictate
 
01:42:02.790 --> 01:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
this still puts in certain things it
 
01:42:04.709 --> 01:42:04.719 align:start position:0%
starts to put in some things that are
 
01:42:06.870 --> 01:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
written into different company policies
 
01:42:09.189 --> 01:42:09.199 align:start position:0%
that are different I mean it sets if
 
01:42:11.229 --> 01:42:11.239 align:start position:0%
you're 15 or more you have to do these
 
01:42:13.870 --> 01:42:13.880 align:start position:0%
certain things so that that's why we're
 
01:42:17.390 --> 01:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
here opposed because it doesn't directly
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
say pursuant to the company policy uh it
 
01:42:23.669 --> 01:42:23.679 align:start position:0%
it starts to impede on that and if you
 
01:42:25.149 --> 01:42:25.159 align:start position:0%
were to make that change it would be
 
01:42:27.310 --> 01:42:27.320 align:start position:0%
better but it still is a little bit of a
 
01:42:29.350 --> 01:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
conflict for me when companies want to
 
01:42:32.950 --> 01:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
use their policy um always a problem is
 
01:42:34.189 --> 01:42:34.199 align:start position:0%
me sitting in the back of the room
 
01:42:36.149 --> 01:42:36.159 align:start position:0%
reading the bill over and over before a
 
01:42:38.030 --> 01:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
hearing and at first I thought I was
 
01:42:40.470 --> 01:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
good with section two and then I read it
 
01:42:43.070 --> 01:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
again because I represent construction
 
01:42:45.270 --> 01:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
we have layoffs every year in
 
01:42:49.149 --> 01:42:49.159 align:start position:0%
construction and the opening of line 18
 
01:42:52.270 --> 01:42:52.280 align:start position:0%
starts with this section shall apply as
 
01:42:55.669 --> 01:42:55.679 align:start position:0%
a result of a layoff well many of the
 
01:42:58.790 --> 01:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
seasonal companies I represent have
 
01:43:01.470 --> 01:43:01.480 align:start position:0%
layoffs they already have the procedures
 
01:43:03.430 --> 01:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
that they follow with the unemployment
 
01:43:07.109 --> 01:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
office they know what meets the law I
 
01:43:09.310 --> 01:43:09.320 align:start position:0%
think the intent and you would have to
 
01:43:12.510 --> 01:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
ask the sponsor is after that sentence
 
01:43:14.589 --> 01:43:14.599 align:start position:0%
in those unusual cases in which a
 
01:43:18.669 --> 01:43:18.679 align:start position:0%
business is sold or goes out of business
 
01:43:21.510 --> 01:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
I would concur after that but not the
 
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
layoff as the trigger um I started to
 
01:43:26.709 --> 01:43:26.719 align:start position:0%
try to come up with terms permanent
 
01:43:29.189 --> 01:43:29.199 align:start position:0%
layoff you know the company closing I
 
01:43:30.830 --> 01:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
think that's what section two is trying
 
01:43:33.390 --> 01:43:33.400 align:start position:0%
to get at which I don't have any issues
 
01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
with because those are where a
 
01:43:37.510 --> 01:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
transaction's happening and I think you
 
01:43:39.510 --> 01:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
want to protect the employee because
 
01:43:41.790 --> 01:43:41.800 align:start position:0%
they're not able to do what the company
 
01:43:44.030 --> 01:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
policy says because it's switching to a
 
01:43:46.910 --> 01:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
new company so I'm I'm not objecting to
 
01:43:49.589 --> 01:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
that notion but I don't want to affect
 
01:43:51.470 --> 01:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
what companies have as their current
 
01:43:53.790 --> 01:43:53.800 align:start position:0%
policy and I I just have trouble with
 
01:43:56.109 --> 01:43:56.119 align:start position:0%
that opening line and just blanket
 
01:43:58.149 --> 01:43:58.159 align:start position:0%
statement uh because there may be
 
01:43:59.910 --> 01:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
companies that carry some of the
 
01:44:03.109 --> 01:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
benefits into the next season as part of
 
01:44:04.870 --> 01:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
encouragement to get them to come back
 
01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
to work for them so I don't want to ruin
 
01:44:08.950 --> 01:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
those things by putting in law that you
 
01:44:10.950 --> 01:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
have to do certain steps that you may
 
01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
not have to now I'm not an expert at
 
01:44:15.709 --> 01:44:15.719 align:start position:0%
every layoff and what the rules and
 
01:44:18.669 --> 01:44:18.679 align:start position:0%
conditions are but that's why we're in
 
01:44:20.709 --> 01:44:20.719 align:start position:0%
opposition I think if it was tailored
 
01:44:23.990 --> 01:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
just to uh where it starts on line 19 if
 
01:44:26.589 --> 01:44:26.599 align:start position:0%
it's a result of a change in company
 
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
that very narrow uh I think we've said
 
01:44:31.750 --> 01:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
this even in previous hearings uh in
 
01:44:34.189 --> 01:44:34.199 align:start position:0%
previous years that if it was to that
 
01:44:37.149 --> 01:44:37.159 align:start position:0%
particular item we understand and then
 
01:44:39.589 --> 01:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
would be able to support the bill for
 
01:44:42.750 --> 01:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
those rare instances that that happens
 
01:44:44.790 --> 01:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
but with that we have some difficulty
 
01:44:46.870 --> 01:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
because it is moving away from the
 
01:44:50.189 --> 01:44:50.199 align:start position:0%
company policy being the the document
 
01:44:51.950 --> 01:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
that the Labor Department goes with and
 
01:44:53.910 --> 01:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
now inserting some things that are
 
01:44:56.709 --> 01:44:56.719 align:start position:0%
mandatory into my policy with that I'd
 
01:44:58.790 --> 01:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
end my testimony and uh take any
 
01:45:00.870 --> 01:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
questions you may have thank you very
 
01:45:03.669 --> 01:45:03.679 align:start position:0%
much are there questions for this
 
01:45:05.910 --> 01:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
witness representative
 
01:45:07.950 --> 01:45:07.960 align:start position:0%
avalani thank you Mr chairman good to
 
01:45:11.109 --> 01:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
see you again Mr Abbott um you you've
 
01:45:13.109 --> 01:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
touched on a couple things um i' I'd
 
01:45:16.629 --> 01:45:16.639 align:start position:0%
like to go back to uh sections 12 to
 
01:45:21.709 --> 01:45:21.719 align:start position:0%
15 um if a company only has one
 
01:45:24.510 --> 01:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
PTO so they acrew at a certain thing is
 
01:45:27.149 --> 01:45:27.159 align:start position:0%
this trying to redefine what earn time
 
01:45:29.070 --> 01:45:29.080 align:start position:0%
vacation vacation time and pay time off
 
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
is and making it separate from sick time
 
01:45:34.629 --> 01:45:34.639 align:start position:0%
and sick days it may be but the real
 
01:45:36.790 --> 01:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
question here is if that's described in
 
01:45:39.830 --> 01:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
my office policies or a company's
 
01:45:43.350 --> 01:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
policies of how it is why do we need
 
01:45:46.510 --> 01:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
this section completely I guess it's
 
01:45:50.189 --> 01:45:50.199 align:start position:0%
the thank you follow Mr chairman follow
 
01:45:51.830 --> 01:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
um and I also agree with you under on
 
01:45:54.790 --> 01:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
line 18 that determination to result of
 
01:45:58.109 --> 01:45:58.119 align:start position:0%
layoff um you represent asphalt
 
01:46:00.830 --> 01:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
companies correct across the board I
 
01:46:04.109 --> 01:46:04.119 align:start position:0%
mean all kinds y um you guys do do use
 
01:46:06.470 --> 01:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
the layoff policy through the year for
 
01:46:07.669 --> 01:46:07.679 align:start position:0%
certain times of the year if it's a
 
01:46:09.870 --> 01:46:09.880 align:start position:0%
rainy season and you guys aren't say
 
01:46:12.189 --> 01:46:12.199 align:start position:0%
Paving till later it's usually winter
 
01:46:14.589 --> 01:46:14.599 align:start position:0%
and Paving you can't pave when it's uh
 
01:46:17.589 --> 01:46:17.599 align:start position:0%
you know below right if you have that if
 
01:46:19.350 --> 01:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
you automatically pay out all of their
 
01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
vacation time all of their PTO time all
 
01:46:23.030 --> 01:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
of their time that's going to affect
 
01:46:25.070 --> 01:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
their ability to to collect um
 
01:46:26.430 --> 01:46:26.440 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance it's going to
 
01:46:28.709 --> 01:46:28.719 align:start position:0%
delay that process even longer well and
 
01:46:31.350 --> 01:46:31.360 align:start position:0%
and I guess that's where I know going
 
01:46:33.550 --> 01:46:33.560 align:start position:0%
back to my office with those employers
 
01:46:35.790 --> 01:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
that may be a problem as I sat here and
 
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
read it I oh we're getting into an area
 
01:46:41.189 --> 01:46:41.199 align:start position:0%
where I'm not so sure I know all of the
 
01:46:43.270 --> 01:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
regs but I don't want to affect it if
 
01:46:46.189 --> 01:46:46.199 align:start position:0%
it's possible not to affect those
 
01:46:48.910 --> 01:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
employers right and my last followup Mr
 
01:46:51.669 --> 01:46:51.679 align:start position:0%
chairman followup question question
 
01:46:54.189 --> 01:46:54.199 align:start position:0%
question um would it also affect the
 
01:46:56.310 --> 01:46:56.320 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance having a large
 
01:46:58.910 --> 01:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
sum paid out before being laid off would
 
01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
it increase the cost of the business
 
01:47:02.350 --> 01:47:02.360 align:start position:0%
saying okay well he's got six weeks
 
01:47:03.870 --> 01:47:03.880 align:start position:0%
vacations we get to pay him now he has a
 
01:47:05.950 --> 01:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
delay in his unemployment it's it's
 
01:47:08.589 --> 01:47:08.599 align:start position:0%
twofold I I'm not really sure okay I'm
 
01:47:11.149 --> 01:47:11.159 align:start position:0%
not really sure what the impact would be
 
01:47:15.430 --> 01:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
um I just know that uh contractors like
 
01:47:17.709 --> 01:47:17.719 align:start position:0%
any other are trying to keep their
 
01:47:20.390 --> 01:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
employees as long as they can extra work
 
01:47:24.229 --> 01:47:24.239 align:start position:0%
you know so um snowplow if they can put
 
01:47:26.270 --> 01:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
the time in they try to work something
 
01:47:29.390 --> 01:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
out so I think times have changed that
 
01:47:32.589 --> 01:47:32.599 align:start position:0%
uh um you know employers try to do as
 
01:47:34.350 --> 01:47:34.360 align:start position:0%
much as they can but for those that have
 
01:47:36.070 --> 01:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
to get laid off I think I don't want to
 
01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:37.430 align:start position:0%
to get laid off I think I don't want to
affect

01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
affect
 
01:47:39.589 --> 01:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
those thank you thank you Mr thank you
 
01:47:42.830 --> 01:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman further
 
01:47:46.709 --> 01:47:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:49.070 --> 01:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
stuff thank you for taking my question
 
01:47:52.109 --> 01:47:52.119 align:start position:0%
Mr Abbott um in the event of an
 
01:47:55.310 --> 01:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
unexpected closure or layoff how would
 
01:47:57.390 --> 01:47:57.400 align:start position:0%
an individual be able to provide
 
01:47:59.310 --> 01:47:59.320 align:start position:0%
notification that they wanted to take
 
01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
their paid or sick leave to the employer
 
01:48:05.750 --> 01:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
if um they were unaware that the B
 
01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
business would be closing moving or that
 
01:48:09.790 --> 01:48:09.800 align:start position:0%
they were being laid off I I think the
 
01:48:11.310 --> 01:48:11.320 align:start position:0%
point you're making is the one that I
 
01:48:14.270 --> 01:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
would say I agree with uh if you were to
 
01:48:17.550 --> 01:48:17.560 align:start position:0%
leave the further point where there was
 
01:48:20.790 --> 01:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh a closure a sale uh some of that
 
01:48:22.310 --> 01:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
effect that the employees did not have
 
01:48:24.270 --> 01:48:24.280 align:start position:0%
their opportunity to take and meet the
 
01:48:26.950 --> 01:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
company policy uh that would be a
 
01:48:30.270 --> 01:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
variable that I would agree with that's
 
01:48:33.229 --> 01:48:33.239 align:start position:0%
in that section two if you get rid of
 
01:48:35.750 --> 01:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
just normal layoffs and describe those
 
01:48:38.270 --> 01:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
situations where your absolutely correct
 
01:48:40.470 --> 01:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
employee did not get the opportunity to
 
01:48:42.910 --> 01:48:42.920 align:start position:0%
request the vacation so therefore they
 
01:48:45.070 --> 01:48:45.080 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be denied it so I'm in
 
01:48:48.229 --> 01:48:48.239 align:start position:0%
agreement with that position I'm trying
 
01:48:50.149 --> 01:48:50.159 align:start position:0%
not to affect all the good business
 
01:48:52.430 --> 01:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
businesses that are going currently and
 
01:48:55.270 --> 01:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
operating successfully thank
 
01:48:57.510 --> 01:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
you further
 
01:48:59.950 --> 01:48:59.960 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
01:49:01.550 --> 01:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
testimony thank
 
01:49:05.510 --> 01:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
you next I would ask David juv of the
 
01:49:08.830 --> 01:49:08.840 align:start position:0%
Bia to speak um he signed up for three
 
01:49:16.109 --> 01:49:16.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:18.510 --> 01:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
bill thank you Mr chair members of the
 
01:49:20.149 --> 01:49:20.159 align:start position:0%
committee again for the record my name
 
01:49:22.070 --> 01:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
my name is Dave ju I'm senior vice
 
01:49:23.870 --> 01:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
president for public policy at the
 
01:49:27.589 --> 01:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
business and industry Association um we
 
01:49:29.750 --> 01:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
are neutral on the bill and I'd like to
 
01:49:31.310 --> 01:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
explain why because I know there will be
 
01:49:32.669 --> 01:49:32.679 align:start position:0%
some people on the committee who might
 
01:49:34.350 --> 01:49:34.360 align:start position:0%
be surprised to hear
 
01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:37.030 align:start position:0%
be surprised to hear
that

01:49:37.030 --> 01:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:49:41.430 --> 01:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
um the primary reason is that this issue
 
01:49:42.910 --> 01:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
of dealing with
 
01:49:46.870 --> 01:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
employees that representative stab so
 
01:49:49.950 --> 01:49:49.960 align:start position:0%
eloquently asked about those individuals
 
01:49:52.669 --> 01:49:52.679 align:start position:0%
that that that have a crude time they
 
01:49:54.430 --> 01:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
may have been planning to take vacation
 
01:49:58.229 --> 01:49:58.239 align:start position:0%
over the summer who knows but through no
 
01:50:02.950 --> 01:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
fault of their own were um denied the
 
01:50:05.709 --> 01:50:05.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do that that there should
 
01:50:07.229 --> 01:50:07.239 align:start position:0%
be some
 
01:50:09.790 --> 01:50:09.800 align:start position:0%
recognition the reason we're neutral on
 
01:50:11.350 --> 01:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
this is because I'm the one who
 
01:50:14.270 --> 01:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
suggested that idea to representative K
 
01:50:16.990 --> 01:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
Hill as a starting point for this bill
 
01:50:19.270 --> 01:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
and I felt it would be bad form to have
 
01:50:21.390 --> 01:50:21.400 align:start position:0%
suggested that but then oppose
 
01:50:25.750 --> 01:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
it um I think that the number of
 
01:50:28.310 --> 01:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
employers that would be impacted by this
 
01:50:31.830 --> 01:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
is very small it's uh 15 or more
 
01:50:35.750 --> 01:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
employees and it's the bills written um
 
01:50:38.149 --> 01:50:38.159 align:start position:0%
only would affect those that that where
 
01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
the business is being sold and and those
 
01:50:43.709 --> 01:50:43.719 align:start position:0%
acred time are not passed on to the new
 
01:50:48.030 --> 01:50:48.040 align:start position:0%
employer or there is a uh layoff and the
 
01:50:50.589 --> 01:50:50.599 align:start position:0%
uh individual had no notice of that
 
01:50:53.149 --> 01:50:53.159 align:start position:0%
happening I I think there does need to
 
01:50:56.950 --> 01:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
be some tightening up uh I think uh Gary
 
01:50:59.750 --> 01:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
Abbott made some good points I don't
 
01:51:02.750 --> 01:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
know what the solution is um I think it
 
01:51:05.350 --> 01:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
might be worthwhile having um a
 
01:51:06.550 --> 01:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
discussion with the Department of
 
01:51:08.470 --> 01:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
Employment Security to get their
 
01:51:11.390 --> 01:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
thoughts on it um I mean one option
 
01:51:13.229 --> 01:51:13.239 align:start position:0%
would be to just eliminate that
 
01:51:15.709 --> 01:51:15.719 align:start position:0%
provision entirely but if there's some
 
01:51:16.790 --> 01:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
way of
 
01:51:20.229 --> 01:51:20.239 align:start position:0%
capturing those individuals who are who
 
01:51:23.910 --> 01:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
are subject to a layoff that is not part
 
01:51:26.510 --> 01:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
of a seasonal work
 
01:51:28.550 --> 01:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
agreement then I think it should be
 
01:51:30.750 --> 01:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
explored the reason we're not supporting
 
01:51:34.189 --> 01:51:34.199 align:start position:0%
the bill is that there are um issues
 
01:51:36.629 --> 01:51:36.639 align:start position:0%
again uh Gary Abbott was very eloquent
 
01:51:39.510 --> 01:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
in in stating these
 
01:51:43.750 --> 01:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
um I believe most employers it's in
 
01:51:45.390 --> 01:51:45.400 align:start position:0%
their best interest to have their
 
01:51:48.189 --> 01:51:48.199 align:start position:0%
vacation and sick time policies uh
 
01:51:50.790 --> 01:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
clearly articulated and written down as
 
01:51:54.069 --> 01:51:54.079 align:start position:0%
a part of the employee um employee
 
01:51:56.510 --> 01:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
manual if they
 
01:51:59.950 --> 01:51:59.960 align:start position:0%
don't all kinds of uh confusion and and
 
01:52:01.990 --> 01:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
bad things can occur so I would hope
 
01:52:05.229 --> 01:52:05.239 align:start position:0%
that most employers do this whether the
 
01:52:07.830 --> 01:52:07.840 align:start position:0%
state needs to be dictating to employers
 
01:52:11.030 --> 01:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
that they do this is is perhaps another
 
01:52:13.589 --> 01:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
question um we've already talked about
 
01:52:17.149 --> 01:52:17.159 align:start position:0%
the uh section having that uh added the
 
01:52:17.159 --> 01:52:18.589 align:start position:0%
the uh section having that uh added the
um

01:52:18.589 --> 01:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:23.229 --> 01:52:23.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:25.589 --> 01:52:25.599 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the employer's practice or
 
01:52:27.870 --> 01:52:27.880 align:start position:0%
policy I I do actually think that's
 
01:52:30.830 --> 01:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
important to have that added um
 
01:52:32.310 --> 01:52:32.320 align:start position:0%
representative love was asking I think
 
01:52:35.550 --> 01:52:35.560 align:start position:0%
for examples of of if you don't have
 
01:52:37.669 --> 01:52:37.679 align:start position:0%
that where confusion could be created
 
01:52:39.470 --> 01:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
and I'll give you an example the company
 
01:52:44.470 --> 01:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
I work for has paid vacation time um
 
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
it's a use it or lose it type of
 
01:52:49.390 --> 01:52:49.400 align:start position:0%
arrangement meaning if I don't use the
 
01:52:51.350 --> 01:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
amount of paid time that I have accured
 
01:52:53.470 --> 01:52:53.480 align:start position:0%
by the end of the year I lose it and we
 
01:52:56.750 --> 01:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
start fresh on January 1st by not
 
01:52:58.669 --> 01:52:58.679 align:start position:0%
including that language in here it
 
01:53:01.510 --> 01:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
leaves some confusion about whether
 
01:53:04.510 --> 01:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
employees are entitled to be compensated
 
01:53:07.669 --> 01:53:07.679 align:start position:0%
for that time or not so I think it is a
 
01:53:11.750 --> 01:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
good idea to add that the other um
 
01:53:13.390 --> 01:53:13.400 align:start position:0%
problem that will be
 
01:53:16.470 --> 01:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
created um I think it is limited but it
 
01:53:19.310 --> 01:53:19.320 align:start position:0%
will be a problem for some employers is
 
01:53:21.830 --> 01:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
those that don't articulate or stipulate
 
01:53:23.830 --> 01:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
the difference between vacation time and
 
01:53:26.270 --> 01:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
sick time some just have a personal time
 
01:53:29.350 --> 01:53:29.360 align:start position:0%
off policy and you use it if you're not
 
01:53:32.950 --> 01:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
feeling well you use it if your um uh
 
01:53:34.990 --> 01:53:35.000 align:start position:0%
child is not feeling well you use it if
 
01:53:36.149 --> 01:53:36.159 align:start position:0%
you're going on
 
01:53:36.159 --> 01:53:37.910 align:start position:0%
you're going on
vacation

01:53:37.910 --> 01:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
vacation
 
01:53:41.310 --> 01:53:41.320 align:start position:0%
and it's going to be confusing for those
 
01:53:44.950 --> 01:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
companies to understand how to implement
 
01:53:48.069 --> 01:53:48.079 align:start position:0%
this um bill again I would point to you
 
01:53:49.589 --> 01:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a relatively small
 
01:53:52.750 --> 01:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
number number of employers here but they
 
01:53:54.870 --> 01:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
do exist another example with some
 
01:53:56.870 --> 01:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
employers that is becoming
 
01:53:59.870 --> 01:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
increasingly um common especially in
 
01:54:04.229 --> 01:54:04.239 align:start position:0%
tech jobs is to not have any uh vacation
 
01:54:08.350 --> 01:54:08.360 align:start position:0%
or sick time at all that is acred the
 
01:54:11.629 --> 01:54:11.639 align:start position:0%
it's up to the individual employee to to
 
01:54:15.069 --> 01:54:15.079 align:start position:0%
use their work time uh wisely and see
 
01:54:16.990 --> 01:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
benefit and the employer understands
 
01:54:18.229 --> 01:54:18.239 align:start position:0%
that from time to time they're going to
 
01:54:20.589 --> 01:54:20.599 align:start position:0%
be taking time off if they're sick or
 
01:54:23.229 --> 01:54:23.239 align:start position:0%
vacation time uh but it's not something
 
01:54:26.229 --> 01:54:26.239 align:start position:0%
that is tracked relatively small number
 
01:54:29.669 --> 01:54:29.679 align:start position:0%
of employers but but they do exist so
 
01:54:32.229 --> 01:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
because because there are these issues
 
01:54:34.189 --> 01:54:34.199 align:start position:0%
uh representing employers that that are
 
01:54:36.870 --> 01:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
real we couldn't really support this
 
01:54:40.750 --> 01:54:40.760 align:start position:0%
bill either we thought that the um
 
01:54:43.709 --> 01:54:43.719 align:start position:0%
sponsor was making a good faith effort
 
01:54:47.229 --> 01:54:47.239 align:start position:0%
to try and do what is fair for a for a
 
01:54:48.669 --> 01:54:48.679 align:start position:0%
small number of
 
01:54:51.709 --> 01:54:51.719 align:start position:0%
employees uh those that have acred time
 
01:54:53.589 --> 01:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
and then never had the opportunity to
 
01:54:57.270 --> 01:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
use it because of an adverse um experi
 
01:55:00.229 --> 01:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
an adverse situation with their employer
 
01:55:02.069 --> 01:55:02.079 align:start position:0%
happy to don't know if I kept my three
 
01:55:03.550 --> 01:55:03.560 align:start position:0%
minutes I might not have but I'm happy
 
01:55:05.510 --> 01:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions thank you very
 
01:55:08.310 --> 01:55:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:10.470 --> 01:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
questions presentative
 
01:55:12.830 --> 01:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
Avalon thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:55:16.189 --> 01:55:16.199 align:start position:0%
Mr Jupe for taking my questions um the
 
01:55:18.310 --> 01:55:18.320 align:start position:0%
same questions I gave Mr Abbott U it
 
01:55:21.270 --> 01:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
looked section two looks they're
 
01:55:25.030 --> 01:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
redefining earn time PTO into wages due
 
01:55:28.270 --> 01:55:28.280 align:start position:0%
when leaving sick time as a outlier uh
 
01:55:33.189 --> 01:55:33.199 align:start position:0%
similar the answer is yes um again I'm
 
01:55:38.350 --> 01:55:38.360 align:start position:0%
not sure section one is necessary to do
 
01:55:40.589 --> 01:55:40.599 align:start position:0%
what the sponsor really wants to do with
 
01:55:43.629 --> 01:55:43.639 align:start position:0%
this bill um I think it creates as many
 
01:55:46.550 --> 01:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
problems as is possibly situations it's
 
01:55:48.629 --> 01:55:48.639 align:start position:0%
trying to to correct but but the answer
 
01:55:50.510 --> 01:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
to your question is yes some employers
 
01:55:52.870 --> 01:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
are not either not going to understand
 
01:55:55.229 --> 01:55:55.239 align:start position:0%
how to do that or it conflicts with what
 
01:55:59.629 --> 01:55:59.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:03.669 --> 01:56:03.679 align:start position:0%
is um so the we know section one is an
 
01:56:06.550 --> 01:56:06.560 align:start position:0%
issue um through
 
01:56:09.589 --> 01:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
your Bia how many employers do you have
 
01:56:11.149 --> 01:56:11.159 align:start position:0%
that are above 15 employees at this
 
01:56:14.950 --> 01:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
would fact it it's not 100 it's not 100%
 
01:56:17.189 --> 01:56:17.199 align:start position:0%
we have many surprising to some we have
 
01:56:20.790 --> 01:56:20.800 align:start position:0%
a number of small uh business businesses
 
01:56:22.990 --> 01:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
um that would have less than 15
 
01:56:25.069 --> 01:56:25.079 align:start position:0%
employees off the top of my head and
 
01:56:26.750 --> 01:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
this is a bit of a guess I would say
 
01:56:31.229 --> 01:56:31.239 align:start position:0%
it's possibly 20% of our membership so
 
01:56:34.510 --> 01:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
you follow so it's mostly smaller micro
 
01:56:37.709 --> 01:56:37.719 align:start position:0%
businesses that would not be affected by
 
01:56:41.790 --> 01:56:41.800 align:start position:0%
this yeah I I don't know that that uh
 
01:56:44.629 --> 01:56:44.639 align:start position:0%
businesses of 14 employees or less would
 
01:56:48.470 --> 01:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
be impacted by it at all thank
 
01:56:54.589 --> 01:56:54.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:57.629 --> 01:56:57.639 align:start position:0%
svin I'm trying to address actually what
 
01:57:00.870 --> 01:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Abbott U mentioned as you did as
 
01:57:06.270 --> 01:57:06.280 align:start position:0%
well if um and Mr Abbott ought to
 
01:57:09.390 --> 01:57:09.400 align:start position:0%
listen he's not going to
 
01:57:13.750 --> 01:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
um dealing with section two again um in
 
01:57:16.629 --> 01:57:16.639 align:start position:0%
addressing the uh the layoff issue if
 
01:57:20.030 --> 01:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
the um word unanticipated was inserted
 
01:57:23.109 --> 01:57:23.119 align:start position:0%
before layoff would that uh address the
 
01:57:26.709 --> 01:57:26.719 align:start position:0%
problem I uh excellent question possibly
 
01:57:29.870 --> 01:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
an excellent suggestion um I think it
 
01:57:31.350 --> 01:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
would help but again I think it would
 
01:57:33.430 --> 01:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
benefit hearing from Employment Security
 
01:57:36.629 --> 01:57:36.639 align:start position:0%
exp if if the committee wants feels like
 
01:57:39.069 --> 01:57:39.079 align:start position:0%
there's a a germ of a good idea here but
 
01:57:41.149 --> 01:57:41.159 align:start position:0%
we want to be careful of unintended
 
01:57:43.030 --> 01:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
consequences might be worth getting
 
01:57:45.709 --> 01:57:45.719 align:start position:0%
their impact explaining to them what the
 
01:57:47.430 --> 01:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
conflict is and getting their
 
01:57:49.629 --> 01:57:49.639 align:start position:0%
suggestions on how best to move forward
 
01:57:49.639 --> 01:57:50.790 align:start position:0%
suggestions on how best to move forward
thank

01:57:50.790 --> 01:57:50.800 align:start position:0%

minute good morning Mr chairman and
 
01:58:16.589 --> 01:58:16.599 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
01:58:17.950 --> 01:58:17.960 align:start position:0%
my name is Katherine heck and I
 
01:58:19.589 --> 01:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire municipal
 
01:58:22.430 --> 01:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
Association the 234 cities and towns in
 
01:58:24.350 --> 01:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I will preface by
 
01:58:27.229 --> 01:58:27.239 align:start position:0%
saying the next person to testify um
 
01:58:29.430 --> 01:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
will have a much more detailed testimony
 
01:58:31.109 --> 01:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
and we don't want to waste your time or
 
01:58:34.950 --> 01:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
be redundant in any way my um I serve in
 
01:58:36.629 --> 01:58:36.639 align:start position:0%
the role of the government Finance
 
01:58:39.109 --> 01:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
adviser so I help cities and towns with
 
01:58:41.830 --> 01:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
all types of Finance questions and
 
01:58:44.750 --> 01:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
Taxation and my testimony while we
 
01:58:47.870 --> 01:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
believe that this already exists in law
 
01:58:49.669 --> 01:58:49.679 align:start position:0%
and these protections already exist in
 
01:58:51.990 --> 01:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
current law as they're written I did
 
01:58:53.510 --> 01:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
want to draw your attention to the
 
01:58:56.750 --> 01:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal note um well we had
 
01:58:59.069 --> 01:58:59.079 align:start position:0%
indeterminable increase in expenditures
 
01:59:01.750 --> 01:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
at the local level um the methodology
 
01:59:05.109 --> 01:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
would be the same as the states so this
 
01:59:08.589 --> 01:59:08.599 align:start position:0%
bill if passed as written um and I do
 
01:59:09.510 --> 01:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
understand there's some discussion
 
01:59:11.030 --> 01:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
around amendments and we certainly
 
01:59:12.830 --> 01:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate that the sponsor has um
 
01:59:14.310 --> 01:59:14.320 align:start position:0%
brought back a different version of this
 
01:59:16.870 --> 01:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
bill to address some of our concerns but
 
01:59:20.030 --> 01:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
when we set our budgets our local tax
 
01:59:22.109 --> 01:59:22.119 align:start position:0%
taxpayers the budget itself is what
 
01:59:24.270 --> 01:59:24.280 align:start position:0%
you're taxed on not what you spend but
 
01:59:26.430 --> 01:59:26.440 align:start position:0%
what the approved budget is and we would
 
01:59:29.870 --> 01:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
have to budget to maximum exposure based
 
01:59:32.270 --> 01:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
on on this so that is passing that along
 
01:59:34.629 --> 01:59:34.639 align:start position:0%
to the taxpayer currently our practice
 
01:59:37.430 --> 01:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
and again um Mr Iran will will testify
 
01:59:39.149 --> 01:59:39.159 align:start position:0%
to how the budget process works in his
 
01:59:41.470 --> 01:59:41.480 align:start position:0%
community so he can be more specific but
 
01:59:43.990 --> 01:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
you you look at your highest liabilities
 
01:59:45.669 --> 01:59:45.679 align:start position:0%
and that's the budget you set set
 
01:59:48.030 --> 01:59:48.040 align:start position:0%
forward so we are concerned that not
 
01:59:49.910 --> 01:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
only is this already
 
01:59:52.350 --> 01:59:52.360 align:start position:0%
codified in law these protections for
 
01:59:54.310 --> 01:59:54.320 align:start position:0%
our employees but that we would have to
 
01:59:56.470 --> 01:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
be increasing our budget just as the
 
01:59:58.950 --> 01:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
state would and carry that on in order
 
02:00:01.550 --> 02:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
to be in comp full compliance for
 
02:00:05.750 --> 02:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
basically um our what if situations um
 
02:00:07.709 --> 02:00:07.719 align:start position:0%
and of course if it's not used then we
 
02:00:09.189 --> 02:00:09.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have that impact it would go
 
02:00:10.830 --> 02:00:10.840 align:start position:0%
into fund balance and could be returned
 
02:00:12.870 --> 02:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
to the taxpayers at a later date but
 
02:00:14.510 --> 02:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
again it would affect that local tax
 
02:00:17.350 --> 02:00:17.360 align:start position:0%
bill um again I won't waste any of your
 
02:00:20.109 --> 02:00:20.119 align:start position:0%
time again I will let Mr Irv talk about
 
02:00:21.830 --> 02:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
his points um but I'll certainly
 
02:00:23.990 --> 02:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
entertain any questions thank you very
 
02:00:25.910 --> 02:00:25.920 align:start position:0%

02:00:29.589 --> 02:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
witness represent Granger uh thank you
 
02:00:31.149 --> 02:00:31.159 align:start position:0%
um you you say that the protections are
 
02:00:34.069 --> 02:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
already in law do you know where um yes
 
02:00:36.030 --> 02:00:36.040 align:start position:0%
um and again Mr Irvine will hand you out
 
02:00:37.990 --> 02:00:38.000 align:start position:0%

today please accept this testimony in
 
02:01:35.149 --> 02:01:35.159 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill 1178 which we
 
02:01:36.870 --> 02:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
would Doge this committee to find his
 
02:01:38.709 --> 02:01:38.719 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to
 
02:01:41.390 --> 02:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
legislate this bill ignores the reality
 
02:01:43.629 --> 02:01:43.639 align:start position:0%
that every employer has the right and
 
02:01:46.109 --> 02:01:46.119 align:start position:0%
ability to craft a benefits package that
 
02:01:48.149 --> 02:01:48.159 align:start position:0%
meets the needs of the employer the
 
02:01:51.229 --> 02:01:51.239 align:start position:0%
employees and their customers current
 
02:01:53.030 --> 02:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
legislation requires an employer to
 
02:01:55.149 --> 02:01:55.159 align:start position:0%
adhere to their policies and procedures
 
02:01:57.430 --> 02:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
as they relate to that benefits package
 
02:01:59.229 --> 02:01:59.239 align:start position:0%
and provides a mechanism through the
 
02:02:01.430 --> 02:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor for an employee to
 
02:02:03.990 --> 02:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
seek redress when an employer violates
 
02:02:05.350 --> 02:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
the terms of
 
02:02:08.310 --> 02:02:08.320 align:start position:0%
employment there is nothing in this bill
 
02:02:10.430 --> 02:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
that provides protections that do not
 
02:02:12.990 --> 02:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
already exist in statute thereby
 
02:02:16.629 --> 02:02:16.639 align:start position:0%
rendering this legislation redundant

committee's attention that in a very

competitive employment Market employers
 
02:05:08.310 --> 02:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
have amended their benefit packages to
 
02:05:10.910 --> 02:05:10.920 align:start position:0%

differentiate between the various types

to as paid time off HB 1178 does not
 
02:05:27.189 --> 02:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
make any allowance for these practices
 
02:05:30.390 --> 02:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
taking a one-size fits-all approach we
 
02:05:33.709 --> 02:05:33.719 align:start position:0%
would respectfully submit the HB 1178 is
 
02:05:36.189 --> 02:05:36.199 align:start position:0%
not a solution in search of a problem
 
02:05:38.470 --> 02:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
but rather a solution to a problem that
 
02:05:41.069 --> 02:05:41.079 align:start position:0%
has already been resolved thank you for
 
02:05:43.430 --> 02:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
your consideration of my testimony we
 
02:05:46.109 --> 02:05:46.119 align:start position:0%
again urge the committee to find HP 1178
 
02:05:48.830 --> 02:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
and expedient to legislate thank thank
 
02:05:50.589 --> 02:05:50.599 align:start position:0%
you very much are there questions for
 
02:05:50.599 --> 02:05:52.350 align:start position:0%
you very much are there questions for
this

02:05:52.350 --> 02:05:52.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:05:54.470 --> 02:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
we representative
 
02:05:56.830 --> 02:05:56.840 align:start position:0%
alalani thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:05:59.750 --> 02:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr Irvine for taking the question
 
02:06:02.870 --> 02:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
what the what policy does the uh town of
 
02:06:06.790 --> 02:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
Northwood do for uh paytime off so we
 
02:06:09.109 --> 02:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
have currently an acrew
 
02:06:12.790 --> 02:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
system and upon
 
02:06:16.229 --> 02:06:16.239 align:start position:0%
separation uh you are paid for your
 
02:06:20.990 --> 02:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:23.109 --> 02:06:23.119 align:start position:0%
and for budgeting purposes we have an
 
02:06:26.430 --> 02:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
Expendable trust fund um currently we
 
02:06:31.109 --> 02:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
have a total exposure in the region of
 
02:06:33.270 --> 02:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
$85 to
 
02:06:35.790 --> 02:06:35.800 align:start position:0%
90,000 uh the Expendable trust fund is
 
02:06:38.750 --> 02:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
funded at approximately 20% of that
 
02:06:42.149 --> 02:06:42.159 align:start position:0%
exposure um as Miss HEC um previously
 
02:06:44.910 --> 02:06:44.920 align:start position:0%
alluded to we would have to look at
 
02:06:47.870 --> 02:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
increasing the Expendable trust fund to
 
02:06:50.910 --> 02:06:50.920 align:start position:0%
100% exposure and the only way to
 
02:06:53.149 --> 02:06:53.159 align:start position:0%
achieve that is to go to the property
 
02:06:57.950 --> 02:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:02.030 --> 02:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
monies thank you any other questions
 
02:07:02.040 --> 02:07:04.790 align:start position:0%
monies thank you any other questions
representative

02:07:04.790 --> 02:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:07.229 --> 02:07:07.239 align:start position:0%
stop thank you for taking my question
 
02:07:10.229 --> 02:07:10.239 align:start position:0%
mrvine um one of the things that we're
 
02:07:13.109 --> 02:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
looking at um is protecting people who
 
02:07:15.430 --> 02:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
might show up for work one day and find
 
02:07:16.790 --> 02:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
a sign on the door saying that the
 
02:07:18.950 --> 02:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
business is closed or get get called
 
02:07:22.109 --> 02:07:22.119 align:start position:0%
into the cafeteria and learn that the U
 
02:07:24.430 --> 02:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
business has been sold
 
02:07:28.229 --> 02:07:28.239 align:start position:0%
um can you think of uh some kind of a an
 
02:07:30.390 --> 02:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
an an analogous situation that would
 
02:07:33.629 --> 02:07:33.639 align:start position:0%
happen in a municipal government that
 
02:07:35.750 --> 02:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
you know someone would show up for work
 
02:07:38.310 --> 02:07:38.320 align:start position:0%
and find that the town of Northwood is
 
02:07:41.270 --> 02:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
closed for business and or has been sold
 
02:07:43.510 --> 02:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
to um
 
02:07:43.520 --> 02:07:46.430 align:start position:0%
to um
[Laughter]

02:07:46.430 --> 02:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:07:50.629 --> 02:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um certainly there there
 
02:07:55.510 --> 02:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
have been instances um not locally but
 
02:07:57.390 --> 02:07:57.400 align:start position:0%
there have been instances in the
 
02:08:00.390 --> 02:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
municipal world where towns have gone
 
02:08:04.069 --> 02:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
bankrupt um and so yes there there could
 
02:08:05.549 --> 02:08:05.559 align:start position:0%
be the
 
02:08:09.510 --> 02:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
potential um for someone to show up at
 
02:08:14.430 --> 02:08:14.440 align:start position:0%
work um if you had a and this is purely
 
02:08:17.390 --> 02:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
hypothetical but if you had multiple
 
02:08:20.549 --> 02:08:20.559 align:start position:0%
years of default budgets where your
 
02:08:23.629 --> 02:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
operating budget did not keep up with
 
02:08:26.709 --> 02:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
inflation then is you could potentially
 
02:08:29.510 --> 02:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
get to a situation where the town has to
 
02:08:32.229 --> 02:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
look at cutting services and so instead
 
02:08:36.149 --> 02:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
of having four or five plow drivers you
 
02:08:38.629 --> 02:08:38.639 align:start position:0%
decide we can only afford to have
 
02:08:43.990 --> 02:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
two um so there are extreme
 
02:08:46.830 --> 02:08:46.840 align:start position:0%
circumstances um where that would happen
 
02:08:48.990 --> 02:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
but as I I pointed out
 
02:08:51.910 --> 02:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
in that world in the private sector of a
 
02:08:54.470 --> 02:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
business closing unexpectedly or
 
02:08:56.750 --> 02:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
transferring ownership the protections
 
02:08:59.589 --> 02:08:59.599 align:start position:0%
already exist that say the employees
 
02:09:03.830 --> 02:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
acrw time shall not go away they have
 
02:09:05.910 --> 02:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
that right and they have the the
 
02:09:08.189 --> 02:09:08.199 align:start position:0%
mechanism through the Department of
 
02:09:11.109 --> 02:09:11.119 align:start position:0%
Labor um to seek
 
02:09:14.910 --> 02:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
redress and as previously um articulated
 
02:09:17.750 --> 02:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
by previous speakers the first thing the
 
02:09:20.709 --> 02:09:20.719 align:start position:0%
department l is going to do is look at
 
02:09:22.870 --> 02:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
the policies and procedures under which
 
02:09:25.629 --> 02:09:25.639 align:start position:0%
the employee was hired and they will
 
02:09:28.830 --> 02:09:28.840 align:start position:0%
always defer and give the benefit of the
 
02:09:30.549 --> 02:09:30.559 align:start position:0%
doubt to the
 
02:09:32.910 --> 02:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
employee in every instance where the
 
02:09:34.950 --> 02:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor has come in and
 
02:09:38.189 --> 02:09:38.199 align:start position:0%
looked at a wage concern they will
 
02:09:40.189 --> 02:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
always give the benefit of doubt if
 
02:09:42.270 --> 02:09:42.280 align:start position:0%
there is any confusion in what is being
 
02:09:44.629 --> 02:09:44.639 align:start position:0%
articulated in those policies and
 
02:09:47.310 --> 02:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
procedures to the
 
02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:52.510 align:start position:0%
procedures to the
employee

02:09:52.510 --> 02:09:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:54.229 --> 02:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
any further
 
02:09:56.470 --> 02:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
02:09:57.910 --> 02:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony my pleasure
 
02:10:00.510 --> 02:10:00.520 align:start position:0%

02:10:16.870 --> 02:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
the late card Mr chairman I arrived a
 
02:10:19.310 --> 02:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
little late and glad to be before your
 
02:10:21.189 --> 02:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
committee again for the record my name
 
02:10:23.709 --> 02:10:23.719 align:start position:0%
is Bruce berky and I am the state
 
02:10:25.669 --> 02:10:25.679 align:start position:0%
director for the national Federation of
 
02:10:27.510 --> 02:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
Independent Business or
 
02:10:30.149 --> 02:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
nfib and you've heard some very good
 
02:10:32.430 --> 02:10:32.440 align:start position:0%
testimony here this morning uh relative
 
02:10:33.870 --> 02:10:33.880 align:start position:0%
to HB
 
02:10:36.870 --> 02:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
1178 and I just wanted I won't repeat it
 
02:10:40.350 --> 02:10:40.360 align:start position:0%
it's it it was that good um but I I
 
02:10:43.470 --> 02:10:43.480 align:start position:0%
guess one question and then uh a
 
02:10:46.069 --> 02:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
statement uh and maybe not even a
 
02:10:48.709 --> 02:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
question but online for it talks about
 
02:10:51.790 --> 02:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
an employer that employs 15 or more
 
02:10:53.790 --> 02:10:53.800 align:start position:0%
employees uh one of the questions I
 
02:10:57.390 --> 02:10:57.400 align:start position:0%
guess I would have would be is that 15
 
02:11:01.470 --> 02:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
people or 15 FTE full full-time
 
02:11:03.750 --> 02:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
employees and so you know you could have
 
02:11:06.030 --> 02:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
25 employees that would be the
 
02:11:09.709 --> 02:11:09.719 align:start position:0%
equivalent of 15 full-time employees and
 
02:11:13.310 --> 02:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
so I think that that would be um needed
 
02:11:17.189 --> 02:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
to be further defined uh with respect to
 
02:11:19.149 --> 02:11:19.159 align:start position:0%
that number and representing the over
 
02:11:21.870 --> 02:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
1,400 small businesses in New Hampshire
 
02:11:24.830 --> 02:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
that are members of nfib across the
 
02:11:27.709 --> 02:11:27.719 align:start position:0%
state um we would recommend that you
 
02:11:31.149 --> 02:11:31.159 align:start position:0%
increase that number from 15 to 50 um
 
02:11:33.030 --> 02:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
making it consistent with some other
 
02:11:34.390 --> 02:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
laws that are on the
 
02:11:37.470 --> 02:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
books um if if this bill were to go
 
02:11:40.030 --> 02:11:40.040 align:start position:0%
forward but we do not recommend that the
 
02:11:41.750 --> 02:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
bill go forward we're concerned about
 
02:11:43.870 --> 02:11:43.880 align:start position:0%
the Mandate that's built into the into
 
02:11:47.270 --> 02:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
the bill um basically telling employers
 
02:11:49.510 --> 02:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
how to manage their business how to
 
02:11:51.870 --> 02:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
manage their relationship with their
 
02:11:54.990 --> 02:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
employees and we think that that should
 
02:11:57.069 --> 02:11:57.079 align:start position:0%
remain with the employer and the
 
02:11:59.790 --> 02:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
employee and not be driven by the state
 
02:12:01.430 --> 02:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire so with that Mr
 
02:12:04.189 --> 02:12:04.199 align:start position:0%
chairman I'll conclude my remarks and
 
02:12:06.910 --> 02:12:06.920 align:start position:0%
happy to try and address any questions
 
02:12:10.510 --> 02:12:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:13.470 --> 02:12:13.480 align:start position:0%
questions I don't see any so thank you
 
02:12:15.830 --> 02:12:15.840 align:start position:0%

02:12:18.350 --> 02:12:18.360 align:start position:0%

attorneys and I believe we have a
question

02:13:13.790 --> 02:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
question

02:13:27.480 --> 02:13:28.990 align:start position:0%
specifically referencing lab
03.03

02:13:28.990 --> 02:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
03.03
 
02:13:35.310 --> 02:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
um you usually to get into your rules
 
02:13:39.350 --> 02:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
but could we get a list of your
 
02:13:43.589 --> 02:13:43.599 align:start position:0%
rules uh absolutely you're asking for a
 
02:13:46.069 --> 02:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
coffee just to clarify as opposed to me
 
02:13:48.510 --> 02:13:48.520 align:start position:0%
reciting the rules today I would I would
 
02:13:51.470 --> 02:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
think that would be all of us would like
 
02:13:54.470 --> 02:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
that but if you would like to um expound
 
02:13:58.990 --> 02:13:59.000 align:start position:0%
on 8303 in the 80303 80303 if give me
 
02:14:00.350 --> 02:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
one second I'm going to go pull my cell
 
02:14:02.709 --> 02:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
phone which I have it pulled up on okay
 
02:14:16.870 --> 02:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:16.880 --> 02:14:21.229 align:start position:0%
 
perfect

02:14:21.229 --> 02:14:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:22.549 --> 02:14:22.559 align:start position:0%
if the committee would just grant me
 
02:14:24.149 --> 02:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
just a minute or two because I was
 
02:14:27.950 --> 02:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:46.870 --> 02:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:46.880 --> 02:15:05.629 align:start position:0%
 
Indulgence

02:15:05.629 --> 02:15:05.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:08.390 --> 02:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
and I wrote down the reference as 80303
 
02:15:08.400 --> 02:15:16.629 align:start position:0%
and I wrote down the reference as 80303
C

02:15:16.629 --> 02:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:19.709 --> 02:15:19.719 align:start position:0%
correct okay and
 
02:15:23.990 --> 02:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
D he cites both um C and D in his
 
02:15:27.149 --> 02:15:27.159 align:start position:0%
testimony I have them pulled
 
02:15:30.229 --> 02:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
up um what did you have a specific
 
02:15:31.990 --> 02:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
02:15:36.430 --> 02:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
avalani yes is is this bill already in
 
02:15:39.750 --> 02:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
8303 keeping in mind that the labor
 
02:15:42.910 --> 02:15:42.920 align:start position:0%
rules are there to fill in some
 
02:15:44.709 --> 02:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
explanations fill in some of the blanks
 
02:15:46.189 --> 02:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
but they are not
 
02:15:49.669 --> 02:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
statutory um we we do not if if there is
 
02:15:52.589 --> 02:15:52.599 align:start position:0%
a statutory provision that contradicts a
 
02:15:54.870 --> 02:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
labor rule the statute obviously
 
02:15:57.990 --> 02:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
prevails so these were put in place to
 
02:16:01.189 --> 02:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
help explain that which is not maybe
 
02:16:03.270 --> 02:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
perfectly clear within the statute but
 
02:16:05.830 --> 02:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
has to be altered if the statute changes
 
02:16:07.790 --> 02:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
so I just want to make that point
 
02:16:14.229 --> 02:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
clear um so in C we have
 
02:16:16.790 --> 02:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
um this is a notification that goes to
 
02:16:18.870 --> 02:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
employees with resp effect to change in
 
02:16:20.910 --> 02:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
pay rates that goes underneath the
 
02:16:23.510 --> 02:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
notification statute and they are
 
02:16:25.830 --> 02:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
required to provide those notifications
 
02:16:27.510 --> 02:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
these are things that are determined
 
02:16:29.310 --> 02:16:29.320 align:start position:0%
also during inspections that are done
 
02:16:31.069 --> 02:16:31.079 align:start position:0%
wage and hour inspections as to whether
 
02:16:33.270 --> 02:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
or not proper notifications have been
 
02:16:35.669 --> 02:16:35.679 align:start position:0%
made to the employees notifications are
 
02:16:37.589 --> 02:16:37.599 align:start position:0%
supposed to be in writing and they tend
 
02:16:41.190 --> 02:16:41.200 align:start position:0%
to come up as pay stub changes or a
 
02:16:44.150 --> 02:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
document that specifically states that
 
02:16:48.230 --> 02:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
John Smith is now having his pay of $15
 
02:16:50.830 --> 02:16:50.840 align:start position:0%
increase to $115.50 effective on such
 
02:16:52.750 --> 02:16:52.760 align:start position:0%
and such a date and signed by the
 
02:16:55.990 --> 02:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
employer and possibly the employee so
 
02:16:57.910 --> 02:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
that is covered on that
 
02:17:00.589 --> 02:17:00.599 align:start position:0%
aspect um and it has to be done prior to
 
02:17:02.509 --> 02:17:02.519 align:start position:0%
the date of the change it can't be done
 
02:17:04.589 --> 02:17:04.599 align:start position:0%
two weeks after the change of pay is is
 
02:17:09.110 --> 02:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
in place um D talks about vacation
 
02:17:11.950 --> 02:17:11.960 align:start position:0%
holiday pay sick pay bonus pay personal
 
02:17:14.870 --> 02:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
day pay employee expenses and all other
 
02:17:17.150 --> 02:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
French benefits earned acred or vested
 
02:17:19.549 --> 02:17:19.559 align:start position:0%
prior to any change or lapse due to the
 
02:17:22.669 --> 02:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
change the primary focus on all of this
 
02:17:22.679 --> 02:17:23.589 align:start position:0%
change the primary focus on all of this
is

02:17:23.589 --> 02:17:23.599 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:17:26.070 --> 02:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
notification this is just
 
02:17:28.230 --> 02:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
notifying it would be a notification in
 
02:17:31.030 --> 02:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
writing if there is a change to a policy
 
02:17:34.030 --> 02:17:34.040 align:start position:0%
of any one of those types of
 
02:17:37.230 --> 02:17:37.240 align:start position:0%
benefits um also wanted to point out too
 
02:17:40.150 --> 02:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm sorry if I'm going off topic
 
02:17:42.629 --> 02:17:42.639 align:start position:0%
for just a second uh but there is a
 
02:17:45.990 --> 02:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
definition under uh section 275 as far
 
02:17:48.030 --> 02:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
as what an employee is so so I know that
 
02:17:50.629 --> 02:17:50.639 align:start position:0%
that will help take care of that aspect
 
02:17:52.790 --> 02:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
of it if the committee takes a look at
 
02:17:54.950 --> 02:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
the definition section under
 
02:17:57.549 --> 02:17:57.559 align:start position:0%
275 um there is a definition of employee
 
02:17:59.750 --> 02:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
and it includes everybody not just
 
02:18:01.950 --> 02:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
part-time not just full-time so I know
 
02:18:03.750 --> 02:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
that was a concern with the last speaker
 
02:18:06.469 --> 02:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
that was up here
 
02:18:09.110 --> 02:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
um so I think that that covers what C
 
02:18:10.549 --> 02:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
and D will do and these are
 
02:18:12.669 --> 02:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
notifications that must be done in
 
02:18:15.150 --> 02:18:15.160 align:start position:0%
writing and I believe these are Under
 
02:18:18.709 --> 02:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
27549 thank you follow Mr chairman
 
02:18:21.230 --> 02:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
follow um there's also notifications for
 
02:18:22.509 --> 02:18:22.519 align:start position:0%
layoffs as
 
02:18:24.589 --> 02:18:24.599 align:start position:0%
well there are not there are
 
02:18:26.549 --> 02:18:26.559 align:start position:0%
notifications for layoffs there's uh
 
02:18:27.750 --> 02:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
there's of course the official
 
02:18:29.429 --> 02:18:29.439 align:start position:0%
notifications for layoffs which is under
 
02:18:31.870 --> 02:18:31.880 align:start position:0%
the warrn statute which uh believe under
 
02:18:34.389 --> 02:18:34.399 align:start position:0%
ours is
 
02:18:38.389 --> 02:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
two70 okay I got we have it we have it
 
02:18:41.549 --> 02:18:41.559 align:start position:0%
section f um so there is a state warn
 
02:18:43.270 --> 02:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
statute there's also a federal warrant
 
02:18:44.950 --> 02:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
statute that has to be complied with
 
02:18:47.990 --> 02:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
there are numbers that have to be met in
 
02:18:50.230 --> 02:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
order for a an actual formal warant
 
02:18:52.110 --> 02:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
notice to be triggered and that is the
 
02:18:57.589 --> 02:18:57.599 align:start position:0%
workers basically um retraining act um
 
02:18:59.429 --> 02:18:59.439 align:start position:0%
sometimes does not apply we only apply
 
02:19:01.349 --> 02:19:01.359 align:start position:0%
it obviously to New Hampshire companies
 
02:19:03.110 --> 02:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
if they involve New Hampshire workers we
 
02:19:05.270 --> 02:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
have to look at at that remote comes
 
02:19:09.070 --> 02:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
into play as well uh as far as layoffs
 
02:19:11.230 --> 02:19:11.240 align:start position:0%
are concerned those fit under Mass
 
02:19:13.429 --> 02:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
layoffs Department of New Hampshire or
 
02:19:15.469 --> 02:19:15.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire employment security has a
 
02:19:17.549 --> 02:19:17.559 align:start position:0%
division that works with that we also
 
02:19:19.429 --> 02:19:19.439 align:start position:0%
get notifications because by Statute
 
02:19:22.429 --> 02:19:22.439 align:start position:0%
under the war act um the notifications
 
02:19:24.830 --> 02:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
are required to go to various agencies
 
02:19:24.840 --> 02:19:25.990 align:start position:0%
are required to go to various agencies
including

02:19:25.990 --> 02:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
including
 
02:19:28.230 --> 02:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
hours so yes there has to be
 
02:19:31.110 --> 02:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
notifications made but if it doesn't
 
02:19:34.230 --> 02:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
trigger the warn act it may not trigger
 
02:19:38.349 --> 02:19:38.359 align:start position:0%
the same amount of time for
 
02:19:40.870 --> 02:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
notifications the warn act requires that
 
02:19:43.110 --> 02:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
notifications be made to the employees
 
02:19:45.230 --> 02:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
at least 60 days prior to the layoff is
 
02:19:48.150 --> 02:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
supposed to take place if if it's not a
 
02:19:50.349 --> 02:19:50.359 align:start position:0%
triggered warn act
 
02:19:52.870 --> 02:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
layoff that may not be the
 
02:19:56.270 --> 02:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
same final followup what is that number
 
02:19:58.190 --> 02:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
for the for the warrant act to come
 
02:20:00.590 --> 02:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
in oh you're talking about as far as
 
02:20:02.190 --> 02:20:02.200 align:start position:0%
number of employees it depends on
 
02:20:04.630 --> 02:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
whether it's a plant lay off it depends
 
02:20:08.510 --> 02:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
on if it's Federal and also for state
 
02:20:10.110 --> 02:20:10.120 align:start position:0%
and I would not want to speak out but I
 
02:20:12.030 --> 02:20:12.040 align:start position:0%
would I will gladly send a copy of the
 
02:20:14.030 --> 02:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
warrn act and highlight the specific
 
02:20:16.110 --> 02:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
sections that factor in whether or not
 
02:20:19.349 --> 02:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
it's 25% of the Workforce whether or not
 
02:20:22.469 --> 02:20:22.479 align:start position:0%
it's 100 employees versus 150 employees
 
02:20:24.070 --> 02:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of numbers that are
 
02:20:26.270 --> 02:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
factored in and I would be more than
 
02:20:28.590 --> 02:20:28.600 align:start position:0%
happy to produce a copy of the warrant
 
02:20:30.270 --> 02:20:30.280 align:start position:0%
act with highlighted sections in there
 
02:20:33.230 --> 02:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
that would factor in uh exactly what the
 
02:20:35.349 --> 02:20:35.359 align:start position:0%
requirements are to meet the trigger for
 
02:20:38.070 --> 02:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
the warn act thank you thank you Mr
 
02:20:41.190 --> 02:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
chairman I have a followup um when you
 
02:20:45.990 --> 02:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
were discussing 80303 D and you were
 
02:20:48.630 --> 02:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
saying that this
 
02:20:51.670 --> 02:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this law or this rule has
 
02:20:54.790 --> 02:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
to do with notification and I want to
 
02:20:58.429 --> 02:20:58.439 align:start position:0%
clarify um the implication at least in
 
02:21:00.550 --> 02:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
this written testimony I'll go to a
 
02:21:02.429 --> 02:21:02.439 align:start position:0%
specific situation that we've talked
 
02:21:05.349 --> 02:21:05.359 align:start position:0%
about in previous years so you have a a
 
02:21:10.110 --> 02:21:10.120 align:start position:0%
company where um the policy is that
 
02:21:14.070 --> 02:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
vacation is acre and is paid unused time
 
02:21:16.830 --> 02:21:16.840 align:start position:0%
is paid out that's the company policy
 
02:21:19.710 --> 02:21:19.720 align:start position:0%
and then that company is sold acquired
 
02:21:22.670 --> 02:21:22.680 align:start position:0%
by another company who does not have
 
02:21:22.680 --> 02:21:23.750 align:start position:0%
by another company who does not have
that

02:21:23.750 --> 02:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:21:28.349 --> 02:21:28.359 align:start position:0%
policy and um the way this is in here
 
02:21:30.950 --> 02:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
with it's underlined the shall not lapse
 
02:21:34.630 --> 02:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
due to the change the implication is by
 
02:21:38.710 --> 02:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
this rule that the change in ownership
 
02:21:41.590 --> 02:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
cannot change the
 
02:21:45.550 --> 02:21:45.560 align:start position:0%
policy that the employee had acred that
 
02:21:47.510 --> 02:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
time under that's the way I read the
 
02:21:52.550 --> 02:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:54.830 --> 02:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
you any further questions for the
 
02:21:57.550 --> 02:21:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:00.150 --> 02:22:00.160 align:start position:0%
Labor seeing none thank you very much
 
02:22:03.670 --> 02:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
for stepping up for us and that was the
 
02:22:05.429 --> 02:22:05.439 align:start position:0%
final card that I
 
02:22:09.830 --> 02:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
had um and normally we don't bring
 
02:22:12.389 --> 02:22:12.399 align:start position:0%
people back up is if this is something
 
02:22:15.030 --> 02:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
that can't wait until we discuss the
 
02:22:17.750 --> 02:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
bill in committee um
 
02:22:17.760 --> 02:22:24.790 align:start position:0%
bill in committee um
I

02:22:24.790 --> 02:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:24.800 --> 02:22:36.150 align:start position:0%
 
want

02:22:36.150 --> 02:22:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:39.230 --> 02:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
okay Mr chairman I do appreciate your
 
02:22:42.110 --> 02:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
kind Indulgence uh and I regret I was
 
02:22:45.270 --> 02:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
outside the room for the past two uh
 
02:22:48.309 --> 02:22:48.319 align:start position:0%
speakers but I do want to say that you
 
02:22:51.990 --> 02:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
know what uh M mcgr just said about
 
02:22:55.710 --> 02:22:55.720 align:start position:0%
803 uh I have provided you know the
 
02:22:59.389 --> 02:22:59.399 align:start position:0%
committee with prior examples where the
 
02:23:03.389 --> 02:23:03.399 align:start position:0%
com the purchasing company did not uh
 
02:23:05.750 --> 02:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
roll over they did not accept rollover
 
02:23:08.110 --> 02:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
hours from the people who were laid off
 
02:23:10.309 --> 02:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
at when the company was sold and the
 
02:23:13.030 --> 02:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
previous owner did not pay them and
 
02:23:16.469 --> 02:23:16.479 align:start position:0%
these people uh lost hundreds of dollars
 
02:23:17.910 --> 02:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
because their
 
02:23:21.230 --> 02:23:21.240 align:start position:0%
acrude vacation hours just
 
02:23:24.110 --> 02:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
disappeared and that that is why I keep
 
02:23:26.309 --> 02:23:26.319 align:start position:0%
on bringing this bill to you so that we
 
02:23:29.670 --> 02:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
can stop that from happening in the
 
02:23:33.110 --> 02:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
future um so it it doesn't if you may
 
02:23:34.830 --> 02:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
read that way but that's not that's not
 
02:23:37.510 --> 02:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
what happens in the hearings and and
 
02:23:39.790 --> 02:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
that's that's something that I the uh
 
02:23:41.349 --> 02:23:41.359 align:start position:0%
the option I believe the language of my
 
02:23:43.670 --> 02:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
bill said the hours would be carried
 
02:23:47.389 --> 02:23:47.399 align:start position:0%
over to the new employer or paid uh by
 
02:23:51.150 --> 02:23:51.160 align:start position:0%
the Le departing owner which is what I
 
02:23:53.710 --> 02:23:53.720 align:start position:0%
think many people would expect to happen
 
02:23:56.429 --> 02:23:56.439 align:start position:0%
in that situation but because we allow
 
02:23:59.469 --> 02:23:59.479 align:start position:0%
people to uh say are we don't pay it up
 
02:24:02.150 --> 02:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
we don't pay the hours regardless of the
 
02:24:04.150 --> 02:24:04.160 align:start position:0%
circumstances that
 
02:24:04.160 --> 02:24:05.710 align:start position:0%
circumstances that
continues

02:24:05.710 --> 02:24:05.720 align:start position:0%
continues
 
02:24:09.030 --> 02:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
um Mr Abbott's issue with lay with
 
02:24:11.790 --> 02:24:11.800 align:start position:0%
layoff the dep the uh employment
 
02:24:15.070 --> 02:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
security has an 11we threshold that if
 
02:24:17.510 --> 02:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
if you're intended to go back you can go
 
02:24:19.750 --> 02:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
collect unemployment which does affect
 
02:24:23.870 --> 02:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
the UI balance and you can do so without
 
02:24:26.510 --> 02:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
looking for work because you intend to
 
02:24:28.190 --> 02:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
go back the employer intends to bring
 
02:24:31.710 --> 02:24:31.720 align:start position:0%
you back uh but I believe after 11 weeks
 
02:24:33.990 --> 02:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
that may not that may not continue or
 
02:24:36.309 --> 02:24:36.319 align:start position:0%
perhaps it could be extended so this is
 
02:24:39.030 --> 02:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
something I had looked at at a a prior
 
02:24:41.309 --> 02:24:41.319 align:start position:0%
year about including similar language
 
02:24:44.389 --> 02:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
that 11 weeks or we had to find a way to
 
02:24:47.950 --> 02:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
describe it as as a temporary lay P off
 
02:24:51.230 --> 02:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
uh not not permanent and in that case
 
02:24:53.429 --> 02:24:53.439 align:start position:0%
the employee would be paid their
 
02:24:55.630 --> 02:24:55.640 align:start position:0%
vacation hour because they don't they
 
02:24:57.670 --> 02:24:57.680 align:start position:0%
don't anticipate coming
 
02:25:00.269 --> 02:25:00.279 align:start position:0%
back and as we know that se these
 
02:25:03.590 --> 02:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
seasonal or employers are are there are
 
02:25:05.150 --> 02:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
are some number of them but there are a
 
02:25:08.510 --> 02:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
great many in the state that do not work
 
02:25:10.910 --> 02:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
seasonally that a job is a year round
 
02:25:13.429 --> 02:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
job and when a layoff happens it's a
 
02:25:15.190 --> 02:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
layoff and they're not coming
 
02:25:17.710 --> 02:25:17.720 align:start position:0%
back again thank you for your
 
02:25:21.670 --> 02:25:21.680 align:start position:0%

1322 um which I am the prime sponsor of

wage um I don't know if I can be brief
 
03:21:01.469 --> 03:21:01.479 align:start position:0%
but I will try to be
 
03:21:04.830 --> 03:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
succinct um this bill raises the minimum
 
03:21:07.389 --> 03:21:07.399 align:start position:0%
wage in increments until it reaches
 
03:21:10.510 --> 03:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
$17 and it's um based on the federal
 
03:21:12.550 --> 03:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
raise the wage bill
 
03:21:17.469 --> 03:21:17.479 align:start position:0%
um wages um I have a um a cheat sheet
 
03:21:19.950 --> 03:21:19.960 align:start position:0%
here and in the blue section it shows
 
03:21:23.630 --> 03:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
how this bill will work um it is a very
 
03:21:27.229 --> 03:21:27.239 align:start position:0%
conservative bill um in September of
 
03:21:30.750 --> 03:21:30.760 align:start position:0%
2024 the minimum wage will go to $99.50
 
03:21:32.229 --> 03:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
an hour from
 
03:21:35.229 --> 03:21:35.239 align:start position:0%
$725 a year from now it'll be 11 it'll
 
03:21:37.510 --> 03:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
go to 1250
 
03:21:40.510 --> 03:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
14550 and then 17 in
 
03:21:42.990 --> 03:21:43.000 align:start position:0%
2029 um
 
03:21:45.630 --> 03:21:45.640 align:start position:0%
and that is very conservative um
 
03:21:50.269 --> 03:21:50.279 align:start position:0%
currently um the um average starting
 
03:21:51.870 --> 03:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
wage in the state of New Hampshire is
 
03:21:54.870 --> 03:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
already over $15 an hour so this is not
 
03:21:57.030 --> 03:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
going to have a huge impact on
 
03:21:58.950 --> 03:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
businesses because most of them are
 
03:22:02.070 --> 03:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
already paying more than
 
03:22:07.950 --> 03:22:07.960 align:start position:0%
um than $15 an hour um starting out um
 
03:22:10.990 --> 03:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
so why do we need this bill um well the
 
03:22:14.870 --> 03:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
average medium wage in the state is
 
03:22:17.309 --> 03:22:17.319 align:start position:0%
$24.10 that means half of the workers in
 
03:22:19.950 --> 03:22:19.960 align:start position:0%
the state make less and the economic
 
03:22:23.630 --> 03:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
policy Institute indicates that 18% of
 
03:22:27.590 --> 03:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:29.870 --> 03:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
1,2 one
 
03:22:32.229 --> 03:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
124,000 um people in the state are
 
03:22:36.750 --> 03:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
making less than $17 an hour and the MIT
 
03:22:39.269 --> 03:22:39.279 align:start position:0%
minimum wage the MIT living wage
 
03:22:41.189 --> 03:22:41.199 align:start position:0%
calculator estimates that a single
 
03:22:43.349 --> 03:22:43.359 align:start position:0%
person need
 
03:22:45.910 --> 03:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
$17.23 to live a decent life in the
 
03:22:47.309 --> 03:22:47.319 align:start position:0%
state of New
 
03:22:50.630 --> 03:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire furthermore a third of U
 
03:22:52.750 --> 03:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters reported to the United
 
03:22:55.349 --> 03:22:55.359 align:start position:0%
States census um that um they're having
 
03:22:57.269 --> 03:22:57.279 align:start position:0%
a difficult time paying their
 
03:22:59.790 --> 03:22:59.800 align:start position:0%
bills um we have not raised our minimum
 
03:23:02.309 --> 03:23:02.319 align:start position:0%
wage in the state since
 
03:23:04.630 --> 03:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
2009 um in
 
03:23:09.110 --> 03:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
2009 um a um a two-bedroom apartment
 
03:23:12.750 --> 03:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
rented for uh $1,050
 
03:23:15.710 --> 03:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
most recently um the New Hampshire
 
03:23:18.950 --> 03:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
housing um indicated that a two-bedroom
 
03:23:20.469 --> 03:23:20.479 align:start position:0%
apartment in the state of New Hampshire
 
03:23:23.550 --> 03:23:23.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:27.110 --> 03:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
$1,764 so in order for people to keep a
 
03:23:29.349 --> 03:23:29.359 align:start position:0%
roof over their head and food on the
 
03:23:33.790 --> 03:23:33.800 align:start position:0%
table and be able to uh get to work and
 
03:23:37.110 --> 03:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
um God raise a family they they need
 
03:23:42.150 --> 03:23:42.160 align:start position:0%
more uh money than they did in 2009 the
 
03:23:45.110 --> 03:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
second reason that we need this bill is
 
03:23:47.590 --> 03:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
that um every state in New England has a
 
03:23:51.429 --> 03:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
much higher minimum wage um the green
 
03:23:52.630 --> 03:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
section on
 
03:23:56.189 --> 03:23:56.199 align:start position:0%
your um on your cheat sheet um shows
 
03:23:59.030 --> 03:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
what the minimum wage is in other states
 
03:24:02.150 --> 03:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:04.870 --> 03:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
um the lowest minimum wage in New
 
03:24:08.309 --> 03:24:08.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is um
 
03:24:10.670 --> 03:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
$13.67 and that's in Vermont and right
 
03:24:12.830 --> 03:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
now they have a bill going through their
 
03:24:14.469 --> 03:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
their legislature that's going to raise
 
03:24:15.830 --> 03:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
it to
 
03:24:18.349 --> 03:24:18.359 align:start position:0%
$19 um Massachusetts is the only other
 
03:24:19.790 --> 03:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
state in New England that didn't raise
 
03:24:21.630 --> 03:24:21.640 align:start position:0%
their minimum wage this year um they're
 
03:24:24.070 --> 03:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
at 15 but there's currently a bill going
 
03:24:27.750 --> 03:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
through their um uh House of
 
03:24:29.590 --> 03:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
Representatives um that will raise the
 
03:24:33.710 --> 03:24:33.720 align:start position:0%
minimum wage to uh $20 an hour
 
03:24:38.309 --> 03:24:38.319 align:start position:0%
so um so th those are those
 
03:24:40.550 --> 03:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
are I think that puts us at a
 
03:24:43.030 --> 03:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
disadvantage um one of the issues that
 
03:24:45.590 --> 03:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
we have I you also included on here what
 
03:24:47.349 --> 03:24:47.359 align:start position:0%
the unemployment rate is in other states
 
03:24:49.550 --> 03:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
and you can see they're all fairly low
 
03:24:51.670 --> 03:24:51.680 align:start position:0%
some economists think that anything
 
03:24:54.590 --> 03:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
under three indicates a a a critical
 
03:24:56.469 --> 03:24:56.479 align:start position:0%
labor shortage and I think we're all
 
03:24:58.189 --> 03:24:58.199 align:start position:0%
aware that we do have a labor shortage
 
03:24:59.830 --> 03:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire I was just
 
03:25:02.110 --> 03:25:02.120 align:start position:0%
at a New Hampshire Phil fiscal policy
 
03:25:04.550 --> 03:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
Institute presentation where they said
 
03:25:06.990 --> 03:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
that for every three job openings
 
03:25:08.670 --> 03:25:08.680 align:start position:0%
there's one person in New Hampshire
 
03:25:11.070 --> 03:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
that's looking for work so we don't have
 
03:25:13.750 --> 03:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
enough people to fill all of the jobs
 
03:25:16.910 --> 03:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
that we have in the state and
 
03:25:18.870 --> 03:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
that's you know if we don't raise the
 
03:25:20.830 --> 03:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
minimum wage it's going to be harder for
 
03:25:23.469 --> 03:25:23.479 align:start position:0%
us to attract workers we've already seen
 
03:25:27.389 --> 03:25:27.399 align:start position:0%
a decline in our Workforce of around
 
03:25:31.670 --> 03:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
16,990 workers and the um critical to
 
03:25:33.670 --> 03:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
that is that the there has been a
 
03:25:36.590 --> 03:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
significant decline um in among workers
 
03:25:39.349 --> 03:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
ages 20 to 29 and those are people who
 
03:25:40.990 --> 03:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
are just starting out in their careers
 
03:25:42.990 --> 03:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
not mid career where you you know
 
03:25:45.990 --> 03:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
starting wage would be 30 40 um dollars
 
03:25:49.550 --> 03:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
an hour so those people um are not going
 
03:25:51.269 --> 03:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
to be working in New Hampshire they're
 
03:25:53.309 --> 03:25:53.319 align:start position:0%
going to cross the border where they're
 
03:25:55.070 --> 03:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
guaranteed a much higher
 
03:25:58.510 --> 03:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
wage and um so this low unemployment
 
03:26:01.550 --> 03:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
rate has certainly um impacted the
 
03:26:04.070 --> 03:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
workforce and that it has this worker
 
03:26:07.030 --> 03:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
shortage has um given workers leverage
 
03:26:10.030 --> 03:26:10.040 align:start position:0%
to to raise wages and that's good for
 
03:26:12.309 --> 03:26:12.319 align:start position:0%
them but I think in the long
 
03:26:15.510 --> 03:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
term the limiting factor for the State
 
03:26:18.349 --> 03:26:18.359 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire to um grow our economy
 
03:26:19.830 --> 03:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
is going to be the number of workers
 
03:26:24.110 --> 03:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
that we have so um I think we one thing
 
03:26:27.910 --> 03:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
we can do um as an institution is raise
 
03:26:31.229 --> 03:26:31.239 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage show the world that New
 
03:26:33.910 --> 03:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire values its workers and that
 
03:26:35.950 --> 03:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
people are welcome to come here and that
 
03:26:37.990 --> 03:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
we will assure that they have a good
 
03:26:40.510 --> 03:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
quality of life in exchange for their
 
03:26:41.950 --> 03:26:41.960 align:start position:0%
hard work
 
03:26:43.670 --> 03:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
um thank
 
03:26:48.030 --> 03:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much and um just
 
03:26:50.790 --> 03:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
right now we you are prepared to take
 
03:26:53.429 --> 03:26:53.439 align:start position:0%
over the clerk duy
 
03:26:57.189 --> 03:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
so we can just hand everything
 
03:26:59.630 --> 03:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
over and thank you for your testimony
 
03:27:01.630 --> 03:27:01.640 align:start position:0%
are there questions for the sponsor of
 
03:27:01.640 --> 03:27:04.750 align:start position:0%
are there questions for the sponsor of
this

03:27:04.750 --> 03:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:08.830 --> 03:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
bill representative bushard um would you
 
03:27:12.830 --> 03:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
believe that when I was canvasing to get
 
03:27:17.389 --> 03:27:17.399 align:start position:0%
reelected um last term that I had
 
03:27:20.110 --> 03:27:20.120 align:start position:0%
constituents in Manchester who are
 
03:27:23.710 --> 03:27:23.720 align:start position:0%
working two to three jobs to put food on
 
03:27:26.510 --> 03:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
their table and pay their
 
03:27:30.790 --> 03:27:30.800 align:start position:0%
rent yes I I believe that um I also ran
 
03:27:33.189 --> 03:27:33.199 align:start position:0%
into the same thing when I was um when I
 
03:27:37.229 --> 03:27:37.239 align:start position:0%
was out canvasing this last time um and
 
03:27:40.630 --> 03:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
also the um data um supports that
 
03:27:43.590 --> 03:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
because why while the number of people
 
03:27:46.389 --> 03:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
in the workforce has declined the number
 
03:27:48.750 --> 03:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
of jobs has actually increased in the
 
03:27:50.630 --> 03:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
state so that means that there are
 
03:27:52.229 --> 03:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
people that are working more than one
 
03:27:55.309 --> 03:27:55.319 align:start position:0%
job at a significant level and that I
 
03:28:00.630 --> 03:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:10.229 --> 03:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:10.239 --> 03:28:14.910 align:start position:0%
 
McKenzie

03:28:14.910 --> 03:28:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:17.990 --> 03:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh yeah yes um this bill would increase
 
03:28:21.229 --> 03:28:21.239 align:start position:0%
the tipped wage to 50% of the of the
 
03:28:25.429 --> 03:28:25.439 align:start position:0%
minimum wage but um so that it would be
 
03:28:27.630 --> 03:28:27.640 align:start position:0%
more competitive with other states you
 
03:28:31.950 --> 03:28:31.960 align:start position:0%
can see on the um list of um wages for
 
03:28:34.189 --> 03:28:34.199 align:start position:0%
other states that the tipped wage in
 
03:28:36.670 --> 03:28:36.680 align:start position:0%
Maine is $7 an hour and in New Hampshire
 
03:28:36.680 --> 03:28:37.469 align:start position:0%
Maine is $7 an hour and in New Hampshire
it's

03:28:37.469 --> 03:28:37.479 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:28:40.309 --> 03:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
$327 an hour uh one of the questions
 
03:28:43.469 --> 03:28:43.479 align:start position:0%
that we're frequently asked um is how
 
03:28:45.710 --> 03:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
many people are actually working for
 
03:28:48.790 --> 03:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
$725 an hour I I think that's the wrong
 
03:28:52.389 --> 03:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
question to be asking because um
 
03:28:55.070 --> 03:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
$725 is kind of irrelevant right now
 
03:28:56.630 --> 03:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
what we should be asking is how much
 
03:28:59.070 --> 03:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
money do people living in New Hampshire
 
03:29:00.710 --> 03:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
need to make in order to have a decent
 
03:29:05.590 --> 03:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
quality of life um however um the um
 
03:29:07.870 --> 03:29:07.880 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that
 
03:29:10.590 --> 03:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
there are about 4,000 people who make
 
03:29:15.429 --> 03:29:15.439 align:start position:0%
less than $25 an hour and that um and
 
03:29:18.630 --> 03:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
they they suspect that um that those may
 
03:29:22.110 --> 03:29:22.120 align:start position:0%
be we we suspect that that that may be
 
03:29:24.870 --> 03:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
um tipped wage workers who make
 
03:29:29.510 --> 03:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
$327 an hour however um an important
 
03:29:31.750 --> 03:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
consideration to that is that if some
 
03:29:35.309 --> 03:29:35.319 align:start position:0%
someone goes into work and um they uh
 
03:29:37.950 --> 03:29:37.960 align:start position:0%
are a waitress or they are working in
 
03:29:41.189 --> 03:29:41.199 align:start position:0%
one of those um chain hair salons and
 
03:29:43.590 --> 03:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
and they go in to work and they're there
 
03:29:46.550 --> 03:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
for a few hours and nobody comes in then
 
03:29:50.309 --> 03:29:50.319 align:start position:0%
their employer is only um required to
 
03:29:51.550 --> 03:29:51.560 align:start position:0%
pay them
 
03:29:54.670 --> 03:29:54.680 align:start position:0%
$7.25 an hour for the the amount of time
 
03:29:56.349 --> 03:29:56.359 align:start position:0%
that they're there before they're sent
 
03:30:00.269 --> 03:30:00.279 align:start position:0%
home and you know what worse um they can
 
03:30:01.469 --> 03:30:01.479 align:start position:0%
they can
 
03:30:05.189 --> 03:30:05.199 align:start position:0%
um they can average so if I'm a waitress
 
03:30:06.870 --> 03:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
and I go into work and I have a really
 
03:30:09.110 --> 03:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
good day on Monday and then Tuesday I go
 
03:30:11.189 --> 03:30:11.199 align:start position:0%
into work and I spend two hours filling
 
03:30:14.670 --> 03:30:14.680 align:start position:0%
salt shakers or cleaning the bathroom or
 
03:30:17.150 --> 03:30:17.160 align:start position:0%
um rolling silverware um and then they
 
03:30:20.030 --> 03:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
send me home for those two hours if they
 
03:30:21.990 --> 03:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
average I'm only getting paid
 
03:30:26.349 --> 03:30:26.359 align:start position:0%
$327 an hour and I think that that um
 
03:30:28.870 --> 03:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
may be a contributing factor to the fact
 
03:30:31.630 --> 03:30:31.640 align:start position:0%
that many um restaurant have are having
 
03:30:34.710 --> 03:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
a difficult time finding uh
 
03:30:37.710 --> 03:30:37.720 align:start position:0%
workers so thank you for the question
 
03:30:39.510 --> 03:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
any further
 
03:30:42.110 --> 03:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
questions uh does anybody have a first
 
03:30:45.990 --> 03:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
question no so representative buard you
 
03:30:49.510 --> 03:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
recognized for thank you Mr chairman uh
 
03:30:52.269 --> 03:30:52.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question now to
 
03:30:54.269 --> 03:30:54.279 align:start position:0%
what extent might a higher minimum wage
 
03:30:58.229 --> 03:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
decrease to Reliance on low-wage workers
 
03:31:00.429 --> 03:31:00.439 align:start position:0%
on government assistant
 
03:31:02.870 --> 03:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
programs well you know very famous thank
 
03:31:04.990 --> 03:31:05.000 align:start position:0%
you for the question very famously
 
03:31:06.830 --> 03:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
Walmart one of the first thing they do
 
03:31:10.429 --> 03:31:10.439 align:start position:0%
when they um hire new employees is to
 
03:31:13.030 --> 03:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
tell them how to apply for food stamps
 
03:31:16.189 --> 03:31:16.199 align:start position:0%
um because while their profits are
 
03:31:18.590 --> 03:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
growing um they're not they're not
 
03:31:20.910 --> 03:31:20.920 align:start position:0%
paying their workers a living wage I
 
03:31:23.429 --> 03:31:23.439 align:start position:0%
mean I I
 
03:31:26.269 --> 03:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
um I obviously you know if people are
 
03:31:28.670 --> 03:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
making more money they're the thing
 
03:31:31.710 --> 03:31:31.720 align:start position:0%
about raising wages for the lowest um uh
 
03:31:33.950 --> 03:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
paid workers is that they spend every
 
03:31:36.030 --> 03:31:36.040 align:start position:0%
cent of that money they're not going to
 
03:31:38.590 --> 03:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
be buying stocks uh they're not going to
 
03:31:41.910 --> 03:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
be um you know investing in
 
03:31:44.110 --> 03:31:44.120 align:start position:0%
uh uh putting it in the bank they're
 
03:31:45.349 --> 03:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
going to be spending it they're going to
 
03:31:46.910 --> 03:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
be spending it on food they're going to
 
03:31:48.910 --> 03:31:48.920 align:start position:0%
be spending it on rent it's going to go
 
03:31:50.110 --> 03:31:50.120 align:start position:0%
they're going to be buying gas it's
 
03:31:51.830 --> 03:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
going to go directly back into the
 
03:31:53.670 --> 03:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
economy which will support small
 
03:31:56.189 --> 03:31:56.199 align:start position:0%
businesses so for for every dollar that
 
03:31:58.710 --> 03:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
you give a a low-wage worker it can be
 
03:32:01.830 --> 03:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
multiplied multiple times and yes it
 
03:32:05.189 --> 03:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
will um reduce the Reliance on things
 
03:32:10.550 --> 03:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
like um food banks um food stamps and uh
 
03:32:13.429 --> 03:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
other um forms of
 
03:32:16.429 --> 03:32:16.439 align:start position:0%
um government
 
03:32:20.349 --> 03:32:20.359 align:start position:0%
um uh subsidies that U low low-wage
 
03:32:22.750 --> 03:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
workers have to rely on in order to
 
03:32:26.070 --> 03:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:29.269 --> 03:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
profits thank you any other
 
03:32:31.590 --> 03:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
03:32:34.429 --> 03:32:34.439 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you very
 
03:32:40.189 --> 03:32:40.199 align:start position:0%
much um next up I have Olivia Lennox
 
03:32:43.630 --> 03:32:43.640 align:start position:0%

speak two to three minutes in support of
 
03:32:45.279 --> 03:33:01.870 align:start position:0%
speak two to three minutes in support of
the

03:33:01.870 --> 03:33:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:05.710 --> 03:33:05.720 align:start position:0%
bill I am okay hi everyone thanks for
 
03:33:09.710 --> 03:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
having me um my name is Olivia I'm 27
 
03:33:12.550 --> 03:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
years old and I own a small business in
 
03:33:15.349 --> 03:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
Manchester New Hampshire we are a
 
03:33:18.189 --> 03:33:18.199 align:start position:0%
restaurant and Cafe so this would be the
 
03:33:18.199 --> 03:33:19.150 align:start position:0%
restaurant and Cafe so this would be the
service

03:33:19.150 --> 03:33:19.160 align:start position:0%
service
 
03:33:22.349 --> 03:33:22.359 align:start position:0%
industry um I have been in the industry
 
03:33:24.750 --> 03:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
since I was 15 years old my first job
 
03:33:26.950 --> 03:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
was in Manchester at another small
 
03:33:31.429 --> 03:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
business and um since 2019 I've owned
 
03:33:33.229 --> 03:33:33.239 align:start position:0%
small businesses in New Hampshire as
 
03:33:34.950 --> 03:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
well as in Oregon I lived there for a
 
03:33:34.960 --> 03:33:35.710 align:start position:0%
well as in Oregon I lived there for a
little

03:33:35.710 --> 03:33:35.720 align:start position:0%
little
 
03:33:35.720 --> 03:33:37.550 align:start position:0%
little
while

03:33:37.550 --> 03:33:37.560 align:start position:0%
while
 
03:33:41.469 --> 03:33:41.479 align:start position:0%
um it's hard to know exactly what to say
 
03:33:43.990 --> 03:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
because to me it seems
 
03:33:45.950 --> 03:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
obvious that
 
03:33:50.990 --> 03:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
$7.25 is just not a livable wage um and
 
03:33:52.750 --> 03:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
going off of some of the numbers that
 
03:33:56.389 --> 03:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
you heard at the last testimony um you
 
03:33:59.349 --> 03:33:59.359 align:start position:0%
know it's calculated this year 2024 that
 
03:34:01.389 --> 03:34:01.399 align:start position:0%
a living wage for an individual in New
 
03:34:04.309 --> 03:34:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:06.990 --> 03:34:07.000 align:start position:0%
$17.23 um it was also calculated that
 
03:34:09.229 --> 03:34:09.239 align:start position:0%
the poverty wage for an individual in
 
03:34:11.550 --> 03:34:11.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is $6
 
03:34:14.269 --> 03:34:14.279 align:start position:0%
53 so I think we're just a little bit
 
03:34:19.790 --> 03:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
too close to that at this number um this
 
03:34:22.150 --> 03:34:22.160 align:start position:0%
bill and its outcome affect folks who
 
03:34:25.590 --> 03:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
work for an hourly rate many of them are
 
03:34:28.269 --> 03:34:28.279 align:start position:0%
employed at local businesses such as my
 
03:34:31.990 --> 03:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
own small businesses represent Community
 
03:34:34.510 --> 03:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
because we interact with Community every
 
03:34:37.189 --> 03:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
day and customers support my local
 
03:34:38.870 --> 03:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
business because they know that they are
 
03:34:41.750 --> 03:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
stimulating their local economy
 
03:34:44.309 --> 03:34:44.319 align:start position:0%
and it is our job as business owners to
 
03:34:46.670 --> 03:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
bridge that gap for them and there are
 
03:34:48.429 --> 03:34:48.439 align:start position:0%
few ways that we can do that you know we
 
03:34:50.990 --> 03:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
can Source from local vendors whenever
 
03:34:52.790 --> 03:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
possible we can get involved in our
 
03:34:55.189 --> 03:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
community but we can also pay our
 
03:34:58.469 --> 03:34:58.479 align:start position:0%
employees who are from our community a
 
03:35:01.790 --> 03:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
livable wage right and so just to give
 
03:35:05.389 --> 03:35:05.399 align:start position:0%
you some examples of my numbers um it's
 
03:35:07.750 --> 03:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
funny because all of my employees are
 
03:35:09.510 --> 03:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
tipped because they are in the
 
03:35:12.030 --> 03:35:12.040 align:start position:0%
restaurant industry so looking at this
 
03:35:14.469 --> 03:35:14.479 align:start position:0%
tipped wage which I do understand
 
03:35:15.710 --> 03:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
because I was a waitress in New
 
03:35:17.670 --> 03:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for a long time so just to
 
03:35:20.229 --> 03:35:20.239 align:start position:0%
touch on the tipped wage a little bit um
 
03:35:20.239 --> 03:35:21.910 align:start position:0%
touch on the tipped wage a little bit um
the

03:35:21.910 --> 03:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:35:25.790 --> 03:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
$327 so as a business owner right now I
 
03:35:28.510 --> 03:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
could choose to pay my employees
 
03:35:31.670 --> 03:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
$327 an hour and so long as within that
 
03:35:36.189 --> 03:35:36.199 align:start position:0%
hour they make that extra three or $4 in
 
03:35:38.790 --> 03:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
tips to bring them up to that
 
03:35:43.189 --> 03:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
$725 that's all I'm responsible for
 
03:35:46.070 --> 03:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
$327 and so I did that for a long time
 
03:35:48.110 --> 03:35:48.120 align:start position:0%
actually as a as a waitress luckily you
 
03:35:50.030 --> 03:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
know this was an established restaurant
 
03:35:52.830 --> 03:35:52.840 align:start position:0%
so I was making you know more than $4 an
 
03:35:56.030 --> 03:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
hour in tips maybe 25 you know so that
 
03:35:59.070 --> 03:35:59.080 align:start position:0%
was helpful um however still if I didn't
 
03:36:01.990 --> 03:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
have a table right I was still sweeping
 
03:36:04.309 --> 03:36:04.319 align:start position:0%
I was still wiping down tables wiping
 
03:36:07.030 --> 03:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
down cleaning the bathroom um wiping
 
03:36:09.150 --> 03:36:09.160 align:start position:0%
down the salt and pepper shakers doing
 
03:36:11.469 --> 03:36:11.479 align:start position:0%
doing tasks and leaving with
 
03:36:15.269 --> 03:36:15.279 align:start position:0%
$7.25 that did happen to me my employees
 
03:36:18.750 --> 03:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
right now start at $15 an hour and that
 
03:36:22.870 --> 03:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
was my choice I opened in 2022 and I
 
03:36:25.309 --> 03:36:25.319 align:start position:0%
knew I was in uh I had the opportunity
 
03:36:26.910 --> 03:36:26.920 align:start position:0%
to make that decision so that I could
 
03:36:29.189 --> 03:36:29.199 align:start position:0%
build my business around the structure
 
03:36:31.670 --> 03:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
of paying my employees $15 an hour
 
03:36:33.710 --> 03:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
starting even though I really didn't
 
03:36:38.229 --> 03:36:38.239 align:start position:0%
have to like I didn't you know so while
 
03:36:40.710 --> 03:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
yeah sure I I feel that when I when I do
 
03:36:43.389 --> 03:36:43.399 align:start position:0%
payroll every week at the same time it's
 
03:36:45.950 --> 03:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
my responsibility to deal with that in
 
03:36:48.349 --> 03:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
my own way and I'm happy to do it
 
03:36:50.990 --> 03:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
because my employees are excited to work
 
03:36:52.790 --> 03:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
there I teach them things they learn
 
03:36:55.590 --> 03:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
things from me we work as a team and
 
03:36:59.110 --> 03:36:59.120 align:start position:0%
they have the ability to feed their kids
 
03:37:03.110 --> 03:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
and to have you know fun outside of work
 
03:37:05.990 --> 03:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
and to come to work and not to live to
 
03:37:08.189 --> 03:37:08.199 align:start position:0%
work but to work to live and it's
 
03:37:09.990 --> 03:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
fulfilling for them and that brings me a
 
03:37:13.830 --> 03:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
lot of joy and I think that this is long
 
03:37:18.070 --> 03:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
overdue honestly um the I have this
 
03:37:19.750 --> 03:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
percentage that I work off of when it
 
03:37:22.590 --> 03:37:22.600 align:start position:0%
comes to net sales versus labor on the
 
03:37:25.469 --> 03:37:25.479 align:start position:0%
low end of net sales versus labor is 25%
 
03:37:28.110 --> 03:37:28.120 align:start position:0%
and on the high end is 35% that's how I
 
03:37:30.670 --> 03:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
can tell at any given time if I'm you
 
03:37:33.030 --> 03:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
know not as busy as I should be for the
 
03:37:34.630 --> 03:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
amount of employees that I have on
 
03:37:37.070 --> 03:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
working at $15 an hour and last year I
 
03:37:38.110 --> 03:37:38.120 align:start position:0%
was at
 
03:37:40.950 --> 03:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
29% that's with paying them between $5
 
03:37:43.670 --> 03:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
and $18 an hour that's really not bad
 
03:37:47.150 --> 03:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm doing fine so I'm I'm just here
 
03:37:49.830 --> 03:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
to say that um you know it's it's just
 
03:37:52.710 --> 03:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
long overdue work is work you know
 
03:37:54.630 --> 03:37:54.640 align:start position:0%
whether they're getting paid hourly or
 
03:37:56.790 --> 03:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
salary if they're in the industry
 
03:37:58.510 --> 03:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
they're working hard they go home and
 
03:38:01.950 --> 03:38:01.960 align:start position:0%
their feet hurt you know and I just had
 
03:38:04.870 --> 03:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
a um a meeting with the psychologist
 
03:38:07.389 --> 03:38:07.399 align:start position:0%
actually um that's personal but he
 
03:38:09.429 --> 03:38:09.439 align:start position:0%
mentioned that he could never do what I
 
03:38:11.229 --> 03:38:11.239 align:start position:0%
do because it involves working with the
 
03:38:13.030 --> 03:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
general public and that's a biggest fear
 
03:38:15.590 --> 03:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
of his and he has a salary he went to
 
03:38:17.870 --> 03:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
school you know he he's a psychologist
 
03:38:20.189 --> 03:38:20.199 align:start position:0%
but he could never do what it is that I
 
03:38:23.229 --> 03:38:23.239 align:start position:0%
do in the industry work is work and
 
03:38:26.269 --> 03:38:26.279 align:start position:0%
people deserve to get paid you know I my
 
03:38:29.030 --> 03:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
employees who make $15 an hour plus tips
 
03:38:31.870 --> 03:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
they end up making around $26 an hour on
 
03:38:35.550 --> 03:38:35.560 align:start position:0%
a good week with those tips um that is
 
03:38:37.469 --> 03:38:37.479 align:start position:0%
pretty good I mean for an industry job
 
03:38:39.990 --> 03:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
but they again they're working 30 35 to
 
03:38:41.950 --> 03:38:41.960 align:start position:0%
40 hours a week they they deserve to
 
03:38:45.309 --> 03:38:45.319 align:start position:0%
make that and so yeah I'm I'm all for it
 
03:38:46.790 --> 03:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
and I think we should really think about
 
03:38:48.910 --> 03:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
it and I really do believe that small
 
03:38:51.910 --> 03:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
businesses they can they can handle this
 
03:38:54.349 --> 03:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
at this point in time um you can work at
 
03:38:56.750 --> 03:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
Dunkin' donuts for $15 an hour that's
 
03:38:59.110 --> 03:38:59.120 align:start position:0%
why I started at 15 because I wanted
 
03:39:00.710 --> 03:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
that's the industry as well you know I
 
03:39:03.429 --> 03:39:03.439 align:start position:0%
mean granted Dunkin Donuts is a large
 
03:39:05.510 --> 03:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
business but there are ways that small
 
03:39:07.870 --> 03:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
businesses can work around this you know
 
03:39:10.510 --> 03:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
like and I just don't think that
 
03:39:13.229 --> 03:39:13.239 align:start position:0%
allowing them to continue to pay people
 
03:39:16.710 --> 03:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
$725 is helping in the long
 
03:39:19.750 --> 03:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
run that's all thank you for your
 
03:39:21.469 --> 03:39:21.479 align:start position:0%
testimony are there questions for this
 
03:39:23.110 --> 03:39:23.120 align:start position:0%
witness representative
 
03:39:25.510 --> 03:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
kahill thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:39:28.070 --> 03:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
for taking my question would you say
 
03:39:30.229 --> 03:39:30.239 align:start position:0%
that then then with your employees you
 
03:39:32.189 --> 03:39:32.199 align:start position:0%
are paying them to work and the
 
03:39:33.790 --> 03:39:33.800 align:start position:0%
customers are paying them for good
 
03:39:36.590 --> 03:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
service with the tips I would say that
 
03:39:40.590 --> 03:39:40.600 align:start position:0%
yes um we we're in a tip pool um so so
 
03:39:42.750 --> 03:39:42.760 align:start position:0%
none of our employees work harder than
 
03:39:45.710 --> 03:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
the other so um I think that the the
 
03:39:47.269 --> 03:39:47.279 align:start position:0%
customers paying for the service that
 
03:39:49.510 --> 03:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
they get you know the speed the quality
 
03:39:51.870 --> 03:39:51.880 align:start position:0%
the smile the information that they get
 
03:39:54.110 --> 03:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
um when they're asking about the menu um
 
03:39:55.750 --> 03:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
clearing the plates making sure that
 
03:39:58.870 --> 03:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
they have a seamless transaction um so
 
03:40:00.309 --> 03:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that's what they're tipping
 
03:40:02.590 --> 03:40:02.600 align:start position:0%
for thanks you very much
 
03:40:04.990 --> 03:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
yes any other
 
03:40:08.110 --> 03:40:08.120 align:start position:0%
questions reprentative Schultz I'm on
 
03:40:12.349 --> 03:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
the I'm not able to ask a real question
 
03:40:14.309 --> 03:40:14.319 align:start position:0%
because I'm a co-sponsor of the bill I
 
03:40:15.590 --> 03:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
just wanted to know the name of your
 
03:40:17.469 --> 03:40:17.479 align:start position:0%
restaurant oh yeah we're called the
 
03:40:20.030 --> 03:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
green beautiful say that again the the
 
03:40:24.429 --> 03:40:24.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:27.910 --> 03:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
thank any others yes representative
 
03:40:30.790 --> 03:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
bushard uh thank you Mr chairman and
 
03:40:32.670 --> 03:40:32.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question and I
 
03:40:34.990 --> 03:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
just want to commend you on on your
 
03:40:35.000 --> 03:40:36.510 align:start position:0%
just want to commend you on on your
restaurant

03:40:36.510 --> 03:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
restaurant
 
03:40:40.870 --> 03:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
and um by increasing the minimum wage
 
03:40:45.590 --> 03:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
does that allow your workers to to stay
 
03:40:47.670 --> 03:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
longer employed with
 
03:40:52.550 --> 03:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
you I would I would think so yes um so
 
03:40:54.830 --> 03:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
as because I started them at 15 like I
 
03:40:57.309 --> 03:40:57.319 align:start position:0%
said it's now my job to navigate raises
 
03:41:00.030 --> 03:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
because it's always incentivizing to to
 
03:41:01.950 --> 03:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
continue to make more as you grow with a
 
03:41:05.670 --> 03:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
company if I had started at the
 
03:41:09.630 --> 03:41:09.640 align:start position:0%
$725 um I think that them getting more
 
03:41:12.070 --> 03:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
hourly would it would incentivize them
 
03:41:13.790 --> 03:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
to stay longer CU they would see that
 
03:41:16.269 --> 03:41:16.279 align:start position:0%
every single week in their paycheck um
 
03:41:18.309 --> 03:41:18.319 align:start position:0%
an example I think of that when I owned
 
03:41:21.070 --> 03:41:21.080 align:start position:0%
a food truck in Portland Oregon um when
 
03:41:23.590 --> 03:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
I got there when we opened in 2019 their
 
03:41:25.790 --> 03:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
minimum wage was
 
03:41:29.189 --> 03:41:29.199 align:start position:0%
$12.75 and um that next year it was
 
03:41:32.469 --> 03:41:32.479 align:start position:0%
actually raised to about 1325 I believe
 
03:41:35.070 --> 03:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
I got um like a notification it it went
 
03:41:37.990 --> 03:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
up and and I was I saw how that affected
 
03:41:39.790 --> 03:41:39.800 align:start position:0%
my employees at the time and they were
 
03:41:41.550 --> 03:41:41.560 align:start position:0%
very very excited you know it was it was
 
03:41:44.030 --> 03:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
out of my hands but I was happy to do it
 
03:41:45.590 --> 03:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
and it was like kind of like a sense of
 
03:41:47.870 --> 03:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
camaraderie and I knew they deserved it
 
03:41:50.389 --> 03:41:50.399 align:start position:0%
so it was it was a nice moment and that
 
03:41:54.229 --> 03:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:56.990 --> 03:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
all any further
 
03:41:59.189 --> 03:41:59.199 align:start position:0%

support of HB 1322 to raise the minimum

wage to $17 an hour by
 
03:42:54.870 --> 03:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
2029 we know that uh the data that was
 
03:42:57.550 --> 03:42:57.560 align:start position:0%
shared by the representative Kathy tab
 
03:42:59.349 --> 03:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
um I'm not going to go back through the
 
03:43:01.030 --> 03:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
numbers but I just wanted to highlight
 
03:43:03.670 --> 03:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
that number which shows that about
 
03:43:06.269 --> 03:43:06.279 align:start position:0%
124,000 Gran Staters who work work for
 
03:43:09.429 --> 03:43:09.439 align:start position:0%
low wages uh and every day we hear from
 
03:43:11.790 --> 03:43:11.800 align:start position:0%
the committe members and representatives
 
03:43:13.550 --> 03:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
across the state that say no one works
 
03:43:14.910 --> 03:43:14.920 align:start position:0%
for low wages in New Hampshire but
 
03:43:17.550 --> 03:43:17.560 align:start position:0%
that's the reality that's the data uh we
 
03:43:21.189 --> 03:43:21.199 align:start position:0%
also know um according to the Bureau of
 
03:43:24.910 --> 03:43:24.920 align:start position:0%
Labor Statistics a report from 2022 that
 
03:43:27.590 --> 03:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
about 5,000 New Hampshire workers work
 
03:43:31.590 --> 03:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
either at $725 an hour or below that and
 
03:43:34.510 --> 03:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
4,000 of those are earing at $725 cents
 
03:43:37.710 --> 03:43:37.720 align:start position:0%
an hour again reflecting uh the kind of
 
03:43:39.910 --> 03:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh people in our communities who are not
 
03:43:39.920 --> 03:43:40.870 align:start position:0%
uh people in our communities who are not
making

03:43:40.870 --> 03:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
making
 
03:43:44.990 --> 03:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
it uh we know that newshire wage does
 
03:43:46.910 --> 03:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
default the federal minimum wage uh
 
03:43:49.429 --> 03:43:49.439 align:start position:0%
which has not really been raised since
 
03:43:51.830 --> 03:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
2009 uh while the prices of goods and
 
03:43:54.510 --> 03:43:54.520 align:start position:0%
services uh rent health care costs
 
03:43:56.030 --> 03:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
everything else goes up every year and
 
03:43:58.469 --> 03:43:58.479 align:start position:0%
there and that hasn't
 
03:44:01.349 --> 03:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
stops uh so New Hampshire's wage is very
 
03:44:03.830 --> 03:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
low and it needs to go much higher
 
03:44:04.950 --> 03:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
there's nowhere in the state of New
 
03:44:07.229 --> 03:44:07.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where anyone can leave for
 
03:44:10.870 --> 03:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
$725 an hour uh the recent report from
 
03:44:12.349 --> 03:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Housing Finance
 
03:44:14.750 --> 03:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
Authority do show that the medium rent
 
03:44:16.990 --> 03:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
and utility for a two-bedroom apartment
 
03:44:17.000 --> 03:44:18.229 align:start position:0%
and utility for a two-bedroom apartment
is

03:44:18.229 --> 03:44:18.239 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:44:21.870 --> 03:44:21.880 align:start position:0%
1,764 per month to afford that someone
 
03:44:24.590 --> 03:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
needs to be making over 70,000 an hour I
 
03:44:28.189 --> 03:44:28.199 align:start position:0%
mean 70,000 a year uh so the reality of
 
03:44:30.149 --> 03:44:30.159 align:start position:0%
what people are earning and what the
 
03:44:32.790 --> 03:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
cost of living is is very
 
03:44:35.149 --> 03:44:35.159 align:start position:0%
clear uh but enough with the numbers and
 
03:44:37.030 --> 03:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
I just want to share a few stories uh
 
03:44:39.030 --> 03:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
that gsop is very familiar with we work
 
03:44:41.189 --> 03:44:41.199 align:start position:0%
in different communities ities uh every
 
03:44:43.309 --> 03:44:43.319 align:start position:0%
day we are talking to people on the
 
03:44:45.510 --> 03:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
doors on the phones people coming to our
 
03:44:47.510 --> 03:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
office and telling us what's going on
 
03:44:49.550 --> 03:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
and people are hiding and so some of the
 
03:44:51.229 --> 03:44:51.239 align:start position:0%
stories I have today I'm not going to
 
03:44:52.910 --> 03:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
mention names but I just want to show
 
03:44:55.110 --> 03:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
you the reality of the people that are
 
03:44:56.590 --> 03:44:56.600 align:start position:0%
not able to be here because they're
 
03:44:58.870 --> 03:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
working and what they're going through
 
03:45:01.269 --> 03:45:01.279 align:start position:0%
um an example is a single mother of four
 
03:45:04.630 --> 03:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
kids uh her rent went up 7ou 700 this
 
03:45:06.790 --> 03:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
year starting in January just after
 
03:45:09.910 --> 03:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
Christmas um that's a 25% increase So
 
03:45:13.389 --> 03:45:13.399 align:start position:0%
currently she's paying $2,000 uh $300
 
03:45:15.670 --> 03:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
per month uh she works as a property
 
03:45:18.189 --> 03:45:18.199 align:start position:0%
manager but she's already sacrificing
 
03:45:19.830 --> 03:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
enough uh to make sure that she takes
 
03:45:21.429 --> 03:45:21.439 align:start position:0%
care of her kids and takes care of her
 
03:45:24.229 --> 03:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
day-to-day living but how much more can
 
03:45:26.189 --> 03:45:26.199 align:start position:0%
she sacrifice this is someone who's
 
03:45:27.950 --> 03:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
working again they're not staying home
 
03:45:29.349 --> 03:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
they're not waiting for anyone to help
 
03:45:31.030 --> 03:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
them they're trying to make it work for
 
03:45:33.830 --> 03:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
their own family and their Community but
 
03:45:35.469 --> 03:45:35.479 align:start position:0%
she's struggling to make it at the
 
03:45:37.830 --> 03:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
current rate that she's earning um
 
03:45:39.429 --> 03:45:39.439 align:start position:0%
another individual that's making a
 
03:45:41.630 --> 03:45:41.640 align:start position:0%
dollar or two above the minimum wage uh
 
03:45:43.910 --> 03:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
she actually works for a Dollar Tree
 
03:45:46.429 --> 03:45:46.439 align:start position:0%
store and the choice that she had to
 
03:45:48.070 --> 03:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
make was to live with multiple people
 
03:45:49.189 --> 03:45:49.199 align:start position:0%
because she can't afford to live by
 
03:45:50.790 --> 03:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
herself she would want one-bedroom
 
03:45:52.990 --> 03:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
apartment two bedroom apartment but
 
03:45:54.510 --> 03:45:54.520 align:start position:0%
that's not something that's feasible to
 
03:45:57.510 --> 03:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
them and they're working fulltime so
 
03:45:59.149 --> 03:45:59.159 align:start position:0%
while some of us are sitting here and
 
03:46:00.790 --> 03:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
wondering if we need a minimum wage the
 
03:46:02.870 --> 03:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
reality is people Inaba need a minimum
 
03:46:05.670 --> 03:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
wage and I want to challenge anyone here
 
03:46:07.309 --> 03:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
if you think that we don't need it I
 
03:46:10.030 --> 03:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
would like you to live on $725 an hour
 
03:46:12.149 --> 03:46:12.159 align:start position:0%
for a week and tell me how you make it
 
03:46:14.630 --> 03:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
out if you don't go to the food uh to
 
03:46:17.149 --> 03:46:17.159 align:start position:0%
the food pantry if you don't ask for any
 
03:46:19.070 --> 03:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
assistance i' would love to know if you
 
03:46:21.269 --> 03:46:21.279 align:start position:0%
are successful in that because a lot of
 
03:46:22.830 --> 03:46:22.840 align:start position:0%
people who are working have to go and
 
03:46:25.750 --> 03:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
look for services um because they can
 
03:46:27.670 --> 03:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
make it on the current
 
03:46:29.870 --> 03:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
rate so with that i' would like to
 
03:46:32.110 --> 03:46:32.120 align:start position:0%
encourage you to raise the minimum wage
 
03:46:34.149 --> 03:46:34.159 align:start position:0%
because it does benefit workers it
 
03:46:36.469 --> 03:46:36.479 align:start position:0%
benefits local businesses and it's the
 
03:46:39.229 --> 03:46:39.239 align:start position:0%
right thing to do um protecting workers
 
03:46:40.830 --> 03:46:40.840 align:start position:0%
who have been been left behind cuz at
 
03:46:43.550 --> 03:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
the same time if we don't put that
 
03:46:45.830 --> 03:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
regulation or that that protection for
 
03:46:48.990 --> 03:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
workers if businesses decide to pay
 
03:46:51.590 --> 03:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
$725 they will most business do pay
 
03:46:54.710 --> 03:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
higher but some do stick to $725 and
 
03:46:57.790 --> 03:46:57.800 align:start position:0%
that's not fair so I add you to vote Yes
 
03:47:01.110 --> 03:47:01.120 align:start position:0%
on HB 1322 and and vote all to pass on
 
03:47:03.269 --> 03:47:03.279 align:start position:0%
the bill thank you very much for your
 
03:47:05.590 --> 03:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
time thank you for your testimony are
 
03:47:08.510 --> 03:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
there questions for this
 
03:47:12.149 --> 03:47:12.159 align:start position:0%
Witness pres McKenzie and uh turn on
 
03:47:13.910 --> 03:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
your microphone so it gets on the
 
03:47:16.750 --> 03:47:16.760 align:start position:0%
recording yep there we
 
03:47:21.710 --> 03:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:26.229 --> 03:47:26.239 align:start position:0%
committee so can can you say that the
 
03:47:28.870 --> 03:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
the uh group that you're working with
 
03:47:31.110 --> 03:47:31.120 align:start position:0%
people that you come in contact are
 
03:47:34.510 --> 03:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
actually making $725 an hour in their
 
03:47:37.590 --> 03:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
workplaces they are making slightly more
 
03:47:42.510 --> 03:47:42.520 align:start position:0%
than $725 $12 $11 $13 but they're still
 
03:47:44.309 --> 03:47:44.319 align:start position:0%
struggling with the current cost of
 
03:47:46.110 --> 03:47:46.120 align:start position:0%
living mostly rent they're paying more
 
03:47:50.030 --> 03:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
than 50 60% of their income to rent
 
03:47:51.510 --> 03:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
because we know the current housing
 
03:47:53.870 --> 03:47:53.880 align:start position:0%
market everywhere across the state is
 
03:47:55.670 --> 03:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
pretty much high right
 
03:47:55.680 --> 03:47:58.269 align:start position:0%
pretty much high right
now

03:47:58.269 --> 03:47:58.279 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:48:02.469 --> 03:48:02.479 align:start position:0%
followup so the the there are people in
 
03:48:06.189 --> 03:48:06.199 align:start position:0%
this economy who are suffering um and
 
03:48:08.429 --> 03:48:08.439 align:start position:0%
come in contact with many of the people
 
03:48:08.439 --> 03:48:10.389 align:start position:0%
come in contact with many of the people
in

03:48:10.389 --> 03:48:10.399 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:48:12.950 --> 03:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
um so there are this is a reality for
 
03:48:15.429 --> 03:48:15.439 align:start position:0%
many people it's not something that well
 
03:48:18.630 --> 03:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
with minimum wage of the wage 1518 an
 
03:48:21.309 --> 03:48:21.319 align:start position:0%
hour you're dealing with people who are
 
03:48:23.830 --> 03:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
at the lower end of the scale yeah
 
03:48:26.510 --> 03:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh and if anyone is in doubt
 
03:48:28.229 --> 03:48:28.239 align:start position:0%
I would like to invite you to our office

he's speaking for
 
03:49:24.910 --> 03:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:27.429 --> 03:49:27.439 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you uh Mr chairman and
 
03:49:29.910 --> 03:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
03:49:31.830 --> 03:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
my name is Henry veu and I'm here on
 
03:49:34.110 --> 03:49:34.120 align:start position:0%
behalf of the lodging and Restaurant
 
03:49:37.910 --> 03:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
Association um and our opposition U
 
03:49:39.950 --> 03:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
largely comes out of um
 
03:49:41.670 --> 03:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
the section that deals with tipped
 
03:49:45.590 --> 03:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
employees um as as was mentioned a lot
 
03:49:49.510 --> 03:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
of our businesses are paying above the
 
03:49:53.630 --> 03:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
725 um so the hourly rate isn't as much
 
03:49:56.630 --> 03:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
of an issue um it's it's the section on
 
03:49:59.990 --> 03:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
the the tipped employees um and when you
 
03:50:01.830 --> 03:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
think about the minimum wage statute
 
03:50:03.510 --> 03:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
it's protective
 
03:50:06.790 --> 03:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
legislation right we're trying to
 
03:50:10.349 --> 03:50:10.359 align:start position:0%
protect uh the lowest wage earners we
 
03:50:13.110 --> 03:50:13.120 align:start position:0%
want to make sure there's a floor there
 
03:50:16.830 --> 03:50:16.840 align:start position:0%
by which it doesn't go below and that's
 
03:50:19.710 --> 03:50:19.720 align:start position:0%
U that's what should happen
 
03:50:22.469 --> 03:50:22.479 align:start position:0%
um but when you look at the tipped
 
03:50:26.710 --> 03:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
employees um although they're they're in
 
03:50:29.590 --> 03:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage statute they're not
 
03:50:33.389 --> 03:50:33.399 align:start position:0%
minimum wage earners um they're
 
03:50:37.269 --> 03:50:37.279 align:start position:0%
typically uh they the highest take-home
 
03:50:41.469 --> 03:50:41.479 align:start position:0%
uh earnings uh in a restaurant on um and
 
03:50:43.630 --> 03:50:43.640 align:start position:0%
so the the problem we have with the bill
 
03:50:47.070 --> 03:50:47.080 align:start position:0%
is increasing it from 45 to
 
03:50:50.990 --> 03:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
50% of uh the minimum yes the employer
 
03:50:55.189 --> 03:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
pays a low cash wage uh and they they
 
03:50:57.309 --> 03:50:57.319 align:start position:0%
make they take home most of their money
 
03:50:58.990 --> 03:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
in tips I mean that's how they earn
 
03:51:02.110 --> 03:51:02.120 align:start position:0%
their wages um but they're considered
 
03:51:05.590 --> 03:51:05.600 align:start position:0%
wages uh their tax the employer pays the
 
03:51:10.229 --> 03:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
the FICA tax on those tips so
 
03:51:14.349 --> 03:51:14.359 align:start position:0%
uh they're considered wages um and so we
 
03:51:16.349 --> 03:51:16.359 align:start position:0%
don't think it's necessary for the
 
03:51:18.309 --> 03:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
second part of the bill beginning on
 
03:51:21.950 --> 03:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
line 17 to increase uh the tip wage
 
03:51:24.670 --> 03:51:24.680 align:start position:0%
because again they're
 
03:51:27.910 --> 03:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
not minimum W they're their highest uh
 
03:51:31.070 --> 03:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
wage earners in the in the restaurant uh
 
03:51:33.750 --> 03:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
business so that's my testimone you
 
03:51:37.110 --> 03:51:37.120 align:start position:0%
probably have heard it 100 times uh I
 
03:51:38.710 --> 03:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
was saying something we should just cut
 
03:51:41.429 --> 03:51:41.439 align:start position:0%
right to the chase you guys exec vote 10
 
03:51:42.860 --> 03:51:42.870 align:start position:0%
to 10 we get this to the
 
03:51:42.870 --> 03:51:44.670 align:start position:0%
to 10 we get this to the
[Laughter]

03:51:44.670 --> 03:51:44.680 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:51:47.990 --> 03:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
floor thank you for the advice uh are
 
03:51:49.590 --> 03:51:49.600 align:start position:0%
there questions for this witness
 
03:51:51.149 --> 03:51:51.159 align:start position:0%
representative L
 
03:51:53.510 --> 03:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
Clair yeah thanks for your testimony and
 
03:51:56.590 --> 03:51:56.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my question would you be uh
 
03:51:58.950 --> 03:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
you said that right now it's 45% of the
 
03:52:00.349 --> 03:52:00.359 align:start position:0%
minimum wage the minimum wage for
 
03:52:03.670 --> 03:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
servers yes would you be okay with
 
03:52:06.550 --> 03:52:06.560 align:start position:0%
45% per increase or you wanted to just
 
03:52:09.349 --> 03:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
stay at what I wanted to keep where it
 
03:52:11.469 --> 03:52:11.479 align:start position:0%
is keep it where it is in the in the
 
03:52:14.469 --> 03:52:14.479 align:start position:0%
statute all right
 
03:52:17.030 --> 03:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
thanks uh representative
 
03:52:20.030 --> 03:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
kahill thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:52:23.189 --> 03:52:23.199 align:start position:0%
Mr Vu um I'm not confusing you with
 
03:52:25.510 --> 03:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner lers of the
 
03:52:27.830 --> 03:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
unemployment but could you tell me if uh
 
03:52:31.590 --> 03:52:31.600 align:start position:0%
do you know if if a if a uh server loses
 
03:52:33.670 --> 03:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
the job you know maybe the closes or
 
03:52:35.550 --> 03:52:35.560 align:start position:0%
something do you know if their benefits
 
03:52:38.429 --> 03:52:38.439 align:start position:0%
are calculated on their total wages or
 
03:52:40.349 --> 03:52:40.359 align:start position:0%
just the
 
03:52:44.389 --> 03:52:44.399 align:start position:0%
327 that they've been paid uh I can
 
03:52:47.910 --> 03:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
check um again it's a good question for
 
03:52:49.550 --> 03:52:49.560 align:start position:0%
um commissioner
 
03:52:54.309 --> 03:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
labors um I believe that I will check
 
03:52:56.670 --> 03:52:56.680 align:start position:0%
and confirming it back to you uh that
 
03:52:59.149 --> 03:52:59.159 align:start position:0%
it's on the total
 
03:53:02.830 --> 03:53:02.840 align:start position:0%
um total reported yeah total reported
 
03:53:02.840 --> 03:53:04.670 align:start position:0%
um total reported yeah total reported
thank

03:53:04.670 --> 03:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:53:07.950 --> 03:53:07.960 align:start position:0%
you further
 
03:53:07.960 --> 03:53:09.510 align:start position:0%
you further
questions

03:53:09.510 --> 03:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:53:19.750 --> 03:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:29.030 --> 03:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:31.229 --> 03:53:31.239 align:start position:0%
further indicate that when somebody
 
03:53:33.710 --> 03:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
works they have to work at least 80% of
 
03:53:33.720 --> 03:53:34.830 align:start position:0%
works they have to work at least 80% of
the

03:53:34.830 --> 03:53:34.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:53:39.389 --> 03:53:39.399 align:start position:0%
time oh as uh so if they were work more
 
03:53:39.399 --> 03:53:40.590 align:start position:0%
time oh as uh so if they were work more
than

03:53:40.590 --> 03:53:40.600 align:start position:0%
than
 
03:53:44.149 --> 03:53:44.159 align:start position:0%
20% not uh doing what a server typically
 
03:53:49.590 --> 03:53:49.600 align:start position:0%
does uh so I this camera here I think
 
03:53:51.229 --> 03:53:51.239 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about and
 
03:53:54.269 --> 03:53:54.279 align:start position:0%
referencing is if you have um a server
 
03:53:59.149 --> 03:53:59.159 align:start position:0%
come in uh a tip server uh coming in and
 
03:54:03.910 --> 03:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
there's an instance where um uh there
 
03:54:05.710 --> 03:54:05.720 align:start position:0%
may not be enough business and they have
 
03:54:09.670 --> 03:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
them doing what an hourly uh employee
 
03:54:12.349 --> 03:54:12.359 align:start position:0%
would typically do
 
03:54:16.149 --> 03:54:16.159 align:start position:0%
um uh which might be filling the salt
 
03:54:18.990 --> 03:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
shakers or whatever not uh dealing
 
03:54:22.830 --> 03:54:22.840 align:start position:0%
directly with customers um and uh the
 
03:54:25.870 --> 03:54:25.880 align:start position:0%
hourly rate uh that needs to be paid
 
03:54:27.830 --> 03:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
versus the
 
03:54:32.710 --> 03:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
327 doing that versus the 725 is that
 
03:54:36.229 --> 03:54:36.239 align:start position:0%
what you're referencing is that your
 
03:54:39.360 --> 03:54:39.370 align:start position:0%
so it's uh
 
03:54:39.370 --> 03:54:47.070 align:start position:0%
so it's uh
[Music]

03:54:47.070 --> 03:54:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:49.670 --> 03:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
employees correct and then their
 
03:54:52.910 --> 03:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
overtime rate is also based on they
 
03:54:55.710 --> 03:54:55.720 align:start position:0%
working they
 
03:54:55.720 --> 03:55:00.389 align:start position:0%
working they
that

03:55:00.389 --> 03:55:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:00.399 --> 03:55:01.990 align:start position:0%
 
Bas

03:55:01.990 --> 03:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
Bas
 
03:55:02.000 --> 03:55:04.030 align:start position:0%
Bas
correct

03:55:04.030 --> 03:55:04.040 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:55:06.670 --> 03:55:06.680 align:start position:0%
yeah any further questions
 
03:55:09.790 --> 03:55:09.800 align:start position:0%
representative Clair thank you
 
03:55:13.429 --> 03:55:13.439 align:start position:0%
um kind of going back to what I asked
 
03:55:15.469 --> 03:55:15.479 align:start position:0%
earlier and it might be a two-part
 
03:55:18.630 --> 03:55:18.640 align:start position:0%
question if I may yeah sure um the
 
03:55:20.229 --> 03:55:20.239 align:start position:0%
restaurant has to pay the difference
 
03:55:22.950 --> 03:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
between uh the tip wage and the minimum
 
03:55:25.269 --> 03:55:25.279 align:start position:0%
wage correct if they don't make it if
 
03:55:27.710 --> 03:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
they don't make it I I mean I I'm not
 
03:55:27.720 --> 03:55:29.510 align:start position:0%
they don't make it I I mean I I'm not
aware

03:55:29.510 --> 03:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
aware
 
03:55:33.309 --> 03:55:33.319 align:start position:0%
of of a lot in that happens right I get
 
03:55:35.750 --> 03:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
it so wouldn't it be wouldn't it benefit
 
03:55:38.469 --> 03:55:38.479 align:start position:0%
the employer if the minimum wage did go
 
03:55:38.479 --> 03:55:39.510 align:start position:0%
the employer if the minimum wage did go
up

03:55:39.510 --> 03:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
up
 
03:55:42.309 --> 03:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
that the minimum wage follow suit
 
03:55:44.990 --> 03:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
because then it would be less for that
 
03:55:48.790 --> 03:55:48.800 align:start position:0%
employer to have to
 
03:55:53.750 --> 03:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
fill uh again typically the amount of
 
03:56:00.389 --> 03:56:00.399 align:start position:0%
tips that a server gets uh is more than
 
03:56:02.349 --> 03:56:02.359 align:start position:0%
uh the minimum so the instance that you
 
03:56:07.070 --> 03:56:07.080 align:start position:0%
are citing I don't think occurs uh often
 
03:56:10.429 --> 03:56:10.439 align:start position:0%
right yeah well well if I may follow up
 
03:56:11.670 --> 03:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
kind of follow up to what um
 
03:56:13.590 --> 03:56:13.600 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie just spoke about
 
03:56:15.149 --> 03:56:15.159 align:start position:0%
you know if you have those couple hours
 
03:56:18.189 --> 03:56:18.199 align:start position:0%
where you're rolling silverware
 
03:56:20.910 --> 03:56:20.920 align:start position:0%
Etc now you have to pay the if the
 
03:56:22.229 --> 03:56:22.239 align:start position:0%
minimum wage would to go up you'd have
 
03:56:25.910 --> 03:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
to pay that I think instead uh you know
 
03:56:30.309 --> 03:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
a good uh business owner manager will
 
03:56:32.110 --> 03:56:32.120 align:start position:0%
manage it in such a way that he's going
 
03:56:33.389 --> 03:56:33.399 align:start position:0%
to make sure that he doesn't have
 
03:56:37.469 --> 03:56:37.479 align:start position:0%
servers coming in um right uh doing the
 
03:56:39.309 --> 03:56:39.319 align:start position:0%
kind of work that you're describing that
 
03:56:41.990 --> 03:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
he has the right people coming in doing
 
03:56:44.030 --> 03:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
the right jobs so yeah and it just
 
03:56:45.429 --> 03:56:45.439 align:start position:0%
depends on how busy the restaurant is at
 
03:56:49.070 --> 03:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
a particular time right right thank you
 
03:56:56.910 --> 03:56:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:58.870 --> 03:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
questions we're trying to find out if
 
03:57:07.590 --> 03:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:07.600 --> 03:57:34.429 align:start position:0%
 
question

03:57:34.429 --> 03:57:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:36.550 --> 03:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
and I I understand that that's the way
 
03:57:39.630 --> 03:57:39.640 align:start position:0%
we modify the house I'm just thinking
 
03:57:44.590 --> 03:57:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:46.950 --> 03:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
always than the
 
03:57:48.630 --> 03:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
current the
 
03:58:07.510 --> 03:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:07.520 --> 03:58:28.710 align:start position:0%
 
to

03:58:28.710 --> 03:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:30.070 --> 03:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
and you want to clarify for the
 
03:58:32.830 --> 03:58:32.840 align:start position:0%
committee it will
 
03:58:36.790 --> 03:58:36.800 align:start position:0%
be if this happens on future bills where
 
03:58:39.830 --> 03:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
people know
 
03:58:42.309 --> 03:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
uh one of the upcoming bills and want to
 
03:58:46.510 --> 03:58:46.520 align:start position:0%
debate I obviously can't stop
 
03:58:49.349 --> 03:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
that okay do you want to clarify for
 
03:58:52.790 --> 03:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
folks no that's goad um Mr ve good to
 
03:58:56.149 --> 03:58:56.159 align:start position:0%
see you as always um to clarify a little
 
03:58:58.429 --> 03:58:58.439 align:start position:0%
bit further from what the two previous
 
03:59:02.189 --> 03:59:02.199 align:start position:0%
reps were asking um I'm aware of at
 
03:59:04.670 --> 03:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
least five or six cases that the US
 
03:59:07.229 --> 03:59:07.239 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor has brought against
 
03:59:10.229 --> 03:59:10.239 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately new restaurants owners
 
03:59:13.269 --> 03:59:13.279 align:start position:0%
for not paying them
 
03:59:17.670 --> 03:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
properly um to follow up on what lir was
 
03:59:21.070 --> 03:59:21.080 align:start position:0%
suggesting wouldn't it just be better to
 
03:59:24.830 --> 03:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
um eliminate tipped wages in general so
 
03:59:27.189 --> 03:59:27.199 align:start position:0%
that this the large fines that
 
03:59:30.670 --> 03:59:30.680 align:start position:0%
restaurants uh are incurring um because
 
03:59:33.309 --> 03:59:33.319 align:start position:0%
that it is complicated and it's easy to
 
03:59:35.870 --> 03:59:35.880 align:start position:0%
do the wrong thing I guess wouldn't it
 
03:59:38.670 --> 03:59:38.680 align:start position:0%
just be better to get rid of tips wages
 
03:59:40.349 --> 03:59:40.359 align:start position:0%
knowing so many restaurants are paying a
 
03:59:42.790 --> 03:59:42.800 align:start position:0%
hefty fines thank you representative
 
03:59:46.750 --> 03:59:46.760 align:start position:0%
Schultz uh for the question uh that's a
 
03:59:49.990 --> 03:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
a big issue that we could talk uh for
 
03:59:52.070 --> 03:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
quite a bit on the whole business model
 
03:59:56.269 --> 03:59:56.279 align:start position:0%
the idea of uh having servers uh make
 
03:59:58.510 --> 03:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
the majority of their wages through tips
 
04:00:00.389 --> 04:00:00.399 align:start position:0%
I think that's your question should we
 
04:00:02.830 --> 04:00:02.840 align:start position:0%
continue to do that or should we just
 
04:00:05.790 --> 04:00:05.800 align:start position:0%
change the whole business model and have
 
04:00:09.670 --> 04:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
the servers make uh uh the minimum um I
 
04:00:13.070 --> 04:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
do know that years uh I think it was in
 
04:00:15.110 --> 04:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
the late
 
04:00:18.590 --> 04:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
201s I I can look at it but in
 
04:00:22.670 --> 04:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
Maine uh there was a ballot item to go
 
04:00:24.510 --> 04:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
to the minimum wage for the servers and
 
04:00:28.550 --> 04:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
it passed and a year later the servers
 
04:00:31.429 --> 04:00:31.439 align:start position:0%
showed up at the State House to ask that
 
04:00:33.229 --> 04:00:33.239 align:start position:0%
it be
 
04:00:36.750 --> 04:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
uh uh repealed than it was largely
 
04:00:39.030 --> 04:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
because they prefer
 
04:00:43.149 --> 04:00:43.159 align:start position:0%
to have the system where they make
 
04:00:45.469 --> 04:00:45.479 align:start position:0%
majority on their tips I think they and
 
04:00:46.790 --> 04:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
maybe it's because it's just the way
 
04:00:59.630 --> 04:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:02.469 --> 04:01:02.479 align:start position:0%
um follow I simply was gonna point out
 
04:01:03.870 --> 04:01:03.880 align:start position:0%
that's the exact same thing you raised
 
04:01:05.590 --> 04:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
the last time we talked about this you
 
04:01:08.429 --> 04:01:08.439 align:start position:0%
and I at one of these hearings um it is
 
04:01:11.349 --> 04:01:11.359 align:start position:0%
my understanding that polls of New
 
04:01:11.359 --> 04:01:12.269 align:start position:0%
my understanding that polls of New
Hampshire

04:01:12.269 --> 04:01:12.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:01:15.710 --> 04:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
servers um actually they're in support
 
04:01:17.429 --> 04:01:17.439 align:start position:0%
of getting rid of the tip wage
 
04:01:19.630 --> 04:01:19.640 align:start position:0%
designation I don't know had you heard
 
04:01:21.910 --> 04:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
that I don't know what polls but I'm
 
04:01:23.910 --> 04:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
sure there is a poll that you are
 
04:01:29.870 --> 04:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:33.309 --> 04:01:33.319 align:start position:0%
you representative McKenzie thank you uh
 
04:01:35.950 --> 04:01:35.960 align:start position:0%
uh one final question uh I had a
 
04:01:39.070 --> 04:01:39.080 align:start position:0%
professor in in grad school said you
 
04:01:40.510 --> 04:01:40.520 align:start position:0%
can't put a number on it it doesn't
 
04:01:43.950 --> 04:01:43.960 align:start position:0%
exist so in that line uh I've heard you
 
04:01:46.710 --> 04:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
come before this committee before and
 
04:01:50.429 --> 04:01:50.439 align:start position:0%
say that uh that the wages for tipped
 
04:01:52.670 --> 04:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
employees are such and such and they
 
04:01:55.110 --> 04:01:55.120 align:start position:0%
make more and that kind of stuff do you
 
04:01:57.910 --> 04:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
have empirical evidence have you done uh
 
04:02:01.189 --> 04:02:01.199 align:start position:0%
surveys uh are you able to prove that
 
04:02:02.670 --> 04:02:02.680 align:start position:0%
and lay that up because I'm not sure
 
04:02:03.710 --> 04:02:03.720 align:start position:0%
that's something that's going to be
 
04:02:05.469 --> 04:02:05.479 align:start position:0%
tracked necessarily by the finement
 
04:02:05.479 --> 04:02:06.349 align:start position:0%
tracked necessarily by the finement
public

04:02:06.349 --> 04:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:02:09.710 --> 04:02:09.720 align:start position:0%
security data uh so can you produce that
 
04:02:11.590 --> 04:02:11.600 align:start position:0%
for the commit yeah I mean I've talked
 
04:02:14.070 --> 04:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
to a lot of the restaurant operators and
 
04:02:16.189 --> 04:02:16.199 align:start position:0%
I've asked them that question what you
 
04:02:18.710 --> 04:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
know what uh are the tipped employees
 
04:02:21.870 --> 04:02:21.880 align:start position:0%
and again you've got the high-ends you
 
04:02:24.510 --> 04:02:24.520 align:start position:0%
know your copper door and Bedford those
 
04:02:27.790 --> 04:02:27.800 align:start position:0%
tip servers are going to be making 30
 
04:02:31.870 --> 04:02:31.880 align:start position:0%
some odd dollars an hour uh you got your
 
04:02:34.110 --> 04:02:34.120 align:start position:0%
mid-range uh and then you got your lower
 
04:02:39.149 --> 04:02:39.159 align:start position:0%
rate so there's clearly a range of um
 
04:02:42.429 --> 04:02:42.439 align:start position:0%
what tip servers are taking home and pay
 
04:02:45.910 --> 04:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh but in just about all the inst it's
 
04:02:47.950 --> 04:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
well above the minimum wage again my
 
04:02:50.550 --> 04:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
point here today is minimum wage is a
 
04:02:53.229 --> 04:02:53.239 align:start position:0%
protective piece of legislation Mr
 
04:02:59.790 --> 04:02:59.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:04.149 --> 04:03:04.159 align:start position:0%
okay your question was what I'm sorry I
 
04:03:05.070 --> 04:03:05.080 align:start position:0%
didn't answer your question
 
04:03:06.870 --> 04:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie um your question
 
04:03:12.670 --> 04:03:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:16.269 --> 04:03:16.279 align:start position:0%
um we've asked uh Employment Security um
 
04:03:18.630 --> 04:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
for that information um I don't think
 
04:03:22.830 --> 04:03:22.840 align:start position:0%
they have it but I guess I would
 
04:03:27.070 --> 04:03:27.080 align:start position:0%
ask when you go into a restaurant um
 
04:03:28.830 --> 04:03:28.840 align:start position:0%
maybe I pose the question to one of the
 
04:03:31.830 --> 04:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
servers that they take
 
04:03:36.710 --> 04:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
on so I could thank you Mr chair
 
04:03:40.030 --> 04:03:40.040 align:start position:0%
so if I take what I can take away from
 
04:03:42.070 --> 04:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
that is that there is that you have not
 
04:03:43.750 --> 04:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
surveyed the restaurants you don't
 
04:03:46.469 --> 04:03:46.479 align:start position:0%
necessarily have empirical evidence to
 
04:03:48.710 --> 04:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
support which you have said on more than
 
04:03:50.269 --> 04:03:50.279 align:start position:0%
one occasion in front of this committee
 
04:03:52.790 --> 04:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
that they make so much more money uh
 
04:03:54.670 --> 04:03:54.680 align:start position:0%
which leads one to believe that
 
04:03:56.990 --> 04:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
everybody in that industry is making
 
04:03:59.389 --> 04:03:59.399 align:start position:0%
those kinds of things like a Copa do so
 
04:04:00.910 --> 04:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
if if you don't have it you don't have
 
04:04:04.189 --> 04:04:04.199 align:start position:0%
it um but I think it uh you know my
 
04:04:07.469 --> 04:04:07.479 align:start position:0%
sense is that it would be helpful uh for
 
04:04:10.910 --> 04:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
this commit to understand U you know if
 
04:04:14.309 --> 04:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
that's actually a true uh representation
 
04:04:16.429 --> 04:04:16.439 align:start position:0%
what's happening in thank you I know the
 
04:04:18.510 --> 04:04:18.520 align:start position:0%
National Restaurant Association does a
 
04:04:20.990 --> 04:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
lot I mean the New Hampshire Restaurant
 
04:04:23.630 --> 04:04:23.640 align:start position:0%
Association is a small outfit they got
 
04:04:25.950 --> 04:04:25.960 align:start position:0%
five people um they're not doing all
 
04:04:28.269 --> 04:04:28.279 align:start position:0%
these empirical studies but the National
 
04:04:30.550 --> 04:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
Restaurant Association which has more
 
04:04:32.870 --> 04:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
resources I think has done some of that
 
04:04:35.389 --> 04:04:35.399 align:start position:0%
and I can try to get you National Data
 
04:04:37.710 --> 04:04:37.720 align:start position:0%
which it's all pretty much the same the
 
04:04:39.710 --> 04:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
IND industry pretty much operates the
 
04:04:42.469 --> 04:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
same um so I can get you some empirical
 
04:04:45.229 --> 04:04:45.239 align:start position:0%
data it won't probably be New Hampshire
 
04:04:47.910 --> 04:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
Pacific uh because the New Hampshire
 
04:04:50.429 --> 04:04:50.439 align:start position:0%
Association isn't some large operation
 
04:04:53.510 --> 04:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty small operation thank you
 
04:04:55.750 --> 04:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
Mr are there any other questions
 
04:04:55.760 --> 04:04:57.269 align:start position:0%
Mr are there any other questions
representative

04:04:57.269 --> 04:04:57.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:05:01.030 --> 04:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
love thank you for taking my question
 
04:05:05.070 --> 04:05:05.080 align:start position:0%
um if if to keep the numbers round if a
 
04:05:07.670 --> 04:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
a small restaurant has 10 employees and
 
04:05:11.030 --> 04:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh the uh the the difference in in wages
 
04:05:14.710 --> 04:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
say $200 an employee and we got a $2,000
 
04:05:19.030 --> 04:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
a week um difference here uh who's who's
 
04:05:21.670 --> 04:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
going to be supporting that who's who's
 
04:05:24.670 --> 04:05:24.680 align:start position:0%
going to be paying that uh the
 
04:05:27.349 --> 04:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
customer and uh
 
04:05:31.670 --> 04:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
follow uh how much would that uh how
 
04:05:33.349 --> 04:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
much trouble that that put on these
 
04:05:36.229 --> 04:05:36.239 align:start position:0%
small businesses to to stay in business
 
04:05:37.990 --> 04:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
um you know in in today's business
 
04:05:40.389 --> 04:05:40.399 align:start position:0%
climate oh you're talking about if we
 
04:05:43.630 --> 04:05:43.640 align:start position:0%
moved the tipped wage up to the minimum
 
04:05:46.429 --> 04:05:46.439 align:start position:0%
and what the impact would be I mean yeah
 
04:05:48.349 --> 04:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
ultimately um if you're going to
 
04:05:51.030 --> 04:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
radically change the business model and
 
04:05:52.590 --> 04:05:52.600 align:start position:0%
have the tipped employees pay the
 
04:05:55.429 --> 04:05:55.439 align:start position:0%
minimum then um it's got to come out of
 
04:05:57.630 --> 04:05:57.640 align:start position:0%
someplace and it'll come through the
 
04:05:57.640 --> 04:06:00.229 align:start position:0%
someplace and it'll come through the
menu

04:06:00.229 --> 04:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:03.110 --> 04:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
prices because the margins aren't big in
 
04:06:03.120 --> 04:06:05.269 align:start position:0%
prices because the margins aren't big in
the

04:06:05.269 --> 04:06:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:08.269 --> 04:06:08.279 align:start position:0%
industry just one more followup just to
 
04:06:11.590 --> 04:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
just to clarify uh so so a small small
 
04:06:13.550 --> 04:06:13.560 align:start position:0%
business small restaurant would have a
 
04:06:15.590 --> 04:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
very difficult time staying in business
 
04:06:18.389 --> 04:06:18.399 align:start position:0%
if their their prices kept going up and
 
04:06:20.990 --> 04:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know for I mean uh it's different
 
04:06:23.189 --> 04:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
for we heard from a uh restaurant
 
04:06:25.590 --> 04:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
operator in Manchester uh that she does
 
04:06:28.110 --> 04:06:28.120 align:start position:0%
it um and that's that's pretty
 
04:06:30.790 --> 04:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
impressive that's good um there were
 
04:06:32.830 --> 04:06:32.840 align:start position:0%
some me members of the New Hampshire
 
04:06:34.429 --> 04:06:34.439 align:start position:0%
lodging restaurant associate that tried
 
04:06:36.630 --> 04:06:36.640 align:start position:0%
it in Dober worked for a little while
 
04:06:39.710 --> 04:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
and then they they went back back uh to
 
04:06:45.149 --> 04:06:45.159 align:start position:0%
the the uh C minimum cash wage but um
 
04:06:47.349 --> 04:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
it's probably um maybe a marketing
 
04:06:49.389 --> 04:06:49.399 align:start position:0%
Advantage for her which is good I don't
 
04:06:52.349 --> 04:06:52.359 align:start position:0%
know but for a lot of do you answer your
 
04:06:53.510 --> 04:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
question I got to start answering
 
04:06:56.550 --> 04:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
questions directly um yeah I'm sure it's
 
04:06:58.349 --> 04:06:58.359 align:start position:0%
going to be it would be difficult for a
 
04:07:01.229 --> 04:07:01.239 align:start position:0%
lot of small
 
04:07:04.269 --> 04:07:04.279 align:start position:0%
operators any f ah we have more
 
04:07:06.269 --> 04:07:06.279 align:start position:0%
questions representative kahill thank
 
04:07:09.269 --> 04:07:09.279 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you m Mr veu for
 
04:07:13.189 --> 04:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
uh taking yet another question
 
04:07:16.990 --> 04:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
um uh a a restaurant owner that I'm
 
04:07:18.870 --> 04:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
aware of I think we when we talked about
 
04:07:21.630 --> 04:07:21.640 align:start position:0%
tip wages previously said something
 
04:07:23.910 --> 04:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
about that they raise prices 6% every
 
04:07:26.750 --> 04:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
year that's just sort of normal and I
 
04:07:31.349 --> 04:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
know that with all the uh Supply
 
04:07:33.990 --> 04:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
problems and cost of you know eggs Food
 
04:07:35.950 --> 04:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
everything else that prices have also
 
04:07:38.510 --> 04:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
gone up and that the yes the customer
 
04:07:40.990 --> 04:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
has paid for that and they continue to
 
04:07:42.389 --> 04:07:42.399 align:start position:0%
do that because the restaurant industry
 
04:07:45.309 --> 04:07:45.319 align:start position:0%
is having a pretty good year um but
 
04:07:47.189 --> 04:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
isn't as also true that when you when
 
04:07:50.429 --> 04:07:50.439 align:start position:0%
the restaurant prices go up the taxes
 
04:07:53.750 --> 04:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
now8 and a half% uh the state receives
 
04:07:55.510 --> 04:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
more revenue and the restaurant
 
04:07:58.950 --> 04:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
operators get the 3% of that tax so they
 
04:08:01.870 --> 04:08:01.880 align:start position:0%
also get another little incentive uh it
 
04:08:03.710 --> 04:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't sort of doesn't that soften the
 
04:08:05.349 --> 04:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
blow of the
 
04:08:08.109 --> 04:08:08.119 align:start position:0%
increase I so I think representative
 
04:08:10.910 --> 04:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
Cahill is referring to an issue that
 
04:08:12.870 --> 04:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
comes up in the Ways and Means Committee
 
04:08:15.790 --> 04:08:15.800 align:start position:0%
a lot uh with the rooms and males tax so
 
04:08:20.030 --> 04:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
he's referring to um so the restaurant
 
04:08:21.630 --> 04:08:21.640 align:start position:0%
operator collects a rooms of mailes tax
 
04:08:24.950 --> 04:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
for the state and uh when it was uh
 
04:08:28.269 --> 04:08:28.279 align:start position:0%
initiated back in the 60s or whatever it
 
04:08:32.149 --> 04:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
was uh they said if you in the statute
 
04:08:34.269 --> 04:08:34.279 align:start position:0%
it says you have to pay you have to
 
04:08:37.309 --> 04:08:37.319 align:start position:0%
remit the taxes to the state by the 15th
 
04:08:39.269 --> 04:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
day of of the following month and if you
 
04:08:43.309 --> 04:08:43.319 align:start position:0%
do so you can retain 3% of the tax
 
04:08:45.189 --> 04:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
collected that's you're referring to
 
04:08:48.269 --> 04:08:48.279 align:start position:0%
you're saying when menu prices go up and
 
04:08:52.070 --> 04:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah and that 3% grows it's
 
04:08:56.149 --> 04:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
not a lot of money um but if you want me
 
04:08:58.710 --> 04:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
to say you're correct I'll say you're
 
04:09:02.109 --> 04:09:02.119 align:start position:0%
correct thank you Mr ve is it also true
 
04:09:03.710 --> 04:09:03.720 align:start position:0%
that that
 
04:09:06.830 --> 04:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
05% uh lowering of that reals and rooms
 
04:09:08.590 --> 04:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
tax also
 
04:09:11.269 --> 04:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
uh reduce the amount the the uh
 
04:09:13.750 --> 04:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
customers were able to keep you mean the
 
04:09:17.309 --> 04:09:17.319 align:start position:0%
business yeah yeah I mean it's largely
 
04:09:20.630 --> 04:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
so when you think about most people put
 
04:09:23.349 --> 04:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
uh they they pay for the meals uh with a
 
04:09:25.309 --> 04:09:25.319 align:start position:0%
credit card right most people pay a
 
04:09:27.189 --> 04:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
credit card
 
04:09:30.429 --> 04:09:30.439 align:start position:0%
well there's a there's a uh what is it
 
04:09:32.750 --> 04:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
for the rates that you pay the credit
 
04:09:35.710 --> 04:09:35.720 align:start position:0%
card companies just keep going up and so
 
04:09:39.149 --> 04:09:39.159 align:start position:0%
we're collecting this tax for the state
 
04:09:40.950 --> 04:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
and the business operator has that
 
04:09:43.189 --> 04:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
expense of having to pay the credit card
 
04:09:47.590 --> 04:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
company for taking the credit card so
 
04:09:50.109 --> 04:09:50.119 align:start position:0%
the businesses aren't making money on
 
04:09:52.590 --> 04:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
the 3% they're basically just covering
 
04:09:57.910 --> 04:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:00.510 --> 04:10:00.520 align:start position:0%
state so pay so bring cash when you go
 
04:10:02.750 --> 04:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
to the restaurant then yes then you'll
 
04:10:05.109 --> 04:10:05.119 align:start position:0%
be doing your restaurant operator a
 
04:10:07.189 --> 04:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
service you're on the record bring cash
 
04:10:08.950 --> 04:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:10:11.469 --> 04:10:11.479 align:start position:0%
are there more
 
04:10:24.710 --> 04:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:29.670 --> 04:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
oh again in this case we have we'll have
 
04:10:31.910 --> 04:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to debate this bill when
 
04:10:33.790 --> 04:10:33.800 align:start position:0%
it comes to the committee we have a
 
04:10:36.229 --> 04:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
number of other people who have come
 
04:10:38.030 --> 04:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
here to testify
 
04:10:41.870 --> 04:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
I um have signed in we're we're past the
 
04:10:45.269 --> 04:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
time allotted to this bill if
 
04:10:48.990 --> 04:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
you really feel we need to discuss that
 
04:10:52.109 --> 04:10:52.119 align:start position:0%
issue I would offer that maybe we can
 
04:10:55.309 --> 04:10:55.319 align:start position:0%
call the sponsor up after we get through
 
04:10:57.950 --> 04:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
the other people who are waiting in line
 
04:11:00.630 --> 04:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
um so at this point questions to the
 
04:11:04.389 --> 04:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
person who is speaking please and and
 
04:11:06.030 --> 04:11:06.040 align:start position:0%

04:11:08.750 --> 04:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
going to be part of a debate and you
 
04:11:10.870 --> 04:11:10.880 align:start position:0%

04:11:13.630 --> 04:11:13.640 align:start position:0%
bill we will have time in committee to

Hampshire United Church of Christ
 
04:11:39.469 --> 04:11:39.479 align:start position:0%
speaking in support of the bill for
 
04:11:39.479 --> 04:11:46.590 align:start position:0%

three

04:11:46.590 --> 04:11:46.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:48.870 --> 04:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you Mr chair and members
 
04:11:50.510 --> 04:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
04:11:53.429 --> 04:11:53.439 align:start position:0%
is Gail Kenny I'm a resident of Kanan
 
04:11:55.349 --> 04:11:55.359 align:start position:0%
and I am a pastor with the United Church
 
04:11:58.189 --> 04:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
of Christ um the United Church of Christ
 
04:12:00.189 --> 04:12:00.199 align:start position:0%
um many of you may also you know know
 
04:12:01.950 --> 04:12:01.960 align:start position:0%
the individual churches as local
 
04:12:04.109 --> 04:12:04.119 align:start position:0%
congregational churches it is the
 
04:12:07.510 --> 04:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
largest Protestant denomination in New
 
04:12:10.990 --> 04:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um the the UCC we also
 
04:12:12.830 --> 04:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
known as the UCC so I'm I'll probably
 
04:12:15.710 --> 04:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
use that so um UCC members and churches
 
04:12:17.590 --> 04:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
were shocked back in
 
04:12:20.349 --> 04:12:20.359 align:start position:0%
2011 on when the uh New Hampshire
 
04:12:21.790 --> 04:12:21.800 align:start position:0%
legislature the general court at the
 
04:12:23.910 --> 04:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
time in its wisdom decided to wipe a
 
04:12:27.229 --> 04:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
minimum wage statute off the books and
 
04:12:29.510 --> 04:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
um so we thought that okay maybe this is
 
04:12:31.750 --> 04:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
just a fluke and that it will be
 
04:12:33.590 --> 04:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
corrected when a new legislature comes
 
04:12:36.990 --> 04:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
to town so um 2013 rolled around and
 
04:12:40.109 --> 04:12:40.119 align:start position:0%
nothing happened and so and then 2014
 
04:12:42.870 --> 04:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
the second year of the session and so um
 
04:12:47.830 --> 04:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
the the um the UCC as a whole in a um a
 
04:12:50.630 --> 04:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
Statewide Gathering passed a very
 
04:12:52.149 --> 04:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
strongly worded resolution that I've
 
04:12:53.750 --> 04:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
actually given to this committee over
 
04:12:55.590 --> 04:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
time so I won't do it again for the sake
 
04:12:59.030 --> 04:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
of paper um but very strong resolution
 
04:13:02.030 --> 04:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
urging a reinstatement of uh minimum
 
04:13:04.870 --> 04:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
wage and moving expeditiously toward a
 
04:13:07.590 --> 04:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
living wage for New Hampshire workers um
 
04:13:10.149 --> 04:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
so because I've heard before uh in this
 
04:13:11.830 --> 04:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
committee and elsewhere that oh well a
 
04:13:13.469 --> 04:13:13.479 align:start position:0%
minimum wage is just a training wage
 
04:13:15.750 --> 04:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
it's just for kids um I want to just
 
04:13:17.109 --> 04:13:17.119 align:start position:0%
State for the record again that the
 
04:13:19.469 --> 04:13:19.479 align:start position:0%
minimum wage was never intended when it
 
04:13:22.309 --> 04:13:22.319 align:start position:0%
was first um implemented um way back
 
04:13:24.590 --> 04:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
when to be a training wage it was meant
 
04:13:28.830 --> 04:13:28.840 align:start position:0%
to be a floor below which no full-time
 
04:13:31.750 --> 04:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
worker should ever fall um to a point
 
04:13:33.229 --> 04:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
where they couldn't meet their basic
 
04:13:35.910 --> 04:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
needs um so it was meant to be the
 
04:13:37.790 --> 04:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
minimum that would allow somebody to
 
04:13:41.349 --> 04:13:41.359 align:start position:0%
live and allow somebody to thrive so um
 
04:13:44.870 --> 04:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
so for 15 years now first with the the
 
04:13:46.309 --> 04:13:46.319 align:start position:0%
wage on the books in New Hampshire at
 
04:13:50.309 --> 04:13:50.319 align:start position:0%
725 back in 2011 and then since then um
 
04:13:53.070 --> 04:13:53.080 align:start position:0%
there has been just an absolute refusal
 
04:13:56.910 --> 04:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
on the part of um the the legislature to
 
04:13:59.790 --> 04:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
do anything about that floor knowing
 
04:14:03.109 --> 04:14:03.119 align:start position:0%
full well that if 725 was an appropriate
 
04:14:07.670 --> 04:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
floor uh um in 2009 it is no we're near
 
04:14:08.870 --> 04:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
that in
 
04:14:11.870 --> 04:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
2024 so my question is what is the
 
04:14:14.229 --> 04:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
message uh that this legislature is
 
04:14:16.189 --> 04:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
sending to workers who want to come into
 
04:14:18.229 --> 04:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and to Young workers that
 
04:14:19.950 --> 04:14:19.960 align:start position:0%
we are in desperate need of in this
 
04:14:22.830 --> 04:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
state and by indicating through just a
 
04:14:25.030 --> 04:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
refusal even to reinstate a minimum wage
 
04:14:28.269 --> 04:14:28.279 align:start position:0%
and to do anything about it um that it
 
04:14:30.550 --> 04:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
the message to me is that New Hampshire
 
04:14:35.030 --> 04:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
devalues work and so um as a as a basic
 
04:14:37.830 --> 04:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
matter of public policy
 
04:14:41.710 --> 04:14:41.720 align:start position:0%
um we the the United Church of Christ
 
04:14:43.910 --> 04:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
strongly strongly strongly urges this
 
04:14:46.189 --> 04:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
committee this time around not to do the
 
04:14:47.750 --> 04:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
same old thing but to think very
 
04:14:51.030 --> 04:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
seriously about what is the message that
 
04:14:54.710 --> 04:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
this the the green um portion that um
 
04:14:56.870 --> 04:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
represent the sponsor provided to all of
 
04:14:58.830 --> 04:14:58.840 align:start position:0%
you look at the numbers it is an
 
04:15:01.469 --> 04:15:01.479 align:start position:0%
embarrassment for New Hampshire to be
 
04:15:04.309 --> 04:15:04.319 align:start position:0%
where we are um less than 50% of what
 
04:15:06.630 --> 04:15:06.640 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage is in um Connecticut
 
04:15:08.590 --> 04:15:08.600 align:start position:0%
and M Massachusetts that that's really a
 
04:15:11.349 --> 04:15:11.359 align:start position:0%
moral atrocity um and I just the final
 
04:15:12.870 --> 04:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
thing I want to say about the bill is
 
04:15:15.389 --> 04:15:15.399 align:start position:0%
that we really we look at this bill um
 
04:15:17.389 --> 04:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
and we appreciate um the fact that it's
 
04:15:19.550 --> 04:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
being introduced um yet again it is
 
04:15:22.349 --> 04:15:22.359 align:start position:0%
modest frankly it is nowhere near enough
 
04:15:24.149 --> 04:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
and we recognize that for people in New
 
04:15:26.469 --> 04:15:26.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to thrive but it's a start and
 
04:15:29.389 --> 04:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
we really encourage you to uh to look at
 
04:15:32.149 --> 04:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
this seriously and to make this start
 
04:15:33.790 --> 04:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
for the sake of all workers in New
 
04:15:35.710 --> 04:15:35.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire just sort of one final thing I
 
04:15:40.550 --> 04:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
want to say is that um if workers
 
04:15:42.550 --> 04:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
particularly in the lodging and
 
04:15:45.790 --> 04:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
restaurant industry are doing so well
 
04:15:48.149 --> 04:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
and if Employers in order to just get
 
04:15:49.670 --> 04:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
workers so they don't have to close
 
04:15:51.830 --> 04:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
their doors have to pay much more than
 
04:15:55.269 --> 04:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
the minimum already then what difference
 
04:15:57.990 --> 04:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
does it make what will it matter to
 
04:16:00.590 --> 04:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
those businesses to raise the minimum
 
04:16:03.149 --> 04:16:03.159 align:start position:0%
wage and make it a living wage um that
 
04:16:05.269 --> 04:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
would affect you know not just them but
 
04:16:06.710 --> 04:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
those businesses who are already playing
 
04:16:08.910 --> 04:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
pay much more than that but to all the
 
04:16:11.950 --> 04:16:11.960 align:start position:0%
other people that are still making $725
 
04:16:16.510 --> 04:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
or $8 or $825 or $9 an hour I I don't
 
04:16:18.590 --> 04:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
understand the opposition at this point
 
04:16:20.830 --> 04:16:20.840 align:start position:0%
when the um lodging and restaurant
 
04:16:22.550 --> 04:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
employers are already doing so well and
 
04:16:24.790 --> 04:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
paying so well but I thank you for your
 
04:16:28.950 --> 04:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
time and I would very very um strongly
 
04:16:30.950 --> 04:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
implore you on the behalf of the United
 
04:16:32.590 --> 04:16:32.600 align:start position:0%

04:17:21.510 --> 04:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
believe that every worker deserves
 
04:17:23.590 --> 04:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
respect and a living wage for their
 
04:17:26.189 --> 04:17:26.199 align:start position:0%
labor every member of the society should
 
04:17:26.199 --> 04:17:27.349 align:start position:0%
labor every member of the society should
feel

04:17:27.349 --> 04:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
feel
 
04:17:29.870 --> 04:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
valued and be able to earn a decent
 
04:17:31.950 --> 04:17:31.960 align:start position:0%
living that allows them to provide basic
 
04:17:33.870 --> 04:17:33.880 align:start position:0%

04:17:44.510 --> 04:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
Fields highlight the intersectionality
 
04:17:47.269 --> 04:17:47.279 align:start position:0%
of these areas supporting what our
 
04:17:50.030 --> 04:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
Common Sense already tells us people who
 
04:17:52.030 --> 04:17:52.040 align:start position:0%
are financially secure have better
 
04:17:55.109 --> 04:17:55.119 align:start position:0%
health because they are food and housing
 
04:17:57.870 --> 04:17:57.880 align:start position:0%
secure that allows them to be able to be
 
04:18:00.510 --> 04:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
better Learners and be because they can
 
04:18:02.510 --> 04:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
focus on the subject at hand rather than
 
04:18:04.189 --> 04:18:04.199 align:start position:0%
worrying about their hunger or how
 
04:18:06.189 --> 04:18:06.199 align:start position:0%
they're going to pay their bills
 
04:18:08.469 --> 04:18:08.479 align:start position:0%
reliable transportation and good health
 
04:18:11.149 --> 04:18:11.159 align:start position:0%
lead to better attendance and all these
 
04:18:13.710 --> 04:18:13.720 align:start position:0%
lead to better job performance more
 
04:18:16.309 --> 04:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
productive workers benefit the economy
 
04:18:18.670 --> 04:18:18.680 align:start position:0%
and workers who feel valued and don't
 
04:18:20.870 --> 04:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
have to worry about food housing Health
 
04:18:23.309 --> 04:18:23.319 align:start position:0%
transportation and Financial Security
 
04:18:25.429 --> 04:18:25.439 align:start position:0%
can devote more time to enriching the
 
04:18:26.670 --> 04:18:26.680 align:start position:0%
lives of their families and
 
04:18:29.550 --> 04:18:29.560 align:start position:0%
participating in in their communities I
 
04:18:31.269 --> 04:18:31.279 align:start position:0%
don't think this is a polyana view of
 
04:18:33.469 --> 04:18:33.479 align:start position:0%
the world I think this is a moral view
 
04:18:37.149 --> 04:18:37.159 align:start position:0%
where every human H has a right to earn
 
04:18:39.189 --> 04:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
a decent living to be respected to be
 
04:18:41.030 --> 04:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
given dignity for their positive
 
04:18:42.790 --> 04:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
contributions to their family work and
 
04:18:45.469 --> 04:18:45.479 align:start position:0%
Community because they are human
 
04:18:48.070 --> 04:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
beings unfortunately in New Hampshire
 
04:18:50.109 --> 04:18:50.119 align:start position:0%
this is a right that is shared by maybe
 
04:18:51.189 --> 04:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
half of our
 
04:18:54.349 --> 04:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
workers you've already heard a lot about
 
04:18:58.630 --> 04:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
the um MIT living wage calculator we've
 
04:19:01.389 --> 04:19:01.399 align:start position:0%
spoken about that today and
 
04:19:04.229 --> 04:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
previously um that means that people
 
04:19:07.189 --> 04:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
would have to be earning at least 20 $
 
04:19:09.990 --> 04:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
an hour if you have a two adult working
 
04:19:14.389 --> 04:19:14.399 align:start position:0%
family and supporting themselves and a
 
04:19:18.670 --> 04:19:18.680 align:start position:0%
child we also know that and and I would
 
04:19:21.750 --> 04:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
add to that that that calculator was
 
04:19:25.910 --> 04:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
based using uh an amount of only a
 
04:19:29.670 --> 04:19:29.680 align:start position:0%
little under $1,400 for housing where we
 
04:19:31.590 --> 04:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
already know that housing in New
 
04:19:33.750 --> 04:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for a two-bedroom apartment is
 
04:19:38.950 --> 04:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
over $1,700 a month in addition we have
 
04:19:40.830 --> 04:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
one in four households in New Hampshire
 
04:19:45.030 --> 04:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
that earn less than $50,000 a year and
 
04:19:49.429 --> 04:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
177% are under $35,000 a year this puts
 
04:19:51.389 --> 04:19:51.399 align:start position:0%
an enormous Financial pressure on these
 
04:19:54.429 --> 04:19:54.439 align:start position:0%
families to meet basic needs of food and
 
04:19:59.189 --> 04:19:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:02.590 --> 04:20:02.600 align:start position:0%
else in terms of hourly wages I already
 
04:20:05.109 --> 04:20:05.119 align:start position:0%
said that a living wage in New Hampshire
 
04:20:08.349 --> 04:20:08.359 align:start position:0%
is well over $20 an hour if if you have
 
04:20:11.149 --> 04:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
two people contributing to the household
 
04:20:13.269 --> 04:20:13.279 align:start position:0%
um and I just want to point out that the
 
04:20:16.870 --> 04:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
poverty rate in New Hampshire is $1
 
04:20:20.630 --> 04:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
15,22 for a single person if you divide
 
04:20:24.469 --> 04:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
that by 2,000 hours of work a year that
 
04:20:27.149 --> 04:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
comes out to an hourly wage of over
 
04:20:29.870 --> 04:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
$760 which means it's above the minimum
 
04:20:31.469 --> 04:20:31.479 align:start position:0%
wage that we have in New Hampshire in
 
04:20:33.590 --> 04:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
other words we consider our minimum wage
 
04:20:35.950 --> 04:20:35.960 align:start position:0%
a poverty wage we're accepting that and
 
04:20:38.550 --> 04:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
I don't think that that's
 
04:20:42.670 --> 04:20:42.680 align:start position:0%
right we have um we've already heard
 
04:20:45.269 --> 04:20:45.279 align:start position:0%
about the the minimum people earning the
 
04:20:47.870 --> 04:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
minimum wage poverty and financial
 
04:20:50.630 --> 04:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
insecurity are very real in our state we
 
04:20:53.229 --> 04:20:53.239 align:start position:0%
have a 7% poverty rate in New Hampshire
 
04:20:54.950 --> 04:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
which we probably think of as being
 
04:20:57.149 --> 04:20:57.159 align:start position:0%
pretty good because it's a it's among
 
04:21:00.229 --> 04:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
the lowest in the country I question
 
04:21:02.309 --> 04:21:02.319 align:start position:0%
from a moral perspective if any poverty
 
04:21:03.349 --> 04:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
rate is
 
04:21:05.790 --> 04:21:05.800 align:start position:0%
acceptable the poverty picture in New
 
04:21:08.950 --> 04:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire very Aries by County Coos and
 
04:21:11.550 --> 04:21:11.560 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County having well over 11%
 
04:21:14.309 --> 04:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
poverty and by groups more men and women
 
04:21:16.630 --> 04:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
and more men and um women and children
 
04:21:19.590 --> 04:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
are in poverty than men and the elderly
 
04:21:22.309 --> 04:21:22.319 align:start position:0%
rate is currently about 7% but if we
 
04:21:24.469 --> 04:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
talk to anybody who works with elderly
 
04:21:26.670 --> 04:21:26.680 align:start position:0%
people it is
 
04:21:29.429 --> 04:21:29.439 align:start position:0%
rising the largest number of poor people
 
04:21:31.990 --> 04:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
are actually in a county that doesn't
 
04:21:33.870 --> 04:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
have a lot of doesn't have a high
 
04:21:35.950 --> 04:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
poverty rate Hillsboro County and that's
 
04:21:39.670 --> 04:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:41.990 --> 04:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
population and among those who live in
 
04:21:44.149 --> 04:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
poverty one and three are disabled so
 
04:21:46.149 --> 04:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
working one's way out of poverty isn't
 
04:21:48.630 --> 04:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
always an option if one is disabled or
 
04:21:50.750 --> 04:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
elderly or can't find affordable child
 
04:21:52.750 --> 04:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
care or doesn't have reliable
 
04:21:55.510 --> 04:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
transportation or has a part-time job
 
04:21:57.710 --> 04:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
with unpredictable schedule and can't
 
04:22:00.189 --> 04:22:00.199 align:start position:0%
schedule a new second job they can't
 
04:22:01.910 --> 04:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
work their way
 
04:22:04.030 --> 04:22:04.040 align:start position:0%
out the other thing I'd like to bring to
 
04:22:05.830 --> 04:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
your attention is that one and three
 
04:22:09.469 --> 04:22:09.479 align:start position:0%
granite Staters last year said that it
 
04:22:13.070 --> 04:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
was difficult or very difficult to meet
 
04:22:17.910 --> 04:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
normal household expenses one and three
 
04:22:20.870 --> 04:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
27% of New Hampshire households do not
 
04:22:23.510 --> 04:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
have $2,000 in savings I have a friend
 
04:22:25.189 --> 04:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
who was considering going into
 
04:22:27.189 --> 04:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy because she couldn't pay off
 
04:22:27.199 --> 04:22:27.830 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy because she couldn't pay off
a

04:22:27.830 --> 04:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:22:31.429 --> 04:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:35.269 --> 04:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
bill and we all know the kind of um what
 
04:22:36.870 --> 04:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
that would do to her credit crit rating
 
04:22:38.870 --> 04:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
for years to
 
04:22:38.880 --> 04:22:40.710 align:start position:0%
for years to
come

04:22:40.710 --> 04:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
come
 
04:22:44.469 --> 04:22:44.479 align:start position:0%
so um we've we're past the major part of
 
04:22:46.950 --> 04:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
the pandemic when people had a lot of
 
04:22:46.960 --> 04:22:48.030 align:start position:0%
the pandemic when people had a lot of
extra

04:22:48.030 --> 04:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
extra
 
04:22:51.550 --> 04:22:51.560 align:start position:0%
income and what's H and wages have
 
04:22:53.349 --> 04:22:53.359 align:start position:0%
increased but they haven't kept up with
 
04:22:57.070 --> 04:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
inflation and two places where they have
 
04:22:59.349 --> 04:22:59.359 align:start position:0%
where they have not kept up is in
 
04:23:02.070 --> 04:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
education and in health services and
 
04:23:04.870 --> 04:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
those two areas are among our largest
 
04:23:08.790 --> 04:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
employers in this State and the places
 
04:23:11.309 --> 04:23:11.319 align:start position:0%
where we constantly need more
 
04:23:14.429 --> 04:23:14.439 align:start position:0%
workers so I really encourage you please
 
04:23:16.990 --> 04:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
to consider raising the minimum wage
 
04:23:20.269 --> 04:23:20.279 align:start position:0%
this $17 an hour we know is not a living
 
04:23:22.710 --> 04:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
wage but it's a vast improvement over
 
04:23:26.189 --> 04:23:26.199 align:start position:0%
where we are now the tipped uh W moving
 
04:23:29.149 --> 04:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
the tipped wages to 50% would also be a
 
04:23:32.790 --> 04:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
big help to our least paid workers and
 
04:23:35.030 --> 04:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
um the economic policy Institute points
 
04:23:39.070 --> 04:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
out that uh this bill would improve the
 
04:23:42.910 --> 04:23:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:46.950 --> 04:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
124,000 people or one in six Granite
 
04:23:49.229 --> 04:23:49.239 align:start position:0%
State Workers please vote this bill
 
04:23:51.830 --> 04:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
ought to pass thank you thank you for
 
04:23:55.630 --> 04:23:55.640 align:start position:0%

and the former mayor I'm also the
 
04:24:45.030 --> 04:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
grafting County
 
04:24:47.189 --> 04:24:47.199 align:start position:0%
Treasurer I think when I was first
 
04:24:51.429 --> 04:24:51.439 align:start position:0%
elected in 2005 $15 was designated as
 
04:24:54.910 --> 04:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
the um living wage at the time so 20
 
04:24:57.550 --> 04:24:57.560 align:start position:0%
years later I can imagine that what uh
 
04:25:00.429 --> 04:25:00.439 align:start position:0%
the previous uh testimony said that it
 
04:25:02.469 --> 04:25:02.479 align:start position:0%
now is over $20 an hour I'm not
 
04:25:04.469 --> 04:25:04.479 align:start position:0%
surprised New Hampshire faces a
 
04:25:08.349 --> 04:25:08.359 align:start position:0%
Workforce crisis and as we all know uh
 
04:25:10.790 --> 04:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
we see that in the city of Lebanon as
 
04:25:14.790 --> 04:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
well particularly among lower wage
 
04:25:18.030 --> 04:25:18.040 align:start position:0%
workers the um inability to recruit and
 
04:25:19.990 --> 04:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
retain workers affects the entire
 
04:25:23.429 --> 04:25:23.439 align:start position:0%
economy having a vibrant economy relies
 
04:25:27.109 --> 04:25:27.119 align:start position:0%
on uh having a having a Workforce at all
 
04:25:30.389 --> 04:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
levels but especially uh especially
 
04:25:33.670 --> 04:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
among lower wage workers the um home
 
04:25:37.630 --> 04:25:37.640 align:start position:0%
health aids the grocery store clerks the
 
04:25:39.349 --> 04:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
all of the people in retail people who
 
04:25:42.189 --> 04:25:42.199 align:start position:0%
are on you know the Frontline
 
04:25:46.429 --> 04:25:46.439 align:start position:0%
workers and we know that a rising tide
 
04:25:48.790 --> 04:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
raises all boats I think if I got that
 
04:25:52.870 --> 04:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
expression correct uh and when we uh
 
04:25:55.510 --> 04:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
when we raise the minimum wage it also
 
04:25:58.630 --> 04:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
has an uh an effect on wages at all
 
04:26:01.910 --> 04:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
levels and so I'm here to encourage you
 
04:26:04.870 --> 04:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
to support raising this is a very modest
 
04:26:07.309 --> 04:26:07.319 align:start position:0%
uh proposal does not even really get to
 
04:26:09.510 --> 04:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
the issue of a living wage but it does
 
04:26:12.469 --> 04:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
send a message that um that New
 
04:26:15.229 --> 04:26:15.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cares about lower wage workers
 
04:26:18.990 --> 04:26:19.000 align:start position:0%
and it does uh it it is the kind of
 
04:26:21.750 --> 04:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
policy by increasing the wage uh the
 
04:26:25.870 --> 04:26:25.880 align:start position:0%
minimum wage it also has um a virtuous
 
04:26:28.630 --> 04:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
impact on the economy by making it more
 
04:26:31.510 --> 04:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
possible for people at the lower levels
 
04:26:34.910 --> 04:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
to be able to afford housing in Lebanon
 
04:26:37.429 --> 04:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
the median income the the medium uh
 
04:26:40.469 --> 04:26:40.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:42.910 --> 04:26:42.920 align:start position:0%
$500,000 we know the minimum wage has
 
04:26:45.070 --> 04:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
not improved in uh has not increased in
 
04:26:47.030 --> 04:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:26:51.950 --> 04:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
um at all let alone to allow lower wage
 
04:26:55.109 --> 04:26:55.119 align:start position:0%
workers to be able to um live within
 
04:26:58.710 --> 04:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
their own communities so I urge you to
 
04:27:00.870 --> 04:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
um work on this bill make improvements
 
04:27:03.550 --> 04:27:03.560 align:start position:0%
where necessary um but I am here to
 
04:27:05.429 --> 04:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
offer my testimony and support of
 
04:27:07.790 --> 04:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
raising this very modest proposal to
 
04:27:09.670 --> 04:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
raise the minimum wage in New Hampshire
 
04:27:12.269 --> 04:27:12.279 align:start position:0%
I think it's beyond time thank you thank
 
04:27:16.670 --> 04:27:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:19.990 --> 04:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you again um
 
04:27:23.389 --> 04:27:23.399 align:start position:0%
that was the last card I had so if there
 
04:27:27.269 --> 04:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
are no other cars to be submitted um
 
04:27:31.630 --> 04:27:31.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:34.830 --> 04:27:34.840 align:start position:0%

again from will he was almost here and
 
04:27:41.109 --> 04:27:41.119 align:start position:0%
uh got called back on an emergency so
 
04:27:45.550 --> 04:27:45.560 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid everyone is stuck with me for
 
04:27:51.030 --> 04:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:55.510 --> 04:27:55.520 align:start position:0%

Bill thank you Mr U acting chair and
 
04:29:30.109 --> 04:29:30.119 align:start position:0%
thank you honorable members of the
 
04:29:32.349 --> 04:29:32.359 align:start position:0%
committee for welcoming me to your
 
04:29:34.389 --> 04:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record my name is
 
04:29:36.990 --> 04:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
Ellen Reid I represent the towns of new
 
04:29:39.030 --> 04:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
fields and New
 
04:29:42.830 --> 04:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
Market um so I have before you today a
 
04:29:46.349 --> 04:29:46.359 align:start position:0%
bill that would establish the 32h hour
 
04:29:49.349 --> 04:29:49.359 align:start position:0%
work week as full-time meaning any hours
 
04:29:54.109 --> 04:29:54.119 align:start position:0%
worked over um 32 hours would be uh
 
04:29:56.750 --> 04:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
would qualify for time and a half over
 
04:30:02.149 --> 04:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
time this is coupled with no loss in pay
 
04:30:05.109 --> 04:30:05.119 align:start position:0%
so that a full-time worker who um
 
04:30:06.710 --> 04:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
whatever they making currently in their
 
04:30:08.469 --> 04:30:08.479 align:start position:0%
full-time position they would still be
 
04:30:11.670 --> 04:30:11.680 align:start position:0%
making that amount for a 32-hour work
 
04:30:14.790 --> 04:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
week this represents a 25% increase in
 
04:30:18.109 --> 04:30:18.119 align:start position:0%
Pay I won't go into all of the virtues
 
04:30:20.750 --> 04:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
of increasing pay and why we need to
 
04:30:22.710 --> 04:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
increase pay in general since you've
 
04:30:24.710 --> 04:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
just heard a very long hearing on the
 
04:30:28.149 --> 04:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
same matter um I will just say once
 
04:30:29.990 --> 04:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
again that
 
04:30:32.870 --> 04:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
economies are built bottom up and when
 
04:30:35.030 --> 04:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
you bring up the bottom you bring up the
 
04:30:38.870 --> 04:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
entire economy so increases in Pay um
 
04:30:41.830 --> 04:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
are helpful especially in our state
 
04:30:44.309 --> 04:30:44.319 align:start position:0%
where we are suffering from a housing
 
04:30:47.510 --> 04:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
crisis that is the cause of the um graay
 
04:30:50.349 --> 04:30:50.359 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire crisis um those two
 
04:30:53.229 --> 04:30:53.239 align:start position:0%
things are basically the one and same
 
04:30:56.950 --> 04:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
one in the same crisis So to that extent
 
04:31:00.149 --> 04:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
this is um this increase in pay would be
 
04:31:04.070 --> 04:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
extremely helpful having said that um
 
04:31:05.630 --> 04:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
eight other states have prepared
 
04:31:08.429 --> 04:31:08.439 align:start position:0%
proposed this legislation uh this is
 
04:31:10.030 --> 04:31:10.040 align:start position:0%
pulled directly from the
 
04:31:12.590 --> 04:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania uh proposed legislation and
 
04:31:14.950 --> 04:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
it has also been proposed federally as
 
04:31:17.550 --> 04:31:17.560 align:start position:0%
well also countless municipalities have
 
04:31:20.469 --> 04:31:20.479 align:start position:0%
already um shifted to a 4-day work week
 
04:31:22.229 --> 04:31:22.239 align:start position:0%
including my own municipality as a
 
04:31:24.229 --> 04:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
matter of fact um and many
 
04:31:27.349 --> 04:31:27.359 align:start position:0%
municipalities in the state um because
 
04:31:29.750 --> 04:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
it helps attract and retain
 
04:31:32.630 --> 04:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
workers uh also several New Hampshire
 
04:31:34.590 --> 04:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
businesses have um already changed
 
04:31:37.910 --> 04:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
voluntarily over to a 4-day work week
 
04:31:41.469 --> 04:31:41.479 align:start position:0%
work it daily and the Morrison Community
 
04:31:45.309 --> 04:31:45.319 align:start position:0%
which is a senior um housing uh company
 
04:31:48.790 --> 04:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
both have changed over as well as others
 
04:31:52.229 --> 04:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
so the benefits of switching to a
 
04:31:57.910 --> 04:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
32-hour work week um are numerous uh as
 
04:31:59.910 --> 04:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
you would expect the benefits for
 
04:32:05.510 --> 04:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
workers are uh a lot so 95% of workers
 
04:32:07.950 --> 04:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
who have worked in a pilot 4-day uh
 
04:32:11.429 --> 04:32:11.439 align:start position:0%
workweek program have um wanted to
 
04:32:14.590 --> 04:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
continue that but wait till I get to the
 
04:32:17.750 --> 04:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
employers um because they experience a
 
04:32:20.469 --> 04:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
69% reduction and burnout and all of
 
04:32:22.630 --> 04:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
this data will be found in this report
 
04:32:24.870 --> 04:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
that I have passed out which studies
 
04:32:27.109 --> 04:32:27.119 align:start position:0%
over a 12-month period the pilot
 
04:32:30.030 --> 04:32:30.040 align:start position:0%
programs over numerous companies in both
 
04:32:33.030 --> 04:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
the United States and Canada um workers
 
04:32:36.870 --> 04:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
also experience 74% % more work life
 
04:32:39.630 --> 04:32:39.640 align:start position:0%
balance satisfaction and they have
 
04:32:41.469 --> 04:32:41.479 align:start position:0%
increased time and this is very
 
04:32:42.950 --> 04:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
important we heard a lot about this they
 
04:32:45.389 --> 04:32:45.399 align:start position:0%
have increased time to care for their
 
04:32:47.309 --> 04:32:47.319 align:start position:0%
loved ones whether their loved ones are
 
04:32:49.550 --> 04:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
their aging parents or their children or
 
04:32:52.630 --> 04:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
maybe their animals or whomever um
 
04:32:54.950 --> 04:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
having that work life balance is
 
04:32:59.389 --> 04:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
important employers though I said 95% of
 
04:33:02.389 --> 04:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
employees wanted to continue the 4-day
 
04:33:05.670 --> 04:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
trial 100% of employers who trial a
 
04:33:07.910 --> 04:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
4-day work week wanted to and did
 
04:33:10.551 --> 04:33:10.561 align:start position:0%
continue it um the reason they
 
04:33:14.230 --> 04:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
experienced no loss in Revenue um they
 
04:33:17.109 --> 04:33:17.119 align:start position:0%
had increased employee productivity so
 
04:33:19.789 --> 04:33:19.799 align:start position:0%
more productivity in 32 hours than they
 
04:33:23.109 --> 04:33:23.119 align:start position:0%
had experienced in 40 hours and they had
 
04:33:25.029 --> 04:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
increased employee retention and
 
04:33:27.269 --> 04:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
satisfaction happier work environments
 
04:33:27.279 --> 04:33:28.830 align:start position:0%
satisfaction happier work environments
less

04:33:28.830 --> 04:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
less
 
04:33:32.629 --> 04:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
turnover in addition uh to benefiting
 
04:33:36.070 --> 04:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
employees and benefiting employers it
 
04:33:39.869 --> 04:33:39.879 align:start position:0%
also benefits society as a whole there
 
04:33:42.470 --> 04:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
is an environmental impact when you have
 
04:33:44.830 --> 04:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
people only commuting four days a week
 
04:33:47.189 --> 04:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
instead of five but the mental health
 
04:33:48.590 --> 04:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
impact is
 
04:33:51.150 --> 04:33:51.160 align:start position:0%
significant um for the well-being of the
 
04:33:53.789 --> 04:33:53.799 align:start position:0%
population as a whole also people tend
 
04:33:56.150 --> 04:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
to share home responsibilities more
 
04:33:58.869 --> 04:33:58.879 align:start position:0%
evenly uh regardless of gender when
 
04:34:01.109 --> 04:34:01.119 align:start position:0%
people have time at home they both
 
04:34:04.590 --> 04:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
engage in uh child care and taking care
 
04:34:06.949 --> 04:34:06.959 align:start position:0%
of the home
 
04:34:10.390 --> 04:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
also um and this is kind of going to get
 
04:34:14.150 --> 04:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
into the the philosophy of this
 
04:34:17.070 --> 04:34:17.080 align:start position:0%
so we have currently a system where if
 
04:34:19.990 --> 04:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
you say automation it's a scary word
 
04:34:22.269 --> 04:34:22.279 align:start position:0%
especially for workers and that doesn't
 
04:34:24.349 --> 04:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
really quite make sense to me because if
 
04:34:27.750 --> 04:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
you imagine let's say a a village and
 
04:34:29.670 --> 04:34:29.680 align:start position:0%
everyone's engaged in work constantly to
 
04:34:31.189 --> 04:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
make that Village go they're fishing
 
04:34:32.949 --> 04:34:32.959 align:start position:0%
they're farming what have you and then
 
04:34:34.789 --> 04:34:34.799 align:start position:0%
you drop into this Village a bunch of
 
04:34:37.150 --> 04:34:37.160 align:start position:0%
robots to do all of that work that is a
 
04:34:39.990 --> 04:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
blessing to that Village that's a boom
 
04:34:42.189 --> 04:34:42.199 align:start position:0%
to them all of a sudden they have free
 
04:34:44.029 --> 04:34:44.039 align:start position:0%
time to do other things because now
 
04:34:45.830 --> 04:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
their needs are being met by these
 
04:34:48.709 --> 04:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
machines and yet in our current economic
 
04:34:51.709 --> 04:34:51.719 align:start position:0%
structure automation does the opposite
 
04:34:53.949 --> 04:34:53.959 align:start position:0%
it threatens the ability of people to
 
04:34:55.869 --> 04:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
meet their basic needs because now they
 
04:34:58.830 --> 04:34:58.840 align:start position:0%
are worried about losing a job now think
 
04:35:01.670 --> 04:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
about this as an employer you actually
 
04:35:04.709 --> 04:35:04.719 align:start position:0%
have two decisions if you choose to buy
 
04:35:06.910 --> 04:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
automated automated
 
04:35:10.510 --> 04:35:10.520 align:start position:0%
technology um and we're we're going to
 
04:35:12.109 --> 04:35:12.119 align:start position:0%
say that the cost of the technology is
 
04:35:14.990 --> 04:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
the same in either scenario you buy some
 
04:35:16.830 --> 04:35:16.840 align:start position:0%
technology that automates the work you
 
04:35:18.629 --> 04:35:18.639 align:start position:0%
employ a certain number of people now
 
04:35:20.269 --> 04:35:20.279 align:start position:0%
that you've bought this technology you
 
04:35:22.949 --> 04:35:22.959 align:start position:0%
now have only half of the requirement of
 
04:35:25.990 --> 04:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
Labor that you previously had the answer
 
04:35:28.990 --> 04:35:29.000 align:start position:0%
normally in our current system is to lay
 
04:35:31.150 --> 04:35:31.160 align:start position:0%
off half of your
 
04:35:33.070 --> 04:35:33.080 align:start position:0%
workers that makes a lot of people
 
04:35:35.789 --> 04:35:35.799 align:start position:0%
unhappy why do that you are paying the
 
04:35:36.949 --> 04:35:36.959 align:start position:0%
same in
 
04:35:40.390 --> 04:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
labor but half as you would if you've
 
04:35:43.189 --> 04:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
simply said everyone keeps their jobs
 
04:35:46.910 --> 04:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
everyone stays uh at the same pay but
 
04:35:48.750 --> 04:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
works half the
 
04:35:51.910 --> 04:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
time so why do we do that to people why
 
04:35:55.629 --> 04:35:55.639 align:start position:0%
do we make something that should help us
 
04:35:58.029 --> 04:35:58.039 align:start position:0%
actually work against
 
04:36:02.070 --> 04:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
us um for what it's worth medieval under
 
04:36:03.189 --> 04:36:03.199 align:start position:0%
I'm not suggesting we go back to
 
04:36:06.189 --> 04:36:06.199 align:start position:0%
feudalism at all but medieval workers
 
04:36:09.789 --> 04:36:09.799 align:start position:0%
medieval peasants only worked 150 days a
 
04:36:11.949 --> 04:36:11.959 align:start position:0%
year like
 
04:36:15.990 --> 04:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
like like 60% of what we we work today
 
04:36:20.990 --> 04:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:24.029 --> 04:36:24.039 align:start position:0%
more so in every period of human
 
04:36:26.310 --> 04:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
development where we were the most
 
04:36:28.709 --> 04:36:28.719 align:start position:0%
productive it was a period where we had
 
04:36:30.789 --> 04:36:30.799 align:start position:0%
the most Leisure I know that there's a a
 
04:36:33.310 --> 04:36:33.320 align:start position:0%
narrative that says that well if you
 
04:36:35.670 --> 04:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
don't make people work Con constantly
 
04:36:37.029 --> 04:36:37.039 align:start position:0%
then they're going to be lazy not going
 
04:36:38.789 --> 04:36:38.799 align:start position:0%
to do anything if you just you know if
 
04:36:40.910 --> 04:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
they have enough but the thing is is
 
04:36:43.269 --> 04:36:43.279 align:start position:0%
that periods like the Renaissance when
 
04:36:45.429 --> 04:36:45.439 align:start position:0%
we did the most it's because we had the
 
04:36:47.029 --> 04:36:47.039 align:start position:0%
most Leisure it's because we had our
 
04:36:49.269 --> 04:36:49.279 align:start position:0%
needs met with a minimal amount of work
 
04:36:51.789 --> 04:36:51.799 align:start position:0%
and it turns out humans are we get
 
04:36:54.470 --> 04:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
Restless you might rest for a while but
 
04:36:56.349 --> 04:36:56.359 align:start position:0%
you want to start studying something or
 
04:36:58.070 --> 04:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
learning something or learning a an
 
04:37:00.510 --> 04:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
instrument or a language people become
 
04:37:02.990 --> 04:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
resourceful and Innovative when you give
 
04:37:05.949 --> 04:37:05.959 align:start position:0%
them Leisure having extra leisure time
 
04:37:09.269 --> 04:37:09.279 align:start position:0%
benefits society as a whole as well as
 
04:37:12.349 --> 04:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
individuals and honestly I don't I don't
 
04:37:14.750 --> 04:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
know I think we are experiencing a
 
04:37:17.629 --> 04:37:17.639 align:start position:0%
moment in our society right now where
 
04:37:19.429 --> 04:37:19.439 align:start position:0%
people are pretty much done with the
 
04:37:22.310 --> 04:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
concept that they have been or are being
 
04:37:24.910 --> 04:37:24.920 align:start position:0%
forced to sell their labor for half of
 
04:37:26.670 --> 04:37:26.680 align:start position:0%
all of their waking hours from the time
 
04:37:28.670 --> 04:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
their bodies are fully formed as adults
 
04:37:30.029 --> 04:37:30.039 align:start position:0%
until the times their bodies are
 
04:37:32.551 --> 04:37:32.561 align:start position:0%
breaking down in old age and that's the
 
04:37:35.109 --> 04:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
situation we have and it gets to a point
 
04:37:38.510 --> 04:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
when you having to work so much that
 
04:37:40.470 --> 04:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
life doesn't seem to have a meaning
 
04:37:42.150 --> 04:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
you're you're working to live but you're
 
04:37:44.949 --> 04:37:44.959 align:start position:0%
also just living to work you get off at
 
04:37:47.709 --> 04:37:47.719 align:start position:0%
5: and you you go and you get the kids
 
04:37:49.910 --> 04:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
food and you do the things that you know
 
04:37:51.629 --> 04:37:51.639 align:start position:0%
you barely get the things done that you
 
04:37:53.869 --> 04:37:53.879 align:start position:0%
need to do to survive and then you rush
 
04:37:55.869 --> 04:37:55.879 align:start position:0%
you go to bed you wake up and you do it
 
04:37:59.750 --> 04:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:02.150 --> 04:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
again I will also say this extra
 
04:38:04.990 --> 04:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
productivity this extra happiness that
 
04:38:07.709 --> 04:38:07.719 align:start position:0%
occurs when you give people more Leisure
 
04:38:10.230 --> 04:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
Time and the Leisure Time that comes
 
04:38:12.629 --> 04:38:12.639 align:start position:0%
with increased productivity from
 
04:38:16.029 --> 04:38:16.039 align:start position:0%
technology is actually what caused us to
 
04:38:18.109 --> 04:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
be an economic superpower in the first
 
04:38:20.551 --> 04:38:20.561 align:start position:0%
place the moving to the 40-hour work
 
04:38:22.029 --> 04:38:22.039 align:start position:0%
week which happened in
 
04:38:24.910 --> 04:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
1940 was a result of a it was part of a
 
04:38:26.470 --> 04:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of reforms that happened
 
04:38:28.390 --> 04:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
after the Great Depression or that
 
04:38:29.349 --> 04:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
helped get us out of the Great
 
04:38:31.510 --> 04:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
Depression and it created the strongest
 
04:38:34.029 --> 04:38:34.039 align:start position:0%
economy in the world because we were
 
04:38:35.429 --> 04:38:35.439 align:start position:0%
more productive
 
04:38:37.590 --> 04:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
and since that time our productivity in
 
04:38:40.230 --> 04:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
large part because of technology has
 
04:38:41.869 --> 04:38:41.879 align:start position:0%
increased over
 
04:38:45.070 --> 04:38:45.080 align:start position:0%
60% and yet we're still even with that
 
04:38:47.750 --> 04:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
technology we're still being forced into
 
04:38:49.390 --> 04:38:49.400 align:start position:0%
half of all of our waking hours for the
 
04:38:49.400 --> 04:38:51.070 align:start position:0%
half of all of our waking hours for the
work

04:38:51.070 --> 04:38:51.080 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:38:55.029 --> 04:38:55.039 align:start position:0%
week so in short and I you know thank
 
04:38:58.029 --> 04:38:58.039 align:start position:0%
you for tolerating my waxing philosophic
 
04:39:01.189 --> 04:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
for a bit but um this is a triple
 
04:39:04.029 --> 04:39:04.039 align:start position:0%
dividend it's a win-win win it helps
 
04:39:08.310 --> 04:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
workers OB viously it helps employers
 
04:39:11.590 --> 04:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
and it helps society as a whole because
 
04:39:15.629 --> 04:39:15.639 align:start position:0%
no one you know imagine having time to
 
04:39:18.269 --> 04:39:18.279 align:start position:0%
actually live whatever it is you think
 
04:39:20.470 --> 04:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
the purpose of your life is to live to
 
04:39:22.629 --> 04:39:22.639 align:start position:0%
your fullest whatever you define it when
 
04:39:25.551 --> 04:39:25.561 align:start position:0%
you have extra time you travel or you
 
04:39:28.590 --> 04:39:28.600 align:start position:0%
read or you learn new skills or develop
 
04:39:30.869 --> 04:39:30.879 align:start position:0%
relationships or you know work on
 
04:39:33.709 --> 04:39:33.719 align:start position:0%
yourself you actually live your life and
 
04:39:35.429 --> 04:39:35.439 align:start position:0%
that's what's really important to to
 
04:39:38.670 --> 04:39:38.680 align:start position:0%
people so it helps workers it helps
 
04:39:41.230 --> 04:39:41.240 align:start position:0%
employers and it helps society and it's
 
04:39:43.550 --> 04:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
proven itself from industry to Industry
 
04:39:45.390 --> 04:39:45.400 align:start position:0%
consistently and I do encourage you to
 
04:39:47.470 --> 04:39:47.480 align:start position:0%
please peruse the report because it is
 
04:39:50.510 --> 04:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
quite thorough and with that I am I I
 
04:39:52.750 --> 04:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
understand this may be the first time
 
04:39:54.430 --> 04:39:54.440 align:start position:0%
this concept has been heard by this
 
04:39:57.990 --> 04:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
committee or or this um legislative
 
04:40:00.270 --> 04:40:00.280 align:start position:0%
branch for that matter but I appreciate
 
04:40:02.590 --> 04:40:02.600 align:start position:0%
you engaging in conversation with me
 
04:40:04.270 --> 04:40:04.280 align:start position:0%
about this concept and I will take
 
04:40:04.280 --> 04:40:05.350 align:start position:0%
about this concept and I will take
questions

04:40:05.350 --> 04:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:40:06.948 --> 04:40:06.958 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony I
 
04:40:09.230 --> 04:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
do have a question uh just to clarify
 
04:40:11.670 --> 04:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
the title of the bill is for a 4-day
 
04:40:14.670 --> 04:40:14.680 align:start position:0%
work week but when I read the language
 
04:40:18.110 --> 04:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
it's not specific so you could if I'm
 
04:40:20.750 --> 04:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
reading correctly meet this by reducing
 
04:40:23.310 --> 04:40:23.320 align:start position:0%
having a five-day work week but sixh
 
04:40:28.270 --> 04:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
hour days for example am I is is that
 
04:40:31.190 --> 04:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
correct in terms of your intent yes and
 
04:40:32.788 --> 04:40:32.798 align:start position:0%
like I said this language is directly
 
04:40:34.150 --> 04:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
out of the Pennsylvania proposed
 
04:40:36.948 --> 04:40:36.958 align:start position:0%
legislation so just like you can meet 40
 
04:40:39.590 --> 04:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
hours in 4 days or 5 days currently you
 
04:40:41.550 --> 04:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
could meet 32 hours in any number of
 
04:40:44.350 --> 04:40:44.360 align:start position:0%
days all right thank you uh further
 
04:40:46.948 --> 04:40:46.958 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:40:49.270 --> 04:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
Susi thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:40:51.510 --> 04:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
taking the question so it says it
 
04:40:54.990 --> 04:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
mandates why wouldn't we have um
 
04:40:57.390 --> 04:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation
 
04:40:59.868 --> 04:40:59.878 align:start position:0%
because I'm assuming that enabling
 
04:41:01.350 --> 04:41:01.360 align:start position:0%
legislation may
 
04:41:05.830 --> 04:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
help um companies that this may not be a
 
04:41:08.070 --> 04:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
um Bill well this may not be legislation
 
04:41:11.270 --> 04:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
that's one size fits all right enabling
 
04:41:13.788 --> 04:41:13.798 align:start position:0%
legislation as I understand it typically
 
04:41:15.150 --> 04:41:15.160 align:start position:0%
um refers to the fact that we're a
 
04:41:16.390 --> 04:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
dyan's rle state and that would be
 
04:41:19.230 --> 04:41:19.240 align:start position:0%
enabling municipalities which um
 
04:41:20.910 --> 04:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities are already enabled to do
 
04:41:22.510 --> 04:41:22.520 align:start position:0%
this and private sector is already
 
04:41:24.510 --> 04:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
enabled I guess you would say already
 
04:41:27.270 --> 04:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
free to do this as they have currently
 
04:41:30.628 --> 04:41:30.638 align:start position:0%
but just like we had to legislate moving
 
04:41:33.670 --> 04:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
from the six day work week back in the
 
04:41:36.390 --> 04:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
20s and actually it was Henry Ford that
 
04:41:38.270 --> 04:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
realized that moving from the six day to
 
04:41:40.590 --> 04:41:40.600 align:start position:0%
the 5-day work week was beneficial and
 
04:41:44.150 --> 04:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
famously um having his employees be able
 
04:41:46.550 --> 04:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
to have the Leisure and afford to buy
 
04:41:48.670 --> 04:41:48.680 align:start position:0%
his own product was a strong motivating
 
04:41:51.708 --> 04:41:51.718 align:start position:0%
factor um but that legislative
 
04:41:54.430 --> 04:41:54.440 align:start position:0%
requirement to move the entire indust or
 
04:41:56.750 --> 04:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
the entire uh private sector over was
 
04:41:59.310 --> 04:41:59.320 align:start position:0%
necessary to actually see those benefits
 
04:42:01.110 --> 04:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
because it turns out that private actors
 
04:42:03.110 --> 04:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
don't always necessarily do the right
 
04:42:05.390 --> 04:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
thing or know the right thing
 
04:42:05.400 --> 04:42:06.110 align:start position:0%
thing or know the right thing
thank

04:42:06.110 --> 04:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:42:09.230 --> 04:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
you further questions representative
 
04:42:12.350 --> 04:42:12.360 align:start position:0%
suvin you mentioned the several states
 
04:42:15.110 --> 04:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
have uh proposes this legislation have
 
04:42:17.430 --> 04:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
any of those States adopted this uh
 
04:42:19.990 --> 04:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
legislation no one's adopted it yet
 
04:42:20.000 --> 04:42:21.190 align:start position:0%
legislation no one's adopted it yet
thank

04:42:21.190 --> 04:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:42:24.750 --> 04:42:24.760 align:start position:0%
you it's considered
 
04:42:28.990 --> 04:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:29.000 --> 04:42:31.190 align:start position:0%
 
represent

04:42:31.190 --> 04:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:42:33.628 --> 04:42:33.638 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman
 
04:42:34.868 --> 04:42:34.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question thank
 
04:42:37.390 --> 04:42:37.400 align:start position:0%
you you I was kind of reading through
 
04:42:40.270 --> 04:42:40.280 align:start position:0%
this while you were talking um one of
 
04:42:41.948 --> 04:42:41.958 align:start position:0%
the things you mentioned is employers
 
04:42:43.708 --> 04:42:43.718 align:start position:0%
found no loss in revenue and actually in
 
04:42:45.550 --> 04:42:45.560 align:start position:0%
here I think those was a spot that said
 
04:42:47.390 --> 04:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
actually they increase it by 15% or
 
04:42:49.470 --> 04:42:49.480 align:start position:0%
something yeah I didn't want to speak
 
04:42:52.110 --> 04:42:52.120 align:start position:0%
for every employer we've seen it be
 
04:42:54.230 --> 04:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
successful from industry to Industry the
 
04:42:55.868 --> 04:42:55.878 align:start position:0%
implementation depending on the industry
 
04:42:59.470 --> 04:42:59.480 align:start position:0%
to rep su's Point um can be different
 
04:43:01.190 --> 04:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
but every industry has been successful
 
04:43:04.030 --> 04:43:04.040 align:start position:0%
but at a bare minimum no no one has
 
04:43:06.590 --> 04:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
experienced a loss of Revenue because of
 
04:43:09.750 --> 04:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
it um some sectors have experienced an
 
04:43:11.150 --> 04:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
increase and thank you very much for
 
04:43:13.948 --> 04:43:13.958 align:start position:0%
pointing that out okay that wasn't even
 
04:43:15.910 --> 04:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
my question I just oh sorry no that's
 
04:43:20.750 --> 04:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
fine is does this proposed Bill
 
04:43:23.788 --> 04:43:23.798 align:start position:0%
match what they did in the
 
04:43:27.470 --> 04:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
study uh so as I understand in the study
 
04:43:30.310 --> 04:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
it's a study of every company that they
 
04:43:32.550 --> 04:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
could track in the US and Canada that
 
04:43:35.110 --> 04:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
did any kind of 4-day work week pilot
 
04:43:38.708 --> 04:43:38.718 align:start position:0%
program so um all of those programs
 
04:43:40.910 --> 04:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
would be different according to the
 
04:43:44.708 --> 04:43:44.718 align:start position:0%
individual business but in by and large
 
04:43:49.110 --> 04:43:49.120 align:start position:0%
yes okay one more question okay so what
 
04:43:52.110 --> 04:43:52.120 align:start position:0%
I was wondering now is if there was no
 
04:43:53.708 --> 04:43:53.718 align:start position:0%
difference in revenue and actually maybe
 
04:43:56.110 --> 04:43:56.120 align:start position:0%
some did increase it didn't say anything
 
04:43:58.788 --> 04:43:58.798 align:start position:0%
about um expenditures going up or down
 
04:44:00.910 --> 04:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
is there data on
 
04:44:03.948 --> 04:44:03.958 align:start position:0%
that if the report doesn't have it it's
 
04:44:06.868 --> 04:44:06.878 align:start position:0%
something I can certainly ask to get the
 
04:44:10.788 --> 04:44:10.798 align:start position:0%
only sorry the only reason I'm asking is
 
04:44:12.708 --> 04:44:12.718 align:start position:0%
the other portion for
 
04:44:15.430 --> 04:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
profit well yes for profit but I was
 
04:44:19.270 --> 04:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
wondering because um this also changes
 
04:44:21.670 --> 04:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
the overtime pay so an employee Works
 
04:44:23.270 --> 04:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
more than eight hours in a single day
 
04:44:25.628 --> 04:44:25.638 align:start position:0%
now the business is on the hook for
 
04:44:28.550 --> 04:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
overtime or 12 hours in double time so
 
04:44:30.750 --> 04:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
my question would be well I guess in my
 
04:44:32.350 --> 04:44:32.360 align:start position:0%
mind I can just think of a lot of
 
04:44:33.628 --> 04:44:33.638 align:start position:0%
different Industries and even
 
04:44:35.110 --> 04:44:35.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities where the eight hours and
 
04:44:36.030 --> 04:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
then they're paying more it's going to
 
04:44:38.390 --> 04:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
be a significant increase in expenses so
 
04:44:39.708 --> 04:44:39.718 align:start position:0%
I wasn't sure if that was brought up in
 
04:44:41.910 --> 04:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
the report at all so the the public
 
04:44:43.628 --> 04:44:43.638 align:start position:0%
sector is different from the private
 
04:44:45.470 --> 04:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
sector and the public sector doesn't
 
04:44:48.628 --> 04:44:48.638 align:start position:0%
have to profit and um and and really
 
04:44:49.910 --> 04:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't but as we've seen in the
 
04:44:51.708 --> 04:44:51.718 align:start position:0%
public sector many many municipalities
 
04:44:53.868 --> 04:44:53.878 align:start position:0%
have already taken that move on their
 
04:44:56.788 --> 04:44:56.798 align:start position:0%
own um and and by the way moving to a
 
04:44:58.868 --> 04:44:58.878 align:start position:0%
4-day work week doesn't mean moving to
 
04:45:01.670 --> 04:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
four days of operation and in some cases
 
04:45:03.788 --> 04:45:03.798 align:start position:0%
you actually you still operate five or
 
04:45:06.470 --> 04:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
even seven days a week you may have more
 
04:45:09.670 --> 04:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
employees which is actually beneficial
 
04:45:13.750 --> 04:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
um but I presume and can ask for more
 
04:45:16.788 --> 04:45:16.798 align:start position:0%
data regarding this specifically that
 
04:45:20.830 --> 04:45:20.840 align:start position:0%
the the um increase to flatlining of
 
04:45:24.750 --> 04:45:24.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue um also meant at least no change
 
04:45:28.310 --> 04:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
in profit because again 100% of
 
04:45:31.590 --> 04:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
employers continued the program past the
 
04:45:33.830 --> 04:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
pilot if they had experienced a sharp
 
04:45:36.230 --> 04:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
increase in expenditures or a decrease
 
04:45:38.310 --> 04:45:38.320 align:start position:0%
in profit I imagine that would have been
 
04:45:39.430 --> 04:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
the very first thing they would have
 
04:45:42.430 --> 04:45:42.440 align:start position:0%
done to be drop the pilot program I
 
04:45:44.708 --> 04:45:44.718 align:start position:0%
guess if you can provide that I'm happy
 
04:45:48.430 --> 04:45:48.440 align:start position:0%
to to get more information yes in fact
 
04:45:50.708 --> 04:45:50.718 align:start position:0%
I'll make a note right now
 
04:45:52.948 --> 04:45:52.958 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman um
 
04:45:54.190 --> 04:45:54.200 align:start position:0%
just the first question is how many
 
04:45:56.310 --> 04:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
employees do you
 
04:45:59.750 --> 04:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
have this feels rather factious but I
 
04:46:01.470 --> 04:46:01.480 align:start position:0%
don't own a business and don't employ
 
04:46:03.948 --> 04:46:03.958 align:start position:0%
anyone thank you um and Fallout Mr
 
04:46:03.958 --> 04:46:05.230 align:start position:0%
anyone thank you um and Fallout Mr
chairman

04:46:05.230 --> 04:46:05.240 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:46:07.590 --> 04:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
um so if you have a fire department who
 
04:46:10.868 --> 04:46:10.878 align:start position:0%
is Staff 24 hours a day um typically
 
04:46:14.310 --> 04:46:14.320 align:start position:0%
they will work 12 or 24hour shifts um
 
04:46:16.070 --> 04:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
this would increase their rate of pay
 
04:46:19.550 --> 04:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
but also increase the tax liability for
 
04:46:21.190 --> 04:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers have you thought that
 
04:46:22.830 --> 04:46:22.840 align:start position:0%
through with this four day week work
 
04:46:25.470 --> 04:46:25.480 align:start position:0%
week and mandates for
 
04:46:28.830 --> 04:46:28.840 align:start position:0%
overtime I not only have I been aware
 
04:46:30.470 --> 04:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
that that is an issue but so have the
 
04:46:32.948 --> 04:46:32.958 align:start position:0%
many many many municipalities that have
 
04:46:35.868 --> 04:46:35.878 align:start position:0%
already enacted it on their own own so
 
04:46:38.948 --> 04:46:38.958 align:start position:0%
again moving to a 4-day work week um is
 
04:46:40.310 --> 04:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
something they've done
 
04:46:42.310 --> 04:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
voluntarily it does come with an
 
04:46:45.190 --> 04:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
increase in pay and to um Industries
 
04:46:47.470 --> 04:46:47.480 align:start position:0%
where you have to pay you know not just
 
04:46:49.910 --> 04:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
for the you know several hours you know
 
04:46:52.230 --> 04:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
that a normal business would be open but
 
04:46:55.350 --> 04:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
in this case 24 hours a day and they
 
04:46:58.310 --> 04:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
still do it and it still works across
 
04:47:00.830 --> 04:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
the board then I'm I don't find that I
 
04:47:02.230 --> 04:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
have the expertise to tell them that's
 
04:47:07.830 --> 04:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:10.350 --> 04:47:10.360 align:start position:0%
any further
 
04:47:12.670 --> 04:47:12.680 align:start position:0%
questions I think I got off pretty easy
 
04:47:14.390 --> 04:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
actually thank you very much for Tes
 
04:47:17.030 --> 04:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
considering I do not have any other
 
04:47:21.510 --> 04:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
cards on this bill um if we miss someone
 
04:47:24.708 --> 04:47:24.718 align:start position:0%
please pass your card up and if not
 
04:47:31.190 --> 04:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:35.390 --> 04:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
sheet and um
 
04:47:38.510 --> 04:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
this is mine for when we vote Yes
 
04:47:41.510 --> 04:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
so it probably shouldn't be in my in
 
04:47:41.520 --> 04:47:42.750 align:start position:0%
so it probably shouldn't be in my in
your

04:47:42.750 --> 04:47:42.760 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:47:42.760 --> 04:47:46.110 align:start position:0%
your
package

04:47:46.110 --> 04:47:46.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:51.070 --> 04:47:51.080 align:start position:0%
um so we have uh in the signups we have
 
04:47:53.750 --> 04:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
three people who signed in in favor and
 
04:47:56.390 --> 04:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
five people who signed in
 
04:47:59.430 --> 04:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
against and with that I will close the
 
04:48:01.830 --> 04:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
public hearing on
 
04:48:04.590 --> 04:48:04.600 align:start position:0%
1668 the next public hearing is
 
04:48:06.070 --> 04:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
scheduled for
 
04:48:09.390 --> 04:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
1377 at this point it doesn't look like
 
04:48:11.750 --> 04:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to exceed the capacity of
 
04:48:14.430 --> 04:48:14.440 align:start position:0%
this room if a lot of people start
 
04:48:17.628 --> 04:48:17.638 align:start position:0%
showing up uh as it gets close to three
 
04:48:20.230 --> 04:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
I need to go talk to staff about what
 
04:48:23.110 --> 04:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
was arranged um we might need to move to
 
04:48:27.470 --> 04:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
a bigger room um so I will go find that
 
04:48:31.990 --> 04:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
out otherwise we'll begin here at 3 o'
 
04:48:32.000 --> 04:48:32.990 align:start position:0%
out otherwise we'll begin here at 3 o'
can

04:48:32.990 --> 04:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
can
 
04:48:36.310 --> 04:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
I for some privilege and welcome
 
04:48:38.470 --> 04:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
honorable Jay W who be a member of this
 
04:49:02.910 --> 04:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:02.920 --> 04:49:32.910 align:start position:0%
 
again

04:49:32.910 --> 04:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:32.920 --> 05:14:37.390 align:start position:0%
 
ch

05:14:37.390 --> 05:14:37.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:39.390 --> 05:14:39.400 align:start position:0%
all right everybody I know that clock's
 
05:14:41.590 --> 05:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
running a few minutes fast so I don't
 
05:14:45.350 --> 05:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
think we're quite at 3:00 so I'll start
 
05:14:47.990 --> 05:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
talking anyway
 
05:14:52.548 --> 05:14:52.558 align:start position:0%
um so first of all because we knew we'd
 
05:14:55.190 --> 05:14:55.200 align:start position:0%
be pushing the capacity of this room
 
05:14:57.910 --> 05:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
what has been set up is upstairs from
 
05:15:02.788 --> 05:15:02.798 align:start position:0%
here in room 307 their labor room
 
05:15:05.868 --> 05:15:05.878 align:start position:0%
is going to be broadcasting this hearing
 
05:15:09.270 --> 05:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
so if this room gets too crowded um
 
05:15:12.628 --> 05:15:12.638 align:start position:0%
people are welcome to go up there and if
 
05:15:14.990 --> 05:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
I have your name in to speak and you're
 
05:15:16.990 --> 05:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
up there I'm going to try to read ahead
 
05:15:20.070 --> 05:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
a couple of names so that people can you
 
05:15:21.590 --> 05:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
know anybody even if you just want a
 
05:15:24.270 --> 05:15:24.280 align:start position:0%
little more room to to relax and and
 
05:15:26.510 --> 05:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
listen upstairs that's available to
 
05:15:29.190 --> 05:15:29.200 align:start position:0%
everyone um as it looks right now I
 
05:15:31.270 --> 05:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
don't think we have an emergency where
 
05:15:33.910 --> 05:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
we have to push people out but just be
 
05:15:35.270 --> 05:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
aware that that's
 
05:15:38.708 --> 05:15:38.718 align:start position:0%
available um
 
05:15:42.230 --> 05:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
secondly I oh and somebody what do we do
 
05:15:45.628 --> 05:15:45.638 align:start position:0%
here there um have a lot of people who
 
05:15:48.948 --> 05:15:48.958 align:start position:0%
want to talk and that's great um
 
05:15:52.990 --> 05:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
but uh just keep in mind that we don't
 
05:15:56.990 --> 05:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
want to be here all night so if you want
 
05:15:59.310 --> 05:15:59.320 align:start position:0%
to say something but you've heard people
 
05:16:02.990 --> 05:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
say the same thing before um please it
 
05:16:05.548 --> 05:16:05.558 align:start position:0%
may not be necessary to repeat it maybe
 
05:16:08.510 --> 05:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
just what what they said if you have
 
05:16:11.670 --> 05:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
written testimony um turn that in the
 
05:16:13.990 --> 05:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
clerk will put that into the record and
 
05:16:16.868 --> 05:16:16.878 align:start position:0%
and try to summarize what you have
 
05:16:19.750 --> 05:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
rather um than than read written
 
05:16:22.548 --> 05:16:22.558 align:start position:0%
testimony um the other thing is I I flip
 
05:16:25.270 --> 05:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
through these cards and almost everyone
 
05:16:27.390 --> 05:16:27.400 align:start position:0%
I think I found two maybe three that
 
05:16:29.350 --> 05:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
were different wrote down that they
 
05:16:33.190 --> 05:16:33.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak for three minutes so um
 
05:16:35.868 --> 05:16:35.878 align:start position:0%
I'd like to ask everyone to please stick
 
05:16:39.868 --> 05:16:39.878 align:start position:0%
to that three minutes um and we'll kind
 
05:16:42.350 --> 05:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
of be watching the clock and maybe maybe
 
05:16:45.990 --> 05:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
wave if if people are going over time
 
05:16:47.990 --> 05:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
and that will just make sure that
 
05:16:50.190 --> 05:16:50.200 align:start position:0%
everyone's here we want everyone has a
 
05:16:53.030 --> 05:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
chance get a chance to speak some people
 
05:16:54.910 --> 05:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
are going to have to leave if we go on
 
05:16:56.948 --> 05:16:56.958 align:start position:0%
too long and I don't want to have people
 
05:16:59.590 --> 05:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
lose their opportunity to testify
 
05:17:02.830 --> 05:17:02.840 align:start position:0%
because um they've run out of time so
 
05:17:05.548 --> 05:17:05.558 align:start position:0%
with that I think we
 
05:17:09.150 --> 05:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
are certainly and why don't you just say
 
05:17:12.750 --> 05:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
it for ex I was just asking our chair um
 
05:17:14.750 --> 05:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
I noticed for example one of our
 
05:17:17.190 --> 05:17:17.200 align:start position:0%
executive counselors is here today so I
 
05:17:19.670 --> 05:17:19.680 align:start position:0%
don't know if anyone has any constraints
 
05:17:22.430 --> 05:17:22.440 align:start position:0%
in their own time we probably should be
 
05:17:25.628 --> 05:17:25.638 align:start position:0%
aware of uh anybody that has to leave
 
05:17:28.990 --> 05:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
for their responsibilities and whatnot I
 
05:17:30.750 --> 05:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
just I don't know I assume she might but
 
05:17:34.150 --> 05:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:37.470 --> 05:17:37.480 align:start position:0%
and um just so people are aware what
 
05:17:39.868 --> 05:17:39.878 align:start position:0%
we've been doing is as the cards go in
 
05:17:42.470 --> 05:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
we've been putting in first in first out
 
05:17:45.150 --> 05:17:45.160 align:start position:0%
so yes if somebody has some kind of
 
05:17:48.430 --> 05:17:48.440 align:start position:0%
emergency constraint uh let me know and
 
05:17:51.110 --> 05:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
and I'll I'll try to reshuffle
 
05:17:54.470 --> 05:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
accordingly um so with that I will open
 
05:17:58.430 --> 05:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
the hearing on HB
 
05:18:01.548 --> 05:18:01.558 align:start position:0%
1377 and I will ask the sponsor to
 
05:18:08.868 --> 05:18:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:11.910 --> 05:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chair uh dear
 
05:18:14.990 --> 05:18:15.000 align:start position:0%

Barton I'm very thankful for the
 
05:18:26.830 --> 05:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to introduce HB
 
05:18:30.990 --> 05:18:31.000 align:start position:0%
1377 FN also commonly known as a right
 
05:18:34.030 --> 05:18:34.040 align:start position:0%
to work work uh the bill is written is
 
05:18:37.110 --> 05:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
granting workers free choice to join or
 
05:18:40.590 --> 05:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
refrain from joining labor unions uh it
 
05:18:44.430 --> 05:18:44.440 align:start position:0%
fixes the current situation when workers
 
05:18:48.390 --> 05:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
are forced to pay the union dues even if
 
05:18:51.470 --> 05:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
they do not want to be part of the Union
 
05:18:54.270 --> 05:18:54.280 align:start position:0%
do not agree with the Union goals
 
05:18:57.310 --> 05:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
leadership self-serving expenditures or
 
05:19:00.390 --> 05:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
financial financial support uh for a
 
05:19:00.400 --> 05:19:02.430 align:start position:0%
financial financial support uh for a
certain

05:19:02.430 --> 05:19:02.440 align:start position:0%
certain
 
05:19:06.110 --> 05:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
politician those mandatory fees hurt the
 
05:19:09.030 --> 05:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
most financially valuable
 
05:19:12.070 --> 05:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
constituents right to work is adopted by
 
05:19:16.948 --> 05:19:16.958 align:start position:0%
a majority of states and when we compare
 
05:19:19.670 --> 05:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
right to work states with states with
 
05:19:19.680 --> 05:19:20.788 align:start position:0%
right to work states with states with
forced

05:19:20.788 --> 05:19:20.798 align:start position:0%
forced
 
05:19:24.670 --> 05:19:24.680 align:start position:0%
unionism right to work is a win BN for
 
05:19:28.510 --> 05:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
everyone so let's compare states with
 
05:19:31.390 --> 05:19:31.400 align:start position:0%
forc unionism in general uh New
 
05:19:35.670 --> 05:19:35.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire specifically and uh right to V
 
05:19:38.750 --> 05:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
States so right to walk states have at
 
05:19:42.030 --> 05:19:42.040 align:start position:0%
least 7% points higher growth in number
 
05:19:45.548 --> 05:19:45.558 align:start position:0%
of people employed they have at least
 
05:19:49.390 --> 05:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
80% higher if we take private non-farm
 
05:19:52.548 --> 05:19:52.558 align:start position:0%
sectors uh 7even at least 7% higher
 
05:19:56.948 --> 05:19:56.958 align:start position:0%
growth in population 35 to 54 that New
 
05:19:58.750 --> 05:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was
 
05:20:02.830 --> 05:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
losing and 7 uh % higher real growth in
 
05:20:02.840 --> 05:20:04.270 align:start position:0%
losing and 7 uh % higher real growth in
household

05:20:04.270 --> 05:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
household
 
05:20:07.470 --> 05:20:07.480 align:start position:0%
consumption and at least twice more new
 
05:20:10.030 --> 05:20:10.040 align:start position:0%
private single unit housing
 
05:20:13.190 --> 05:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
alization even opponents of the bill
 
05:20:17.350 --> 05:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
recognize that this bill helps increase
 
05:20:18.788 --> 05:20:18.798 align:start position:0%
the number of
 
05:20:22.110 --> 05:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
employed but they counted it uh by
 
05:20:25.070 --> 05:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
saying that the salaries are
 
05:20:28.670 --> 05:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
lower it might be true uh for example in
 
05:20:30.628 --> 05:20:30.638 align:start position:0%
forced restrictive States like
 
05:20:30.638 --> 05:20:31.948 align:start position:0%
forced restrictive States like
California

05:20:31.948 --> 05:20:31.958 align:start position:0%
California
 
05:20:35.350 --> 05:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
that salaries are in general higher in
 
05:20:38.830 --> 05:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
California but uh what is even higher
 
05:20:40.030 --> 05:20:40.040 align:start position:0%
cost of
 
05:20:43.390 --> 05:20:43.400 align:start position:0%
living when we calculate cost of living
 
05:20:46.230 --> 05:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
adjustment for private sector salaries
 
05:20:48.670 --> 05:20:48.680 align:start position:0%
the difference goes away and even
 
05:20:52.430 --> 05:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
reverses so slight difference of uh
 
05:20:54.390 --> 05:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
employees in a right to work states
 
05:20:58.190 --> 05:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
making a few hundred more in the past
 
05:21:01.110 --> 05:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire was uh split on on this
 
05:21:05.070 --> 05:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
isue New Hampshire was unsure uh but uh
 
05:21:08.110 --> 05:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
this new scientific data from dozens of
 
05:21:11.110 --> 05:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
states with a Right to Work legislation
 
05:21:14.190 --> 05:21:14.200 align:start position:0%
shows that uh it is time so please
 
05:21:17.750 --> 05:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
support this bill uh thank you and I'm
 
05:21:20.548 --> 05:21:20.558 align:start position:0%
ready to answer any questions thank you
 
05:21:22.190 --> 05:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
for your testimony are there any
 
05:21:24.990 --> 05:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
05:21:27.868 --> 05:21:27.878 align:start position:0%
sponsor thank you um this is something
 
05:21:29.868 --> 05:21:29.878 align:start position:0%
I'll ask anyone or you can just provide
 
05:21:32.230 --> 05:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
it I see your remark Mar s are written
 
05:21:34.868 --> 05:21:34.878 align:start position:0%
um as the clerk I would love to have a
 
05:21:36.830 --> 05:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
copy thank
 
05:21:40.430 --> 05:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
05:21:44.510 --> 05:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:46.470 --> 05:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
Susie thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:21:47.830 --> 05:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
you for answering the
 
05:21:50.910 --> 05:21:50.920 align:start position:0%
question can you please explain the bill
 
05:21:52.628 --> 05:21:52.638 align:start position:0%
and what the impact would be regarding
 
05:21:59.070 --> 05:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:04.750 --> 05:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
law so a Bill allows workers to join or
 
05:22:10.750 --> 05:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
not to join uh unions and uh it fixes
 
05:22:14.270 --> 05:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
the situation when people are forced to
 
05:22:18.230 --> 05:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
pay union dues even if they don't agree
 
05:22:21.310 --> 05:22:21.320 align:start position:0%
with the goals of certain
 
05:22:23.990 --> 05:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
Union and uh in terms
 
05:22:28.470 --> 05:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
of large implications uh maybe you could
 
05:22:32.430 --> 05:22:32.440 align:start position:0%
clarify your question but if uh I'm
 
05:22:35.270 --> 05:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
missing something uh we will have more
 
05:22:37.590 --> 05:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable people testifying after me
 
05:22:42.548 --> 05:22:42.558 align:start position:0%
who can help answer the larger
 
05:22:45.470 --> 05:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
implications any other
 
05:22:48.708 --> 05:22:48.718 align:start position:0%
questions representative L Clair thank
 
05:22:50.030 --> 05:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
05:22:53.590 --> 05:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
question too um so you said that um
 
05:22:56.430 --> 05:22:56.440 align:start position:0%
people are forced to pay union dues have
 
05:22:58.470 --> 05:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
you asked Union people if they're forced
 
05:23:03.788 --> 05:23:03.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:07.590 --> 05:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
definitely we have situations when
 
05:23:11.548 --> 05:23:11.558 align:start position:0%
um we have uh union members who choose
 
05:23:15.190 --> 05:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
to pay union dues but also we have
 
05:23:17.910 --> 05:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
situations when people would rather
 
05:23:17.920 --> 05:23:19.110 align:start position:0%
situations when people would rather
prefer

05:23:19.110 --> 05:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
prefer
 
05:23:24.470 --> 05:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
working uh without uh pay paying those
 
05:23:26.680 --> 05:23:26.690 align:start position:0%
dues and not to be part of the
 
05:23:26.690 --> 05:23:28.310 align:start position:0%
dues and not to be part of the
[Music]

05:23:28.310 --> 05:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:23:31.590 --> 05:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
Union follow up follow up
 
05:23:34.310 --> 05:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
so I mean everybody has a choice right
 
05:23:35.948 --> 05:23:35.958 align:start position:0%
to be part of a union or not be part of
 
05:23:37.270 --> 05:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
a union if you don't want to work for a
 
05:23:38.708 --> 05:23:38.718 align:start position:0%
particular job
 
05:23:40.868 --> 05:23:40.878 align:start position:0%
that would rather have you be a union
 
05:23:42.430 --> 05:23:42.440 align:start position:0%
member you don't have to work there is
 
05:23:42.440 --> 05:23:44.548 align:start position:0%
member you don't have to work there is
that

05:23:44.548 --> 05:23:44.558 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:23:50.150 --> 05:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
correct um you can see at it that way
 
05:23:54.150 --> 05:23:54.160 align:start position:0%
but um I'm seeing that
 
05:23:57.948 --> 05:23:57.958 align:start position:0%
uh uh people should be free to work
 
05:24:00.350 --> 05:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
without being forced to be part of the
 
05:24:00.360 --> 05:24:01.470 align:start position:0%
without being forced to be part of the
Union

05:24:01.470 --> 05:24:01.480 align:start position:0%
Union
 
05:24:01.480 --> 05:24:02.830 align:start position:0%
Union
and

05:24:02.830 --> 05:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:24:02.840 --> 05:24:05.150 align:start position:0%
and
uh

05:24:05.150 --> 05:24:05.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:24:09.948 --> 05:24:09.958 align:start position:0%
Union Union has their freedom of uh be
 
05:24:12.470 --> 05:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
being in Union and have their own
 
05:24:12.480 --> 05:24:13.948 align:start position:0%
being in Union and have their own
bargaining

05:24:13.948 --> 05:24:13.958 align:start position:0%
bargaining
 
05:24:17.590 --> 05:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
agreements thank you representative
 
05:24:19.948 --> 05:24:19.958 align:start position:0%
svin thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:24:22.070 --> 05:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question are you familiar with
 
05:24:28.590 --> 05:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:32.390 --> 05:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
representation uh is it uh in in this
 
05:24:37.070 --> 05:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:37.080 --> 05:24:40.270 align:start position:0%
 
much

05:24:40.270 --> 05:24:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:42.230 --> 05:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
so the the
 
05:24:46.868 --> 05:24:46.878 align:start position:0%
way I see it there there some um
 
05:24:50.110 --> 05:24:50.120 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding about this term I don't
 
05:24:52.150 --> 05:24:52.160 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
05:24:54.830 --> 05:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
unions necessarily have duty to
 
05:24:57.150 --> 05:24:57.160 align:start position:0%
represent those who are not paying
 
05:25:01.830 --> 05:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
unions dues so uh that's how I
 
05:25:03.910 --> 05:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
understand your question and
 
05:25:06.470 --> 05:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh I think we have different
 
05:25:09.150 --> 05:25:09.160 align:start position:0%
understanding on what's going on here
 
05:25:09.160 --> 05:25:10.910 align:start position:0%
understanding on what's going on here
followup

05:25:10.910 --> 05:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
followup
 
05:25:13.750 --> 05:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
followup are you aware that unions are
 
05:25:16.350 --> 05:25:16.360 align:start position:0%
required to represent everyone that is
 
05:25:18.990 --> 05:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
covered by their contract
 
05:25:21.750 --> 05:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
therefore a union would have to um
 
05:25:25.430 --> 05:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
represent dues paying members and non-u
 
05:25:25.440 --> 05:25:29.670 align:start position:0%
represent dues paying members and non-u
paying

05:25:29.670 --> 05:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:29.680 --> 05:25:32.190 align:start position:0%
 
non-members

05:25:32.190 --> 05:25:32.200 align:start position:0%
non-members
 
05:25:35.548 --> 05:25:35.558 align:start position:0%
um I would agree with you that uh if
 
05:25:37.110 --> 05:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
it's in a
 
05:25:40.270 --> 05:25:40.280 align:start position:0%
contract the union might be obliged by
 
05:25:44.470 --> 05:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
that contract but as far as I understand
 
05:25:46.948 --> 05:25:46.958 align:start position:0%
uh the current situation the cont
 
05:25:51.830 --> 05:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:55.628 --> 05:25:55.638 align:start position:0%
way thank you represent
 
05:25:59.190 --> 05:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
buard thank you Mr chair um thank you
 
05:26:01.230 --> 05:26:01.240 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
05:26:02.628 --> 05:26:02.638 align:start position:0%
uh do you think it's fair for some
 
05:26:04.390 --> 05:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
workers to benefit from collective
 
05:26:07.510 --> 05:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreements without sharing
 
05:26:07.520 --> 05:26:13.110 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreements without sharing
the

05:26:13.110 --> 05:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:16.310 --> 05:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
cost uh it's it's a uh thank you for
 
05:26:19.590 --> 05:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
your question and uh yes it's a common
 
05:26:24.910 --> 05:26:24.920 align:start position:0%
uh objection to right to work uh so uh I
 
05:26:29.590 --> 05:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
think um some some people may perceive
 
05:26:34.788 --> 05:26:34.798 align:start position:0%
uh uh it uh uh the same way as you
 
05:26:38.548 --> 05:26:38.558 align:start position:0%
worded it but it is being fixed as I say
 
05:26:41.990 --> 05:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
by the fact that uh conflict could be
 
05:26:44.868 --> 05:26:44.878 align:start position:0%
constructed in that way so union doesn't
 
05:26:49.390 --> 05:26:49.400 align:start position:0%
have to um represent uh those who are
 
05:26:52.030 --> 05:26:52.040 align:start position:0%
not part of the unions and doesn't have
 
05:26:55.548 --> 05:26:55.558 align:start position:0%
to include them in the same agreement so
 
05:27:01.310 --> 05:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
I I think uh there are uh when if if if
 
05:27:05.470 --> 05:27:05.480 align:start position:0%
it's if it's felt as unfair and Bome
 
05:27:12.190 --> 05:27:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:15.310 --> 05:27:15.320 align:start position:0%
it follow
 
05:27:18.910 --> 05:27:18.920 align:start position:0%
up I I don't I don't believe that that
 
05:27:20.948 --> 05:27:20.958 align:start position:0%
you can do that when you have a
 
05:27:23.510 --> 05:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining bill you have to
 
05:27:23.520 --> 05:27:26.830 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining bill you have to
represent

05:27:26.830 --> 05:27:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:35.070 --> 05:27:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:37.788 --> 05:27:37.798 align:start position:0%
uh I believe it's the same question that
 
05:27:39.670 --> 05:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
I answered before
 
05:27:39.680 --> 05:27:43.310 align:start position:0%
I answered before
uh

05:27:43.310 --> 05:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:46.070 --> 05:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
so I I don't have new
 
05:27:49.190 --> 05:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
information representative brudy thank
 
05:27:51.948 --> 05:27:51.958 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um do you think it's
 
05:27:54.190 --> 05:27:54.200 align:start position:0%
right to ask somebody to do something
 
05:27:57.190 --> 05:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
for you without compensating them if you
 
05:27:59.030 --> 05:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
need something done and you force
 
05:28:01.270 --> 05:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
somebody to help you
 
05:28:07.868 --> 05:28:07.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:07.878 --> 05:28:09.708 align:start position:0%
 
him

05:28:09.708 --> 05:28:09.718 align:start position:0%
him
 
05:28:14.110 --> 05:28:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:16.670 --> 05:28:16.680 align:start position:0%
uh this bill
 
05:28:20.788 --> 05:28:20.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't doesn't stop unions
 
05:28:25.110 --> 05:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
from limiting or completely denying
 
05:28:27.750 --> 05:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
amount of services that they provide to
 
05:28:29.670 --> 05:28:29.680 align:start position:0%
those who are not paying them for those
 
05:28:29.680 --> 05:28:31.830 align:start position:0%
those who are not paying them for those
services

05:28:31.830 --> 05:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
services
 
05:28:35.590 --> 05:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you Mr chairman so if if
 
05:28:38.868 --> 05:28:38.878 align:start position:0%
you um don't want to belong to the union
 
05:28:40.470 --> 05:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
but you need their
 
05:28:42.548 --> 05:28:42.558 align:start position:0%
services don't you think it's right that
 
05:28:44.430 --> 05:28:44.440 align:start position:0%
you pay for the services or do you
 
05:28:46.788 --> 05:28:46.798 align:start position:0%
expect people to work for free and other
 
05:28:50.910 --> 05:28:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:54.150 --> 05:28:54.160 align:start position:0%
you I think it's could be solved on one
 
05:28:57.548 --> 05:28:57.558 align:start position:0%
to one case if somebody suddenly feels
 
05:29:00.868 --> 05:29:00.878 align:start position:0%
an urge uh to join the union bill
 
05:29:03.590 --> 05:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't stop people from volunteer
 
05:29:07.470 --> 05:29:07.480 align:start position:0%
joining the union and starting paying uh
 
05:29:11.270 --> 05:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
the the fees or otherwise contributing
 
05:29:13.788 --> 05:29:13.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:17.150 --> 05:29:17.160 align:start position:0%
union representative love thank you for
 
05:29:18.510 --> 05:29:18.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question you know back in the
 
05:29:21.788 --> 05:29:21.798 align:start position:0%
70s I I had a job uh you know working on
 
05:29:24.868 --> 05:29:24.878 align:start position:0%
a beer truck was a union job and uh the
 
05:29:26.948 --> 05:29:26.958 align:start position:0%
business agent uh that was a pretty
 
05:29:29.990 --> 05:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
contentious uh you know environment uh
 
05:29:32.190 --> 05:29:32.200 align:start position:0%
labor related but uh the business agent
 
05:29:34.910 --> 05:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
was going out to drink drink have liquid
 
05:29:37.708 --> 05:29:37.718 align:start position:0%
lunch with the bosses three times a week
 
05:29:40.670 --> 05:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
which left us in a a pretty rotten spot
 
05:29:43.230 --> 05:29:43.240 align:start position:0%
uh at that time we could we could not
 
05:29:45.948 --> 05:29:45.958 align:start position:0%
and even now today we could not say hey
 
05:29:47.350 --> 05:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
until you start doing your job you're
 
05:29:49.030 --> 05:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
not getting any more money we were being
 
05:29:51.910 --> 05:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
forced to to buy a product that wasn't
 
05:29:55.030 --> 05:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
serving us do you think that's
 
05:29:59.230 --> 05:29:59.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:03.708 --> 05:30:03.718 align:start position:0%
right right thank you um so I would
 
05:30:06.030 --> 05:30:06.040 align:start position:0%
especially with a sponsor I think we
 
05:30:07.670 --> 05:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
like to have more questions with the
 
05:30:09.788 --> 05:30:09.798 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill I would remind the
 
05:30:12.110 --> 05:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
committee that I've got a thick pile of
 
05:30:15.230 --> 05:30:15.240 align:start position:0%
cards here and we're going to have a lot
 
05:30:17.310 --> 05:30:17.320 align:start position:0%
of people talking on both sides of the
 
05:30:19.590 --> 05:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
bill some of whom we'll agree with some
 
05:30:21.190 --> 05:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
of whom will disagree with and I think
 
05:30:23.030 --> 05:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
it would be better to let the people who
 
05:30:26.230 --> 05:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
have come speak and make the points uh
 
05:30:28.788 --> 05:30:28.798 align:start position:0%
not to cut off questions when you really
 
05:30:31.750 --> 05:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
have them but be mindful of the number
 
05:30:33.910 --> 05:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
of people that are here before us so I
 
05:30:36.990 --> 05:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
thank you in advance for that if there
 
05:30:38.830 --> 05:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions before the
 
05:30:41.150 --> 05:30:41.160 align:start position:0%
SP for the
 
05:30:45.230 --> 05:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
sponsor seeing none thank you and I said
 
05:30:48.830 --> 05:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
I'd read ahead so um I'm going to next
 
05:30:52.150 --> 05:30:52.160 align:start position:0%
call uh co-sponsor uh representative Dan
 
05:30:55.270 --> 05:30:55.280 align:start position:0%
Maguire I'm going to call Rich Gula and
 
05:30:58.110 --> 05:30:58.120 align:start position:0%
I'm GNA call Maggie
 
05:31:00.990 --> 05:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
Fogerty and again I know some people
 
05:31:03.310 --> 05:31:03.320 align:start position:0%
walked in after I said that one of the
 
05:31:06.430 --> 05:31:06.440 align:start position:0%
reasons I'm doing that is we have set up
 
05:31:09.948 --> 05:31:09.958 align:start position:0%
upstairs room 307 has a monitor so if it
 
05:31:11.990 --> 05:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
gets too crowded here and people want a
 
05:31:14.150 --> 05:31:14.160 align:start position:0%
little more space you can go up here and
 
05:31:16.670 --> 05:31:16.680 align:start position:0%
and we'll make sure that you can still
 
05:31:19.788 --> 05:31:19.798 align:start position:0%
testify um and get back down if need be
 
05:31:22.830 --> 05:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
and with that representative uh thank
 
05:31:24.590 --> 05:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chairman members of the
 
05:31:26.150 --> 05:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Dan
 
05:31:28.910 --> 05:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
Maguire I represent the town of
 
05:31:32.190 --> 05:31:32.200 align:start position:0%
Epsom um I'm happy to co-sponsor this
 
05:31:36.470 --> 05:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
bill because I see it as just sort of um
 
05:31:37.830 --> 05:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
basic sort of
 
05:31:40.990 --> 05:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
antitrust legislation for the labor
 
05:31:43.310 --> 05:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
Arena so let me give you an example
 
05:31:46.750 --> 05:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
suppose in the in the regular business
 
05:31:50.350 --> 05:31:50.360 align:start position:0%
Arena um apple and Verizon were to get
 
05:31:53.868 --> 05:31:53.878 align:start position:0%
together and make an agreement such that
 
05:31:57.628 --> 05:31:57.638 align:start position:0%
Verizon would exclusively sell iPhones
 
05:32:00.110 --> 05:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
to their customers and there wouldn't
 
05:32:03.590 --> 05:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
allow any customer uh new to come in
 
05:32:05.430 --> 05:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
with with a non with some other kind of
 
05:32:08.910 --> 05:32:08.920 align:start position:0%
phone only iPhones right well that
 
05:32:11.708 --> 05:32:11.718 align:start position:0%
agreement that might benefit Apple it
 
05:32:13.110 --> 05:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
might benefit
 
05:32:16.230 --> 05:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
Verizon but it would not benefit the
 
05:32:19.868 --> 05:32:19.878 align:start position:0%
public right that that would be um a
 
05:32:22.390 --> 05:32:22.400 align:start position:0%
monopolistic agreement and if if if they
 
05:32:25.310 --> 05:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
tried to make such an agreement um the
 
05:32:27.390 --> 05:32:27.400 align:start position:0%
justice department antitrust division
 
05:32:30.670 --> 05:32:30.680 align:start position:0%
would have something to say to them
 
05:32:34.230 --> 05:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
so in the Labor Field what we're talking
 
05:32:37.230 --> 05:32:37.240 align:start position:0%
about here is is something very similar
 
05:32:41.270 --> 05:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
right suppose uh the AFL CIO and Walmart
 
05:32:44.868 --> 05:32:44.878 align:start position:0%
got together and they said uh okay
 
05:32:46.788 --> 05:32:46.798 align:start position:0%
everybody who works for Walmart has to
 
05:32:49.830 --> 05:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
belong to the AFL CIO and we won't hire
 
05:32:53.070 --> 05:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
anyone else all right that might work
 
05:32:55.948 --> 05:32:55.958 align:start position:0%
well for the aflcio it possibly could
 
05:32:58.670 --> 05:32:58.680 align:start position:0%
even work well for Walmart but it's not
 
05:33:00.708 --> 05:33:00.718 align:start position:0%
right for the public
 
05:33:03.430 --> 05:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
right because
 
05:33:08.150 --> 05:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
because if the people being working and
 
05:33:11.350 --> 05:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
being paid and Walmart are all
 
05:33:14.350 --> 05:33:14.360 align:start position:0%
gaining it's the consumers who are
 
05:33:20.548 --> 05:33:20.558 align:start position:0%
losing right so um and our constitution
 
05:33:23.990 --> 05:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
is very clear about this right it has
 
05:33:27.190 --> 05:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
very strong anti-m monopolistic language
 
05:33:30.708 --> 05:33:30.718 align:start position:0%
in part two article 83 so I I see this
 
05:33:33.628 --> 05:33:33.638 align:start position:0%
very simply I I don't see that those two
 
05:33:36.070 --> 05:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
examples the commercial example and the
 
05:33:39.350 --> 05:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
labor example have any real difference
 
05:33:47.030 --> 05:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:49.470 --> 05:33:49.480 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you very much for your
 
05:33:52.948 --> 05:33:52.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:55.470 --> 05:33:55.480 align:start position:0%
questions I have so much respect for you
 
05:33:58.070 --> 05:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
representative a soft spot in my heart
 
05:34:02.310 --> 05:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
for you um we do disagree on this one um
 
05:34:05.030 --> 05:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
would you believe that mit's business
 
05:34:07.628 --> 05:34:07.638 align:start position:0%
school professors at mit's business
 
05:34:10.270 --> 05:34:10.280 align:start position:0%
school have multiple studies that show
 
05:34:13.470 --> 05:34:13.480 align:start position:0%
when workers are either organized or
 
05:34:17.510 --> 05:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
treated very well paid decent wage that
 
05:34:20.868 --> 05:34:20.878 align:start position:0%
those companies like Costco for example
 
05:34:24.470 --> 05:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
are um not when they're happier and when
 
05:34:27.788 --> 05:34:27.798 align:start position:0%
they're treated well they actually uh
 
05:34:30.070 --> 05:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
are more profitable compared to to
 
05:34:32.190 --> 05:34:32.200 align:start position:0%
companies like
 
05:34:36.868 --> 05:34:36.878 align:start position:0%
Walmart so um would you believe that
 
05:34:40.590 --> 05:34:40.600 align:start position:0%
even at mit's business school um the
 
05:34:42.590 --> 05:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
value of
 
05:34:45.628 --> 05:34:45.638 align:start position:0%
Labor has been expressed in a different
 
05:34:48.350 --> 05:34:48.360 align:start position:0%
way than um you
 
05:34:50.910 --> 05:34:50.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned um thanks for the question if
 
05:34:53.430 --> 05:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
it is a question I guess
 
05:34:56.590 --> 05:34:56.600 align:start position:0%
uh you know I I'll take your word for it
 
05:34:58.990 --> 05:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
um but I don't think it's quite relevant
 
05:35:01.868 --> 05:35:01.878 align:start position:0%
to to what I was uh talking
 
05:35:03.830 --> 05:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
about further
 
05:35:07.030 --> 05:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
05:35:09.510 --> 05:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
stop thank you thank you for taking my
 
05:35:11.310 --> 05:35:11.320 align:start position:0%
question I'm a little confused about
 
05:35:13.590 --> 05:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
something you said you said if the
 
05:35:17.230 --> 05:35:17.240 align:start position:0%
workers at Walmart were um were members
 
05:35:20.190 --> 05:35:20.200 align:start position:0%
of a union that they would benefit but
 
05:35:22.310 --> 05:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
that members of the public and consumers
 
05:35:25.270 --> 05:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
would lose my question to you is are
 
05:35:27.750 --> 05:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
people that work at Walmart also members
 
05:35:31.350 --> 05:35:31.360 align:start position:0%
of the public and um
 
05:35:33.310 --> 05:35:33.320 align:start position:0%
consumers thank you for the question of
 
05:35:36.750 --> 05:35:36.760 align:start position:0%
course they are yeah but but they're not
 
05:35:40.708 --> 05:35:40.718 align:start position:0%
all consumers right there there are
 
05:35:45.948 --> 05:35:45.958 align:start position:0%
some um so so so I mean if you read part
 
05:35:49.590 --> 05:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
two article 83 right it it talks very
 
05:35:51.990 --> 05:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
clearly about monopolies and and
 
05:35:54.590 --> 05:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
combinations and exclusivity and things
 
05:35:57.830 --> 05:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
like that that's what's going
 
05:36:02.430 --> 05:36:02.440 align:start position:0%
on further question representative
 
05:36:04.750 --> 05:36:04.760 align:start position:0%
McKenzie representative MCU thank you
 
05:36:06.590 --> 05:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
for hearing before the
 
05:36:10.628 --> 05:36:10.638 align:start position:0%
committee your logic um seems to ignore
 
05:36:12.750 --> 05:36:12.760 align:start position:0%
the fact that there is a separate
 
05:36:14.830 --> 05:36:14.840 align:start position:0%
structure that governs Labor
 
05:36:17.708 --> 05:36:17.718 align:start position:0%
Relations uh it's not the antitrust law
 
05:36:19.750 --> 05:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
it's not business law it's the National
 
05:36:21.590 --> 05:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
Labor Relations
 
05:36:25.510 --> 05:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
law so in that context have you ever
 
05:36:27.510 --> 05:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
reviewed the National Labor Relations
 
05:36:29.788 --> 05:36:29.798 align:start position:0%
law and are you familiar with the the
 
05:36:33.628 --> 05:36:33.638 align:start position:0%
terms and conditions under which people
 
05:36:37.868 --> 05:36:37.878 align:start position:0%
work yes thanks for the question I the
 
05:36:39.548 --> 05:36:39.558 align:start position:0%
the basic answer is no I'm not an
 
05:36:43.070 --> 05:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
attorney I'm an engineer okay but I
 
05:36:45.868 --> 05:36:45.878 align:start position:0%
think my logic is sound all right I
 
05:36:50.110 --> 05:36:50.120 align:start position:0%
don't think um there's a substantive
 
05:36:53.628 --> 05:36:53.638 align:start position:0%
difference uh between uh paying for
 
05:36:56.910 --> 05:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
labor and paying for
 
05:37:01.670 --> 05:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:01.680 --> 05:37:02.670 align:start position:0%
 
follow

05:37:02.670 --> 05:37:02.680 align:start position:0%
follow
 
05:37:07.750 --> 05:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
up uh the person before you um suggested
 
05:37:11.628 --> 05:37:11.638 align:start position:0%
or said that people are compelled to be
 
05:37:15.830 --> 05:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
members of any Union uh are you are you
 
05:37:18.270 --> 05:37:18.280 align:start position:0%
familiar uh with the way that this thing
 
05:37:21.910 --> 05:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
works in terms of compelling anybody uh
 
05:37:24.030 --> 05:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
and the prohibition against compelling
 
05:37:25.390 --> 05:37:25.400 align:start position:0%
somebody to be in a
 
05:37:30.070 --> 05:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
union um I I think so not uh not super
 
05:37:32.030 --> 05:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
well I mean I I personally had a working
 
05:37:35.070 --> 05:37:35.080 align:start position:0%
career I was never a member of a union
 
05:37:39.830 --> 05:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
um but um as I understand it you can be
 
05:37:41.190 --> 05:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
compelled to
 
05:37:44.708 --> 05:37:44.718 align:start position:0%
pay uh at least some portion of dues but
 
05:37:46.110 --> 05:37:46.120 align:start position:0%
you don't have you're not compelled to
 
05:37:47.110 --> 05:37:47.120 align:start position:0%
be a
 
05:37:49.910 --> 05:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
member technically in the sense that you
 
05:37:52.350 --> 05:37:52.360 align:start position:0%
you join and vote and things like that
 
05:37:53.990 --> 05:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
that's the way I understand it but I
 
05:37:55.708 --> 05:37:55.718 align:start position:0%
could I could easily be
 
05:37:58.150 --> 05:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
wrong final final question are you
 
05:38:00.110 --> 05:38:00.120 align:start position:0%
familiar with CWA versus
 
05:38:05.830 --> 05:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
Beck no which prohibits uh uh compelling
 
05:38:09.510 --> 05:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
people to pay even a uh even at agency
 
05:38:11.750 --> 05:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
fee you familiar you're not familiar
 
05:38:15.390 --> 05:38:15.400 align:start position:0%
with that no okay thank
 
05:38:18.110 --> 05:38:18.120 align:start position:0%
you further questions from the committee
 
05:38:24.788 --> 05:38:24.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:28.190 --> 05:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
Clair yes turn the mic on because people
 
05:38:30.270 --> 05:38:30.280 align:start position:0%
upstairs can't appreciate it
 
05:38:31.750 --> 05:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
representative mire I just wanted to ask
 
05:38:33.070 --> 05:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
you the same question I asked
 
05:38:36.110 --> 05:38:36.120 align:start position:0%
representative poz of if you have the
 
05:38:37.868 --> 05:38:37.878 align:start position:0%
choice right you can you know if you
 
05:38:39.750 --> 05:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to go to Verizon because
 
05:38:44.070 --> 05:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
their Union you don't go to whomever
 
05:38:46.070 --> 05:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
else Comcast whomever else whatever
 
05:38:48.230 --> 05:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
carry anywhere don't you think that's
 
05:38:51.670 --> 05:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for the question so
 
05:38:55.590 --> 05:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
obviously there's um there are edge
 
05:38:57.750 --> 05:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
cases right I mean
 
05:39:00.548 --> 05:39:00.558 align:start position:0%
things the the justice department
 
05:39:03.150 --> 05:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't go after people who are this big
 
05:39:05.190 --> 05:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
they go after people who are this big
 
05:39:07.548 --> 05:39:07.558 align:start position:0%
right um you could say the same right
 
05:39:10.590 --> 05:39:10.600 align:start position:0%
now for example they're suing Google for
 
05:39:13.310 --> 05:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
having deals with computer manufacturers
 
05:39:15.468 --> 05:39:15.478 align:start position:0%
that makes their search engine the
 
05:39:18.030 --> 05:39:18.040 align:start position:0%
default search engine they pay they pay
 
05:39:21.070 --> 05:39:21.080 align:start position:0%
manufacturers to do that well you could
 
05:39:22.990 --> 05:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
say the exact same argument you could
 
05:39:25.350 --> 05:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
say well they can use Bing or they can
 
05:39:28.390 --> 05:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
use this other search engine right so so
 
05:39:30.070 --> 05:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
therefore there's nothing wrong
 
05:39:31.750 --> 05:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
well the justice department thinks there
 
05:39:34.830 --> 05:39:34.840 align:start position:0%
is something wrong okay and and let me
 
05:39:37.548 --> 05:39:37.558 align:start position:0%
again let me if you mind don't mind Mr
 
05:39:39.868 --> 05:39:39.878 align:start position:0%
chairman I I just want to respond to
 
05:39:42.150 --> 05:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
some of these questions you're thinking
 
05:39:46.310 --> 05:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
of this this bill and this situation as
 
05:39:48.910 --> 05:39:48.920 align:start position:0%
just having two parties involved right
 
05:39:51.350 --> 05:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
the employer and the employee and that's
 
05:39:54.868 --> 05:39:54.878 align:start position:0%
it but the point of my testimony is
 
05:39:57.430 --> 05:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
there's a third person in this room and
 
05:39:59.990 --> 05:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
that's the rest of the public and that's
 
05:40:04.150 --> 05:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
who who um whose condition we we should
 
05:40:07.270 --> 05:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
be thinking about thank you Mr chair
 
05:40:10.830 --> 05:40:10.840 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Bui thank
 
05:40:13.150 --> 05:40:13.160 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I wasn't going to ask
 
05:40:15.948 --> 05:40:15.958 align:start position:0%
you any questions my friend but what you
 
05:40:18.750 --> 05:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
just said there's three people involved
 
05:40:20.110 --> 05:40:20.120 align:start position:0%
the employer the
 
05:40:23.670 --> 05:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
employee but the person in the middle is
 
05:40:25.830 --> 05:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
what this is all about the person in the
 
05:40:28.670 --> 05:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
middle is going to be responsible for
 
05:40:32.150 --> 05:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
negotiating in for this employee taking
 
05:40:35.230 --> 05:40:35.240 align:start position:0%
care of him when he's in trouble and he
 
05:40:38.788 --> 05:40:38.798 align:start position:0%
is the the injured party let's say if
 
05:40:41.150 --> 05:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
this bill passes because he won't be
 
05:40:43.310 --> 05:40:43.320 align:start position:0%
able to get compensated for the work
 
05:40:46.070 --> 05:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
they do thank you
 
05:40:48.910 --> 05:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
do is there a would you believe in that
 
05:40:50.310 --> 05:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
would you believe would you have a
 
05:40:54.110 --> 05:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
response to that no I disagree but
 
05:40:56.750 --> 05:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
anyways any further
 
05:40:59.868 --> 05:40:59.878 align:start position:0%

um I would like to know what the impact
 
05:42:48.708 --> 05:42:48.718 align:start position:0%
on wages up and down the line are in
 
05:42:50.670 --> 05:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
Right to Work versus non-right to work
 
05:42:53.270 --> 05:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
states I just did a quick online search
 
05:42:55.788 --> 05:42:55.798 align:start position:0%
and I found that of the 10 states with
 
05:42:58.708 --> 05:42:58.718 align:start position:0%
the highest poverty rate six of them
 
05:43:00.830 --> 05:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
were to work
 
05:43:03.030 --> 05:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
states that is correct it's my
 
05:43:05.788 --> 05:43:05.798 align:start position:0%
understanding as well um right to work
 
05:43:07.590 --> 05:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
states the standard of living is much
 
05:43:10.270 --> 05:43:10.280 align:start position:0%
less than in states where unions prosper
 
05:43:10.280 --> 05:43:12.310 align:start position:0%

American friend service committee an
 
05:44:05.948 --> 05:44:05.958 align:start position:0%
organization dedicated throughout its
 
05:44:08.910 --> 05:44:08.920 align:start position:0%
106 years and counting uh to the rights

proud 16-year Union member Unite Here
 
05:44:14.760 --> 05:44:15.910 align:start position:0%
proud 16-year Union member Unite Here
Local

05:44:15.910 --> 05:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
Local
 
05:44:18.990 --> 05:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
66l and I'm here as a Quaker and a
 
05:44:21.670 --> 05:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
member of a growing group of New
 
05:44:23.788 --> 05:44:23.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire people of Faith called New
 
05:44:26.150 --> 05:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Voices of Faith and it's on
 
05:44:28.708 --> 05:44:28.718 align:start position:0%
their behalf that I give testimony today
 
05:44:33.750 --> 05:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:36.350 --> 05:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
1377 the members of New Hampshire Voices
 
05:44:38.230 --> 05:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
of Faith come together from multiple
 
05:44:40.830 --> 05:44:40.840 align:start position:0%
Faith Traditions throughout the state to
 
05:44:43.510 --> 05:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
bring a moral witness to issues of
 
05:44:47.230 --> 05:44:47.240 align:start position:0%
justice and equity in our state in our
 
05:44:49.310 --> 05:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
policymaking so as a matter of
 
05:44:51.310 --> 05:44:51.320 align:start position:0%
conscience we bear faithful witness to
 
05:44:53.788 --> 05:44:53.798 align:start position:0%
the need for policies that promote
 
05:44:56.788 --> 05:44:56.798 align:start position:0%
well-being that promote equality
 
05:44:58.468 --> 05:44:58.478 align:start position:0%
especially among those of us who are
 
05:45:00.628 --> 05:45:00.638 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable and whose rights and
 
05:45:03.868 --> 05:45:03.878 align:start position:0%
dignity are under attack so one bill
 
05:45:06.468 --> 05:45:06.478 align:start position:0%
that is causing a significant concern is
 
05:45:09.150 --> 05:45:09.160 align:start position:0%
the return yet again of a so-called
 
05:45:12.310 --> 05:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
Right to Work bill in this case HB
 
05:45:15.110 --> 05:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
1377 it is not in the interest of New
 
05:45:16.990 --> 05:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire people and we urge you to
 
05:45:17.000 --> 05:45:18.830 align:start position:0%
Hampshire people and we urge you to
recommend

05:45:18.830 --> 05:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
05:45:21.948 --> 05:45:21.958 align:start position:0%
itl we recognize that the phrase Right
 
05:45:25.468 --> 05:45:25.478 align:start position:0%
to Work can fool anyone including us
 
05:45:28.830 --> 05:45:28.840 align:start position:0%
because it certainly sounds good the
 
05:45:31.070 --> 05:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
disturbing reality however is that this
 
05:45:34.030 --> 05:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
policy is not about providing access to
 
05:45:37.150 --> 05:45:37.160 align:start position:0%
work for anyone but it's designed
 
05:45:39.910 --> 05:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
specifically to weaken unions and to
 
05:45:42.948 --> 05:45:42.958 align:start position:0%
weaken workers capacity for Collective
 
05:45:46.990 --> 05:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
action that's it it was first dreamed up
 
05:45:50.830 --> 05:45:50.840 align:start position:0%
in the 1940s in the Jim Crow South as a
 
05:45:53.270 --> 05:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
calculated effort to uphold the racial
 
05:45:56.510 --> 05:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
divide among workers by creating a
 
05:45:59.310 --> 05:45:59.320 align:start position:0%
mechanism for white workers to avoid
 
05:46:02.310 --> 05:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
being part of unions or paying dues to a
 
05:46:04.628 --> 05:46:04.638 align:start position:0%
union that included black
 
05:46:07.548 --> 05:46:07.558 align:start position:0%
workers the Dual Focus was maintaining
 
05:46:09.948 --> 05:46:09.958 align:start position:0%
racial Division and dramatically
 
05:46:13.468 --> 05:46:13.478 align:start position:0%
weakening emerging and existing unions
 
05:46:15.510 --> 05:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
both of which are very much counter to
 
05:46:17.670 --> 05:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
our shared moral
 
05:46:20.468 --> 05:46:20.478 align:start position:0%
values despite protestations to the
 
05:46:23.190 --> 05:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
contrary worker division plus the
 
05:46:25.670 --> 05:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
undermining of unions and collective
 
05:46:28.868 --> 05:46:28.878 align:start position:0%
bargaining Remains the key purpose of
 
05:46:32.110 --> 05:46:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:34.670 --> 05:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
1377 I want to add that the push for
 
05:46:37.270 --> 05:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is not bubbling up from New
 
05:46:40.070 --> 05:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire people it's the product of
 
05:46:42.750 --> 05:46:42.760 align:start position:0%
well-healed outof State groups who have
 
05:46:45.910 --> 05:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
spent Untold sums to Pedal this bill in
 
05:46:48.628 --> 05:46:48.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire year or session after
 
05:46:51.230 --> 05:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
session you as a legislator are the
 
05:46:53.628 --> 05:46:53.638 align:start position:0%
target of these advocacy
 
05:46:56.468 --> 05:46:56.478 align:start position:0%
groups the proponents of this bill claim
 
05:46:58.830 --> 05:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
that new employers will flock to the
 
05:47:01.150 --> 05:47:01.160 align:start position:0%
state of this bill is passed but they
 
05:47:03.948 --> 05:47:03.958 align:start position:0%
cannot cite a single example of any such
 
05:47:06.510 --> 05:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
employer waiting in the wings for us to
 
05:47:08.830 --> 05:47:08.840 align:start position:0%
become a right to work
 
05:47:12.830 --> 05:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
state in order to arrive here and HB
 
05:47:16.190 --> 05:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
1377 targets private sector workplaces
 
05:47:19.270 --> 05:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
where unions exist it actually prohibits
 
05:47:21.350 --> 05:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
an employer from agreeing to certain
 
05:47:23.868 --> 05:47:23.878 align:start position:0%
unifying language in the collective
 
05:47:26.590 --> 05:47:26.600 align:start position:0%
collectively bargained contract with
 
05:47:29.270 --> 05:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
workers New Hampshire employers have not
 
05:47:32.310 --> 05:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
asked for this in fact just the opposite
 
05:47:34.110 --> 05:47:34.120 align:start position:0%
numerous New Hampshire employers have
 
05:47:36.670 --> 05:47:36.680 align:start position:0%
pleaded with the legislature do not
 
05:47:39.628 --> 05:47:39.638 align:start position:0%
interfere with our freedom to decide for
 
05:47:42.390 --> 05:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
ourselves how to work with our
 
05:47:45.150 --> 05:47:45.160 align:start position:0%
unions one major New Hampshire employer
 
05:47:47.230 --> 05:47:47.240 align:start position:0%
said that this testimony would be a
 
05:47:49.948 --> 05:47:49.958 align:start position:0%
burdensome and costly intrusion on our
 
05:47:52.070 --> 05:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
freedom as a privately held
 
05:47:55.230 --> 05:47:55.240 align:start position:0%
business at its core this runs contrary
 
05:47:57.110 --> 05:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire's Live Free or Die
 
05:47:59.670 --> 05:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
principles by inserting state government
 
05:48:01.830 --> 05:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
into private business
 
05:48:04.190 --> 05:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
Affairs so Faith leaders across the
 
05:48:06.070 --> 05:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
state are clear in our opposition to
 
05:48:08.350 --> 05:48:08.360 align:start position:0%
this bill and we thank you for your
 
05:48:10.590 --> 05:48:10.600 align:start position:0%
attention to this testimony and we urge
 
05:48:12.670 --> 05:48:12.680 align:start position:0%
you to defeat it thank
 
05:48:17.788 --> 05:48:17.798 align:start position:0%
you thank you any questions for this
 
05:48:20.070 --> 05:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you can you
 
05:48:23.190 --> 05:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
pass that forward to the Clark thank
 
05:48:27.590 --> 05:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:27.600 --> 05:48:34.750 align:start position:0%
 
next

05:48:34.750 --> 05:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:36.270 --> 05:48:36.280 align:start position:0%
thank you once again honorable members
 
05:48:39.868 --> 05:48:39.878 align:start position:0%
of the committee um I the only reason I
 
05:48:42.110 --> 05:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
am speaking to you on this particular
 
05:48:43.708 --> 05:48:43.718 align:start position:0%
bill because otherwise I wouldn't have
 
05:48:45.110 --> 05:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
more to add is because I have a very
 
05:48:47.590 --> 05:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
unique story um that I want to share
 
05:48:48.990 --> 05:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
with you for the record my name is Ellen
 
05:48:51.750 --> 05:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
Reed and I represent new fields and New
 
05:48:54.548 --> 05:48:54.558 align:start position:0%
Market um I do want to correct a few
 
05:48:56.910 --> 05:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
things that were said uh and for the
 
05:48:59.670 --> 05:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
record I am very very opposed to this
 
05:49:04.190 --> 05:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
bill um so once again no one no one
 
05:49:07.150 --> 05:49:07.160 align:start position:0%
forces anyone to pay membership dues
 
05:49:10.110 --> 05:49:10.120 align:start position:0%
that is not what we are talking about
 
05:49:11.910 --> 05:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
the Free Rider fee that goes by other
 
05:49:14.230 --> 05:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
names but I call it a free rider fee is
 
05:49:16.150 --> 05:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
something that is negotiated freely and
 
05:49:19.390 --> 05:49:19.400 align:start position:0%
agreed to by the employer um and it
 
05:49:21.548 --> 05:49:21.558 align:start position:0%
covers a whole bunch of services as you
 
05:49:23.510 --> 05:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
already know and that's what the kind of
 
05:49:26.788 --> 05:49:26.798 align:start position:0%
Crux of my story will center around and
 
05:49:29.910 --> 05:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
um it is federal law nothing we can do
 
05:49:31.548 --> 05:49:31.558 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire can stop the fact that
 
05:49:33.548 --> 05:49:33.558 align:start position:0%
a union does have to provide those
 
05:49:35.628 --> 05:49:35.638 align:start position:0%
services to all people in that
 
05:49:38.670 --> 05:49:38.680 align:start position:0%
bargaining unit we cannot change the
 
05:49:40.230 --> 05:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
structure as I think the the prime
 
05:49:41.750 --> 05:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor had
 
05:49:45.628 --> 05:49:45.638 align:start position:0%
said um that fee is very very minimal uh
 
05:49:48.830 --> 05:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
even a membership dues is very minimal
 
05:49:51.830 --> 05:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
compared to the increase in pay that
 
05:49:55.468 --> 05:49:55.478 align:start position:0%
unions get when they um bargain for
 
05:49:58.070 --> 05:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
their contracts which is why union jobs
 
05:50:01.708 --> 05:50:01.718 align:start position:0%
are famously better jobs um and not only
 
05:50:04.830 --> 05:50:04.840 align:start position:0%
is that a small free writer fee minimal
 
05:50:07.150 --> 05:50:07.160 align:start position:0%
but none of it and I I've heard this in
 
05:50:08.468 --> 05:50:08.478 align:start position:0%
years past when we've dealt with right
 
05:50:11.590 --> 05:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
to work um that somehow those that that
 
05:50:14.310 --> 05:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
those dues or the free writer fees go to
 
05:50:17.548 --> 05:50:17.558 align:start position:0%
political purposes that is illegal um
 
05:50:20.110 --> 05:50:20.120 align:start position:0%
none of it goes to political purposes
 
05:50:22.750 --> 05:50:22.760 align:start position:0%
and also I heard from the prime sponsor
 
05:50:24.948 --> 05:50:24.958 align:start position:0%
I believe that states that had already
 
05:50:29.030 --> 05:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
passed um right to work had uh reduced
 
05:50:31.070 --> 05:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
uh unemployment I grew up in one of
 
05:50:33.150 --> 05:50:33.160 align:start position:0%
those States I grew up in Tennessee
 
05:50:36.150 --> 05:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
until I was 23 actually um I didn't even
 
05:50:39.948 --> 05:50:39.958 align:start position:0%
know what a a labor union was um and I
 
05:50:42.150 --> 05:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
can't speak to the unemployment side but
 
05:50:44.030 --> 05:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
I can speak to like maybe it would be
 
05:50:45.670 --> 05:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
lower unemployment because people are
 
05:50:48.270 --> 05:50:48.280 align:start position:0%
forced into working multiple jobs
 
05:50:50.468 --> 05:50:50.478 align:start position:0%
because the pay in those States is so
 
05:50:52.670 --> 05:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
atrocious if you look at the economy of
 
05:50:53.990 --> 05:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
Tennessee and compare it to New
 
05:50:55.590 --> 05:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I guarantee you you wouldn't
 
05:50:58.110 --> 05:50:58.120 align:start position:0%
change um their economic situation with
 
05:50:58.120 --> 05:50:59.070 align:start position:0%
change um their economic situation with
our

05:50:59.070 --> 05:50:59.080 align:start position:0%
our
 
05:51:01.190 --> 05:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
um it is a I grew up in a very
 
05:51:03.708 --> 05:51:03.718 align:start position:0%
economically depressed
 
05:51:07.150 --> 05:51:07.160 align:start position:0%
state so my particular story is when I
 
05:51:10.070 --> 05:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
got elected I decided to leave kind of
 
05:51:12.548 --> 05:51:12.558 align:start position:0%
the professional advocacy world and go
 
05:51:16.150 --> 05:51:16.160 align:start position:0%
back to CDL driving um and the place
 
05:51:18.230 --> 05:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
that I worked in addition to being the
 
05:51:21.948 --> 05:51:21.958 align:start position:0%
lowest paid um company in the entire
 
05:51:23.750 --> 05:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
State we got new management and the
 
05:51:25.948 --> 05:51:25.958 align:start position:0%
management was pretty severe started uh
 
05:51:28.030 --> 05:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
working us really crazy hours crazy
 
05:51:30.070 --> 05:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
split shifts taking away our ability to
 
05:51:31.590 --> 05:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
go to doctor's appointments and things
 
05:51:34.190 --> 05:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
like that so I decided to start
 
05:51:36.590 --> 05:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
unionizing and uh did you know
 
05:51:39.150 --> 05:51:39.160 align:start position:0%
management doesn't like it when you do
 
05:51:41.708 --> 05:51:41.718 align:start position:0%
that um very quickly when it was found
 
05:51:44.110 --> 05:51:44.120 align:start position:0%
out that I was unionizing um much
 
05:51:46.310 --> 05:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
against our discipline policy which
 
05:51:48.350 --> 05:51:48.360 align:start position:0%
required warnings and what have you I
 
05:51:50.430 --> 05:51:50.440 align:start position:0%
was immediately suspended for 5 days
 
05:51:53.548 --> 05:51:53.558 align:start position:0%
without pay for not tucking in my
 
05:51:55.708 --> 05:51:55.718 align:start position:0%
shirt um there were a few other
 
05:51:57.708 --> 05:51:57.718 align:start position:0%
incidents like that I kept getting kind
 
05:51:59.548 --> 05:51:59.558 align:start position:0%
of slapped down and then finally they
 
05:52:02.788 --> 05:52:02.798 align:start position:0%
put me on a fully paid administrative
 
05:52:04.788 --> 05:52:04.798 align:start position:0%
leave pending an investigation the
 
05:52:06.868 --> 05:52:06.878 align:start position:0%
charges for which I still to this day I
 
05:52:09.030 --> 05:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
don't know I was not working but
 
05:52:11.948 --> 05:52:11.958 align:start position:0%
receiving my full salary for a month
 
05:52:13.990 --> 05:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
before and there's here's where the free
 
05:52:17.590 --> 05:52:17.600 align:start position:0%
riter fee comes in uh the union lawyers
 
05:52:19.628 --> 05:52:19.638 align:start position:0%
sent a cease and desist letter to the
 
05:52:21.868 --> 05:52:21.878 align:start position:0%
employer they were there with me every
 
05:52:23.548 --> 05:52:23.558 align:start position:0%
time I met with the employer or the
 
05:52:25.948 --> 05:52:25.958 align:start position:0%
employer's lawyers they stood by my side
 
05:52:27.868 --> 05:52:27.878 align:start position:0%
and I hadn't even successfully gotten
 
05:52:29.070 --> 05:52:29.080 align:start position:0%
that year
 
05:52:31.830 --> 05:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
Union I can't name a single worker who
 
05:52:34.310 --> 05:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't appreciate having backup when
 
05:52:36.510 --> 05:52:36.520 align:start position:0%
you go against your employer who's
 
05:52:37.750 --> 05:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
treating you
 
05:52:40.110 --> 05:52:40.120 align:start position:0%
unfairly and that is what the free riter
 
05:52:42.708 --> 05:52:42.718 align:start position:0%
fee that is freely negotiated between
 
05:52:46.468 --> 05:52:46.478 align:start position:0%
two private uh entities pays for and has
 
05:52:48.350 --> 05:52:48.360 align:start position:0%
to pay for by
 
05:52:51.750 --> 05:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
law unions are democracy in the
 
05:52:55.150 --> 05:52:55.160 align:start position:0%
workplace without unions your workplace
 
05:52:57.548 --> 05:52:57.558 align:start position:0%
is an authoritarian regime the boss has
 
05:53:00.708 --> 05:53:00.718 align:start position:0%
all the control and workers have nothing
 
05:53:04.070 --> 05:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
unions are what allow employees to come
 
05:53:05.910 --> 05:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
together and negotiate together so that
 
05:53:08.670 --> 05:53:08.680 align:start position:0%
they can balance out that force of power
 
05:53:10.430 --> 05:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
if you believe in the decentralization
 
05:53:12.070 --> 05:53:12.080 align:start position:0%
of power if you are against
 
05:53:14.468 --> 05:53:14.478 align:start position:0%
authoritarianism then you should believe
 
05:53:14.478 --> 05:53:15.190 align:start position:0%
authoritarianism then you should believe
in

05:53:15.190 --> 05:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:53:17.990 --> 05:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
unions the idea that unions are a
 
05:53:20.868 --> 05:53:20.878 align:start position:0%
monopoly I find to be absurd first of
 
05:53:22.708 --> 05:53:22.718 align:start position:0%
all there is no one Union that's
 
05:53:26.070 --> 05:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
claiming all of the the labor market but
 
05:53:29.390 --> 05:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
it simply levels that playing field and
 
05:53:32.150 --> 05:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
what I I think that's why employers are
 
05:53:33.948 --> 05:53:33.958 align:start position:0%
mad about it is because it does level
 
05:53:36.510 --> 05:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
the playing field and they don't like it
 
05:53:38.830 --> 05:53:38.840 align:start position:0%
so with that um I don't think that I can
 
05:53:40.510 --> 05:53:40.520 align:start position:0%
answer any more questions if someone
 
05:53:41.948 --> 05:53:41.958 align:start position:0%
really has a burning question I'm happy
 
05:53:43.948 --> 05:53:43.958 align:start position:0%
to answer it but I just wanted to share
 
05:53:47.350 --> 05:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
my personal story thank you very much
 
05:53:51.830 --> 05:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
and uh I apologize for walking out
 
05:53:54.350 --> 05:53:54.360 align:start position:0%
um I don't know whether that went over
 
05:53:56.270 --> 05:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
three minutes but I'll again remind
 
05:53:59.468 --> 05:53:59.478 align:start position:0%
everybody to please uh limit your
 
05:54:02.708 --> 05:54:02.718 align:start position:0%
testimony and um please if you hear
 
05:54:05.788 --> 05:54:05.798 align:start position:0%
something that you were going to say um
 
05:54:08.310 --> 05:54:08.320 align:start position:0%
maybe you don't need to repeat it the
 
05:54:11.350 --> 05:54:11.360 align:start position:0%
reason this is on my mind is I uh had a
 
05:54:13.430 --> 05:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
conversation with the chairman and he
 
05:54:14.910 --> 05:54:14.920 align:start position:0%
got a call from
 
05:54:18.788 --> 05:54:18.798 align:start position:0%
security uh wondering about how long
 
05:54:21.990 --> 05:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to keep them over um at some
 
05:54:27.430 --> 05:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
point we may have to uh hold the hearing
 
05:54:30.628 --> 05:54:30.638 align:start position:0%
and put uh continue the hearing to
 
05:54:32.270 --> 05:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
another time that was the suggestion I
 
05:54:34.830 --> 05:54:34.840 align:start position:0%
got from a chair the chairman hopefully
 
05:54:37.070 --> 05:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
uh we won't need to do that it looks
 
05:54:38.750 --> 05:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
like the representative has somewhere to
 
05:54:42.070 --> 05:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
be so rather than go to questions I'll
 
05:54:44.548 --> 05:54:44.558 align:start position:0%
call up the next speaker which is Glenn
 
05:54:47.590 --> 05:54:47.600 align:start position:0%
bracket the president of the AFL
 
05:54:50.990 --> 05:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
CIO and following him will be Tyler Le
 
05:54:56.190 --> 05:54:56.200 align:start position:0%
plant and Janice Kell Kel I probably got
 
05:54:58.548 --> 05:54:58.558 align:start position:0%
that wrong and I apologize for names I
 
05:55:01.548 --> 05:55:01.558 align:start position:0%
got wrong earlier so with that
 
05:55:04.190 --> 05:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
uh please well thank you very much Mr
 
05:55:06.030 --> 05:55:06.040 align:start position:0%

05:55:08.548 --> 05:55:08.558 align:start position:0%

05:55:52.230 --> 05:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
on behalf of these New Hampshire workers
 
05:55:54.270 --> 05:55:54.280 align:start position:0%
to oppose House Bill
 
05:55:56.670 --> 05:55:56.680 align:start position:0%
1377 which is the house version of this
 
05:56:00.430 --> 05:56:00.440 align:start position:0%
session's fraud titled right to work now
 
05:56:02.270 --> 05:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
every new legislative session for the
 
05:56:04.510 --> 05:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
last 35 years has seen this attack on
 
05:56:07.430 --> 05:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
workers rights and every legislation
 
05:56:09.510 --> 05:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
every legislature regardless of which
 
05:56:12.628 --> 05:56:12.638 align:start position:0%
party is in the majority has rejected it
 
05:56:16.468 --> 05:56:16.478 align:start position:0%
in fact in 2021 in 2019 this house
 
05:56:19.150 --> 05:56:19.160 align:start position:0%
rejected this very same bill Governor
 
05:56:22.270 --> 05:56:22.280 align:start position:0%
sonunu himself declared that there is no
 
05:56:23.788 --> 05:56:23.798 align:start position:0%
need to pursue any additional
 
05:56:25.670 --> 05:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
legislation when it comes to right to
 
05:56:28.270 --> 05:56:28.280 align:start position:0%
work our elective leaders have
 
05:56:30.070 --> 05:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
repeatedly defeated this piece of
 
05:56:32.910 --> 05:56:32.920 align:start position:0%
legislation because they understand that
 
05:56:34.830 --> 05:56:34.840 align:start position:0%
the free market does not need any
 
05:56:37.350 --> 05:56:37.360 align:start position:0%
further government intrusion or
 
05:56:39.628 --> 05:56:39.638 align:start position:0%
regulatory burdens into the private
 
05:56:42.230 --> 05:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
business World a lot of State
 
05:56:44.468 --> 05:56:44.478 align:start position:0%
billionaires and DC lobbyists continue
 
05:56:46.468 --> 05:56:46.478 align:start position:0%
to enlist legislators to introduce
 
05:56:49.868 --> 05:56:49.878 align:start position:0%
identical bills year in and year out our
 
05:56:51.510 --> 05:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
elected representatives of both
 
05:56:53.750 --> 05:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
political parties have voted to defeat
 
05:56:57.150 --> 05:56:57.160 align:start position:0%
them that is because it's clear that New
 
05:56:59.270 --> 05:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's government should not meddle
 
05:57:01.788 --> 05:57:01.798 align:start position:0%
in how private businesses in this state
 
05:57:04.150 --> 05:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
do business with other parties for their
 
05:57:07.150 --> 05:57:07.160 align:start position:0%
Mutual benefit contracts between private
 
05:57:09.708 --> 05:57:09.718 align:start position:0%
employers and labor units are businesso
 
05:57:11.350 --> 05:57:11.360 align:start position:0%
business agreements that this
 
05:57:13.350 --> 05:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
legislature should leave to the free
 
05:57:15.830 --> 05:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
market supporters of Right to Work claim
 
05:57:17.990 --> 05:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
that it will hurt people from being
 
05:57:20.548 --> 05:57:20.558 align:start position:0%
forced into joining labor unions and
 
05:57:23.070 --> 05:57:23.080 align:start position:0%
this bill will advance freedom of
 
05:57:26.830 --> 05:57:26.840 align:start position:0%
Association in truth this is a non-issue
 
05:57:28.548 --> 05:57:28.558 align:start position:0%
since the passing of the the TA heartley
 
05:57:31.708 --> 05:57:31.718 align:start position:0%
act in 1947 it is illegal to force
 
05:57:34.510 --> 05:57:34.520 align:start position:0%
workers to become part of a union this
 
05:57:36.750 --> 05:57:36.760 align:start position:0%
Freedom of Choice already exists for New
 
05:57:39.190 --> 05:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire workers this bill will
 
05:57:41.548 --> 05:57:41.558 align:start position:0%
diminish Freedom it will diminish the
 
05:57:43.510 --> 05:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
American Spirit of free enterprise and
 
05:57:46.270 --> 05:57:46.280 align:start position:0%
contracts by allowing the state the
 
05:57:49.030 --> 05:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
government to interfere with businesso
 
05:57:51.350 --> 05:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
business exchanges through this
 
05:57:53.190 --> 05:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
government intervention the state would
 
05:57:55.750 --> 05:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
be creating a Free Rider by providing
 
05:57:58.390 --> 05:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
benefits to those who don't pay for them
 
05:58:00.190 --> 05:58:00.200 align:start position:0%
it diminishes the freedom of workers to
 
05:58:02.190 --> 05:58:02.200 align:start position:0%
join together in the workplace to help
 
05:58:04.788 --> 05:58:04.798 align:start position:0%
provide for their families it is
 
05:58:06.468 --> 05:58:06.478 align:start position:0%
difficult for me to think of another
 
05:58:08.390 --> 05:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
circumstance that the sponsors of this
 
05:58:10.070 --> 05:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
bill would agree with where the
 
05:58:11.868 --> 05:58:11.878 align:start position:0%
government would require a private
 
05:58:14.590 --> 05:58:14.600 align:start position:0%
business with a contract with another
 
05:58:17.990 --> 05:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
private business to provide free service
 
05:58:20.030 --> 05:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
to involve itself in negotiations
 
05:58:22.030 --> 05:58:22.040 align:start position:0%
between two private entities or to
 
05:58:23.628 --> 05:58:23.638 align:start position:0%

Hampshire and I'm a proud union worker
 
05:59:23.468 --> 05:59:23.478 align:start position:0%
I'm a part of the International Alliance
 
05:59:26.468 --> 05:59:26.478 align:start position:0%
of theatrical stage employees local 481
 
05:59:27.910 --> 05:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
which means I work on film and
 
05:59:30.030 --> 05:59:30.040 align:start position:0%
television projects in the New England
 
05:59:32.830 --> 05:59:32.840 align:start position:0%
area workers in my industry are highly
 
05:59:35.150 --> 05:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
skilled and professional individuals and
 
05:59:37.468 --> 05:59:37.478 align:start position:0%
that's thanks to the strength of our
 
05:59:41.750 --> 05:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
Union House Bill 1377 FN and Senate Bill
 
05:59:43.990 --> 05:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
516 FN I know we're not talking about
 
05:59:46.708 --> 05:59:46.718 align:start position:0%
that one seeks to St seeks to take the
 
05:59:48.430 --> 05:59:48.440 align:start position:0%
strength out of New Hampshire's workers
 
05:59:50.150 --> 05:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
hands and give that power back to
 
05:59:52.150 --> 05:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
outside big businesses who are only
 
05:59:55.590 --> 05:59:55.600 align:start position:0%
interested in higher profit margins now
 
05:59:57.548 --> 05:59:57.558 align:start position:0%
in order to make those higher profit Mar
 
05:59:59.590 --> 05:59:59.600 align:start position:0%
margins businesses unless the help of
 
06:00:02.628 --> 06:00:02.638 align:start position:0%
Republicans to dra to draft these quote
 
06:00:05.548 --> 06:00:05.558 align:start position:0%
Right to Work
 
06:00:08.708 --> 06:00:08.718 align:start position:0%
bills these bills are deceptively made
 
06:00:10.270 --> 06:00:10.280 align:start position:0%
out to seem as though they are in the
 
06:00:12.390 --> 06:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
interest of New Hampshire workers by
 
06:00:15.510 --> 06:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
giving legal bypasses to joining unions
 
06:00:17.750 --> 06:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
in reality these bills take away better
 
06:00:19.468 --> 06:00:19.478 align:start position:0%
health benefits better pay and
 
06:00:22.190 --> 06:00:22.200 align:start position:0%
negotiation rights apart from these
 
06:00:24.270 --> 06:00:24.280 align:start position:0%
pitfalls another major concern to this
 
06:00:26.468 --> 06:00:26.478 align:start position:0%
bill is the safety of the of the New
 
06:00:29.350 --> 06:00:29.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire worker unions provide free
 
06:00:31.548 --> 06:00:31.558 align:start position:0%
required trainings for members as well
 
06:00:34.830 --> 06:00:34.840 align:start position:0%
as higher safety standards across the
 
06:00:37.990 --> 06:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
board now let's say these bills pass I
 
06:00:39.628 --> 06:00:39.638 align:start position:0%
mean hopefully not but just for the sake
 
06:00:41.788 --> 06:00:41.798 align:start position:0%
of the argument let's say they do uh
 
06:00:43.990 --> 06:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
what do the workers get out of this I
 
06:00:45.350 --> 06:00:45.360 align:start position:0%
mean sure they won't have to join a
 
06:00:47.468 --> 06:00:47.478 align:start position:0%
union if they don't want to but they
 
06:00:49.230 --> 06:00:49.240 align:start position:0%
also wouldn't be making as much as their
 
06:00:51.750 --> 06:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
Union Brothers they wouldn't be having a
 
06:00:54.948 --> 06:00:54.958 align:start position:0%
pension or access to Affordable Health
 
06:00:58.070 --> 06:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
Care I think it's time that we refer to
 
06:01:00.390 --> 06:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
these so-called Right to Work bills as
 
06:01:04.310 --> 06:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
what they really are union busting scab
 
06:01:07.390 --> 06:01:07.400 align:start position:0%
work promoting garbage New Hampshire
 
06:01:09.230 --> 06:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
Republicans are not creating these bills
 
06:01:11.070 --> 06:01:11.080 align:start position:0%
in the interest of the people it's in
 
06:01:12.628 --> 06:01:12.638 align:start position:0%
the interest of the big companies and
 
06:01:15.110 --> 06:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
anti-labor lobbyists who line their
 
06:01:18.948 --> 06:01:18.958 align:start position:0%
pockets every election season unions
 
06:01:21.350 --> 06:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
make workers strong workers make New
 
06:01:22.948 --> 06:01:22.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire strong thank you and
 
06:01:22.958 --> 06:01:24.070 align:start position:0%
Hampshire strong thank you and
solidarity

06:01:24.070 --> 06:01:24.080 align:start position:0%

Goen and John
 
06:01:51.390 --> 06:01:51.400 align:start position:0%
drinkwater good afternoon my name is
 
06:01:53.390 --> 06:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
Janice Kelby and I appreciate the
 
06:01:55.948 --> 06:01:55.958 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify in opposition to
 
06:02:00.750 --> 06:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
HB 13 77 I'm a retired postal worker I
 
06:02:02.990 --> 06:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
joined the union immediately after I was
 
06:02:05.590 --> 06:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
hired and worked a midnight shift in a
 
06:02:08.070 --> 06:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
maale processing plant for the US Postal
 
06:02:11.150 --> 06:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
Service for 29 years I live in hookset
 
06:02:14.110 --> 06:02:14.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as a single parent when I
 
06:02:16.270 --> 06:02:16.280 align:start position:0%
was hired I knew that the benefits that
 
06:02:18.990 --> 06:02:19.000 align:start position:0%
made me want the job at the post office
 
06:02:21.230 --> 06:02:21.240 align:start position:0%
had been obtained through negotiations
 
06:02:23.788 --> 06:02:23.798 align:start position:0%
with the Union it's probably more
 
06:02:25.868 --> 06:02:25.878 align:start position:0%
evident with the Postal Service than it
 
06:02:28.070 --> 06:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
is in other workplaces
 
06:02:29.830 --> 06:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
because the Postal Service had a
 
06:02:33.070 --> 06:02:33.080 align:start position:0%
category of employees called casuals
 
06:02:35.708 --> 06:02:35.718 align:start position:0%
casuals were not necessarily short-term
 
06:02:38.110 --> 06:02:38.120 align:start position:0%
employees some had worked there for over
 
06:02:40.350 --> 06:02:40.360 align:start position:0%
10 years they were not a part of any
 
06:02:42.270 --> 06:02:42.280 align:start position:0%
bargaining unit and could not belong to
 
06:02:42.280 --> 06:02:43.548 align:start position:0%
bargaining unit and could not belong to
a

06:02:43.548 --> 06:02:43.558 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:02:46.230 --> 06:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
union this made the difference very
 
06:02:48.548 --> 06:02:48.558 align:start position:0%
obvious between what the Postal Service
 
06:02:50.628 --> 06:02:50.638 align:start position:0%
gave to employees out of the kindness of
 
06:02:53.190 --> 06:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
their heart and what was negotiated by
 
06:02:56.390 --> 06:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
the union it was crystal clear to me
 
06:02:58.350 --> 06:02:58.360 align:start position:0%
that the union was responsible for
 
06:03:02.110 --> 06:03:02.120 align:start position:0%
making the job a desirable one casual
 
06:03:04.430 --> 06:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
wages were far less than ours even
 
06:03:07.270 --> 06:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
though they often did identical work
 
06:03:09.430 --> 06:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
they got no sick leave no health
 
06:03:12.750 --> 06:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
benefits they earned minimal paid time
 
06:03:16.070 --> 06:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
off and no retirement benefits folks
 
06:03:18.190 --> 06:03:18.200 align:start position:0%
were not knocking down the doors for
 
06:03:20.910 --> 06:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
these casual positions but they were for
 
06:03:22.310 --> 06:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
the career
 
06:03:24.910 --> 06:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
positions um complete with the benefits
 
06:03:27.868 --> 06:03:27.878 align:start position:0%
negotiated by the union any worker who
 
06:03:29.548 --> 06:03:29.558 align:start position:0%
tells you they want nothing to do with
 
06:03:31.910 --> 06:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
the Union is not telling you the entire
 
06:03:34.548 --> 06:03:34.558 align:start position:0%
truth they do want the benefits that
 
06:03:36.788 --> 06:03:36.798 align:start position:0%
have been achieved by the union and
 
06:03:38.788 --> 06:03:38.798 align:start position:0%
those benefits do not just fall out of
 
06:03:42.910 --> 06:03:42.920 align:start position:0%
the sky sadly working in a USPS is like
 
06:03:44.990 --> 06:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
working in a right to work state in some
 
06:03:49.270 --> 06:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
ways people who choose not to join a
 
06:03:52.230 --> 06:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
union don't share the cost of
 
06:03:54.750 --> 06:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
representation most postal workers do
 
06:03:57.750 --> 06:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
join the union but not all having some
 
06:04:00.230 --> 06:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
people enjoy contract benefits without
 
06:04:03.310 --> 06:04:03.320 align:start position:0%
helping to pay for them causes Division
 
06:04:03.320 --> 06:04:04.548 align:start position:0%
helping to pay for them causes Division
and

06:04:04.548 --> 06:04:04.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:04:07.030 --> 06:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
resentment in the workplace and that
 
06:04:09.788 --> 06:04:09.798 align:start position:0%
division neither benefits the workers or
 
06:04:13.830 --> 06:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
the employer or productivity for that
 
06:04:15.948 --> 06:04:15.958 align:start position:0%
matter this paper doesn't want to
 
06:04:19.430 --> 06:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
cooperate with me the union is obligated
 
06:04:21.788 --> 06:04:21.798 align:start position:0%
by law to represent these non-members
 
06:04:23.990 --> 06:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
who pay nothing not even for their own
 
06:04:24.000 --> 06:04:25.110 align:start position:0%
who pay nothing not even for their own
personal

06:04:25.110 --> 06:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
personal
 
06:04:27.350 --> 06:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
representation I remember my local
 
06:04:29.868 --> 06:04:29.878 align:start position:0%
defending a non-member and arbitration
 
06:04:32.708 --> 06:04:32.718 align:start position:0%
18 years ago that cost was more than
 
06:04:36.230 --> 06:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
$1,500 for just one day of hearing our
 
06:04:39.390 --> 06:04:39.400 align:start position:0%
cost not his the bigger issue is the
 
06:04:42.190 --> 06:04:42.200 align:start position:0%
considerable resources that go into that
 
06:04:45.030 --> 06:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
are required to negotiate our contract I
 
06:04:47.670 --> 06:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
once was asked to testify at a national
 
06:04:51.510 --> 06:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
hearing that involved the pay wage for a
 
06:04:54.670 --> 06:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
specific job and I listen to the
 
06:04:58.270 --> 06:04:58.280 align:start position:0%
testimony from economics econom ists and
 
06:05:01.390 --> 06:05:01.400 align:start position:0%
a host of experts and as well as Rank
 
06:05:04.548 --> 06:05:04.558 align:start position:0%
and file workers listening to The
 
06:05:07.110 --> 06:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
Economist I wondered how many hours of
 
06:05:09.430 --> 06:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
research and preparation went into her
 
06:05:12.110 --> 06:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
testimony the union paid for that work
 
06:05:14.110 --> 06:05:14.120 align:start position:0%
without her testimony we would never
 
06:05:16.468 --> 06:05:16.478 align:start position:0%
have convinced the arbitrator to upgrade
 
06:05:19.670 --> 06:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
to pay for that job even the guy who
 
06:05:23.310 --> 06:05:23.320 align:start position:0%
chose not to pay his fair share real
 
06:05:25.670 --> 06:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
people have a real right to work right
 
06:05:27.830 --> 06:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
now in New Hampshire we have a right to
 
06:05:30.708 --> 06:05:30.718 align:start position:0%
choose to work in a union shop or to
 
06:05:34.110 --> 06:05:34.120 align:start position:0%
choose a non-union shop even in Union

workplaces not all Union workplaces have
 
06:05:39.750 --> 06:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
a fair share Clause employers have to
 
06:05:42.670 --> 06:05:42.680 align:start position:0%
agree if an employer negotiates fair
 
06:05:45.750 --> 06:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
share as a condition of employment the
 
06:05:47.590 --> 06:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
state has no business
 
06:05:50.150 --> 06:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
interfering just as it has no business
 
06:05:52.830 --> 06:05:52.840 align:start position:0%
interfering with a dress code policy if
 
06:05:54.990 --> 06:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
a person doesn't like a company's fair
 
06:05:58.030 --> 06:05:58.040 align:start position:0%
share policy employment policy or
 
06:05:59.948 --> 06:05:59.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't like a dress code there are
 
06:06:01.708 --> 06:06:01.718 align:start position:0%
other places they can
 
06:06:04.190 --> 06:06:04.200 align:start position:0%
work and of course they are free to talk
 
06:06:06.948 --> 06:06:06.958 align:start position:0%
to their co-workers as well and if they
 
06:06:09.750 --> 06:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
can convince them that it's a bad
 
06:06:11.788 --> 06:06:11.798 align:start position:0%
condition at their workplace they can
 
06:06:14.948 --> 06:06:14.958 align:start position:0%
negotiate it out in the next contract my
 
06:06:16.868 --> 06:06:16.878 align:start position:0%
union struggles to meet the financial
 
06:06:20.070 --> 06:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
burden caused by those who refuse to pay
 
06:06:22.270 --> 06:06:22.280 align:start position:0%
their fair share if enough people
 
06:06:24.628 --> 06:06:24.638 align:start position:0%
decided not to do their part then the
 
06:06:26.590 --> 06:06:26.600 align:start position:0%
union would be seriously weakened which
 
06:06:29.390 --> 06:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
is the whole purpose of this law
 
06:06:31.628 --> 06:06:31.638 align:start position:0%
lessening our ability to negotiate
 
06:06:33.510 --> 06:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
decent wages and benefits it would have
 
06:06:35.708 --> 06:06:35.718 align:start position:0%
a negative impact on our state without
 
06:06:38.270 --> 06:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
benefits negotiated by my union I
 
06:06:39.948 --> 06:06:39.958 align:start position:0%
couldn't afford a house and I couldn't
 
06:06:43.468 --> 06:06:43.478 align:start position:0%
afford to support local New Hampshire
 
06:06:46.390 --> 06:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
businesses as I do now safety in the
 
06:06:49.190 --> 06:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
workplace would also be very negatively
 
06:06:51.750 --> 06:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
impacted it was the union that waged a
 
06:06:54.190 --> 06:06:54.200 align:start position:0%
major safety campaign literally saving
 
06:06:56.628 --> 06:06:56.638 align:start position:0%
the lives of postal workers I remember
 
06:06:59.110 --> 06:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
well the death of New York postal worker
 
06:07:01.548 --> 06:07:01.558 align:start position:0%
Michael mcder who was pulled into a
 
06:07:03.948 --> 06:07:03.958 align:start position:0%
conveyor belt and lost his life I'm
 
06:07:06.030 --> 06:07:06.040 align:start position:0%
forever grateful for the resources that
 
06:07:08.990 --> 06:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
our Union was able to put into waging
 
06:07:13.310 --> 06:07:13.320 align:start position:0%
the battle to increase the worker safety
 
06:07:15.270 --> 06:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
and all who benefit should share in the
 
06:07:16.830 --> 06:07:16.840 align:start position:0%
cost HP
 
06:07:19.708 --> 06:07:19.718 align:start position:0%
1377 does nothing to expand anyone's
 
06:07:21.948 --> 06:07:21.958 align:start position:0%
right to work it serves only to weaken
 
06:07:24.468 --> 06:07:24.478 align:start position:0%
unions lower our standard of living and
 
06:07:26.670 --> 06:07:26.680 align:start position:0%
hurt New Hampshire's economy the state
 
06:07:28.430 --> 06:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
should did not interfere with collective
 
06:07:30.628 --> 06:07:30.638 align:start position:0%
bargaining and with the employer's
 
06:07:32.708 --> 06:07:32.718 align:start position:0%
decision to negotiate an employment
 
06:07:35.190 --> 06:07:35.200 align:start position:0%
policy that requires workers to pay
 
06:07:37.750 --> 06:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
their fair share for services that they
 
06:07:41.230 --> 06:07:41.240 align:start position:0%
enjoy I ask that you vote inexpedient to

when it comes to Labor Relations most

06:09:23.990 --> 06:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
we are only able to accomplish this as

Union employers through our partnership

construction projects our partnership
 
06:09:55.628 --> 06:09:55.638 align:start position:0%
with the ibw also allows us to eliminate
 
06:09:58.670 --> 06:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
callbacks it limits change
 
06:10:01.868 --> 06:10:01.878 align:start position:0%
orders which helps avoid emergencies
 
06:10:03.948 --> 06:10:03.958 align:start position:0%
that can bust budgets or incidents that
 
06:10:06.990 --> 06:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
turn into legal issues when a contractor

calls the hiring Hall the ibw they know

contractors that are voluntarily Union
 
06:10:26.948 --> 06:10:26.958 align:start position:0%
contractors attract electricians and
 
06:10:29.750 --> 06:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
technicians from outside the Union as
 
06:10:31.868 --> 06:10:31.878 align:start position:0%

06:10:40.548 --> 06:10:40.558 align:start position:0%
model we do all this and we can do this
 
06:10:42.628 --> 06:10:42.638 align:start position:0%
work because of the agreements that we
 
06:10:44.948 --> 06:10:44.958 align:start position:0%
have made privately in the private

receive the highly trained and skilled
 
06:11:05.270 --> 06:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
Workforce that meet these requirements

and obligations on projects once again
 
06:11:10.750 --> 06:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
zero cost to the public this is a
 
06:11:12.510 --> 06:11:12.520 align:start position:0%
business model much like some of the
 
06:11:15.990 --> 06:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
other organizations the apples Walmart
 
06:11:18.110 --> 06:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
those are business models this has been
 
06:11:20.628 --> 06:11:20.638 align:start position:0%
our business model for decades and we do
 
06:11:22.150 --> 06:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
not need the government to interfere
 
06:11:23.990 --> 06:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
with the contracts and the agreements

essential not only to our continued

small business owners we also represent

the large business owners that probably
 
06:11:51.628 --> 06:11:51.638 align:start position:0%
work throughout all these states that I
 
06:11:55.230 --> 06:11:55.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned above all of these businesses
 
06:11:57.390 --> 06:11:57.400 align:start position:0%
think that the right to work is bad for

drink Squad I'm the director of
 
06:13:00.830 --> 06:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
government Affairs for iupat DC35 I
 
06:13:02.510 --> 06:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to testify
 
06:13:04.548 --> 06:13:04.558 align:start position:0%
today and I want to say from our
 
06:13:06.110 --> 06:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
perspective we're we're a union that
 
06:13:08.708 --> 06:13:08.718 align:start position:0%
represents over 4,000 workers in the
 
06:13:11.310 --> 06:13:11.320 align:start position:0%
finishing trades in Massachusetts New
 
06:13:13.788 --> 06:13:13.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Main and Vermont and uh along
 
06:13:15.270 --> 06:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
with representing workers in the
 
06:13:16.830 --> 06:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
construction trades we also represent
 
06:13:19.670 --> 06:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
public sector workers so we understand
 
06:13:23.270 --> 06:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
um to what it's like um in a right to
 
06:13:25.190 --> 06:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
work environment in the public sector
 
06:13:27.310 --> 06:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
since the Janice rule ruling now I'm
 
06:13:30.590 --> 06:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
happy to say that 100% of our workers in
 
06:13:33.150 --> 06:13:33.160 align:start position:0%
the public sector have chosen to join
 
06:13:36.990 --> 06:13:37.000 align:start position:0%
our Union because they recognize that we
 
06:13:38.390 --> 06:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
represent them and we provide a pretty
 
06:13:39.310 --> 06:13:39.320 align:start position:0%
good deal when it comes to
 
06:13:41.390 --> 06:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
representation and I do find it
 
06:13:44.030 --> 06:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
interesting when it comes to regulating
 
06:13:46.628 --> 06:13:46.638 align:start position:0%
employer um employee and labor union
 
06:13:49.590 --> 06:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
relationships that our duty the duty
 
06:13:51.708 --> 06:13:51.718 align:start position:0%
that we have to represent each and every
 
06:13:53.350 --> 06:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
worker under our Collective bargain
 
06:13:55.468 --> 06:13:55.478 align:start position:0%
agreements whether or not they choice to
 
06:13:57.990 --> 06:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
Jo CH choose to join our Union is not
 
06:14:01.110 --> 06:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
something that is often regulated it's
 
06:14:04.430 --> 06:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
the financial agreement between unions
 
06:14:06.628 --> 06:14:06.638 align:start position:0%
and employers that are privately
 
06:14:09.150 --> 06:14:09.160 align:start position:0%
negotiated and part of a a contract that
 
06:14:11.708 --> 06:14:11.718 align:start position:0%
tends to be the thing that's regulated
 
06:14:13.190 --> 06:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
and I think that's because most would
 
06:14:15.468 --> 06:14:15.478 align:start position:0%
recognize that workers get a pretty good
 
06:14:17.788 --> 06:14:17.798 align:start position:0%
deal when they're covered by a Union
 
06:14:19.350 --> 06:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
contract and the representation that
 
06:14:21.548 --> 06:14:21.558 align:start position:0%
they receive if they file a meritorious
 
06:14:23.990 --> 06:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
grievance their Union is obligated to
 
06:14:26.270 --> 06:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
pursue that on their behalf and and we
 
06:14:28.150 --> 06:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
we think that's a good thing we want to
 
06:14:29.750 --> 06:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
represent each and every worker that
 
06:14:31.628 --> 06:14:31.638 align:start position:0%
falls under our contract but it's also
 
06:14:35.708 --> 06:14:35.718 align:start position:0%
Fair uh that that those workers um pay
 
06:14:37.948 --> 06:14:37.958 align:start position:0%
uh for the cost of their representation
 
06:14:40.310 --> 06:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
that's provided by the union and that's
 
06:14:43.030 --> 06:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
why uh we understand Right to Work bills
 
06:14:45.270 --> 06:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
to be something that are just to attack
 
06:14:47.070 --> 06:14:47.080 align:start position:0%
Union finances and make it difficult to
 
06:14:50.548 --> 06:14:50.558 align:start position:0%
do what we do now when unions can worry
 
06:14:52.830 --> 06:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
about more than just trying to collect
 
06:14:54.190 --> 06:14:54.200 align:start position:0%
enough fees to provide the
 
06:14:56.350 --> 06:14:56.360 align:start position:0%
representation that we're obligated to
 
06:14:58.590 --> 06:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
we can go out and do things like
 
06:15:00.750 --> 06:15:00.760 align:start position:0%
organized we can go out and talk to
 
06:15:03.708 --> 06:15:03.718 align:start position:0%
members of the community about the value
 
06:15:05.990 --> 06:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
of what a union apprenticeship provides
 
06:15:08.070 --> 06:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
and that's what members of our staff do
 
06:15:10.150 --> 06:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
we provide training and career
 
06:15:12.350 --> 06:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
opportunities and we try to extend those
 
06:15:14.510 --> 06:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
to those who may not have uh a foot in
 
06:15:16.948 --> 06:15:16.958 align:start position:0%
the door to unions and when we can think
 
06:15:19.510 --> 06:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
about more than just surviving and
 
06:15:21.310 --> 06:15:21.320 align:start position:0%
collecting enough fees to do what it is
 
06:15:23.948 --> 06:15:23.958 align:start position:0%
that we have to do we can go out there
 
06:15:25.430 --> 06:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
and reach out to the community to
 
06:15:27.310 --> 06:15:27.320 align:start position:0%
Residents in new Hamp ampire and talk
 
06:15:30.150 --> 06:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
about the great value and the great
 
06:15:32.510 --> 06:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
opportunities that a union career can
 
06:15:34.468 --> 06:15:34.478 align:start position:0%
provide and we just simply ask that we
 
06:15:36.270 --> 06:15:36.280 align:start position:0%
can continue doing that for the
 
06:15:38.590 --> 06:15:38.600 align:start position:0%

with organized labor for 23 years being
 
06:16:05.990 --> 06:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
part of a union and always knowing that
 
06:16:07.990 --> 06:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
a union has my back and Bargains on my
 
06:16:09.390 --> 06:16:09.400 align:start position:0%
behalf for all the great wages and

06:16:19.350 --> 06:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
worker already has the right to either
 
06:16:20.948 --> 06:16:20.958 align:start position:0%
join a union or not the New Hampshire
 
06:16:23.310 --> 06:16:23.320 align:start position:0%
motto is Live Free or Die being in a
 
06:16:25.070 --> 06:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
union and paying union dues for the
 
06:16:27.270 --> 06:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
union to collectively bargain on your
 
06:16:29.270 --> 06:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
behalf it's no different than any other
 
06:16:30.750 --> 06:16:30.760 align:start position:0%
membership fee you would have to pay at
 
06:16:34.670 --> 06:16:34.680 align:start position:0%

we are often running right to work
 
06:16:48.190 --> 06:16:48.200 align:start position:0%
actually has nothing to do with work of
 
06:16:49.830 --> 06:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
freedom and everything with to do with
 
06:16:51.670 --> 06:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
breaking organized labor and
 
06:16:53.230 --> 06:16:53.240 align:start position:0%
strengthening corporate control of a
 
06:16:55.510 --> 06:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
politics workers have very little
 
06:16:56.990 --> 06:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
bargaining power in the United States
 
06:16:59.590 --> 06:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
and in most developed countries workers
 
06:17:02.468 --> 06:17:02.478 align:start position:0%
have more say and uh better working
 
06:17:04.310 --> 06:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
conditions in America unless you're in a
 
06:17:06.270 --> 06:17:06.280 align:start position:0%
union workplace Dynamic gives all the
 
06:17:08.708 --> 06:17:08.718 align:start position:0%
power to the owner if businesses and
 
06:17:09.910 --> 06:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
interests are not checked by the
 
06:17:11.548 --> 06:17:11.558 align:start position:0%
bargaining power of labor unions and
 
06:17:13.868 --> 06:17:13.878 align:start position:0%
other worker groups then we will quickly
 
06:17:16.310 --> 06:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
become a developing country the safest
 
06:17:18.548 --> 06:17:18.558 align:start position:0%
most trained and skilled labor is that
 
06:17:20.390 --> 06:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
of union labor we fight every day not
 
06:17:22.468 --> 06:17:22.478 align:start position:0%
just for union labor but for labor in
 
06:17:24.030 --> 06:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
general this so-called Right to Work
 
06:17:26.310 --> 06:17:26.320 align:start position:0%
bill is nothing as it reads is a right
 
06:17:28.030 --> 06:17:28.040 align:start position:0%
to work for Less study shows that
 
06:17:29.948 --> 06:17:29.958 align:start position:0%
workers in right to work states make
 
06:17:32.868 --> 06:17:32.878 align:start position:0%
$10,000 less a year while the CEOs get
 
06:17:34.788 --> 06:17:34.798 align:start position:0%
320 times richer off the back of the
 
06:17:37.948 --> 06:17:37.958 align:start position:0%
workers unions make up unions make up 7%
 
06:17:39.510 --> 06:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
of the workforce in this country in the
 
06:17:42.350 --> 06:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
construction field 4% this country was
 
06:17:44.030 --> 06:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
built on union labor it's because of
 
06:17:45.788 --> 06:17:45.798 align:start position:0%
organized labor and the right to
 
06:17:47.390 --> 06:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
collectively bargain is why we have
 
06:17:49.948 --> 06:17:49.958 align:start position:0%
eight hour work days 5day work weeks and
 
06:17:52.750 --> 06:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
40 hour work week six leave Etc this is
 
06:17:54.868 --> 06:17:54.878 align:start position:0%
why we have the safest workers in work
 
06:17:56.830 --> 06:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
sites going today and this is all
 
06:17:56.840 --> 06:17:57.830 align:start position:0%
sites going today and this is all
factual

06:17:57.830 --> 06:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
factual
 
06:17:59.948 --> 06:17:59.958 align:start position:0%
information working people in right to
 
06:18:01.510 --> 06:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
work states have consistently lower
 
06:18:03.230 --> 06:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
quality of life when compared to right
 
06:18:06.190 --> 06:18:06.200 align:start position:0%
to work states to free bargaining States
 
06:18:08.190 --> 06:18:08.200 align:start position:0%
and the differences are not comparable
 
06:18:09.788 --> 06:18:09.798 align:start position:0%
they have less access to health care and
 
06:18:12.230 --> 06:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
poor education systems for children the
 
06:18:13.868 --> 06:18:13.878 align:start position:0%
poverty rate is higher and the risk of
 
06:18:16.990 --> 06:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
workplace fatalities is 49% higher when
 
06:18:18.830 --> 06:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
working people can't freely speak up
 
06:18:20.910 --> 06:18:20.920 align:start position:0%
together they can't negotiate for higher
 
06:18:23.030 --> 06:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
safety standards better training Fair
 
06:18:25.070 --> 06:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
wages and health benefits and this will
 
06:18:27.868 --> 06:18:27.878 align:start position:0%
all and that will impact all of us Union
 
06:18:30.150 --> 06:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
and non-union alike right to work will
 
06:18:32.150 --> 06:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
lower wages cause higher workplace
 
06:18:34.230 --> 06:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
injuries and increase poverty will this
 
06:18:36.350 --> 06:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
make our state more attractive I don't
 
06:18:38.590 --> 06:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
think so I urge you to vote no on House
 
06:18:38.600 --> 06:18:39.548 align:start position:0%
think so I urge you to vote no on House

06:18:59.150 --> 06:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
turn on your
 
06:19:02.390 --> 06:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
microphone the the uh trades model is
 
06:19:05.590 --> 06:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
somewhat different than it than the
 
06:19:09.510 --> 06:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
others uh other workplaces might be so a
 
06:19:12.310 --> 06:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
member comes in to the painters comes
 
06:19:15.628 --> 06:19:15.638 align:start position:0%
into the uh uh the the plumbers and pipe
 
06:19:20.750 --> 06:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
fitters um they become a union member um
 
06:19:22.548 --> 06:19:22.558 align:start position:0%
right off the bat
 
06:19:27.628 --> 06:19:27.638 align:start position:0%
so is there any time that um that those
 
06:19:31.708 --> 06:19:31.718 align:start position:0%
workers um are not Union or how do you
 
06:19:33.350 --> 06:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
handle when somebody does not want to be
 
06:19:35.350 --> 06:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
in the Union in the Building Trades and
 
06:19:37.390 --> 06:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
I ask you this because this has come up
 
06:19:39.468 --> 06:19:39.478 align:start position:0%
in the discussions here
 
06:19:42.190 --> 06:19:42.200 align:start position:0%
before you understand my understand the
 
06:19:45.430 --> 06:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
question I do and the the building TRS a
 
06:19:47.350 --> 06:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
little different So within within our
 
06:19:51.590 --> 06:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction that we cover with DC 35 um
 
06:19:54.070 --> 06:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
we don't um operate in a right to work
 
06:19:57.350 --> 06:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
environment in in the private sector um
 
06:19:59.628 --> 06:19:59.638 align:start position:0%
so the agreements that do we have with
 
06:20:02.788 --> 06:20:02.798 align:start position:0%
our signatory contractors do include uh
 
06:20:06.510 --> 06:20:06.520 align:start position:0%
Union security Clauses uh where those um
 
06:20:08.150 --> 06:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
you know either dues or fees are are
 
06:20:11.230 --> 06:20:11.240 align:start position:0%
collected uh from from our members as as
 
06:20:14.230 --> 06:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
part of the agreement between
 
06:20:18.510 --> 06:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
DC35 and signatory contractors um where
 
06:20:21.990 --> 06:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
we we do operate as I had mentioned uh
 
06:20:23.830 --> 06:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
in in my remarks in in a right to work
 
06:20:27.030 --> 06:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
environment is in the public sector uh
 
06:20:28.270 --> 06:20:28.280 align:start position:0%
in in each of the states that we
 
06:20:30.708 --> 06:20:30.718 align:start position:0%
represent so we do understand how that
 
06:20:32.430 --> 06:20:32.440 align:start position:0%
works differently um in the different
 
06:20:33.868 --> 06:20:33.878 align:start position:0%
sectors that we represent and that's
 
06:20:35.788 --> 06:20:35.798 align:start position:0%
been been a fairly new thing for us as a
 
06:20:37.868 --> 06:20:37.878 align:start position:0%
result of the the jna Supreme Court case
 
06:20:41.150 --> 06:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
so how how that is operated um generally
 
06:20:43.230 --> 06:20:43.240 align:start position:0%
in the public sector our employees come
 
06:20:45.430 --> 06:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
to us through their public sector
 
06:20:47.948 --> 06:20:47.958 align:start position:0%
employer rather than through a training
 
06:20:50.430 --> 06:20:50.440 align:start position:0%
program or through a signatory employer
 
06:20:52.070 --> 06:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
um and in that case we we've operated
 
06:20:53.350 --> 06:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
just like the rest of the public sector
 
06:20:56.070 --> 06:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
and we've had to to educate uh members
 
06:20:58.910 --> 06:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
of our own Union on the The Importance
 
06:21:00.430 --> 06:21:00.440 align:start position:0%
uh that provides and essentially every
 
06:21:02.430 --> 06:21:02.440 align:start position:0%
single one of those members has had to
 
06:21:05.468 --> 06:21:05.478 align:start position:0%
um be signed again um signed for a
 
06:21:06.830 --> 06:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
second time as a member of the Union
 
06:21:08.110 --> 06:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
we've had a lot of great success in
 
06:21:09.868 --> 06:21:09.878 align:start position:0%
doing that but the trades are a little
 
06:21:11.670 --> 06:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
bit different and that many people come
 
06:21:14.510 --> 06:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
to us uh with an application in hand uh
 
06:21:16.430 --> 06:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
for the the training that we provide
 
06:21:19.150 --> 06:21:19.160 align:start position:0%
jointly with our employers um so when
 
06:21:20.670 --> 06:21:20.680 align:start position:0%
when we get those applications people
 
06:21:22.948 --> 06:21:22.958 align:start position:0%
are approaching us desperately want
 
06:21:25.350 --> 06:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
wanting to be a member uh of the Union
 
06:21:27.110 --> 06:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
because not just for the representation
 
06:21:30.750 --> 06:21:30.760 align:start position:0%
that we provide but for the the skills
 
06:21:32.190 --> 06:21:32.200 align:start position:0%
uh that they get through in
 
06:21:34.190 --> 06:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship program so the model is a
 
06:21:35.910 --> 06:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
little bit different in that people see
 
06:21:37.750 --> 06:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
the value that that they're getting
 
06:21:40.030 --> 06:21:40.040 align:start position:0%
before they ever walk onto a job site or
 
06:21:42.030 --> 06:21:42.040 align:start position:0%
into a training center great thank you
 
06:21:43.390 --> 06:21:43.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question represent be
 
06:21:46.468 --> 06:21:46.478 align:start position:0%
proud of Youk you any further
 
06:21:49.590 --> 06:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you um next up
 
06:21:52.110 --> 06:21:52.120 align:start position:0%
I would call Lisa Shapiro uh
 
06:21:56.590 --> 06:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
representing New Hampshire AFL CIO and
 
06:22:01.750 --> 06:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
following her Greg Moore and John buo oh
 
06:22:08.270 --> 06:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:11.390 --> 06:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
sorry oh thank you uh good afternoon Mr
 
06:22:12.948 --> 06:22:12.958 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee my
 
06:22:15.430 --> 06:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
name is Dr Lisa shapy I'm Chief
 
06:22:17.510 --> 06:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
Economist at Gallagher Calahan gartell
 
06:22:19.910 --> 06:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
and conquered New Hampshire and I'm here
 
06:22:22.868 --> 06:22:22.878 align:start position:0%
today on behalf of the AFL CIO in
 
06:22:26.830 --> 06:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
opposition to HB 1377
 
06:22:28.788 --> 06:22:28.798 align:start position:0%
from an economic perspective you'll hear
 
06:22:31.430 --> 06:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
from right to work Advocates asserting
 
06:22:34.150 --> 06:22:34.160 align:start position:0%
that right to work states outperform
 
06:22:36.390 --> 06:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
non-right to work states and it would
 
06:22:38.190 --> 06:22:38.200 align:start position:0%
therefore be beneficial to the New
 
06:22:40.468 --> 06:22:40.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire economy if Right to Work were
 
06:22:43.468 --> 06:22:43.478 align:start position:0%
passed and further the passing right to
 
06:22:47.150 --> 06:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
work enhances economic freedom these
 
06:22:49.750 --> 06:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
arguments should be rejected on several
 
06:22:53.310 --> 06:22:53.320 align:start position:0%
grounds first the best science the
 
06:22:55.750 --> 06:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
articles that are published in peer
 
06:22:59.390 --> 06:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
reviewed journals not just public policy
 
06:23:03.510 --> 06:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
shops attached and working for Advocates
 
06:23:06.310 --> 06:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
find in these published studies that
 
06:23:09.788 --> 06:23:09.798 align:start position:0%
right to work states end up with lower
 
06:23:12.788 --> 06:23:12.798 align:start position:0%
wage growth for example a
 
06:23:15.468 --> 06:23:15.478 align:start position:0%
2019 article in the Journal of financial
 
06:23:19.230 --> 06:23:19.240 align:start position:0%
economics reviewed nearly 20,000
 
06:23:21.670 --> 06:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreements over a
 
06:23:24.948 --> 06:23:24.958 align:start position:0%
period of time in States before they
 
06:23:27.590 --> 06:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
pass right to work after they pass right
 
06:23:30.310 --> 06:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
to work and found that in those right to
 
06:23:32.830 --> 06:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
work states there was a decrease in
 
06:23:35.788 --> 06:23:35.798 align:start position:0%
workers wage growth and an increase in
 
06:23:38.510 --> 06:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
executive compensation in
 
06:23:42.468 --> 06:23:42.478 align:start position:0%
2023 Federal Reserve researchers closely
 
06:23:46.110 --> 06:23:46.120 align:start position:0%
analyze wages in six states that adopted
 
06:23:48.750 --> 06:23:48.760 align:start position:0%
right to work over the last 20 years in
 
06:23:51.510 --> 06:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
particular Oklahoma Indiana Michigan
 
06:23:54.590 --> 06:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
Wisconsin West Virginia and Kentucky and
 
06:23:56.670 --> 06:23:56.680 align:start position:0%
they can be compared the conditions
 
06:23:59.830 --> 06:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
before and after passing right to work
 
06:24:02.548 --> 06:24:02.558 align:start position:0%
and with States that had not adopted
 
06:24:05.350 --> 06:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
right to work and in response to
 
06:24:09.230 --> 06:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
adoption of these laws here in this case
 
06:24:11.590 --> 06:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
they did find a slight uptick in
 
06:24:14.030 --> 06:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
employment you'd expect that there are
 
06:24:17.310 --> 06:24:17.320 align:start position:0%
some businesses that want to work and be
 
06:24:20.390 --> 06:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
located where there is less Union
 
06:24:22.750 --> 06:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
involvement however while this was very
 
06:24:27.628 --> 06:24:27.638 align:start position:0%
small they did find an actual ual annual
 
06:24:31.030 --> 06:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh reduction in real wages of
 
06:24:34.548 --> 06:24:34.558 align:start position:0%
$1900 so after right to work was in real
 
06:24:38.190 --> 06:24:38.200 align:start position:0%
wages went down while some right to work
 
06:24:40.910 --> 06:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
states clearly are doing well simply
 
06:24:44.590 --> 06:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
comparing right to work states with free
 
06:24:47.390 --> 06:24:47.400 align:start position:0%
bargaining States across a range of
 
06:24:51.030 --> 06:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
metrics doesn't tell us whether right to
 
06:24:53.670 --> 06:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
work is economically beneficial there
 
06:24:56.430 --> 06:24:56.440 align:start position:0%
are competing explanations for why any
 
06:25:00.030 --> 06:25:00.040 align:start position:0%
individual State performs well factors
 
06:25:03.030 --> 06:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
including electric rates which is a big
 
06:25:06.150 --> 06:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
dri in manufacturing location business
 
06:25:08.628 --> 06:25:08.638 align:start position:0%
taxes business incentives and a
 
06:25:11.830 --> 06:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
regulatory climate may have a stronger
 
06:25:14.190 --> 06:25:14.200 align:start position:0%
effect on economic performance than
 
06:25:17.310 --> 06:25:17.320 align:start position:0%
right to work laws studies that claim
 
06:25:20.110 --> 06:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
that right to work helps economic growth
 
06:25:23.270 --> 06:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
tend to be selective in their analysis
 
06:25:25.270 --> 06:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
of which states or counties to incl
 
06:25:29.110 --> 06:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
include what time period what metric how
 
06:25:31.310 --> 06:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
to model it and whether other
 
06:25:34.510 --> 06:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
explanatory factors are even considered
 
06:25:37.830 --> 06:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
and what approach they use to doing this
 
06:25:40.468 --> 06:25:40.478 align:start position:0%
have not been uh held up in the
 
06:25:40.478 --> 06:25:42.030 align:start position:0%
have not been uh held up in the
peer-reviewed

06:25:42.030 --> 06:25:42.040 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed
 
06:25:44.948 --> 06:25:44.958 align:start position:0%
literature third as a matter of
 
06:25:48.150 --> 06:25:48.160 align:start position:0%
principle right to work is government
 
06:25:51.430 --> 06:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
intervention in private contracts we
 
06:25:54.190 --> 06:25:54.200 align:start position:0%
just heard about that directly which
 
06:25:57.990 --> 06:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
reduces economic freedom Milton Freedman
 
06:26:00.510 --> 06:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
a well-known Economist who advocated for
 
06:26:03.310 --> 06:26:03.320 align:start position:0%
free market capitalism and other
 
06:26:05.670 --> 06:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
prominent libertarian thinkers although
 
06:26:09.468 --> 06:26:09.478 align:start position:0%
in the minority have been consistently
 
06:26:13.430 --> 06:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
against right to work laws why because
 
06:26:16.430 --> 06:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
right to work laws limit and restrict
 
06:26:19.070 --> 06:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
workers and employers freedom of
 
06:26:21.868 --> 06:26:21.878 align:start position:0%
contract they substitute the decision of
 
06:26:24.270 --> 06:26:24.280 align:start position:0%
politicians for the players in the
 
06:26:24.280 --> 06:26:25.708 align:start position:0%
politicians for the players in the
marketplace

06:26:25.708 --> 06:26:25.718 align:start position:0%
marketplace
 
06:26:28.708 --> 06:26:28.718 align:start position:0%
now while the KO Institute out of
 
06:26:32.190 --> 06:26:32.200 align:start position:0%
Washington advocates for right to work
 
06:26:35.430 --> 06:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
laws in for New Hampshire recently came
 
06:26:37.628 --> 06:26:37.638 align:start position:0%
out as number one in Freedom you may
 
06:26:39.628 --> 06:26:39.638 align:start position:0%
have heard that it was touted by many in
 
06:26:42.548 --> 06:26:42.558 align:start position:0%
the state so you look into that report
 
06:26:44.510 --> 06:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
and right to work is an aspect they
 
06:26:46.868 --> 06:26:46.878 align:start position:0%
think that's a good thing but somehow we
 
06:26:48.670 --> 06:26:48.680 align:start position:0%
still managed to come out as number one
 
06:26:48.680 --> 06:26:49.868 align:start position:0%

Freedom furthermore in the report it
 
06:26:56.670 --> 06:26:56.680 align:start position:0%
admits quote right to work laws are
 
06:26:59.990 --> 06:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
controversial among Libertarians and in
 
06:27:03.070 --> 06:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
fact it provides an alternative Freedom
 
06:27:06.030 --> 06:27:06.040 align:start position:0%
index in the back of the report which
 
06:27:08.750 --> 06:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
excludes right to work laws for those
 
06:27:11.230 --> 06:27:11.240 align:start position:0%
Libertarians that don't agree with right
 
06:27:14.310 --> 06:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
to work laws as being a measure of
 
06:27:17.030 --> 06:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
Freedom finally economic growth and
 
06:27:19.230 --> 06:27:19.240 align:start position:0%
well-being currently New Hampshire's
 
06:27:21.948 --> 06:27:21.958 align:start position:0%
economy generally ranks well compared to
 
06:27:24.670 --> 06:27:24.680 align:start position:0%
other states across a range of economic
 
06:27:27.150 --> 06:27:27.160 align:start position:0%
metrics including lower unemployment
 
06:27:30.270 --> 06:27:30.280 align:start position:0%
rates lower poverty rates higher median
 
06:27:33.270 --> 06:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
wages New Hampshire's economic headwinds
 
06:27:36.670 --> 06:27:36.680 align:start position:0%
for growth probably revolve more around
 
06:27:38.708 --> 06:27:38.718 align:start position:0%
access to affordable housing and child
 
06:27:40.788 --> 06:27:40.798 align:start position:0%
care and getting young people into
 
06:27:43.230 --> 06:27:43.240 align:start position:0%
careers where there are jobs that they
 
06:27:47.310 --> 06:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
are needed for on a range of metrics new
 
06:27:49.788 --> 06:27:49.798 align:start position:0%
excuse me New Hampshire outperforms
 
06:27:53.150 --> 06:27:53.160 align:start position:0%
right to work states please vote itl on
 
06:27:56.270 --> 06:27:56.280 align:start position:0%
HB 1377 keep the New Hampshire
 
06:27:58.548 --> 06:27:58.558 align:start position:0%
government from intervening in these
 
06:28:02.310 --> 06:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
relationships HB 1377 puts at risk
 
06:28:05.430 --> 06:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
workers opportunities for training
 
06:28:07.708 --> 06:28:07.718 align:start position:0%
working and making a good living and the
 
06:28:10.310 --> 06:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
employers who want to work with them
 
06:28:12.468 --> 06:28:12.478 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
06:28:14.788 --> 06:28:14.798 align:start position:0%
um the testimony is going well over the
 
06:28:16.910 --> 06:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
three minutes I don't want to have to
 
06:28:19.270 --> 06:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
cut people off so especially if you have
 
06:28:22.548 --> 06:28:22.558 align:start position:0%
a long lengthy written testimony please
 
06:28:25.230 --> 06:28:25.240 align:start position:0%
try to summarize rather than uh go
 
06:28:27.910 --> 06:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
through it thank you um if you can turn
 
06:28:29.548 --> 06:28:29.558 align:start position:0%
that into the clerk I'm sure we'd
 
06:28:31.590 --> 06:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate it and are there any
 
06:28:34.548 --> 06:28:34.558 align:start position:0%
questions are you sure okay
 
06:28:37.230 --> 06:28:37.240 align:start position:0%
representative love thank you for taking
 
06:28:39.030 --> 06:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
my question uh you mentioned government
 
06:28:41.628 --> 06:28:41.638 align:start position:0%
intervention in in the employer employee
 
06:28:44.310 --> 06:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
relationship quite a few times and uh
 
06:28:46.270 --> 06:28:46.280 align:start position:0%
since uh Taft hotley and maybe before
 
06:28:47.670 --> 06:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
hasn't the government been sticking its
 
06:28:49.150 --> 06:28:49.160 align:start position:0%
nose in the employee employer
 
06:28:51.030 --> 06:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
relationship yes the government the
 
06:28:53.030 --> 06:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
federal government is quite involved
 
06:28:55.468 --> 06:28:55.478 align:start position:0%
this what this is here is a New
 
06:28:57.990 --> 06:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law
 
06:29:00.670 --> 06:29:00.680 align:start position:0%
intervention and many economists do not
 
06:29:04.030 --> 06:29:04.040 align:start position:0%
buy into the concept that if one thing
 
06:29:06.270 --> 06:29:06.280 align:start position:0%
is bad do another thing that's just as
 
06:29:07.990 --> 06:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
bad and somehow that's going to make it
 
06:29:09.830 --> 06:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
better so even for those that are
 
06:29:14.190 --> 06:29:14.200 align:start position:0%
opposed to any involvement in unions the
 
06:29:20.548 --> 06:29:20.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:23.430 --> 06:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
intervention uh representative
 
06:29:25.430 --> 06:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
Granger uh thank you for taking my
 
06:29:26.750 --> 06:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
question uh do you oppose government
 
06:29:28.468 --> 06:29:28.478 align:start position:0%
intervention in the economy
 
06:29:30.548 --> 06:29:30.558 align:start position:0%
generally the government represents
 
06:29:33.590 --> 06:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
about 20% of the economy so uh there's
 
06:29:36.070 --> 06:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
an awful lot of uh tentacles of the
 
06:29:37.948 --> 06:29:37.958 align:start position:0%
government involved in the economy and I
 
06:29:40.070 --> 06:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
think each and every decision that comes
 
06:29:41.910 --> 06:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
before you as a committee other
 
06:29:43.990 --> 06:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
committees in New Hampshire you have to
 
06:29:46.390 --> 06:29:46.400 align:start position:0%
look at what is in front of us and in
 
06:29:50.948 --> 06:29:50.958 align:start position:0%
1377 it is a new intervention into the
 
06:29:53.070 --> 06:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
economy okay thank
 
06:29:55.830 --> 06:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
you seeing no other questions thank you
 
06:29:58.670 --> 06:29:58.680 align:start position:0%
for your testimony uh next up I would
 
06:30:01.110 --> 06:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
ask Greg Moore representing Americans
 
06:30:05.110 --> 06:30:05.120 align:start position:0%

06:30:09.110 --> 06:30:09.120 align:start position:0%

Blan thank you Mr chair Mr Vice chair
 
06:30:16.628 --> 06:30:16.638 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I appreciate
 
06:30:18.868 --> 06:30:18.878 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to to join you today for
 
06:30:20.270 --> 06:30:20.280 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Greg Moore I'm a
 
06:30:21.708 --> 06:30:21.718 align:start position:0%
regional director for Americans for
 
06:30:23.670 --> 06:30:23.680 align:start position:0%
Prosperity here today to testify in
 
06:30:25.708 --> 06:30:25.718 align:start position:0%
support of house bill
 
06:30:29.190 --> 06:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
1377 uh this is not a novel issue as
 
06:30:30.590 --> 06:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
many speakers have mentioned before this
 
06:30:33.110 --> 06:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
is a mature issue uh certainly got on my
 
06:30:36.230 --> 06:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
radar screen when I was uh working in
 
06:30:37.670 --> 06:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
for the N Hampshire house first as a
 
06:30:40.110 --> 06:30:40.120 align:start position:0%
policy director then the chief of staff
 
06:30:42.150 --> 06:30:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh this legislation has passed the house
 
06:30:44.110 --> 06:30:44.120 align:start position:0%
a couple times passed the Senate a
 
06:30:45.590 --> 06:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
couple times passed the house and the
 
06:30:47.990 --> 06:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
Senate once uh didn't quite make it
 
06:30:50.030 --> 06:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
through the governor's VTO but it's it's
 
06:30:51.468 --> 06:30:51.478 align:start position:0%
an issue that's going to continue
 
06:30:52.910 --> 06:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
continue to be discussed and it should
 
06:30:55.270 --> 06:30:55.280 align:start position:0%
be continue discussed I I think if we go
 
06:30:57.990 --> 06:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
back and look at the history in 1935 the
 
06:31:00.868 --> 06:31:00.878 align:start position:0%
Wagner Act took place uh that now is
 
06:31:02.510 --> 06:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
known as the National Labor Relations
 
06:31:05.030 --> 06:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
Act prior to that that uh in many
 
06:31:07.590 --> 06:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
workforces there were multiple unions uh
 
06:31:10.468 --> 06:31:10.478 align:start position:0%
who had members uh and there were in a
 
06:31:12.708 --> 06:31:12.718 align:start position:0%
non-union me Members would bargain for
 
06:31:15.310 --> 06:31:15.320 align:start position:0%
themselves the uh National Labor
 
06:31:17.230 --> 06:31:17.240 align:start position:0%
Relations Act brought in a provision of
 
06:31:19.628 --> 06:31:19.638 align:start position:0%
exclusive representation that provision
 
06:31:22.628 --> 06:31:22.638 align:start position:0%
meant that if one Union could get 50%
 
06:31:24.910 --> 06:31:24.920 align:start position:0%
plus one members of of of that that
 
06:31:27.388 --> 06:31:27.398 align:start position:0%
Workforce to agree to join then no other
 
06:31:29.708 --> 06:31:29.718 align:start position:0%
Union could participate and that on that
 
06:31:33.230 --> 06:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
on that that bargaining unit as well as
 
06:31:36.110 --> 06:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
the fact that uh non- non-union members
 
06:31:39.270 --> 06:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
lost their right to negotiate for
 
06:31:42.030 --> 06:31:42.040 align:start position:0%
themselves seeing a little bit of a of a
 
06:31:45.510 --> 06:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh over correction in 1947 the Taft
 
06:31:47.830 --> 06:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
heartley uh Taft heartley act otherwise
 
06:31:49.310 --> 06:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
known as the Labor Management Relations
 
06:31:51.270 --> 06:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
Act was passed that authorized these
 
06:31:53.868 --> 06:31:53.878 align:start position:0%
right to work laws across States
 
06:31:56.788 --> 06:31:56.798 align:start position:0%
ultimately uh ultimately 26 States now
 
06:31:58.590 --> 06:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
are right to work states out of the 50
 
06:32:00.590 --> 06:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
in the union I will just offer a few bit
 
06:32:03.150 --> 06:32:03.160 align:start position:0%
of anecdotes because you guys are going
 
06:32:04.628 --> 06:32:04.638 align:start position:0%
to get tons of data throwing at you on
 
06:32:06.070 --> 06:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
this issue and I don't want to just
 
06:32:08.468 --> 06:32:08.478 align:start position:0%
continue to just throw more stuff into a
 
06:32:10.430 --> 06:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
wall but I'll I'll tell you some
 
06:32:12.430 --> 06:32:12.440 align:start position:0%
experiences that I've had first and
 
06:32:14.468 --> 06:32:14.478 align:start position:0%
foremost I was uh working at the
 
06:32:15.788 --> 06:32:15.798 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
06:32:17.990 --> 06:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
in 2005 when they implemented an agency
 
06:32:21.310 --> 06:32:21.320 align:start position:0%
fee so I saw I saw the amount of rancor
 
06:32:23.190 --> 06:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
that that brought in the my my
 
06:32:25.628 --> 06:32:25.638 align:start position:0%
co-workers I was I was not actually not
 
06:32:28.510 --> 06:32:28.520 align:start position:0%
eligible to join a union but uh but a
 
06:32:30.628 --> 06:32:30.638 align:start position:0%
number of my my colleagues who were
 
06:32:33.110 --> 06:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
non-members were very upset by this as
 
06:32:35.190 --> 06:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
you can imagine money was going to be
 
06:32:37.190 --> 06:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
deducted from their paycheck ultimately
 
06:32:39.670 --> 06:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
that was reversed in 2018 with the the
 
06:32:41.548 --> 06:32:41.558 align:start position:0%
uh the Janice decision and obviously no
 
06:32:44.030 --> 06:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
non-union members now have to pay pay a
 
06:32:46.150 --> 06:32:46.160 align:start position:0%
due I'll also talk on behalf a little
 
06:32:49.110 --> 06:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
bit of of some of our activists and that
 
06:32:50.788 --> 06:32:50.798 align:start position:0%
hopefully that'll explain why some
 
06:32:52.948 --> 06:32:52.958 align:start position:0%
employers support Right to Work
 
06:32:56.070 --> 06:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
legislation uh one of our activists uh
 
06:32:59.628 --> 06:32:59.638 align:start position:0%
he was part of a union shop and uh he
 
06:33:01.430 --> 06:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
felt as though the union was not
 
06:33:03.670 --> 06:33:03.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily bargaining on his behalf he
 
06:33:05.230 --> 06:33:05.240 align:start position:0%
felt there were a lot of senior members
 
06:33:06.468 --> 06:33:06.478 align:start position:0%
that they were bargain on behalf of the
 
06:33:08.230 --> 06:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
senior members he was he was a junior
 
06:33:10.190 --> 06:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
member he he wanted different things out
 
06:33:12.548 --> 06:33:12.558 align:start position:0%
of the negotiations and he didn't get it
 
06:33:14.788 --> 06:33:14.798 align:start position:0%
well he didn't want to continue to pay a
 
06:33:16.510 --> 06:33:16.520 align:start position:0%
union that he felt is working against
 
06:33:19.830 --> 06:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
his best interests so this notion that
 
06:33:21.388 --> 06:33:21.398 align:start position:0%
that somehow all all people are
 
06:33:22.990 --> 06:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
benefiting by the bargaining of the
 
06:33:24.868 --> 06:33:24.878 align:start position:0%
Union I I think that's overblown and I
 
06:33:26.388 --> 06:33:26.398 align:start position:0%
think that there are real life examples
 
06:33:29.590 --> 06:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
of that it is true it is true that uh
 
06:33:31.628 --> 06:33:31.638 align:start position:0%
that if you are part of a Union contract
 
06:33:33.750 --> 06:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
the union must represent you that is
 
06:33:35.190 --> 06:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
true all all people in the bargaining
 
06:33:37.430 --> 06:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
are represented by the contract but I'll
 
06:33:39.510 --> 06:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
tell you one anecdote back in 2011 when
 
06:33:41.230 --> 06:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
we passed the uh Right to Work
 
06:33:43.510 --> 06:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
legislation in the house and what
 
06:33:45.310 --> 06:33:45.320 align:start position:0%
happened in that instance is that
 
06:33:47.430 --> 06:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
argument was raised and this committee
 
06:33:49.468 --> 06:33:49.478 align:start position:0%
the house labor committee actually put a
 
06:33:51.948 --> 06:33:51.958 align:start position:0%
provision in that said that public
 
06:33:54.190 --> 06:33:54.200 align:start position:0%
sector unions did not have to represent
 
06:33:55.788 --> 06:33:55.798 align:start position:0%
repr represent all employees in the in
 
06:33:57.990 --> 06:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
the in the bargaining unit when that
 
06:34:00.110 --> 06:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
bill went over the wall to the Senate
 
06:34:01.788 --> 06:34:01.798 align:start position:0%
and that public hearing came up the
 
06:34:04.310 --> 06:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
first thing that the unions attacked was
 
06:34:05.830 --> 06:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
the fact that they didn't get a chance
 
06:34:08.910 --> 06:34:08.920 align:start position:0%
to represent all members so with that
 
06:34:10.070 --> 06:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
I'm probably at three minutes and I
 
06:34:10.948 --> 06:34:10.958 align:start position:0%
don't want to take any more of this
 
06:34:12.468 --> 06:34:12.478 align:start position:0%
committee's time so I I'll stop there
 
06:34:14.468 --> 06:34:14.478 align:start position:0%
and take any questions all right thank
 
06:34:18.190 --> 06:34:18.200 align:start position:0%
you uh any questions yes go ahead thank
 
06:34:19.430 --> 06:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking the
 
06:34:22.948 --> 06:34:22.958 align:start position:0%
question so you obviously know there's a
 
06:34:24.788 --> 06:34:24.798 align:start position:0%
lot of businesses and associations in
 
06:34:28.830 --> 06:34:28.840 align:start position:0%
the state that charge will have members
 
06:34:31.670 --> 06:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
that they charge fees to represent them
 
06:34:35.310 --> 06:34:35.320 align:start position:0%
so why would we discriminate against a
 
06:34:37.548 --> 06:34:37.558 align:start position:0%
company just because it has a union logo
 
06:34:40.948 --> 06:34:40.958 align:start position:0%
on it see I I sponsor want a
 
06:34:42.590 --> 06:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
clarification are you talking about
 
06:34:44.830 --> 06:34:44.840 align:start position:0%
customers I'm talking about businesses
 
06:34:46.468 --> 06:34:46.478 align:start position:0%
as a lobbyist I'm sure you have clients
 
06:34:47.948 --> 06:34:47.958 align:start position:0%
you have members and I'm sure you don't
 
06:34:49.990 --> 06:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
do it for free I'm assuming that you get
 
06:34:53.868 --> 06:34:53.878 align:start position:0%
paid to represent members so my the
 
06:34:55.868 --> 06:34:55.878 align:start position:0%
question is why would we discriminate
 
06:34:59.070 --> 06:34:59.080 align:start position:0%
against a union company to allow it not
 
06:35:00.990 --> 06:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
to represent its members and get paid
 
06:35:03.388 --> 06:35:03.398 align:start position:0%
for it well if if thank you for the
 
06:35:05.990 --> 06:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
question if the union is providing
 
06:35:08.190 --> 06:35:08.200 align:start position:0%
something that that that that employee
 
06:35:10.070 --> 06:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
does not want in other words they don't
 
06:35:11.990 --> 06:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
support the outcome of the bargaining
 
06:35:13.270 --> 06:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
then why should they have to pay for
 
06:35:14.750 --> 06:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
something that they didn't like would be
 
06:35:19.910 --> 06:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:23.230 --> 06:35:23.240 align:start position:0%
you I'll go with representative L Clair
 
06:35:25.310 --> 06:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
and then
 
06:35:27.270 --> 06:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
um thank you just kind of following up
 
06:35:30.830 --> 06:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
on that if 99% of the people agree that
 
06:35:33.510 --> 06:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
it's good for them wouldn't it be better
 
06:35:36.910 --> 06:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
than just the 1% that may not I think
 
06:35:39.270 --> 06:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
that the Crux the Crux of of the issue
 
06:35:40.628 --> 06:35:40.638 align:start position:0%
is important of what you're raising and
 
06:35:44.750 --> 06:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
that is and that is uh by ensuring that
 
06:35:46.628 --> 06:35:46.638 align:start position:0%
unions get paid when their members
 
06:35:48.750 --> 06:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
believe that the the outcome of the of
 
06:35:51.628 --> 06:35:51.638 align:start position:0%
the negotiation is is something that's
 
06:35:53.868 --> 06:35:53.878 align:start position:0%
supporting something that they support
 
06:35:55.830 --> 06:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
and they'll voluntarily want to join the
 
06:35:57.230 --> 06:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
unions and you'll have greater
 
06:36:00.350 --> 06:36:00.360 align:start position:0%
participation if on the other hand uh
 
06:36:02.708 --> 06:36:02.718 align:start position:0%
they think well we can get 51% to
 
06:36:04.030 --> 06:36:04.040 align:start position:0%
support this and that's enough because
 
06:36:05.510 --> 06:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to get agency fees from the
 
06:36:08.150 --> 06:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
other 49% then I don't think that's good
 
06:36:09.788 --> 06:36:09.798 align:start position:0%
for the for the overall health the
 
06:36:11.830 --> 06:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
morale of of the bargaining
 
06:36:16.468 --> 06:36:16.478 align:start position:0%
unit can I follow up okay please um and
 
06:36:18.070 --> 06:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
these Agreements are made between not
 
06:36:20.830 --> 06:36:20.840 align:start position:0%
just just um the workers but they're
 
06:36:22.468 --> 06:36:22.478 align:start position:0%
also made between the businesses or the
 
06:36:25.190 --> 06:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
people that they work for
 
06:36:27.990 --> 06:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
again it's not it's typically not 51%
 
06:36:30.708 --> 06:36:30.718 align:start position:0%
it's really high numbers in negotiations
 
06:36:32.070 --> 06:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
I've seen some negotiations and it's
 
06:36:35.948 --> 06:36:35.958 align:start position:0%
never just 50 plus one it's it's it's
 
06:36:38.548 --> 06:36:38.558 align:start position:0%
really is it back and forth back and
 
06:36:40.830 --> 06:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
forth back and forth and and again not
 
06:36:42.788 --> 06:36:42.798 align:start position:0%
everybody's going to agree not you know
 
06:36:44.548 --> 06:36:44.558 align:start position:0%
you got people that agree with you right
 
06:36:47.910 --> 06:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
is this a question so so again I'm sorry
 
06:36:51.190 --> 06:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
you're right um you know why does that
 
06:36:52.628 --> 06:36:52.638 align:start position:0%
why would the
 
06:36:55.430 --> 06:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
51% or 50% plus 1% even make a
 
06:36:57.230 --> 06:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
difference I mean if if most of the
 
06:36:59.670 --> 06:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
people that are out there agree to it
 
06:37:02.430 --> 06:37:02.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be I mean that's how we're
 
06:37:04.230 --> 06:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
we elect officials and thank you for the
 
06:37:06.350 --> 06:37:06.360 align:start position:0%
question I would say I would say that if
 
06:37:08.548 --> 06:37:08.558 align:start position:0%
you look at some of the most effective
 
06:37:10.670 --> 06:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
unions and I in particular I look at the
 
06:37:13.468 --> 06:37:13.478 align:start position:0%
the public safety unions that have 99%
 
06:37:16.708 --> 06:37:16.718 align:start position:0%
to your point 99% of the individual
 
06:37:18.628 --> 06:37:18.638 align:start position:0%
members that means that the union is
 
06:37:20.230 --> 06:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely providing something that they
 
06:37:22.868 --> 06:37:22.878 align:start position:0%
find valuable and useful when you have
 
06:37:24.468 --> 06:37:24.478 align:start position:0%
bargaining units that are significant
 
06:37:26.670 --> 06:37:26.680 align:start position:0%
less than that I mean I I'll give you an
 
06:37:27.830 --> 06:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
example as someone who was a former
 
06:37:29.510 --> 06:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
state employee the state employee is
 
06:37:30.990 --> 06:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
nowhere near that
 
06:37:33.670 --> 06:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
99% uh then you have a number of people
 
06:37:35.270 --> 06:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
who are dissatisfied with the outcome of
 
06:37:35.280 --> 06:37:37.788 align:start position:0%
who are dissatisfied with the outcome of
the

06:37:37.788 --> 06:37:37.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:40.830 --> 06:37:40.840 align:start position:0%
bargaining representative McKenzie Mr
 
06:37:43.030 --> 06:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
chairman I have I'll have two questions
 
06:37:46.990 --> 06:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
I can shoot them uh at this point uh
 
06:37:49.430 --> 06:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
together uh could you explain to us what
 
06:37:52.350 --> 06:37:52.360 align:start position:0%
the Americans for Prosperity is and
 
06:37:54.190 --> 06:37:54.200 align:start position:0%
where you get your money and how you
 
06:37:57.270 --> 06:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
funded sure sure absolutely uh Americans
 
06:38:00.190 --> 06:38:00.200 align:start position:0%
for Prosperity is a 501c4 uh it means
 
06:38:02.670 --> 06:38:02.680 align:start position:0%
we're we are on what the IRS describes
 
06:38:05.270 --> 06:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
as a social welfare organization uh we
 
06:38:07.030 --> 06:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
Advocate on behalf of policies that
 
06:38:09.468 --> 06:38:09.478 align:start position:0%
expand economic freedom uh the second
 
06:38:10.910 --> 06:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
question you ask is where we funded from
 
06:38:13.388 --> 06:38:13.398 align:start position:0%
well we have over 500,000 donors across
 
06:38:16.030 --> 06:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
the country including over 1500 here in
 
06:38:18.430 --> 06:38:18.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and they they pay their
 
06:38:20.708 --> 06:38:20.718 align:start position:0%
dues because they think we do a good job
 
06:38:22.070 --> 06:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
let me ask you another question if I
 
06:38:24.788 --> 06:38:24.798 align:start position:0%
could Mr chairman uh yes follow but be
 
06:38:26.510 --> 06:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
mindful we're we're going to have to
 
06:38:28.190 --> 06:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
throw some people out of here without
 
06:38:31.070 --> 06:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
speaking if we take up the time that
 
06:38:32.868 --> 06:38:32.878 align:start position:0%
we've allotted to them this is this is
 
06:38:36.388 --> 06:38:36.398 align:start position:0%
the opportunity I have to just so and I
 
06:38:37.868 --> 06:38:37.878 align:start position:0%
to be honest with you I understand where
 
06:38:40.548 --> 06:38:40.558 align:start position:0%
you're coming from but you know I a
 
06:38:42.948 --> 06:38:42.958 align:start position:0%
little resentful of of the the position
 
06:38:45.270 --> 06:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
you're taking I understand it but these
 
06:38:46.990 --> 06:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
are this is our opportunity to question
 
06:38:49.948 --> 06:38:49.958 align:start position:0%
people come before this I'm I'm just I'm
 
06:38:52.388 --> 06:38:52.398 align:start position:0%
asking you to just be mindful not I'm
 
06:38:56.388 --> 06:38:56.398 align:start position:0%
not saying I have you uh is can you tell
 
06:38:59.510 --> 06:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
me uh if anytime you're a state employee
 
06:39:02.548 --> 06:39:02.558 align:start position:0%
either you or anybody that you knew ever
 
06:39:04.310 --> 06:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
turned down the benefits that were
 
06:39:06.788 --> 06:39:06.798 align:start position:0%
negotiated by the local by uh
 
06:39:09.190 --> 06:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
1984 well considering legally I don't
 
06:39:11.070 --> 06:39:11.080 align:start position:0%
have the right to do that I would that
 
06:39:13.510 --> 06:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
the answer is no is the answer no they
 
06:39:15.150 --> 06:39:15.160 align:start position:0%
they they don't have the
 
06:39:18.548 --> 06:39:18.558 align:start position:0%
option thank you are there further
 
06:39:21.310 --> 06:39:21.320 align:start position:0%
questions representative Granger uh
 
06:39:22.948 --> 06:39:22.958 align:start position:0%
excuse thank you for uh taking the
 
06:39:24.750 --> 06:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
question uh excuse I I I don't have a
 
06:39:27.030 --> 06:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
lot of experience working in a union um
 
06:39:28.590 --> 06:39:28.600 align:start position:0%
the only experience I have was a bad one
 
06:39:31.030 --> 06:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
and it didn't last very long but if so
 
06:39:33.990 --> 06:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
let's say I'm working at a union job and
 
06:39:36.110 --> 06:39:36.120 align:start position:0%
I don't like some aspect of what they've
 
06:39:37.750 --> 06:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
negotiated so for instance I don't take
 
06:39:38.830 --> 06:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
health insurance I don't believe in
 
06:39:41.388 --> 06:39:41.398 align:start position:0%
health insurance um and I I would rather
 
06:39:44.150 --> 06:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
have a different deal if it's a union
 
06:39:45.628 --> 06:39:45.638 align:start position:0%
job and I'm not a member of the Union
 
06:39:47.430 --> 06:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
how do I go about actually getting what
 
06:39:47.440 --> 06:39:48.830 align:start position:0%
how do I go about actually getting what
I

06:39:48.830 --> 06:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
I
 
06:39:52.510 --> 06:39:52.520 align:start position:0%
want well so and thanks for the question
 
06:39:54.788 --> 06:39:54.798 align:start position:0%
uh I first in the first instance I'd say
 
06:39:57.150 --> 06:39:57.160 align:start position:0%
that that um you don't have the right
 
06:39:59.430 --> 06:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
legally assuming it's it's a certified
 
06:40:01.310 --> 06:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
under the National Labor Relations Act
 
06:40:03.310 --> 06:40:03.320 align:start position:0%
if it's a certified bargaining unit you
 
06:40:04.868 --> 06:40:04.878 align:start position:0%
don't have the right to negotiate for
 
06:40:07.628 --> 06:40:07.638 align:start position:0%
yourself that that is taken away uh
 
06:40:08.990 --> 06:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's called exclusive

06:40:13.708 --> 06:40:13.718 align:start position:0%
Wagner Act uh obviously you can go
 
06:40:16.270 --> 06:40:16.280 align:start position:0%
outside obviously you can go outside of
 
06:40:18.708 --> 06:40:18.718 align:start position:0%
of that and and either leave the
 
06:40:20.990 --> 06:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
bargaining unit or the other opportunity
 
06:40:22.708 --> 06:40:22.718 align:start position:0%
would be to to try to join the union and
 
06:40:23.948 --> 06:40:23.958 align:start position:0%
change the direction of what where
 
06:40:23.958 --> 06:40:25.750 align:start position:0%

legislation and I could talk about all
 
06:43:14.270 --> 06:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
the reasons why you heard a lot of the
 
06:43:17.310 --> 06:43:17.320 align:start position:0%
good reasons that were already said that
 
06:43:20.468 --> 06:43:20.478 align:start position:0%
I had PL to talk about um but it it
 
06:43:23.350 --> 06:43:23.360 align:start position:0%

06:43:27.110 --> 06:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
important important a union job
 
06:43:32.030 --> 06:43:32.040 align:start position:0%

is to their way of life and a decent way

06:43:32.910 --> 06:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:43:36.590 --> 06:43:36.600 align:start position:0%

speak to you all my name is DJ bluen and
 
06:44:50.990 --> 06:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
I uh have a bit of a unique perspective
 
06:44:55.190 --> 06:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
in that I am a union contractor and I I
 
06:44:58.070 --> 06:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
am also a member and I employ these same
 
06:45:01.030 --> 06:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
guys and I could sit and debate both uh
 
06:45:03.430 --> 06:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
both sides of unionism very
 
06:45:05.670 --> 06:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
impassionately and I can go down and
 
06:45:06.990 --> 06:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
repeat all of the things that our
 
06:45:08.670 --> 06:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
brothers and sisters have pointed out
 
06:45:11.910 --> 06:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
here about the benefits that unionism
 
06:45:15.030 --> 06:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
brings to them this bill that is before
 
06:45:18.750 --> 06:45:18.760 align:start position:0%
us is here every two years it's never
 
06:45:21.190 --> 06:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
passed and it's starting to become
 
06:45:24.150 --> 06:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
irresponsible with legislator who are
 
06:45:26.868 --> 06:45:26.878 align:start position:0%
being given this opportunity to shine by
 
06:45:29.628 --> 06:45:29.638 align:start position:0%
people out of state because I don't know
 
06:45:32.150 --> 06:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
who this law benefits in New
 
06:45:32.160 --> 06:45:33.750 align:start position:0%
who this law benefits in New
Hampshire

06:45:33.750 --> 06:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:45:36.590 --> 06:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
the things that have been discussed here
 
06:45:38.910 --> 06:45:38.920 align:start position:0%
today can we can go on chapter and verse
 
06:45:42.430 --> 06:45:42.440 align:start position:0%
about the benefits for workers and
 
06:45:44.670 --> 06:45:44.680 align:start position:0%
people in the state New Hampshire is an
 
06:45:46.350 --> 06:45:46.360 align:start position:0%
expensive place to live and you got to
 
06:45:49.510 --> 06:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
stroke a big living to live here and
 
06:45:53.070 --> 06:45:53.080 align:start position:0%
unionism provides the kind of wage
 
06:45:55.510 --> 06:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
package and benefit package that allows
 
06:45:57.788 --> 06:45:57.798 align:start position:0%
a middle class to thrive here in New
 
06:46:00.830 --> 06:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire unionism also and this is
 
06:46:02.310 --> 06:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
something that hasn't been said and I
 
06:46:03.350 --> 06:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
think that is
 
06:46:07.190 --> 06:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
important unionism gives an attractive
 
06:46:09.868 --> 06:46:09.878 align:start position:0%
option to young people who are not
 
06:46:12.948 --> 06:46:12.958 align:start position:0%
college educated to stay in this state
 
06:46:15.468 --> 06:46:15.478 align:start position:0%
the Navy Yard puts tremendous pressure
 
06:46:18.628 --> 06:46:18.638 align:start position:0%
on that resource for us as contractors
 
06:46:22.190 --> 06:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
and in order to retain any kind of young
 
06:46:25.430 --> 06:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
capable willing people we need to offer
 
06:46:28.910 --> 06:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
them more than just some Mississippian
 
06:46:32.190 --> 06:46:32.200 align:start position:0%
or indianan or whatever right to work
 
06:46:35.110 --> 06:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
state you can pick whatever Vision they
 
06:46:37.788 --> 06:46:37.798 align:start position:0%
have for compensation we are in the
 
06:46:39.548 --> 06:46:39.558 align:start position:0%
Northeast where it's tremendously
 
06:46:42.868 --> 06:46:42.878 align:start position:0%
expensive to live I would urge lawmakers
 
06:46:45.670 --> 06:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
here to find ways to reduce our
 
06:46:50.030 --> 06:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
electricity tax I would ask you if you
 
06:46:52.628 --> 06:46:52.638 align:start position:0%
are willing to develop the state
 
06:46:55.110 --> 06:46:55.120 align:start position:0%
economically to take away the business
 
06:46:57.830 --> 06:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
dividend tax if you want to get
 
06:47:00.468 --> 06:47:00.478 align:start position:0%
businesses to come to New Hampshire I
 
06:47:03.510 --> 06:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
would say if you need Revenue sell weed
 
06:47:04.750 --> 06:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
at the liquor
 
06:47:04.760 --> 06:47:06.468 align:start position:0%
at the liquor
stores

06:47:06.468 --> 06:47:06.478 align:start position:0%
stores
 
06:47:09.948 --> 06:47:09.958 align:start position:0%
but no no I'm serious if you want to be
 
06:47:12.628 --> 06:47:12.638 align:start position:0%
modern and think about how to run this
 
06:47:15.990 --> 06:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
state trying to stifle wages and
 
06:47:17.948 --> 06:47:17.958 align:start position:0%
opportunities for its citizens is a
 
06:47:21.670 --> 06:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
terrible thing and it doesn't it doesn't
 
06:47:24.110 --> 06:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
benefit anybody in the state so I urge
 
06:47:26.590 --> 06:47:26.600 align:start position:0%
you that if this bill makes it that you
 
06:47:28.510 --> 06:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
vote no and if the Senate Bill makes it
 
06:47:31.030 --> 06:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
you vote no and this is someone speaking
 
06:47:33.590 --> 06:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
to you from the management side of
 
06:47:37.548 --> 06:47:37.558 align:start position:0%
Labor we work in Partnership okay it's
 
06:47:42.548 --> 06:47:42.558 align:start position:0%
not the 1940s where everybody's fighting
 
06:47:44.788 --> 06:47:44.798 align:start position:0%
we've created a safety culture in the
 
06:47:46.310 --> 06:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
last 20 years in the business and
 
06:47:49.190 --> 06:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
reduced accidents and unions have done
 
06:47:52.388 --> 06:47:52.398 align:start position:0%
that you know the the positive things
 
06:47:53.990 --> 06:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
that unions have brought to this country
 
06:47:56.430 --> 06:47:56.440 align:start position:0%
like the weekend you know things like
 
06:47:58.270 --> 06:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
that like a 40-hour work week we can go
 
06:48:00.150 --> 06:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
on chapter and verse it's just wrong for
 
06:48:02.070 --> 06:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I thank you for your
 
06:48:04.190 --> 06:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
time and I will answer any questions
 
06:48:06.750 --> 06:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
06:48:09.270 --> 06:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
and representative buudy thank you Mr
 
06:48:12.070 --> 06:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I had someplace else to go
 
06:48:14.070 --> 06:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
but I had to come back to ask a question
 
06:48:17.628 --> 06:48:17.638 align:start position:0%
sure um thank you for coming today and
 
06:48:20.070 --> 06:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
speaking from management side uh
 
06:48:22.190 --> 06:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
somebody before you spoke about
 
06:48:24.548 --> 06:48:24.558 align:start position:0%
performance now being from management
 
06:48:28.030 --> 06:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
side do you feel that if all the members
 
06:48:31.868 --> 06:48:31.878 align:start position:0%
belong to the same Union perform better
 
06:48:34.468 --> 06:48:34.478 align:start position:0%
together and the performance overall is
 
06:48:36.788 --> 06:48:36.798 align:start position:0%
better we ensure our performance in
 
06:48:38.990 --> 06:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
trade unions by controlling our training
 
06:48:41.070 --> 06:48:41.080 align:start position:0%
of our apprentices it's typically a four
 
06:48:44.270 --> 06:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
or fiveyear program and every Apprentice
 
06:48:46.230 --> 06:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
in a trade Union be it an electrician a
 
06:48:47.990 --> 06:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
plumber a sheet metal work or a
 
06:48:51.708 --> 06:48:51.718 align:start position:0%
carpenter they go to school at night or
 
06:48:53.670 --> 06:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
they block out two weeks of school
 
06:48:57.468 --> 06:48:57.478 align:start position:0%
during the work hours to have book
 
06:48:59.990 --> 06:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
learning and to understand Concepts and
 
06:49:01.708 --> 06:49:01.718 align:start position:0%
that's stuff that is all privately
 
06:49:04.230 --> 06:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
funded by unions themselves when you pay
 
06:49:08.310 --> 06:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
dues you pay into your training program
 
06:49:10.388 --> 06:49:10.398 align:start position:0%
and the training program ensures that
 
06:49:12.830 --> 06:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
the guys coming behind you are working
 
06:49:16.670 --> 06:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:19.910 --> 06:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
retire follow so this would if they're
 
06:49:22.468 --> 06:49:22.478 align:start position:0%
all working and training together their
 
06:49:25.190 --> 06:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
teamwork must be a much better our
 
06:49:27.430 --> 06:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
productivity level is far higher than
 
06:49:30.430 --> 06:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
any sheet metal worker that is not
 
06:49:34.070 --> 06:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
organized thank you any further
 
06:49:36.070 --> 06:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
06:49:41.670 --> 06:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:45.910 --> 06:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
um now being after 4:30 I uh got some
 
06:49:48.750 --> 06:49:48.760 align:start position:0%
instructions from chairman infantine one
 
06:49:51.388 --> 06:49:51.398 align:start position:0%
of the issues that we have right now is
 
06:49:55.030 --> 06:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
that the um house staff is going to be
 
06:49:58.388 --> 06:49:58.398 align:start position:0%
kept over their time and and just at the
 
06:50:00.548 --> 06:50:00.558 align:start position:0%
rate that we're going we can't possibly
 
06:50:02.548 --> 06:50:02.558 align:start position:0%
get through all this testimony so
 
06:50:05.468 --> 06:50:05.478 align:start position:0%
chairman infantine told me that he is
 
06:50:07.868 --> 06:50:07.878 align:start position:0%
going to resume the hearing we need to
 
06:50:09.830 --> 06:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
end between
 
06:50:13.990 --> 06:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
5:15 uh maybe 5:30 at the very latest
 
06:50:18.990 --> 06:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
and uh any any people we can't get to in
 
06:50:20.910 --> 06:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
that time we're going to have to pick up
 
06:50:27.230 --> 06:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:31.070 --> 06:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
later and yes Claudia is still uh is
 
06:50:33.548 --> 06:50:33.558 align:start position:0%
speaking for herself in opposition to
 
06:50:35.590 --> 06:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
the bill followed by representative J.R
 
06:50:42.310 --> 06:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:45.830 --> 06:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
gonzal thank you for letting me speak
 
06:50:48.708 --> 06:50:48.718 align:start position:0%
and um I stand in opposition to this
 
06:50:51.430 --> 06:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
bill a lot of things have been said that
 
06:50:53.830 --> 06:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
I was going to say so I want to just
 
06:50:57.590 --> 06:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
share two things one um I'm a lifetime
 
06:51:00.628 --> 06:51:00.638 align:start position:0%
member of Nea as a public school
 
06:51:04.190 --> 06:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
educator and I'm also a member of SEIU
 
06:51:07.230 --> 06:51:07.240 align:start position:0%
um 1984 chapter 32 as an adjunct in the
 
06:51:09.468 --> 06:51:09.478 align:start position:0%
community college system um I've
 
06:51:11.910 --> 06:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
benefited greatly from being a union
 
06:51:15.190 --> 06:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
member um as a teacher one of the things
 
06:51:17.510 --> 06:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
I love is when I get to see former
 
06:51:19.708 --> 06:51:19.718 align:start position:0%
students and I ran into a former student
 
06:51:22.030 --> 06:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
of mine in the grocery store young man
 
06:51:23.788 --> 06:51:23.798 align:start position:0%
who was you know you know an average
 
06:51:27.030 --> 06:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
student a nice guy he was so proud of
 
06:51:30.910 --> 06:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
the fact that he had a great job a great
 
06:51:33.868 --> 06:51:33.878 align:start position:0%
union job so that he was earning a good
 
06:51:36.030 --> 06:51:36.040 align:start position:0%
living he was getting training he was
 
06:51:38.150 --> 06:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
being able to put money aside for his
 
06:51:41.468 --> 06:51:41.478 align:start position:0%
retirement as in as a young man in his
 
06:51:43.948 --> 06:51:43.958 align:start position:0%
20s so that's one thing I want to say
 
06:51:47.510 --> 06:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
and the second thing is as a teacher um
 
06:51:49.430 --> 06:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
there were times when we when
 
06:51:51.468 --> 06:51:51.478 align:start position:0%
negotiations when we were negotiating
 
06:51:53.708 --> 06:51:53.718 align:start position:0%
our collective bargaining agreement
 
06:51:57.830 --> 06:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
that we focused on um the particularly
 
06:52:01.628 --> 06:52:01.638 align:start position:0%
the pay um for the younger teachers and
 
06:52:05.230 --> 06:52:05.240 align:start position:0%
the newer teachers at the detriment
 
06:52:07.868 --> 06:52:07.878 align:start position:0%
maybe of those who of us who were higher
 
06:52:10.788 --> 06:52:10.798 align:start position:0%
up on the on the pay scale um who are
 
06:52:13.948 --> 06:52:13.958 align:start position:0%
more experienced there were other times
 
06:52:17.190 --> 06:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
that the reverse happened we had we done
 
06:52:18.948 --> 06:52:18.958 align:start position:0%
things for people at the at the lower
 
06:52:21.310 --> 06:52:21.320 align:start position:0%
end of the scale it was time to give
 
06:52:22.910 --> 06:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
something to the people who were at the
 
06:52:25.510 --> 06:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
top end of the scale
 
06:52:29.350 --> 06:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
um I think it's because the thing that
 
06:52:31.350 --> 06:52:31.360 align:start position:0%
that the gentleman from Americans for
 
06:52:32.948 --> 06:52:32.958 align:start position:0%
Prosperity didn't point out is that
 
06:52:36.110 --> 06:52:36.120 align:start position:0%
Union contracts are for the common good
 
06:52:38.388 --> 06:52:38.398 align:start position:0%
and so I think that when we we we
 
06:52:40.190 --> 06:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
negotiated those collective bargaining
 
06:52:42.468 --> 06:52:42.478 align:start position:0%
agreements and sometimes one group
 
06:52:44.830 --> 06:52:44.840 align:start position:0%
benefited more than another group we all
 
06:52:46.868 --> 06:52:46.878 align:start position:0%
stood behind each together and
 
06:52:49.430 --> 06:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
solidarity because we knew that this was
 
06:52:51.548 --> 06:52:51.558 align:start position:0%
for the common good so that's all I had
 
06:52:53.350 --> 06:52:53.360 align:start position:0%
to say thank you so much
 
06:52:57.190 --> 06:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:00.388 --> 06:53:00.398 align:start position:0%

the towns of Dunbarton hookit Allenstown
 
06:53:25.798 --> 06:53:27.350 align:start position:0%
the towns of Dunbarton hookit Allenstown
and

06:53:27.350 --> 06:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:53:29.510 --> 06:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
epom while I was sitting in the audience
 
06:53:31.430 --> 06:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
I heard people talk about I was a member
 
06:53:34.230 --> 06:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
of the Nea well given the recent US
 
06:53:36.628 --> 06:53:36.638 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision right public
 
06:53:38.310 --> 06:53:38.320 align:start position:0%
schools are not part of this anymore or
 
06:53:40.150 --> 06:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
sorry public unions this is really about
 
06:53:42.628 --> 06:53:42.638 align:start position:0%
private unions and the thing that comes
 
06:53:46.750 --> 06:53:46.760 align:start position:0%
to mind is if the union has to work
 
06:53:49.510 --> 06:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
harder for its membership to get the
 
06:53:51.670 --> 06:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
donations as opposed to compulsory
 
06:53:53.948 --> 06:53:53.958 align:start position:0%
membership the employees will better be
 
06:53:57.830 --> 06:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
better off recently I had a a a job I
 
06:54:00.270 --> 06:54:00.280 align:start position:0%
was having quoted for um that was a
 
06:54:02.350 --> 06:54:02.360 align:start position:0%
plumbing job Plumbing there are Plumbing
 
06:54:04.670 --> 06:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
unions there are private plumbers as
 
06:54:07.110 --> 06:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
well plumbers are making or at least
 
06:54:10.350 --> 06:54:10.360 align:start position:0%
billing north of $150 an hour if you are
 
06:54:12.388 --> 06:54:12.398 align:start position:0%
a self-employed plumber You're Building
 
06:54:15.548 --> 06:54:15.558 align:start position:0%
at $150 an hour what used to be rates
 
06:54:17.430 --> 06:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
that you would see for engineers and
 
06:54:20.190 --> 06:54:20.200 align:start position:0%
attorneys and higher-end firms are now
 
06:54:23.150 --> 06:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
common in the trades and part of this is
 
06:54:25.548 --> 06:54:25.558 align:start position:0%
due to a severe labor
 
06:54:27.510 --> 06:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
shortage I think one of the things that
 
06:54:29.948 --> 06:54:29.958 align:start position:0%
we need to think about is the unions
 
06:54:32.868 --> 06:54:32.878 align:start position:0%
become more responsive to their members
 
06:54:34.948 --> 06:54:34.958 align:start position:0%
once a right to work law is passed I
 
06:54:36.788 --> 06:54:36.798 align:start position:0%
would ask that you would pass this thank

um I there's so many reasons why this is
 
06:55:12.270 --> 06:55:12.280 align:start position:0%
bad for New Hampshire and let me just
 
06:55:15.230 --> 06:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
say that 30 years ago I was in the state
 
06:55:18.670 --> 06:55:18.680 align:start position:0%
legislature I sat in this committee we
 
06:55:22.670 --> 06:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
heard the same exact Bill and it met
 
06:55:25.270 --> 06:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
with the feet as it's done every two
 
06:55:30.750 --> 06:55:30.760 align:start position:0%
years for the 30 years but the when I
 
06:55:32.830 --> 06:55:32.840 align:start position:0%
was in it wasn't the first time that
 
06:55:35.430 --> 06:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
this Bill had come up so it been there
 
06:55:38.590 --> 06:55:38.600 align:start position:0%
for at least 10 15 years prior to that
 
06:55:41.990 --> 06:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
and it had been defeated and I know that
 
06:55:45.030 --> 06:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
we don't want to be repeating ourself
 
06:55:47.830 --> 06:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
but I think we have to because we've
 
06:55:51.070 --> 06:55:51.080 align:start position:0%
heard it all I mean everything that's
 
06:55:53.948 --> 06:55:53.958 align:start position:0%
ever been discussed it's been discussed
 
06:55:56.110 --> 06:55:56.120 align:start position:0%
and it's always been killed it's wrong
 
06:55:57.070 --> 06:55:57.080 align:start position:0%
for New
 
06:56:00.990 --> 06:56:01.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I don't believe that you
 
06:56:03.990 --> 06:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
all have had a lot of your
 
06:56:06.750 --> 06:56:06.760 align:start position:0%
constituents coming up to you and saying
 
06:56:08.990 --> 06:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
you know what the the the biggest thing
 
06:56:11.468 --> 06:56:11.478 align:start position:0%
that you have to fix is Right to Work I
 
06:56:15.628 --> 06:56:15.638 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that and so I
 
06:56:17.468 --> 06:56:17.478 align:start position:0%
wonder I don't think there's another
 
06:56:19.590 --> 06:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
bill out there that has
 
06:56:24.590 --> 06:56:24.600 align:start position:0%
seen 40 Years of the same exact bill I
 
06:56:27.708 --> 06:56:27.718 align:start position:0%
don't think that it's there but if it is
 
06:56:29.388 --> 06:56:29.398 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see it and what you're going
 
06:56:33.708 --> 06:56:33.718 align:start position:0%
to do about it but it just gives me
 
06:56:37.070 --> 06:56:37.080 align:start position:0%
pause to say okay why is this bill here
 
06:56:39.910 --> 06:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's it's generated from
 
06:56:43.310 --> 06:56:43.320 align:start position:0%
constituents and so it must be
 
06:56:45.750 --> 06:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
from National Right to Work committee
 
06:56:49.510 --> 06:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
out of state that are giving money to to
 
06:56:51.388 --> 06:56:51.398 align:start position:0%
legislators to bring this in I don't
 
06:56:55.750 --> 06:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
know but one thing is really clear and
 
06:56:57.548 --> 06:56:57.558 align:start position:0%
let's make no mistake this is an
 
06:57:00.310 --> 06:57:00.320 align:start position:0%
anti-union bill there's no doubt about
 
06:57:02.788 --> 06:57:02.798 align:start position:0%
it all these people that say oh it'll
 
06:57:05.468 --> 06:57:05.478 align:start position:0%
make the union stronger it'll if you
 
06:57:08.628 --> 06:57:08.638 align:start position:0%
want to help make Union stronger then
 
06:57:11.830 --> 06:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
support them with jobs support them with
 
06:57:15.110 --> 06:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
um ways to bring companies in to the
 
06:57:17.670 --> 06:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
state rather than you know fighting
 
06:57:20.830 --> 06:57:20.840 align:start position:0%
amongst the small percentages of the
 
06:57:23.750 --> 06:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
workforce that are actually in the state
 
06:57:26.708 --> 06:57:26.718 align:start position:0%
right let's face it it's not that
 
06:57:31.350 --> 06:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
big and so imagine if in a world that we
 
06:57:33.628 --> 06:57:33.638 align:start position:0%
spent as much
 
06:57:36.388 --> 06:57:36.398 align:start position:0%
time that you've already spent on this
 
06:57:40.150 --> 06:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
bill and many of you are multiple um uh
 
06:57:42.190 --> 06:57:42.200 align:start position:0%
sessions have seen
 
06:57:44.868 --> 06:57:44.878 align:start position:0%
it think about all the things you could
 
06:57:47.948 --> 06:57:47.958 align:start position:0%
have been do doing like addressing the
 
06:57:51.910 --> 06:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
the high energy cost like um adequate
 
06:57:56.310 --> 06:57:56.320 align:start position:0%
afford housing adequate and affordable
 
06:58:00.230 --> 06:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
daycare and education giving people the
 
06:58:04.510 --> 06:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
the tools to get good jobs that will
 
06:58:08.468 --> 06:58:08.478 align:start position:0%
attract businesses to the state not
 
06:58:13.310 --> 06:58:13.320 align:start position:0%
having a artificial impediment to a um
 
06:58:16.910 --> 06:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh a business to say you cannot
 
06:58:19.548 --> 06:58:19.558 align:start position:0%
negotiate terms of your collective
 
06:58:23.468 --> 06:58:23.478 align:start position:0%
bargaining that include a mandatory
 
06:58:26.310 --> 06:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
06:58:31.430 --> 06:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
dues if the owner of that business wants
 
06:58:34.788 --> 06:58:34.798 align:start position:0%
to do that because he wants workplace
 
06:58:38.350 --> 06:58:38.360 align:start position:0%
Harmony he is he or she has decided that
 
06:58:39.990 --> 06:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
that's the way they want to go you're
 
06:58:41.868 --> 06:58:41.878 align:start position:0%
going to say with this bill they cannot
 
06:58:41.878 --> 06:58:43.230 align:start position:0%
going to say with this bill they cannot
do

06:58:43.230 --> 06:58:43.240 align:start position:0%
do
 
06:58:45.708 --> 06:58:45.718 align:start position:0%
it that's not in
 
06:58:48.948 --> 06:58:48.958 align:start position:0%
the if you think about it why would you
 
06:58:52.468 --> 06:58:52.478 align:start position:0%
even waste your time on that I mean let
 
06:58:55.910 --> 06:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
the businesses do what they need to
 
06:59:00.350 --> 06:59:00.360 align:start position:0%
do and give people real jobs that
 
06:59:03.310 --> 06:59:03.320 align:start position:0%
will let them stay in this state you
 
06:59:06.270 --> 06:59:06.280 align:start position:0%
know I um one of the things I I I
 
06:59:09.230 --> 06:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
started to look back at all the bills um
 
06:59:11.270 --> 06:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
that have come up on right to work in
 
06:59:14.590 --> 06:59:14.600 align:start position:0%
the past and man I it's really tedious
 
06:59:17.628 --> 06:59:17.638 align:start position:0%
it is so tedious to go through them all
 
06:59:20.388 --> 06:59:20.398 align:start position:0%
and it just shows me
 
06:59:23.628 --> 06:59:23.638 align:start position:0%
that you all can be be doing a lot of
 
06:59:26.110 --> 06:59:26.120 align:start position:0%
things that's good for New Hampshire
 
06:59:30.350 --> 06:59:30.360 align:start position:0%
this bill is not one of them
 
06:59:33.788 --> 06:59:33.798 align:start position:0%
um I would say that
 
06:59:37.868 --> 06:59:37.878 align:start position:0%
uh if you look at the bills that we've
 
06:59:39.788 --> 06:59:39.798 align:start position:0%
been defeated
 
06:59:43.350 --> 06:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
and the economy of this state has done
 
06:59:46.708 --> 06:59:46.718 align:start position:0%
relatively well when you look at all 50
 
06:59:49.910 --> 06:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
states but I can tell you it's doing a
 
06:59:52.350 --> 06:59:52.360 align:start position:0%
heck of a lot better than if you compare
 
06:59:55.270 --> 06:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
to just your right to work states
 
06:59:58.910 --> 06:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
guaranteed there's there's no doubt that
 
07:00:01.310 --> 07:00:01.320 align:start position:0%
you would be doing better so the world
 
07:00:03.628 --> 07:00:03.638 align:start position:0%
did not end because we don't have right
 
07:00:03.638 --> 07:00:04.548 align:start position:0%
did not end because we don't have right
to

07:00:04.548 --> 07:00:04.558 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:00:08.350 --> 07:00:08.360 align:start position:0%
work but yet you still spend so much
 
07:00:10.830 --> 07:00:10.840 align:start position:0%
time on this
 
07:00:14.230 --> 07:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
um and I mean while I like to come up
 
07:00:16.150 --> 07:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
here and and talk to you all it's nice
 
07:00:17.868 --> 07:00:17.878 align:start position:0%
to see all my brothers and sisters out
 
07:00:21.628 --> 07:00:21.638 align:start position:0%
here I think we could be doing something
 
07:00:23.788 --> 07:00:23.798 align:start position:0%
a lot better
 
07:00:28.190 --> 07:00:28.200 align:start position:0%
and the one thing the irony of this
 
07:00:31.868 --> 07:00:31.878 align:start position:0%
um unions are not corporations they're
 
07:00:35.750 --> 07:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
not businesses and yet you had the one
 
07:00:37.948 --> 07:00:37.958 align:start position:0%
of the sponsors of the bill come in and
 
07:00:42.230 --> 07:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
say um try to equate
 
07:00:46.230 --> 07:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh some business
 
07:00:49.708 --> 07:00:49.718 align:start position:0%
model that's not what who unions are you
 
07:00:52.788 --> 07:00:52.798 align:start position:0%
heard the um uh gentleman from uh
 
07:00:56.190 --> 07:00:56.200 align:start position:0%
Americans for Prosperity talking about
 
07:00:59.468 --> 07:00:59.478 align:start position:0%
unions as a business it unions are made
 
07:01:01.590 --> 07:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
up of
 
07:01:05.670 --> 07:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
members they decide what the uh um
 
07:01:09.788 --> 07:01:09.798 align:start position:0%
direction of the uh Union wants to go in
 
07:01:12.310 --> 07:01:12.320 align:start position:0%
they decide collective bargaining and
 
07:01:17.868 --> 07:01:17.878 align:start position:0%
then they vote on it it's not a
 
07:01:21.468 --> 07:01:21.478 align:start position:0%
business and also um the irony of of
 
07:01:23.628 --> 07:01:23.638 align:start position:0%
some of this legislation and and some of
 
07:01:25.910 --> 07:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
the uh supporters of it like the
 
07:01:30.270 --> 07:01:30.280 align:start position:0%
chambers of the Commerce like um the Bia
 
07:01:33.190 --> 07:01:33.200 align:start position:0%
they're all member organizations if you
 
07:01:35.868 --> 07:01:35.878 align:start position:0%
would to say to them that they
 
07:01:39.110 --> 07:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
suddenly um have to let everybody in and
 
07:01:42.590 --> 07:01:42.600 align:start position:0%
they have to work for everyone the same
 
07:01:46.150 --> 07:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
but they can't charge dues I don't think
 
07:01:47.350 --> 07:01:47.360 align:start position:0%
they'd be very
 
07:01:52.350 --> 07:01:52.360 align:start position:0%
happy but that's what this bill will do
 
07:01:54.230 --> 07:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
and I know that you want to wrap it up
 
07:01:56.670 --> 07:01:56.680 align:start position:0%
yes but then again I want to see you
 
07:01:59.070 --> 07:01:59.080 align:start position:0%
wrap it up too and not have this come
 
07:02:03.948 --> 07:02:03.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:06.350 --> 07:02:06.360 align:start position:0%
year thank you for your testimony are
 
07:02:06.360 --> 07:02:07.150 align:start position:0%
year thank you for your testimony are
there

07:02:07.150 --> 07:02:07.160 align:start position:0%
there
 
07:02:10.110 --> 07:02:10.120 align:start position:0%
questions and then and we have yes go
 
07:02:12.510 --> 07:02:12.520 align:start position:0%
ahead I'm gonna try to make this quick
 
07:02:16.190 --> 07:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
great to see you again um it struck me
 
07:02:17.788 --> 07:02:17.798 align:start position:0%
when you were with
 
07:02:20.430 --> 07:02:20.440 align:start position:0%
sea um you brought it to my attention
 
07:02:23.310 --> 07:02:23.320 align:start position:0%
that the membership of sea reflected a
 
07:02:25.590 --> 07:02:25.600 align:start position:0%
political party membership in general
 
07:02:27.750 --> 07:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
reflected the states membership and I
 
07:02:30.310 --> 07:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
thought that was interesting and you've
 
07:02:32.788 --> 07:02:32.798 align:start position:0%
worked with other unions um I know this
 
07:02:34.788 --> 07:02:34.798 align:start position:0%
is probably true for the teamsters as a
 
07:02:37.670 --> 07:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
granddaughter of a Teamster um I get the
 
07:02:41.468 --> 07:02:41.478 align:start position:0%
sense that there's a disconnect between
 
07:02:44.270 --> 07:02:44.280 align:start position:0%
um you know the National Organization
 
07:02:47.150 --> 07:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
pushing this versus Republican union
 
07:02:51.190 --> 07:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
members who um appreciate their Union
 
07:02:53.590 --> 07:02:53.600 align:start position:0%
and in a way union membership can in
 
07:02:57.430 --> 07:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
some cases create uh Republican Party
 
07:03:00.628 --> 07:03:00.638 align:start position:0%
Loyalty in a way what was your sense and
 
07:03:03.388 --> 07:03:03.398 align:start position:0%
what is your sense of the disconnect or
 
07:03:06.110 --> 07:03:06.120 align:start position:0%
is there a disconnect um between like
 
07:03:09.628 --> 07:03:09.638 align:start position:0%
Rank and file Republicans and Union that
 
07:03:12.948 --> 07:03:12.958 align:start position:0%
are union members versus the national
 
07:03:16.190 --> 07:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
cookie cutter bill um there is and just
 
07:03:18.670 --> 07:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
like um in every single Community you
 
07:03:20.628 --> 07:03:20.638 align:start position:0%
have what
 
07:03:24.868 --> 07:03:24.878 align:start position:0%
30% uh Republicans 30% you know and so
 
07:03:29.590 --> 07:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
it it's the same way we are a um exact
 
07:03:32.868 --> 07:03:32.878 align:start position:0%
we are the the union is your community
 
07:03:34.190 --> 07:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
because they're all the workers that are
 
07:03:36.388 --> 07:03:36.398 align:start position:0%
combining together so there are going to
 
07:03:40.910 --> 07:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
be um uh equal numbers of Independents
 
07:03:46.468 --> 07:03:46.478 align:start position:0%
Democrats and Republicans um and it it
 
07:03:47.868 --> 07:03:47.878 align:start position:0%
is all
 
07:03:52.190 --> 07:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
local um and um what happens in DC
 
07:03:56.150 --> 07:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
happens and so there is a great

work to the Granite State and more
 
07:07:06.388 --> 07:07:06.398 align:start position:0%
specifically vote inexpedient to
 
07:07:09.388 --> 07:07:09.398 align:start position:0%
legislate on this house bill
 
07:07:13.070 --> 07:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
1377 unions built the middle class in
 
07:07:15.590 --> 07:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
this country and they will rebuild it as
 
07:07:17.548 --> 07:07:17.558 align:start position:0%
we fight for a brighter future for
 
07:07:19.750 --> 07:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
Working Families the right to
 
07:07:22.310 --> 07:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
collectively bargain is a fundamental
 
07:07:24.708 --> 07:07:24.718 align:start position:0%
Freedom across the United States that
 
07:07:26.430 --> 07:07:26.440 align:start position:0%
should be protected here in New
 
07:07:29.110 --> 07:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so-called right to work laws
 
07:07:32.510 --> 07:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
are simply Right to Work For Less that
 
07:07:35.070 --> 07:07:35.080 align:start position:0%
they harm and disadvantage Working
 
07:07:38.070 --> 07:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
Families the proposed legislation before
 
07:07:40.910 --> 07:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
us which is veiled as maximizing
 
07:07:43.350 --> 07:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
individual freedom of choice would
 
07:07:46.750 --> 07:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
actually decrease wages increase unsafe
 
07:07:49.430 --> 07:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
working conditions and reduce benefits
 
07:07:52.830 --> 07:07:52.840 align:start position:0%
for working people across our our state
 
07:07:55.190 --> 07:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
out of state special interests and
 
07:07:57.230 --> 07:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
proponents of so-called right to work
 
07:08:00.270 --> 07:08:00.280 align:start position:0%
laws have tried multiple times over the
 
07:08:02.230 --> 07:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
last several decades to bring these
 
07:08:05.070 --> 07:08:05.080 align:start position:0%
disastrous policies to our state and
 
07:08:07.350 --> 07:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
thankfully New Hampshire has come
 
07:08:09.468 --> 07:08:09.478 align:start position:0%
together to stop these attacks on the
 
07:08:13.070 --> 07:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
middle class and each and every time we
 
07:08:15.230 --> 07:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
value the hardworking Granite Staters
 
07:08:18.190 --> 07:08:18.200 align:start position:0%
who keep our state moving forward we
 
07:08:19.830 --> 07:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
understand that they are the backbone of
 
07:08:22.110 --> 07:08:22.120 align:start position:0%
our economy and without them it would
 
07:08:25.388 --> 07:08:25.398 align:start position:0%
come to a grinding halt in my two terms
 
07:08:27.270 --> 07:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
on the executive Council I have
 
07:08:29.430 --> 07:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
represented hundreds of thousands of
 
07:08:32.150 --> 07:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
hardworking families across eight of our
 
07:08:34.830 --> 07:08:34.840 align:start position:0%
10 counties from firefighters to
 
07:08:36.830 --> 07:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
fishermen to teachers small business
 
07:08:38.910 --> 07:08:38.920 align:start position:0%
owners from north to south and east and
 
07:08:41.788 --> 07:08:41.798 align:start position:0%
west in small towns and big cities the
 
07:08:45.270 --> 07:08:45.280 align:start position:0%
people of our state support workers and
 
07:08:47.270 --> 07:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
their neighbors and their ability to
 
07:08:50.830 --> 07:08:50.840 align:start position:0%
collectively bargain it is critical that
 
07:08:53.310 --> 07:08:53.320 align:start position:0%
every employee in the state of New
 
07:08:55.548 --> 07:08:55.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is able to work in safe
 
07:08:58.510 --> 07:08:58.520 align:start position:0%
working conditions this legislation
 
07:09:01.590 --> 07:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
undermines that it is critical that
 
07:09:04.910 --> 07:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
every employee has good wages and good
 
07:09:07.830 --> 07:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
benefits can access quality affordable
 
07:09:10.788 --> 07:09:10.798 align:start position:0%
health care the legislation diminishes
 
07:09:13.788 --> 07:09:13.798 align:start position:0%
workers Collective power to secure those
 
07:09:16.388 --> 07:09:16.398 align:start position:0%
benefits it is harmful to Working
 
07:09:19.510 --> 07:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
Families and to our communities right to
 
07:09:22.388 --> 07:09:22.398 align:start position:0%
work is wrong for new New Hampshire and
 
07:09:25.150 --> 07:09:25.160 align:start position:0%
again I urge each of you to vote in
 
07:09:28.110 --> 07:09:28.120 align:start position:0%

next I would call Joe marusi
 
07:09:45.670 --> 07:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
representing himself in opposition to
 
07:09:48.868 --> 07:09:48.878 align:start position:0%
the bill followed by Blaine Hansen John
 
07:09:53.510 --> 07:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:55.150 --> 07:09:55.160 align:start position:0%
chairperson committee thank you for the
 
07:09:56.990 --> 07:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
time my name's Joseph
 
07:10:00.190 --> 07:10:00.200 align:start position:0%
morazzi I live in New Hampshire uh I'm a
 
07:10:02.270 --> 07:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
republican a lot of people before me
 
07:10:04.510 --> 07:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
have gone against this I agree I go
 
07:10:06.270 --> 07:10:06.280 align:start position:0%
against it as well I just have one
 
07:10:08.708 --> 07:10:08.718 align:start position:0%
question seeing is this is Private
 
07:10:11.350 --> 07:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
Business unions private entity has
 
07:10:11.360 --> 07:10:13.110 align:start position:0%
Business unions private entity has
anyone

07:10:13.110 --> 07:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
07:10:14.910 --> 07:10:14.920 align:start position:0%
thought this is kind of out of the
 
07:10:16.310 --> 07:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
perview with the
 
07:10:19.070 --> 07:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
government it's died in New Hampshire I
 
07:10:20.628 --> 07:10:20.638 align:start position:0%
think this will be hopefully the 19th
 
07:10:20.638 --> 07:10:22.670 align:start position:0%
think this will be hopefully the 19th
time

07:10:22.670 --> 07:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
time
 
07:10:25.590 --> 07:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
and that wasn't a rhetorical
 
07:10:29.310 --> 07:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
question to you guys has anyone thought
 
07:10:31.590 --> 07:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
this is just a waste of time why are we
 
07:10:33.110 --> 07:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
hearing this
 
07:10:36.590 --> 07:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
again it's clearly something we don't
 
07:10:38.910 --> 07:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
want and there are no sponsors of the
 
07:10:42.830 --> 07:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
bill on this committee so uh someone if
 
07:10:44.590 --> 07:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
if that's your full testimony maybe
 
07:10:46.948 --> 07:10:46.958 align:start position:0%
someone wants to respond and I'll allow
 
07:10:52.388 --> 07:10:52.398 align:start position:0%
that but uh I'll just say that I I agree
 
07:10:54.388 --> 07:10:54.398 align:start position:0%
with you I think it's a waste of time
 
07:10:57.310 --> 07:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
and yet I do enjoy seeing all the me my
 
07:10:59.510 --> 07:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
brothers and sisters from labor is
 
07:11:02.190 --> 07:11:02.200 align:start position:0%

07:11:52.270 --> 07:11:52.280 align:start position:0%
we're treated to another Right to Work
 
07:11:55.070 --> 07:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
fight um there's plenty of stuff you
 
07:11:57.948 --> 07:11:57.958 align:start position:0%
folks uh should be doing instead of
 
07:12:01.388 --> 07:12:01.398 align:start position:0%
belaboring this again and again um we
 
07:12:05.030 --> 07:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
have an aging State um we suffer from
 
07:12:08.310 --> 07:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
brain drain um our cost of living is
 
07:12:11.868 --> 07:12:11.878 align:start position:0%
ridiculous and there's not enough
 
07:12:14.150 --> 07:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
careers in this state to sustain the
 
07:12:17.150 --> 07:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
population there's plenty of jobs but
 
07:12:18.628 --> 07:12:18.638 align:start position:0%
nothing where you can buy a house and
 
07:12:22.388 --> 07:12:22.398 align:start position:0%
support a family and that's a problem um
 
07:12:25.830 --> 07:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
so continuing the race to the Bottom by
 
07:12:28.670 --> 07:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
enacting right to work which as other
 
07:12:31.590 --> 07:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
people have said um is just anti-labor
 
07:12:34.670 --> 07:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
legislation it's um union busting at its
 
07:12:38.030 --> 07:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
best um and it's a waste of time for the
 
07:12:42.830 --> 07:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
state um one thing I will say um there's
 
07:12:45.270 --> 07:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of Labor people in here um I've
 
07:12:48.430 --> 07:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
talked to all of them um at one time or
 
07:12:50.350 --> 07:12:50.360 align:start position:0%
another I don't know if anybody in this
 
07:12:53.510 --> 07:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
room that is uh forced to pay their dues
 
07:12:56.150 --> 07:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
they all do it willingly and they like
 
07:12:59.948 --> 07:12:59.958 align:start position:0%
what they get for it um you guys need to
 
07:13:01.548 --> 07:13:01.558 align:start position:0%
do better you need to figure out why
 
07:13:04.310 --> 07:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
companies that have good jobs and pay
 
07:13:06.430 --> 07:13:06.440 align:start position:0%
good wages don't come to the state we
 
07:13:08.030 --> 07:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
know workman's comp in the state's
 
07:13:10.350 --> 07:13:10.360 align:start position:0%
ridiculous we know utility rates in the
 
07:13:14.030 --> 07:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
state are ridiculous find out why
 
07:13:16.350 --> 07:13:16.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts the state that some of you
 
07:13:19.430 --> 07:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
complain about having high taxes and
 
07:13:21.310 --> 07:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
high regulations and supposedly being
 
07:13:23.868 --> 07:13:23.878 align:start position:0%
not business friendly is full of Fortune
 
07:13:27.548 --> 07:13:27.558 align:start position:0%
500 companies and none of them come here
 
07:13:31.430 --> 07:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
55 miles difference between my house and
 
07:13:34.430 --> 07:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
where I work and I double my
 
07:13:37.708 --> 07:13:37.718 align:start position:0%
income that's a problem in this state
 
07:13:39.350 --> 07:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
and that's why young people leave and
 
07:13:41.110 --> 07:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
that's why the state keeps getting older
 
07:13:43.750 --> 07:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
and older and older and my last point is
 
07:13:46.628 --> 07:13:46.638 align:start position:0%
I noticed everybody in this room that is
 
07:13:48.070 --> 07:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
against this
 
07:13:51.110 --> 07:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
legislation is dressed like this and has
 
07:13:53.670 --> 07:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
work boots on everybody that supports
 
07:13:55.750 --> 07:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
this legislation is from out of state
 
07:13:59.750 --> 07:13:59.760 align:start position:0%

General Hospital and I want to tell you
 
07:17:02.910 --> 07:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
after 150 days in the hospital I don't I

I couldn't even guess what the bills
 
07:17:06.270 --> 07:17:06.280 align:start position:0%
would have been what it would have done
 
07:17:08.670 --> 07:17:08.680 align:start position:0%
to the next decade of my life if I even
 
07:17:11.030 --> 07:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
ever got out of that hole if it wasn't
 
07:17:13.990 --> 07:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
for gold star health care that's
 
07:17:16.990 --> 07:17:17.000 align:start position:0%
provided by collectively bargaining with
 
07:17:19.310 --> 07:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
the union and the the ability for the
 
07:17:22.070 --> 07:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
union to uh to do that now I I'm happy
 
07:17:24.628 --> 07:17:24.638 align:start position:0%

07:17:40.468 --> 07:17:40.478 align:start position:0%
political issue you know we heard about
 
07:17:43.388 --> 07:17:43.398 align:start position:0%
um the the third party in there which I
 
07:17:46.350 --> 07:17:46.360 align:start position:0%
think is so absurd that we're not also
 
07:17:48.270 --> 07:17:48.280 align:start position:0%

sisters uh testified earlier you know
 
07:19:13.708 --> 07:19:13.718 align:start position:0%
nights and weekends and weeks at a time
 
07:19:16.350 --> 07:19:16.360 align:start position:0%
to get the the requisite training hours
 
07:19:19.468 --> 07:19:19.478 align:start position:0%
in to complete the apprenticeship um but
 
07:19:21.270 --> 07:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the greatest
 
07:19:24.230 --> 07:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
components of uh unionism is the ability
 
07:19:27.590 --> 07:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
to upskill yourself you know I I think
 
07:19:29.468 --> 07:19:29.478 align:start position:0%
the narrative in the media has been in
 
07:19:31.468 --> 07:19:31.478 align:start position:0%
the last year that uh the current
 
07:19:33.628 --> 07:19:33.638 align:start position:0%
generation can't afford healthare can't
 
07:19:36.510 --> 07:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
afford College can't afford access to
 
07:19:38.230 --> 07:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
the skills and the training that are
 
07:19:40.270 --> 07:19:40.280 align:start position:0%
going to give them the ability to earn
 
07:19:43.030 --> 07:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
what's going to be required to succeed
 
07:19:45.310 --> 07:19:45.320 align:start position:0%
in the world that we see coming we're
 
07:19:48.910 --> 07:19:48.920 align:start position:0%
we're so heavily invested in our people
 
07:19:51.070 --> 07:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
and offering them the ability to get
 
07:19:52.910 --> 07:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
those Next Generation skills that are
 
07:19:56.388 --> 07:19:56.398 align:start position:0%
going to make them relevant Beyond today
 
07:19:59.270 --> 07:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
um you have to be seeing the fact that
 
07:20:01.030 --> 07:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
everything is changing and if you don't
 
07:20:03.628 --> 07:20:03.638 align:start position:0%
have organizations responsible employers
 
07:20:06.910 --> 07:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
that are committing to to put money into
 
07:20:09.310 --> 07:20:09.320 align:start position:0%
building their people that that that is
 
07:20:11.628 --> 07:20:11.638 align:start position:0%
a a zero sum game for uh for New
 
07:20:15.230 --> 07:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents like I love it here
 
07:20:17.468 --> 07:20:17.478 align:start position:0%
I I love the the winters the summer the
 
07:20:19.788 --> 07:20:19.798 align:start position:0%
weather the people I love it here and I
 
07:20:22.110 --> 07:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
want to see this be a place where people
 
07:20:25.110 --> 07:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
can keep coming I looked at the numbers
 
07:20:28.070 --> 07:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
on um on right to work in in other
 
07:20:31.628 --> 07:20:31.638 align:start position:0%
places and it's it's lower income it's
 
07:20:33.990 --> 07:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
mortality on construction sites it's
 
07:20:37.868 --> 07:20:37.878 align:start position:0%
less safety um it every metric that you
 
07:20:40.990 --> 07:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
could measure this by I is is lower I
 
07:20:43.468 --> 07:20:43.478 align:start position:0%
can't even understand why I'm back here
 
07:20:45.388 --> 07:20:45.398 align:start position:0%
again and this I think this is my third
 
07:20:47.628 --> 07:20:47.638 align:start position:0%
time now coming to talk to all of you
 
07:20:49.750 --> 07:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
about this it's ridiculous it's an
 
07:20:49.760 --> 07:20:50.830 align:start position:0%
about this it's ridiculous it's an
interfer

07:20:50.830 --> 07:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
interfer
 
07:20:53.468 --> 07:20:53.478 align:start position:0%
in private business we should be
 
07:20:55.910 --> 07:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
throwing this out on its heels it goes
 
07:20:58.750 --> 07:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
against what we are as New Hampshire

of the circuit court but I am here today
 
07:21:33.750 --> 07:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
as an old-fashioned traditional New
 
07:21:33.760 --> 07:21:35.030 align:start position:0%
as an old-fashioned traditional New
England

07:21:35.030 --> 07:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
England
 
07:21:37.548 --> 07:21:37.558 align:start position:0%
Republican this bill before us as we've
 
07:21:39.670 --> 07:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
heard several times comes up about every
 
07:21:42.270 --> 07:21:42.280 align:start position:0%
two years and gets shot down every two
 
07:21:45.030 --> 07:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
years including terms when my fellow
 
07:21:47.830 --> 07:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
Republicans had a significant majority
 
07:21:50.468 --> 07:21:50.478 align:start position:0%
in the house well there's so many bills
 
07:21:52.990 --> 07:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
that are filed every year that I don't
 
07:21:55.868 --> 07:21:55.878 align:start position:0%
pay attention to every one of them and I
 
07:21:58.510 --> 07:21:58.520 align:start position:0%
haven't paid attention to this one until
 
07:22:00.788 --> 07:22:00.798 align:start position:0%
this year and when I read it I found
 
07:22:03.110 --> 07:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
there are some things in it that Disturb
 
07:22:05.670 --> 07:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
This old-fashioned traditional New
 
07:22:08.750 --> 07:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
England Republican let me give you just
 
07:22:12.190 --> 07:22:12.200 align:start position:0%
two one old-fashioned traditional New
 
07:22:13.788 --> 07:22:13.798 align:start position:0%
England Republicans believe in
 
07:22:17.110 --> 07:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
supporting business while we do know
 
07:22:19.868 --> 07:22:19.878 align:start position:0%
that some business laws have their place
 
07:22:22.590 --> 07:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
that would regulate safety and prevent
 
07:22:25.350 --> 07:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
sexual harassment in general we don't
 
07:22:27.110 --> 07:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
like the government telling us how to
 
07:22:29.628 --> 07:22:29.638 align:start position:0%
run our businesses and this bill seeks
 
07:22:33.510 --> 07:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
to regulate private businesses if I own
 
07:22:35.750 --> 07:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
a business and I tell my employees they
 
07:22:39.750 --> 07:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
must now we to work pink bib overalls
 
07:22:42.270 --> 07:22:42.280 align:start position:0%
that is my right to do so if they don't
 
07:22:45.190 --> 07:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
like it I don't ow them owe them a job
 
07:22:47.670 --> 07:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
they can go to work elsewhere if the
 
07:22:50.430 --> 07:22:50.440 align:start position:0%
public thinks I'm crazy they can shock
 
07:22:53.070 --> 07:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
elsewhere or buy from other people you
 
07:22:56.750 --> 07:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
don't like Walmart go to Target I don't
 
07:22:58.788 --> 07:22:58.798 align:start position:0%
want the government's Fashion Police to
 
07:23:00.830 --> 07:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
say I can't require them to wear the
 
07:23:03.270 --> 07:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
uniform of my choice that is not
 
07:23:06.070 --> 07:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
old-fashioned traditional New England
 
07:23:08.990 --> 07:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
republicanism I want the minimum of
 
07:23:11.788 --> 07:23:11.798 align:start position:0%
State interference with how my business
 
07:23:14.510 --> 07:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
is run and this bill
 
07:23:17.350 --> 07:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
interferes secondly I come from a large
 
07:23:19.270 --> 07:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
family we've got at least one of just
 
07:23:22.070 --> 07:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
about every C category of person you can
 
07:23:25.590 --> 07:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
imagine in my family we've got a few who
 
07:23:29.030 --> 07:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
truly need government assistance they
 
07:23:30.990 --> 07:23:31.000 align:start position:0%
don't want a hand out and they're
 
07:23:33.430 --> 07:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
willing to do their fair share but they
 
07:23:36.868 --> 07:23:36.878 align:start position:0%
do need a hand up and I don't begrudge
 
07:23:39.788 --> 07:23:39.798 align:start position:0%
that but we also had a chisler in the
 
07:23:43.230 --> 07:23:43.240 align:start position:0%
family she could work but she wouldn't
 
07:23:45.830 --> 07:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
she wanted to sit back and get a check
 
07:23:47.628 --> 07:23:47.638 align:start position:0%
that comes out of all of our pockets and
 
07:23:51.030 --> 07:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
I do resent that some company owners
 
07:23:53.830 --> 07:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
like to have a union a good respectable
 
07:23:55.868 --> 07:23:55.878 align:start position:0%
Union because they'd rather deal with
 
07:23:58.510 --> 07:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
one Union bargaining team than a whole
 
07:24:00.628 --> 07:24:00.638 align:start position:0%
lot of individuals and I've been told
 
07:24:03.948 --> 07:24:03.958 align:start position:0%
that by numbers of company owners seems
 
07:24:08.070 --> 07:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
to me if the union negotiating team has
 
07:24:10.750 --> 07:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
spent time effort and money to represent
 
07:24:13.308 --> 07:24:13.318 align:start position:0%
the workers to ownership everybody who
 
07:24:15.430 --> 07:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
will benefit from the new contract
 
07:24:17.948 --> 07:24:17.958 align:start position:0%
should contribute to the costs incurred
 
07:24:21.230 --> 07:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
to get them a raise in pay and
 
07:24:24.230 --> 07:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
benefits it would be a chisler who would
 
07:24:26.868 --> 07:24:26.878 align:start position:0%
take the raise in income and benefits
 
07:24:32.430 --> 07:24:32.440 align:start position:0%
but not help pay the share that is fair
 
07:24:34.590 --> 07:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
now no one should be required to pay
 
07:24:37.910 --> 07:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
into a union political action committee
 
07:24:40.350 --> 07:24:40.360 align:start position:0%
including one that might support
 
07:24:43.830 --> 07:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
me I believe it's against the law anyway
 
07:24:45.308 --> 07:24:45.318 align:start position:0%
but we're not talking here about
 
07:24:46.868 --> 07:24:46.878 align:start position:0%
political action committees we're
 
07:24:49.910 --> 07:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
talking about better pay and benefits un
 
07:24:52.868 --> 07:24:52.878 align:start position:0%
unless someone's willing not to take the
 
07:24:55.468 --> 07:24:55.478 align:start position:0%
negotiated pay raise or donate it back
 
07:24:58.070 --> 07:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
to the company I think they need to pay
 
07:25:01.388 --> 07:25:01.398 align:start position:0%
their fair share I wonder also how many
 
07:25:03.308 --> 07:25:03.318 align:start position:0%
owners are willing to negotiate
 
07:25:05.350 --> 07:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
separately with a large number of
 
07:25:08.468 --> 07:25:08.478 align:start position:0%
individuals coming in one at a time well
 
07:25:10.670 --> 07:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
being a chisler taking benefits while
 
07:25:14.708 --> 07:25:14.718 align:start position:0%
not owning responsibilities is not to me
 
07:25:17.708 --> 07:25:17.718 align:start position:0%
old-fashioned traditional New England
 
07:25:20.150 --> 07:25:20.160 align:start position:0%
republicanism so Mr chairman and members
 
07:25:21.628 --> 07:25:21.638 align:start position:0%

07:25:23.868 --> 07:25:23.878 align:start position:0%
committee I wrote this before I heard

two hours of testimony I don't know why
 
07:25:28.070 --> 07:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
others may be opposed to this bill but
 
07:25:31.070 --> 07:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
here's why I am I'm an old-fashioned
 
07:25:33.150 --> 07:25:33.160 align:start position:0%
traditional New England Republican and
 
07:25:35.750 --> 07:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't sound like that to me
 
07:25:37.948 --> 07:25:37.958 align:start position:0%

I went on to college during which time I
 
07:27:58.468 --> 07:27:58.478 align:start position:0%
had two
 
07:28:00.708 --> 07:28:00.718 align:start position:0%
children life as you can imagine was
 
07:28:02.990 --> 07:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
quite difficult to balance I eventually
 
07:28:05.670 --> 07:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
divorced and remarried and had another
 
07:28:09.190 --> 07:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
child by 2008 I was having to work two
 
07:28:11.510 --> 07:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
jobs to barely pay our bills with little
 
07:28:14.948 --> 07:28:14.958 align:start position:0%
to no benefits or retirement options I
 
07:28:16.590 --> 07:28:16.600 align:start position:0%
had to apply for food stamps and
 
07:28:20.230 --> 07:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
financial assistance in May of 201 12 I
 
07:28:22.548 --> 07:28:22.558 align:start position:0%
lost my primary job then in August of
 
07:28:25.150 --> 07:28:25.160 align:start position:0%
2012 I lost my second job when Stop and
 
07:28:27.990 --> 07:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
Shop closed all their stores in New
 
07:28:30.350 --> 07:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at this time I decided to find
 
07:28:32.388 --> 07:28:32.398 align:start position:0%
a job that would provide better pay and
 
07:28:34.230 --> 07:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
benefits and allow me to actually be
 
07:28:36.990 --> 07:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
home to be a father to my children I
 
07:28:38.468 --> 07:28:38.478 align:start position:0%
worked through a temp agency while
 
07:28:40.150 --> 07:28:40.160 align:start position:0%
applying to the Carpenters Apprentice
 
07:28:43.030 --> 07:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
program I was accepted and began work on
 
07:28:48.150 --> 07:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:50.830 --> 07:28:50.840 align:start position:0%

07:28:53.830 --> 07:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
place uh since joining the Brotherhood I
 
07:28:56.670 --> 07:28:56.680 align:start position:0%
have begun a most rewarding career I am
 
07:28:58.430 --> 07:28:58.440 align:start position:0%

07:29:00.990 --> 07:29:01.000 align:start position:0%

is able to get the medical services they
 
07:29:07.750 --> 07:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
need if right to work is passed in the
 
07:29:09.308 --> 07:29:09.318 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire all these goals
 
07:29:11.030 --> 07:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
and achievements and dreams will be
 
07:29:12.788 --> 07:29:12.798 align:start position:0%
shortlived and
 
07:29:15.628 --> 07:29:15.638 align:start position:0%
vanish at its core right to work is an
 
07:29:18.308 --> 07:29:18.318 align:start position:0%
assault on unions inaccurately displayed
 
07:29:21.070 --> 07:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
as an initiative to enhance worker
 
07:29:23.548 --> 07:29:23.558 align:start position:0%
Freedom its true objective is to
 
07:29:26.190 --> 07:29:26.200 align:start position:0%
unions financially by eliminating the
 
07:29:28.788 --> 07:29:28.798 align:start position:0%
obligation for workers in a collective
 
07:29:30.708 --> 07:29:30.718 align:start position:0%
bargaining Union to share the cost
 
07:29:33.590 --> 07:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
associated with negotiation and
 
07:29:35.948 --> 07:29:35.958 align:start position:0%
representation it's no hidden fact that
 
07:29:37.830 --> 07:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
in other states where right to work was
 
07:29:40.230 --> 07:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
passed wages and benefits eventually
 
07:29:42.110 --> 07:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
dropped leaving many hardworking
 
07:29:44.070 --> 07:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
Americans fearing for their
 
07:29:47.430 --> 07:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
Futures not a single not a single state
 
07:29:49.590 --> 07:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
in the Northeast currently enforces a
 
07:29:50.670 --> 07:29:50.680 align:start position:0%
right to work
 
07:29:53.308 --> 07:29:53.318 align:start position:0%
law despite persistent Endeavors by
 
07:29:55.868 --> 07:29:55.878 align:start position:0%
special interest groups this legislation
 
07:29:59.110 --> 07:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
has consistently faced defeat in our
 
07:30:01.868 --> 07:30:01.878 align:start position:0%
state this pattern not only shows how
 
07:30:04.868 --> 07:30:04.878 align:start position:0%
wrong right to work is for New Hampshire
 
07:30:07.270 --> 07:30:07.280 align:start position:0%
but also the useless nature of investing
 
07:30:10.030 --> 07:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
time and resources in its
 
07:30:12.708 --> 07:30:12.718 align:start position:0%
Pursuit such resources could be better
 
07:30:14.788 --> 07:30:14.798 align:start position:0%
used to help with other more pressing
 
07:30:17.948 --> 07:30:17.958 align:start position:0%
issues such as opioids and improved
 
07:30:20.308 --> 07:30:20.318 align:start position:0%
housing I ask you from the bottom of my
 
07:30:22.510 --> 07:30:22.520 align:start position:0%
heart to please consider my testimony
 
07:30:24.830 --> 07:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
and others along with the facts very
 
07:30:28.190 --> 07:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
carefully then vote no on House Bill

questions seeing none and at this point
 
07:30:43.910 --> 07:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
again there's still a lot of testimony
 
07:30:46.190 --> 07:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
to go and we're up against a limit in
 
07:30:49.190 --> 07:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
terms of the how staff able to support
 
07:30:53.510 --> 07:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
