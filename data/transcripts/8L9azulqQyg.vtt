Senate District 18 five Wards in the
 
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
city of Manchester in the town of
 
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
Litchfield um this was a a late bill
 
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
that Senator Bradley and I the Senate
 
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
President worked on together um he
 
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 align:start position:0%
unfortunately has another 10:00 hearing
 
00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 align:start position:0%
so we met in the elevator and um I hope
 
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
that I can do it justice um as probably
 
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
many of you are aware uh the legislative
 
00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee has released some
 
00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.390 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee has released some
advisory

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
advisory
 
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
opinions um regarding when someone
 
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
should recuse
 
00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
themselves the first opinion led to a
 
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 align:start position:0%
great deal of discussion amongst our
 
00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
members some concerns
 
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 align:start position:0%
about making sure that individuals had
 
00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
Clarity and
 
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
Direction uh about when they should
 
00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
recuse themselves from certain votes so
 
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
that led to some work with our Senate
 
00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 align:start position:0%
legal council to draft the bill that is
 
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
before you today
 
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
um it is our belief that recusal is
 
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
something that we should as legislators
 
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
take very seriously and consider when
 
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
we're looking at issues before us and
 
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
the potential impact they have on us as
 
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 align:start position:0%
individuals the language before you is
 
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
taken primarily from the IRS code which
 
00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 align:start position:0%
has certain Provisions um that I will
 
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
outline in just a moment about what
 
00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:34.439 align:start position:0%
substantial influences and I think
 
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
that's really one of the issues um we
 
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
can all come up with I'm sure some
 
00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 align:start position:0%
examples where something is really
 
00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 align:start position:0%
attenuated somebody is employed by a
 
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 align:start position:0%
company but really has no influence over
 
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
the decisions the company makes I mean
 
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
they may be somebody who is a custodian
 
00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
for a a major employer there may be
 
00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
someone who works in bill
 
00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 align:start position:0%
they have no influence over the decision
 
00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 align:start position:0%
making and I think what our focus is was
 
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
to really narrow down those instances
 
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
where someone has a truly substantial
 
00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
interest so I would call your attention
 
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
to um the paragraph begins on line 13
 
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
and then you will see it outlines three
 
00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 align:start position:0%
items starting on line
 
00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:25.759 align:start position:0%
16 um about what substantial interest is
 
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
one is that excuse me I'm Excuse me the
 
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
recusal the substantial interest portion
 
00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039 align:start position:0%
that I I just pointed you to uh you
 
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 align:start position:0%
would have to be someone it defines who
 
00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
that person is so somebody who's a
 
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
voting member of the governing body one
 
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 align:start position:0%
of the executives so the president chief
 
00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 align:start position:0%
officer Treasurer or Chief Financial
 
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 align:start position:0%
Officer someone who does have a lot of
 
00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 align:start position:0%
authority over the company the recusal
 
00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 align:start position:0%
portion is actually the paragraph before
 
00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
begins on line seven um and the
 
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 align:start position:0%
circumstances start with line n so
 
00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
recusal in a situation where somebody
 
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
receives Financial remuneration from the
 
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
organization so paid from the
 
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
organization holds a position to
 
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
exercise substantial influence over it
 
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
and the organization has Lobby testified
 
00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 align:start position:0%
or otherwise attempted to influence the
 
00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
outcome of legislation it's not an or
 
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
it's all three so you would have
 
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
to be receiving funds from the
 
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
organization you would have to be
 
00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:38.759 align:start position:0%
someone who substantially influences the
 
00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 align:start position:0%
organization and someone would have had
 
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 align:start position:0%
to have testified or lobbied so we
 
00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
believe the language is clear and very
 
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 align:start position:0%
significantly Narrows those instances
 
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
where a legislator should recuse
 
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
themselves from participation and
 
00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
legislation um so with that I would be
 
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any question questions
 
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
that you may have Mr chairman uh to the
 
00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
best of my ability thank you very much
 
00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:08.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for taking my
 
00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.070 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for taking my
question

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
Senator based on line
 
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 align:start position:0%
16 since I am the chairman of the board
 
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
of Selectmen for the town of
 
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280 align:start position:0%
Northumberland I wouldn't be able to
 
00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:25.639 align:start position:0%
vote on anything that pertains to
 
00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities because up on line
 
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
six six okay thank you uh the United
 
00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:36.919 align:start position:0%
States the state of New Hampshire
 
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
counties within the state but
 
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities aren't included in there
 
00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:45.319 align:start position:0%
and just because I'm a board member why
 
00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:48.039 align:start position:0%
should I be
 
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
disqualified yeah thank you for that
 
00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:51.800 align:start position:0%
question representative it is a good one
 
00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
because I think that applies to a number
 
00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:56.759 align:start position:0%
of people in our legislature I I will
 
00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479 align:start position:0%
get back to you with the specific
 
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
reference but I believe there is
 
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
actually a provision that exempts those
 
00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:07.720 align:start position:0%
from government and Municipal
 
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
organizations that is another part of
 
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
the chapter um the issue if I just may
 
00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:15.879 align:start position:0%
complete my answer part of the reason
 
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
this issue arose in the Senate is for
 
00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:20.199 align:start position:0%
example we have three members of the
 
00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
Senate that are employed by well two by
 
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:25.160 align:start position:0%
the university system one by the
 
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:27.560 align:start position:0%
community college system so the question
 
00:07:31.629 --> 00:07:31.639 align:start position:0%
came up would those members be precluded
 
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
from voting on the budget since the
 
00:07:38.589 --> 00:07:38.599 align:start position:0%
university system and others and there
 
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:41.560 align:start position:0%
was a legal determination made by our
 
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
Council which I believe was presented to
 
00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
the Senate Ethics Committee and I see
 
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
former Justice and representative Gordon
 
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
here who can who's chair of that
 
00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:53.240 align:start position:0%
committee who can explain um there is an
 
00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
exemption for those situations that
 
00:07:59.710 --> 00:07:59.720 align:start position:0%
already exists in the statute and if
 
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
that isn't clear from here once I give
 
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
you the site that's something that we
 
00:08:06.909 --> 00:08:06.919 align:start position:0%
certainly would want to
 
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
exempt sure I'm
 
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
sure so would you have objections if
 
00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:16.919 align:start position:0%
municipalities were added to line six
 
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
right after counties um I personally
 
00:08:23.149 --> 00:08:23.159 align:start position:0%
would not okay um but I would I'm
 
00:08:24.869 --> 00:08:24.879 align:start position:0%
speaking on my own behalf I would
 
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
obviously want to consult with the
 
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
Senate President as well as the prime
 
00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill great thank you
 
00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:32.190 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill great thank you
further

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:32.200 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
questions I have a couple sure um if you
 
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:38.360 align:start position:0%
don't mind not at all um you may or may
 
00:08:40.589 --> 00:08:40.599 align:start position:0%
not be aware uh this committee has been
 
00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:42.919 align:start position:0%
working or struggling with this for
 
00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:46.360 align:start position:0%
three years or so um and and one of the
 
00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
things that we started coming to the
 
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
table with was the was the fundamental
 
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
question of whether we are trying to um
 
00:08:59.069 --> 00:08:59.079 align:start position:0%
provide guidance to the legislator who
 
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
Maybe sitting in division three in the
 
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
middle of a row and trying to figure out
 
00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
whether he has he or she has a problem
 
00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
um with the bill that's before us and
 
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
without having a their attorney on speed
 
00:09:15.389 --> 00:09:15.399 align:start position:0%
dial um having to answer whether they
 
00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:17.519 align:start position:0%
should be recusing themselves from that
 
00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
debate or not um and and judging that
 
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
against the idea of whether this is more
 
00:09:30.509 --> 00:09:30.519 align:start position:0%
for the Ethics Committee
 
00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:33.519 align:start position:0%
to um judge
 
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
individual opinions such as the one that
 
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
you mentioned earlier with uh with the
 
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.190 align:start position:0%
you mentioned earlier with uh with the
three

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
instructors um we're not we we kind of
 
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
come down on both sides of that issue
 
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
whether whether this is for the
 
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
legislator to to guide them or whether
 
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
it is for punitive purposes or or
 
00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
judgmental purposes so that's where we
 
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
started I guess my first question is do
 
00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:07.519 align:start position:0%
you feel that this legislation proposed
 
00:10:11.389 --> 00:10:11.399 align:start position:0%
legislation puts us in a better category
 
00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:14.200 align:start position:0%
with either of those one or the
 
00:10:16.829 --> 00:10:16.839 align:start position:0%
other thank you representative Hill for
 
00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:19.640 align:start position:0%
the question I I think it does a bit of
 
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
both I think it provides clear guidance
 
00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
to the individual who is as you said
 
00:10:30.269 --> 00:10:30.279 align:start position:0%
confronted with an issue and is trying
 
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
to work through whether or not they
 
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
should specifically recuse and as I said
 
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
they'd have to meet all three criteria
 
00:10:41.949 --> 00:10:41.959 align:start position:0%
it's an and not an or um but I also
 
00:10:45.069 --> 00:10:45.079 align:start position:0%
think that the statute does not
 
00:10:45.079 --> 00:10:46.710 align:start position:0%
think that the statute does not
currently

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
provide um for the legislative Ethics
 
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
Committee to have very specific
 
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
statutory guidance as to when recusal is
 
00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
clear so I I I think it does both it's
 
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
not an effort to try
 
00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
to get people caught it's an effort to
 
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
try to better inform the individual
 
00:11:11.069 --> 00:11:11.079 align:start position:0%
legislator and to the extent the
 
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
committee is rendering opinions about
 
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
whether or not somebody may have
 
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
violated the law I think having
 
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
something in statute is better than
 
00:11:22.829 --> 00:11:22.839 align:start position:0%
simply relying upon um all of their
 
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
previous opinions and upon the
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
individual circumstances and as I said I
 
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
I do know that the chair of the
 
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
committee is here and I'm sure will'll
 
00:11:31.389 --> 00:11:31.399 align:start position:0%
entertain those questions for you as
 
00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:34.120 align:start position:0%
well and and we have questions for them
 
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
as well um beyond that
 
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
um I guess um where I'm uh well first of
 
00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:45.279 align:start position:0%
all do you would you know if um attorney
 
00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:49.519 align:start position:0%
Layman had uh went to the IRS
 
00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
regulations um primarily or as a as a
 
00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
second Source we in this committee we
 
00:11:59.790 --> 00:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
went and looked at and riew viewed what
 
00:12:02.509 --> 00:12:02.519 align:start position:0%
all of the other states do and how how
 
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:06.920 align:start position:0%
their wording is set up um I think I'm
 
00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:09.160 align:start position:0%
safe in saying we didn't even look at
 
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
what the IRS determines um so can you
 
00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:17.560 align:start position:0%
speak to why the IRS language was
 
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
preferable um actually I cannot speak
 
00:12:23.189 --> 00:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
for him um all I can tell you is that
 
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
that was one of the references he
 
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
indicated was used in developing helping
 
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
us to develop this legis
 
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
ation um I I think I'll have a
 
00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
conversation with with Rick later on
 
00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:39.160 align:start position:0%
then um I wondered if if the
 
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
conversation or the question of whether
 
00:12:45.389 --> 00:12:45.399 align:start position:0%
we would need to change any part of um
 
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
uh part two article 7 of The
 
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
Constitution where it talks about being
 
00:12:52.949 --> 00:12:52.959 align:start position:0%
of council do you is that anything that
 
00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
came up in the senate in any did not Mr
 
00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
chairman okay because I notice in I
 
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
think it's page to
 
00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:07.839 align:start position:0%
line we get to line 11 um where where
 
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
we're um tending to show no substantial
 
00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
influence we've included attorneys in
 
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
there um and it would seem to me that
 
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:21.160 align:start position:0%
would run counter to part two article 7
 
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:30.629 --> 00:13:30.639 align:start position:0%
council well
 
00:13:34.269 --> 00:13:34.279 align:start position:0%
I there are I think I would answer that
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
question in two ways um being of
 
00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
council the way the Constitution
 
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
represents is is different than it's a
 
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:47.480 align:start position:0%
term of art used for currently um
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
the position an attorney might hold
 
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:51.800 align:start position:0%
within a firm there are those that are
 
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
of councel that are not you know
 
00:13:56.269 --> 00:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
substantially influent but are
 
00:13:59.829 --> 00:13:59.839 align:start position:0%
affiliated with the firm um I also think
 
00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
with respect to attorneys um there are
 
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
as you know I'm sure well Mr chairman
 
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
having considered these issues before um
 
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
there are a number of other ethical
 
00:14:13.749 --> 00:14:13.759 align:start position:0%
issues um regarding an attorney's
 
00:14:15.629 --> 00:14:15.639 align:start position:0%
representation of their client and
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
further representation before the
 
00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:20.680 align:start position:0%
legislature so that's something we would
 
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
need to consider as well I I I don't
 
00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
think the Constitutional provision is
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
implicated here but certainly something
 
00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:29.320 align:start position:0%
we we did not consider and would be Happ
 
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
to work with the
 
00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
committee uh following up on that we it
 
00:14:37.389 --> 00:14:37.399 align:start position:0%
seems that the
 
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
legislation gears more towards the
 
00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
employer employee relationship um and
 
00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:47.720 align:start position:0%
and judging by the fact that the I think
 
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
the last four or five of the of the
 
00:14:52.189 --> 00:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
opinions that were rendered by the
 
00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:55.160 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee do Center in on that
 
00:14:57.189 --> 00:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
employer employee
 
00:14:59.590 --> 00:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
relationship um
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
did the senate or or in drafting this um
 
00:15:07.749 --> 00:15:07.759 align:start position:0%
did was the consideration for those
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
those ethical considerations that are
 
00:15:14.509 --> 00:15:14.519 align:start position:0%
occurring outside that relationship um
 
00:15:16.269 --> 00:15:16.279 align:start position:0%
was that something
 
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
that you you seem to have focused only
 
00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
on the employer or employee relationship
 
00:15:24.189 --> 00:15:24.199 align:start position:0%
um is the rest of it fine as far as
 
00:15:24.199 --> 00:15:25.269 align:start position:0%
um is the rest of it fine as far as
you're

00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
concerned well I think the rest of it if
 
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
you're referring to other professions I
 
00:15:31.309 --> 00:15:31.319 align:start position:0%
think you're referring to those that
 
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
provide service to an employer or to the
 
00:15:38.509 --> 00:15:38.519 align:start position:0%
organization as opposed to someone who
 
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
has direct authority over an individual
 
00:15:44.949 --> 00:15:44.959 align:start position:0%
um actually I would say that what we
 
00:15:46.749 --> 00:15:46.759 align:start position:0%
attempted to craft with the legislation
 
00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:49.759 align:start position:0%
is something that would be clear that
 
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
there are many employees of
 
00:15:54.189 --> 00:15:54.199 align:start position:0%
organizations that are not receiving
 
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
compensation aren't in a decision-making
 
00:15:58.629 --> 00:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
position and aren't directly lobbying
 
00:16:01.629 --> 00:16:01.639 align:start position:0%
that don't want to capture we only want
 
00:16:04.309 --> 00:16:04.319 align:start position:0%
we want to try to narrow it to those
 
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
that truly would self benefit from their
 
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
participation in the legislation and
 
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:13.480 align:start position:0%
that's you know maybe maybe not as clear
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
in the language as you know we see it
 
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
but that was what we were attempting to
 
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
do Mr chairman was to try to focus in on
 
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
those individuals that are truly
 
00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
substantially trying
 
00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:29.240 align:start position:0%
to influence legislation that that would
 
00:16:31.269 --> 00:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
then directly benefit
 
00:16:35.629 --> 00:16:35.639 align:start position:0%
themselves thank you further questions
 
00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:38.360 align:start position:0%
from seeing none thank you very much
 
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman we'll see you in a
 
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
few minutes I guess
 
00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
yeah uh chair would call um chairman
 
00:16:49.629 --> 00:16:49.639 align:start position:0%
Representative Bob
 
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
Lynn member of the Ethics
 
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:56.040 align:start position:0%

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:59.949 align:start position:0%
Committee supports the bill with
reservations

00:16:59.949 --> 00:16:59.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:02.440 align:start position:0%
so thank you good morning thank you Mr
 
00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:05.480 align:start position:0%
chair and members of the committee um as
 
00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:07.480 align:start position:0%
I indic as indicated on the note card I
 
00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:10.959 align:start position:0%
I do support the bill but I do have some
 
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
reservations and um one of the
 
00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:17.000 align:start position:0%
reservations I have and I I think it it
 
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
U goes to the question that was uh asked
 
00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:23.240 align:start position:0%
by of the previous witness
 
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
um I like I like the
 
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:31.400 align:start position:0%
restrictions that the three uh uh
 
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
restrictions that uh uh Define when a
 
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
legislator should recuse himself that is
 
00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
receives Financial re remuneration from
 
00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:43.480 align:start position:0%
an organization holds a position to
 
00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:45.400 align:start position:0%
exercise substantial influence over the
 
00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
Affairs of the organization and the
 
00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
organization has Lobby testified or
 
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise attempted to influence the
 
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
outcome of the official legislative
 
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
activity but my question is is sort of
 
00:17:59.310 --> 00:17:59.320 align:start position:0%
the the the opposite of of the question
 
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
that you raised in other
 
00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
words the I guess the question that I
 
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
have is if you have those three
 
00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:09.880 align:start position:0%
conditions which I think are good
 
00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:13.640 align:start position:0%
conditions then why would you exclude
 
00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:15.320 align:start position:0%
from the definition of
 
00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
organization the United States of
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
America the state of New Hampshire or a
 
00:18:21.789 --> 00:18:21.799 align:start position:0%
county and I guess what I'm thinking is
 
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
is this we I know and these are the
 
00:18:26.669 --> 00:18:26.679 align:start position:0%
because the advisory opinions are public
 
00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:30.200 align:start position:0%
records we issued uh two advisory
 
00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
opinions um that I was involved in one
 
00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:34.120 align:start position:0%
one and a third one that I was not
 
00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:36.200 align:start position:0%
involved in because I recused myself but
 
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:38.440 align:start position:0%
the two that that I was involved in we
 
00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
dealt with uh uh uh Senator Andis and
 
00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson and we said that their um
 
00:18:46.669 --> 00:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
the fact that they were employed by the
 
00:18:48.549 --> 00:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
university system in one instance and
 
00:18:50.669 --> 00:18:50.679 align:start position:0%
the community college system in another
 
00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
did not require them to recuse
 
00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
themselves uh but but I guess the the
 
00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:57.400 align:start position:0%
question i' have is
 
00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
suppose they they were only working as
 
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh I believe Senator inis is a professor
 
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
at the University of New Hampshire and
 
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh Senator uh Carson I believe is a
 
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
part-time uh instructor at the Comm I
 
00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
think the I think Nash Community College
 
00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
but one of the community colleges anyway
 
00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:17.480 align:start position:0%
but I I guess the question that it
 
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
seemed to me it would have made a big
 
00:19:23.549 --> 00:19:23.559 align:start position:0%
difference is suppose that instead of
 
00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:25.720 align:start position:0%
working instead of the position they
 
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
held they actually worked in the
 
00:19:30.029 --> 00:19:30.039 align:start position:0%
Chancellor's office or something like
 
00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:32.600 align:start position:0%
that and were and had some you know
 
00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:35.320 align:start position:0%
involvement in the positions that the
 
00:19:37.149 --> 00:19:37.159 align:start position:0%
University was going to take on matters
 
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
before the legislature I think our
 
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
outcome would have been you know that
 
00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
would have been an a much different
 
00:19:47.789 --> 00:19:47.799 align:start position:0%
situation and so you know I guess that I
 
00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:51.400 align:start position:0%
would say um that's there if you're
 
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
going to have the the requirements of
 
00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
being able to in uh exercise substantial
 
00:19:59.950 --> 00:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
influence over an organization
 
00:20:02.149 --> 00:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
then if you have that caveat why
 
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you
 
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:06.520 align:start position:0%
include employees of the state or the
 
00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:11.320 align:start position:0%
federal government or or the counties um
 
00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
so I you know I I would tend to say that
 
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
they that they should be covered um and
 
00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
and and you know to to give just to give
 
00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
an example I think which I I
 
00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
think would would kind of go to the
 
00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:29.480 align:start position:0%
question you you raised if
 
00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
if for
 
00:20:34.789 --> 00:20:34.799 align:start position:0%
example you are a selectman in the town
 
00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
and so you have you know you have a
 
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
substantial authority over what what
 
00:20:41.149 --> 00:20:41.159 align:start position:0%
kind of what position the town would
 
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
take and you receive compensation from
 
00:20:47.029 --> 00:20:47.039 align:start position:0%
the town and the town is going to Lobby
 
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
in favor of some particular particular
 
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
measure before the
 
00:20:54.909 --> 00:20:54.919 align:start position:0%
legislature I I guess the question that
 
00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
I would ask is why would why should the
 
00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:01.720 align:start position:0%
law say it's okay for you to do that
 
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:03.080 align:start position:0%
you're not you know you you don't have
 
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
to recuse yourself Bute and let's take
 
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
an I try to use a concrete example you
 
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
know the bill that was that we had quite
 
00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
a debate on the question of like what um
 
00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:17.080 align:start position:0%
whether um people who make substantial
 
00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:18.559 align:start position:0%
requests for information under the
 
00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:20.200 align:start position:0%
rights of no law do should they have to
 
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
pay for it I my my recollection is that
 
00:21:26.149 --> 00:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
many municipalities were thought that
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
was a good idea um and there were a lot
 
00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:30.200 align:start position:0%
of other people who thought it was a bad
 
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
idea but suppose that you know a
 
00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
particular municipality the selectman in
 
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
that municipality think it's a great you
 
00:21:40.269 --> 00:21:40.279 align:start position:0%
know we should be making people to pay
 
00:21:41.789 --> 00:21:41.799 align:start position:0%
uh making people pay for that so that it
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't the burden doesn't fall in the
 
00:21:47.149 --> 00:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
taxpayer um why should it be all right
 
00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:51.039 align:start position:0%
for a selectman who has taken that
 
00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:53.919 align:start position:0%
position and the um you know and
 
00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:55.559 align:start position:0%
receives comp let's assume they receive
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
compensation for being a selectman um to
 
00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:02.360 align:start position:0%
be able to to to vote on that but
 
00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
suppose suppose that somebody from the
 
00:22:07.789 --> 00:22:07.799 align:start position:0%
ACLU who you know who was very much
 
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
opposed to that legislation suppose we
 
00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:13.039 align:start position:0%
had somebody in a in a you know in a
 
00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
relatively high level position with the
 
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
ACLU who was also a
 
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
legislator this would prohibit that ACLU
 
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
member from from uh voting and it just
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
seems like there's a there's some
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
something of a disconnect there it it
 
00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:32.440 align:start position:0%
seems to me either either both should be
 
00:22:34.149 --> 00:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
prohib should be prohibited or both
 
00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:37.400 align:start position:0%
should be allowed but I I have you know
 
00:22:38.909 --> 00:22:38.919 align:start position:0%
it's I have some difficulty in
 
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
understanding why why you would draw
 
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
that distinction um now may you know
 
00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
maybe this is just a
 
00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
suggestion maybe an answer to that would
 
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
be to put some
 
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
compensation dollar limits in other
 
00:23:00.669 --> 00:23:00.679 align:start position:0%
words I suspect that uh most Selectmen
 
00:23:02.269 --> 00:23:02.279 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire are not
 
00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:04.360 align:start position:0%
receiving high dollar compensation for
 
00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:06.200 align:start position:0%
their services it would be it would be
 
00:23:09.669 --> 00:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
very uh surprising to me if they were so
 
00:23:13.549 --> 00:23:13.559 align:start position:0%
maybe it would be you know maybe one
 
00:23:17.789 --> 00:23:17.799 align:start position:0%
solution might be to say you know um a a
 
00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
cut off would be uh a a a a state
 
00:23:26.909 --> 00:23:26.919 align:start position:0%
federal or Municipal Employee who is not
 
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
earning more than
 
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
some amount of money you know some
 
00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
relatively low amount of money um and
 
00:23:36.149 --> 00:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
that would be you know that would be a
 
00:23:38.269 --> 00:23:38.279 align:start position:0%
basis for the distinction I I'm just I'm
 
00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:39.919 align:start position:0%
just throwing that out as a possibility
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that's necessarily the
 
00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
the right answer but it's something to
 
00:23:44.669 --> 00:23:44.679 align:start position:0%
think about
 
00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:49.240 align:start position:0%
anyway thank you repes good morning um
 
00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:51.640 align:start position:0%
good morning representative wall um you
 
00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:53.480 align:start position:0%
have a question thank you Mr chairman
 
00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:57.320 align:start position:0%
today and for being here um you
 
00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned selectman and not being paid
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
much but they are paid something and
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
Selectmen and communities have
 
00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
tremendous power and influence as to
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
what goes on wouldn't that be vitally
 
00:24:10.149 --> 00:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
important in terms of decisions that are
 
00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:14.360 align:start position:0%
made here yeah no I I mean I I agree I I
 
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:16.799 align:start position:0%
guess you know the
 
00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
the I I appreciate the the uh your
 
00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
colleague's concern about do we want to
 
00:24:27.549 --> 00:24:27.559 align:start position:0%
you know prohibit uh people who are are
 
00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
are selectman for example our school
 
00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
board members and also serve in the
 
00:24:33.149 --> 00:24:33.159 align:start position:0%
legislature do we want to kind of
 
00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:36.440 align:start position:0%
prohibit them from voting on things that
 
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
about which they have a lot of
 
00:24:40.149 --> 00:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
information and a lot of knowledge you
 
00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
know that's uh that that is the that
 
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
really is the crucial question um and I
 
00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:46.710 align:start position:0%
really is the crucial question um and I
think

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
the you know the other thing that I that
 
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
that would that concerns me as I said
 
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
before it's just the idea of balance it
 
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I'm not sure that it it is a
 
00:25:02.029 --> 00:25:02.039 align:start position:0%
good idea to sort of generally
 
00:25:05.789 --> 00:25:05.799 align:start position:0%
exempt um state employees or federal
 
00:25:09.269 --> 00:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
employees or County Employees um but and
 
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
as you point out if we're and that
 
00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:13.640 align:start position:0%
that's another kind of
 
00:25:15.789 --> 00:25:15.799 align:start position:0%
uh you know distinction that I'm not
 
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
sure I understand why if you were going
 
00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.389 align:start position:0%
sure I understand why if you were going
to

00:25:19.389 --> 00:25:19.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:25:22.029 --> 00:25:22.039 align:start position:0%
exempt federal employees state employees
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
and County Employees then why not
 
00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:25.960 align:start position:0%
Municipal Employees I mean it just it
 
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't quite you know that that doesn't
 
00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
there's a disconnect there it seems to
 
00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:34.120 align:start position:0%
me um so anyway representative wall
 
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
follow Mr chairman thank you thank you
 
00:25:38.669 --> 00:25:38.679 align:start position:0%
for that explanation so I hear you
 
00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
saying it sort of depends on the
 
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
hierarchy of where you are in your
 
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
position or what influence you might
 
00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
have in the organization to which you
 
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
belong I I think that's I think that's
 
00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
right I mean I think I agree completely
 
00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:51.880 align:start position:0%
with Senator Susi if some you know if
 
00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
somebody is if if I'm you know if I work
 
00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
for Amazon but my position is I'm the
 
00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:01.240 align:start position:0%
you know I'm the chief custodian then I
 
00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
think and I'm also in the legislature I
 
00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
don't think that um it's very likely
 
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
that my um you know that I'm going to be
 
00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
influencing the positions of the
 
00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:13.480 align:start position:0%
organization I mean absent some you know
 
00:26:14.909 --> 00:26:14.919 align:start position:0%
unless there's some
 
00:26:17.149 --> 00:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
nefarious thing going on that they hired
 
00:26:19.789 --> 00:26:19.799 align:start position:0%
me specifically to be you know the
 
00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:21.640 align:start position:0%
really my real job is to be a lobbyist
 
00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:25.240 align:start position:0%
for the for them but I'm I'm acting as a
 
00:26:26.669 --> 00:26:26.679 align:start position:0%
you know as a chief custodian that's
 
00:26:29.389 --> 00:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
probably pretty unlikely final question
 
00:26:31.789 --> 00:26:31.799 align:start position:0%
followup thank you very much so what I
 
00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
hear you saying is really up to the
 
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
individual and the individual's position
 
00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:37.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of the issue that comes before
 
00:26:41.029 --> 00:26:41.039 align:start position:0%
the legislature to determine how much
 
00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:43.480 align:start position:0%
influence they might have on that par
 
00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:46.520 align:start position:0%
particular subject and therefore they
 
00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
would have to determine whether they
 
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
should recuse or not is that correct I
 
00:26:51.909 --> 00:26:51.919 align:start position:0%
no I think that's right I think a lot of
 
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
this um as I've discussed on numerous
 
00:26:55.789 --> 00:26:55.799 align:start position:0%
occasions with the chairman a lot of
 
00:26:59.230 --> 00:26:59.240 align:start position:0%
this does depend on um you know
 
00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
legislators exercising sort of
 
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
reasonable and good faith Judgment of
 
00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
you know and I think we I think we can't
 
00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
we can't get away from that that's
 
00:27:12.029 --> 00:27:12.039 align:start position:0%
that's a a crucial part of
 
00:27:14.269 --> 00:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
this thank you very
 
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
much representative
 
00:27:20.389 --> 00:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
Tierney thank you for taking my question
 
00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
representative okay there is a bill this
 
00:27:28.269 --> 00:27:28.279 align:start position:0%
afternoon coming up it's SB 553
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
has to do with the p dip accounts and
 
00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
that is the public deposit investment
 
00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
pool according to what's written here I
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
would not be allowed to say anything I
 
00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
would not be our Treasurer would not be
 
00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:48.440 align:start position:0%
allowed to say anything and yet we're
 
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
the ones in the town who would have the
 
00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
most ex uh knowledge of how those
 
00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
accounts work all right the only ones
 
00:27:58.590 --> 00:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
who could speak would would be the
 
00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:01.039 align:start position:0%
opposing side the ones who want the bill
 
00:28:06.909 --> 00:28:06.919 align:start position:0%
to pass would that be a fair way to run
 
00:28:08.789 --> 00:28:08.799 align:start position:0%
that hearing yeah no that's a that's a
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
good point I guess the only question I
 
00:28:12.149 --> 00:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
would have is I don't I don't know a lot
 
00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
about that bill at least at this point
 
00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
but the only question I would have is is
 
00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
the for example has your town taken a
 
00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
position on on this you know what I'm
 
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
saying is that is that or is that
 
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
something that was just follow up
 
00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
I an answer to that uh basically yes the
 
00:28:33.269 --> 00:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
treasurer is opposed to it our count
 
00:28:35.389 --> 00:28:35.399 align:start position:0%
administrator is opposed to it and I'm
 
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
the chair of the board of Selectmen
 
00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
right uh I'm opposed to it it it's not
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
allowing us to make as much money as
 
00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
possible for the taxpayers so it's
 
00:28:47.389 --> 00:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
making us violate our fiduciary
 
00:28:49.549 --> 00:28:49.559 align:start position:0%
responsibility to the town right right
 
00:28:51.549 --> 00:28:51.559 align:start position:0%
no I I mean I I I see what you're saying
 
00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
I think I agree with you it's not you
 
00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
know you you you have to have some you
 
00:28:58.669 --> 00:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
have to have some balance I don't I
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
don't know exactly where the you know
 
00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:07.480 align:start position:0%
where the line should be um if you know
 
00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
the thing that would concern me is for
 
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
for example if the
 
00:29:15.509 --> 00:29:15.519 align:start position:0%
if you know suppose I think maybe this
 
00:29:17.389 --> 00:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
is a really unlikely situation but
 
00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
suppose that you know someone pretty
 
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
high up in your uh police department in
 
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
the town let's say I take the police
 
00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
department as an example but um was also
 
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
in the legislature and there was a bill
 
00:29:35.789 --> 00:29:35.799 align:start position:0%
um dealing
 
00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
with I don't know increasing uh pension
 
00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
benefits for for uh for police officers
 
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
um you know there I don't know if the
 
00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:49.039 align:start position:0%
and and if the you know if the town uh
 
00:29:51.389 --> 00:29:51.399 align:start position:0%
um took a position that this was a great
 
00:29:55.509 --> 00:29:55.519 align:start position:0%
idea um I don't know or or you know I
 
00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
don't know what the that there it seems
 
00:29:58.590 --> 00:29:58.600 align:start position:0%
to me it's a close
 
00:30:01.509 --> 00:30:01.519 align:start position:0%
closer uh question about whether the
 
00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
person should be voting on that um on on
 
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
that that's that's just an
 
00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:10.950 align:start position:0%
that that's that's just an
example

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:14.120 align:start position:0%
I you indicated earlier that we do we
 
00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
have had numerous conversations about
 
00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:19.960 align:start position:0%
this um and I'm and I want to ask you
 
00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
specifically about line six on page two
 
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
which um The Heading is facts and
 
00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:29.240 align:start position:0%
circumstances um it was our original
 
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
intention in this committee to create
 
00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
some kind of guidelin so that individual
 
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
employees would be able to make
 
00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:42.440 align:start position:0%
um legitimate decisions for themselves
 
00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:45.919 align:start position:0%
and decide whether they were on um the
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
correct side of this recusal issue or
 
00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:51.640 align:start position:0%
not it seems to me the more that we
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
delve into this and the more we discuss
 
00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
individual cases and the more we
 
00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
review the ACT ual um ethics opinions
 
00:31:03.669 --> 00:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
that have come forth from the Ethics
 
00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
Committee it seems that these facts and
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
circumstances are becoming more and more
 
00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
important and it almost it would seem
 
00:31:14.269 --> 00:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
that each individual four of the 400
 
00:31:16.549 --> 00:31:16.559 align:start position:0%
reps sitting in rep's Hall would need to
 
00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
have um a review of their individual
 
00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
facts and circumstances before they
 
00:31:26.029 --> 00:31:26.039 align:start position:0%
could be confident of of their actions
 
00:31:29.149 --> 00:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
and so I'm I guess my question for you
 
00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
is does this legislation coming forth
 
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:38.360 align:start position:0%
Senate coupled with your knowledge of
 
00:31:40.629 --> 00:31:40.639 align:start position:0%
what the house passed on consent
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
calendar a couple weeks ago does this
 
00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:16.750 align:start position:0%
 
thank

00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:19.960 align:start position:0%

here pleasure to have you thank
 
00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
you uh my name is Ned Gordon I do chair
 
00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:48.200 align:start position:0%
the Ethics Committee I'm from
 
00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
Bristol a former
 
00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
legislator I um I support the bill I
 
00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
think it U clarifies the standard for
 
00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
recusal I think there are circumstances
 
00:33:04.509 --> 00:33:04.519 align:start position:0%
where it is obvious to most people
 
00:33:07.029 --> 00:33:07.039 align:start position:0%
including the public that recusal is
 
00:33:10.669 --> 00:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
appropriate and we should have at least
 
00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
in our statutory guidelines a standard
 
00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
for that and currently we don't if you
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
were to read the guidelines there is
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
nothing that mentions recusal at
 
00:33:24.149 --> 00:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
all but again there are circumstances
 
00:33:26.549 --> 00:33:26.559 align:start position:0%
where it appears has appeared obvious to
 
00:33:28.629 --> 00:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
the Ethics Committee and I think to many
 
00:33:31.269 --> 00:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
that recusal is is an appropriate
 
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
outcome and I think ultimately it was
 
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
contemplated in our constitution in the
 
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
1700s that a recusal that there are
 
00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
circumstances where it's not appropriate
 
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:46.559 align:start position:0%
for a legislator to act uh and to act as
 
00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
a legislator on certain matters when
 
00:33:51.789 --> 00:33:51.799 align:start position:0%
they have a personal
 
00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
involvement so uh I think this uh the
 
00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
standards that are set forth in this
 
00:34:01.389 --> 00:34:01.399 align:start position:0%
legislation pretty much mirror The
 
00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
Advisory opinions that we have been
 
00:34:06.549 --> 00:34:06.559 align:start position:0%
issuing particularly with regard to
 
00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
people receiving Financial
 
00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:11.320 align:start position:0%
remuneration and whether or not that
 
00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
organization has actively participated
 
00:34:19.149 --> 00:34:19.159 align:start position:0%
in uh influencing the outcome of
 
00:34:22.349 --> 00:34:22.359 align:start position:0%
legislation and in our in our more
 
00:34:24.669 --> 00:34:24.679 align:start position:0%
recent opinions particularly the last
 
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
opinions that we've had you'll see that
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
I think we've all also Incorporated what
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
is included here as sort of the third
 
00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:35.560 align:start position:0%
prong of the test and that is whether or
 
00:34:37.589 --> 00:34:37.599 align:start position:0%
not the person who is employed in the
 
00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
organization has substantial influence
 
00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:41.240 align:start position:0%
over the
 
00:34:43.869 --> 00:34:43.879 align:start position:0%
organization so I think it sets forth a
 
00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:45.399 align:start position:0%
standard I think it's consistent with
 
00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
what we've been doing and I think uh
 
00:34:52.589 --> 00:34:52.599 align:start position:0%
having it in statute makes a lot of
 
00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
sense I do have a comment with regard to
 
00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:58.270 align:start position:0%
sense I do have a comment with regard to
uh

00:34:58.270 --> 00:34:58.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
the I I fully agree with the portion of
 
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
the bill that says that these three
 
00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
criteria are deemed to be having
 
00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
substantial influence voting members of
 
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
the governing body presidents executive
 
00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:15.710 align:start position:0%
the governing body presidents executive
officers

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
officers
 
00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:17.960 align:start position:0%
treasurers but I think my my only
 
00:35:20.109 --> 00:35:20.119 align:start position:0%
concern is sort of a statutory thing and
 
00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
this comes from being a lawyer I think
 
00:35:24.109 --> 00:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
and a judge and that is if I were
 
00:35:26.069 --> 00:35:26.079 align:start position:0%
reading through the statutes and I read
 
00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
that first I might get the impression
 
00:35:30.589 --> 00:35:30.599 align:start position:0%
that that those are the only things that
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
have substantial
 
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
influence and then you go to the next
 
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
section and that talks about the facts
 
00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
and circumstances which constitute
 
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
substantial influence I might just
 
00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:43.400 align:start position:0%
reverse those and put the facts and
 
00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
circumstances of substantial influence
 
00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
first and then put persons having uh
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
persons having these particular roles
 
00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
are deemed to have substantial influence
 
00:35:57.910 --> 00:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
after that so there wouldn't be any
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
confusion with that that
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
regard with regard
 
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
to uh uh representative Lyn's
 
00:36:12.069 --> 00:36:12.079 align:start position:0%
concerns um I guess I share some of
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
those concerns because I believe that
 
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
there would be circumstances where
 
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.550 align:start position:0%
there would be circumstances where
people

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:17.560 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
do um uh are involved in governmental
 
00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:25.960 align:start position:0%
matters where I think if you were
 
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
looking at it as a member of the public
 
00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
he would say it would not be appropriate
 
00:36:34.349 --> 00:36:34.359 align:start position:0%
for them to vote on things so if the
 
00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:37.160 align:start position:0%
financial officer of the University
 
00:36:39.069 --> 00:36:39.079 align:start position:0%
system was a
 
00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
legislator and was involved in
 
00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:43.960 align:start position:0%
developing the budget for the University
 
00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
system and promoting it here I don't
 
00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
think they should be voting on it so um
 
00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
but if I was a selectman and I'm just
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
one of 250 towns in the state that feels
 
00:36:58.430 --> 00:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
a particular way
 
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:01.480 align:start position:0%
I really don't think that that would
 
00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:05.720 align:start position:0%
disqualify you from having an opinion as
 
00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
to whether a lot legislation should be
 
00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:13.240 align:start position:0%
passed or not passed but that's my I I
 
00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
have to say uh first of all that uh we
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
we talked about whether or not this is
 
00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
uh informative for legislators or
 
00:37:24.109 --> 00:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
whether it's intended to be punitive I
 
00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
can tell you that the Ethics Committee
 
00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't View itself is punitive in the
 
00:37:34.069 --> 00:37:34.079 align:start position:0%
lease um it rules on complaints and when
 
00:37:36.309 --> 00:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate we'll act on complaints
 
00:37:38.829 --> 00:37:38.839 align:start position:0%
but over the 30 years the ethics
 
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
committee's been here there have only
 
00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:43.720 align:start position:0%
been less than a handful of times when
 
00:37:46.109 --> 00:37:46.119 align:start position:0%
we've actually recommended punishment
 
00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:49.240 align:start position:0%
for legislators what we've done our very
 
00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:54.280 align:start position:0%
best to do is to inform legislators to
 
00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh make sure that uh things are done
 
00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.510 align:start position:0%
uh make sure that uh things are done
appropriately

00:37:58.510 --> 00:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
but once in a while you get a
 
00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:03.400 align:start position:0%
circumstance where you see it's just
 
00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
appropriate for somebody to recuse
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
themselves I mean and we see it the
 
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
public sees
 
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
it they if we had and you know these are
 
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
all you know public opinions the Doug
 
00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:16.520 align:start position:0%
lay opinion for example you know it
 
00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:19.240 align:start position:0%
pretty clear you know a circumstance you
 
00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:20.390 align:start position:0%
pretty clear you know a circumstance you
can't

00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
can't
 
00:38:23.109 --> 00:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
be an Essence lobbying and voting on the
 
00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
same same things um and more recent opin
 
00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:29.720 align:start position:0%
iions that have come out it's pretty
 
00:38:31.349 --> 00:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
obvious so it's pretty obvious of
 
00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:33.160 align:start position:0%
somebody but we're not going out there
 
00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:36.280 align:start position:0%
looking as a police force for people to
 
00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:37.670 align:start position:0%
looking as a police force for people to
punish

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
punish
 
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
for their bad behavior what we're trying
 
00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:43.880 align:start position:0%
to do as our very best is to educate and
 
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that uh when the public looks
 
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
at our legislature they see people who
 
00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
are ethical and who are uh doing their
 
00:38:56.589 --> 00:38:56.599 align:start position:0%
very best to be honest and to serve the
 
00:38:59.550 --> 00:38:59.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:01.349 --> 00:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
I think it was me that brought up the
 
00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:03.560 align:start position:0%
word uh punishment and I think it would
 
00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:05.240 align:start position:0%
have been better to say perhaps that it
 
00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
was a tool of adjudication it's a y it's
 
00:39:10.349 --> 00:39:10.359 align:start position:0%
whether it's
 
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
for in informational purposes for the
 
00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
legislature or whether it helps the
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee to determine um whether
 
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
there's a violation or not I think
 
00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:25.480 align:start position:0%
that's better um you have a minute or
 
00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:27.400 align:start position:0%
two for questions if there are any yep
 
00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
I'll do my best representative wall
 
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
who's also on
 
00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
the thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chairman for being here um
 
00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
you mentioned slackman and positions
 
00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
they may or may not take because uh
 
00:39:43.589 --> 00:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
we're one of over 200 towns in the OR
 
00:39:46.309 --> 00:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities in the state this may go
 
00:39:48.829 --> 00:39:48.839 align:start position:0%
back to when you were on Judiciary we
 
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
had um a lot of
 
00:39:53.589 --> 00:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
landlords who were on the Judiciary
 
00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
Committee and were taking or making
 
00:39:59.470 --> 00:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
votes um on certain issues that were the
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant things thinking it
 
00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
directly affected them would that be a
 
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
more sensitive situation than Selectmen
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
being parts of all the communities in
 
00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
the state I mean there are landlords all
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
over the state so how would this work
 
00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
with landlords I I think it's a similar
 
00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:20.200 align:start position:0%
circumstance that there are
 
00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
landlords ultimately will be affected by
 
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
legislation just like municipalities
 
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
will be affected by legislation but
 
00:40:30.829 --> 00:40:30.839 align:start position:0%
they're not being paid to be there to
 
00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:33.640 align:start position:0%
lobby and influence the legislation
 
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
itself and so I don't think that there's
 
00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
themselves further questions um I have
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
one or two um as far as the municipality
 
00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
we seem to have centered in on
 
00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
Selectmen but there are plenty of other
 
00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:56.440 align:start position:0%
um influencers within the within a
 
00:40:59.670 --> 00:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
municipality um you know Fire Chiefs
 
00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
police Chiefs um would would that with
 
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
those same circumstances that same
 
00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
discussion occur um we see often times a
 
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
a uniform um come through and testify on
 
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
on things um we have plenty of officers
 
00:41:22.589 --> 00:41:22.599 align:start position:0%
that are um legislators is it all going
 
00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:25.640 align:start position:0%
to fall down onto this facts and
 
00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
circumstances situation do you think
 
00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:30.750 align:start position:0%
circumstances situation do you think
yeah

00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
um well I don't think you you can make a
 
00:41:41.829 --> 00:41:41.839 align:start position:0%
decision just based upon a
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
generalization you know that's why you
 
00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:46.720 align:start position:0%
need the standard to apply to this
 
00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
particular case
 
00:41:53.309 --> 00:41:53.319 align:start position:0%
but just because you are a firefighter
 
00:41:56.109 --> 00:41:56.119 align:start position:0%
or a police officer and you take a
 
00:41:59.470 --> 00:41:59.480 align:start position:0%
position and in and of itself I don't
 
00:42:02.349 --> 00:42:02.359 align:start position:0%
think that's going to disqualify you
 
00:42:04.589 --> 00:42:04.599 align:start position:0%
what disqualifies you is if you're
 
00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
getting paid to do it
 
00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
basically so just to clarify if you're
 
00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
getting paid to testify you're saying
 
00:42:18.069 --> 00:42:18.079 align:start position:0%
rather than the outcome of the
 
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
legislation that you're testifying on
 
00:42:23.589 --> 00:42:23.599 align:start position:0%
pay isue right I mean if you're a
 
00:42:26.829 --> 00:42:26.839 align:start position:0%
firefighter and you feel strongly about
 
00:42:30.349 --> 00:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
some something and you come here I don't
 
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
think anybody is going to find that you
 
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
should be disqualified or that you had
 
00:42:41.109 --> 00:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
need to recuse but if you are paid to do
 
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
so then certainly you would be required
 
00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:45.349 align:start position:0%
so then certainly you would be required
to

00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:49.480 align:start position:0%
recuse um so a quick just clarification
 
00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:53.480 align:start position:0%
on that so if um if for example we have
 
00:42:57.390 --> 00:42:57.400 align:start position:0%
a a piece of legislation dealing with um
 
00:42:59.910 --> 00:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
with the retirement system and it would
 
00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:03.800 align:start position:0%
be clear that the firefighters um or any
 
00:43:07.549 --> 00:43:07.559 align:start position:0%
of group two or group one benefit from
 
00:43:07.559 --> 00:43:09.710 align:start position:0%
of group two or group one benefit from
that

00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:09.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
legislation where where are they in that
 
00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
in that scenario um where would would a
 
00:43:18.829 --> 00:43:18.839 align:start position:0%
a legislator who is also a firefighter
 
00:43:23.829 --> 00:43:23.839 align:start position:0%
Andor a policeman Andor um
 
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
County just being just being part of an
 
00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:29.240 align:start position:0%
organ organization wouldn't disqualify
 
00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
you but I think you'd have to apply the
 
00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
standard as to whether or not you were
 
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079 align:start position:0%
um had substantial influence over the
 
00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:45.160 align:start position:0%
effort to affect the legislation I
 
00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:50.200 align:start position:0%
see uh any further questions seeing none
 
00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'm sure this won't
 
00:43:54.349 --> 00:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
be the last conversation we have on the
 
00:43:58.349 --> 00:43:58.359 align:start position:0%
topic we've had many conversations have
 
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
um I have only one additional pink card
 
00:44:09.309 --> 00:44:09.319 align:start position:0%
um and that comes from Eric payer um
 
00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
Power I'm sorry um who supports the bill
 
00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
and is asking for two minutes from the
 
00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
school district governance
 
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
Association welcome to legislative
 
00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:23.000 align:start position:0%
Administration thank you committee
 
00:44:25.309 --> 00:44:25.319 align:start position:0%
members honorable chair my name is Eric
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
power I'm come from the town of Brook
 
00:44:29.309 --> 00:44:29.319 align:start position:0%
line I'm also the president of the
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
school district governance Association
 
00:44:32.109 --> 00:44:32.119 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire which is an all
 
00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
volunteer volunteer
 
00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
organization Statewide I just want to
 
00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
bring up a couple of points to consider
 
00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
um with this um legislation so I also
 
00:44:44.829 --> 00:44:44.839 align:start position:0%
previously schooled uh served on the
 
00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
school board Hollis Brookland
 
00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school board for three years
 
00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
and I got paid $450 a year but I was on
 
00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
the governing body of a school board so
 
00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
keep that in mind when you're looking at
 
00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:01.160 align:start position:0%
renum renumeration um I think that
 
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
select boards um I also serve on the
 
00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
planning board in Brooklyn uh I don't
 
00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:07.640 align:start position:0%
get paid for that right now but who
 
00:45:09.309 --> 00:45:09.319 align:start position:0%
knows that could change in the future
 
00:45:11.309 --> 00:45:11.319 align:start position:0%
but I think if people are serving in
 
00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:13.880 align:start position:0%
these in a school board and
 
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
municipality um and getting some sort of
 
00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
stipend and Selectmen tend to get more
 
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
than school board for whatever reason
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
but some upper limit maybe
 
00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:25.190 align:start position:0%
but some upper limit maybe
$5,000

00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
$5,000
 
00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
$10,000 that if you're get financial R
 
00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:29.240 align:start position:0%
renumeration you're not going to get
 
00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
rich from legislation the the select
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
board members aren't going to get rich
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
school board members aren't going to get
 
00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:37.160 align:start position:0%
rich so kind of consider that that just
 
00:45:39.549 --> 00:45:39.559 align:start position:0%
saying you get a dollar would would
 
00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:43.240 align:start position:0%
would fill that square so or my wife's
 
00:45:45.309 --> 00:45:45.319 align:start position:0%
of State Rep as you as some folks might
 
00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:47.960 align:start position:0%
know she would be disqualified from it
 
00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
because I got a dollar so we don't want
 
00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
to do that so we probably want to put
 
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
some um upper limit because if some sort
 
00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
of legislation passes
 
00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:01.160 align:start position:0%
um and you were involved you don't want
 
00:46:02.829 --> 00:46:02.839 align:start position:0%
to have to come back to it and you're
 
00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
not going to get rich by um being a
 
00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:07.240 align:start position:0%
select board member or a school board
 
00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:08.680 align:start position:0%
member if some sort of legislation
 
00:46:12.829 --> 00:46:12.839 align:start position:0%
passes so I would say that um also in uh
 
00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
you know line six talks we talked about
 
00:46:16.990 --> 00:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
you talked about potentially adding in
 
00:46:18.829 --> 00:46:18.839 align:start position:0%
uh municipalities but I would also maybe
 
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:20.200 align:start position:0%
you would want to use a term like
 
00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
political subdivision because that would
 
00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:25.000 align:start position:0%
cover school districts that would cover
 
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
Village districts that would cover
 
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities that would cover cities
 
00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
it would cover more in that uh aspect I
 
00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
think and that would be important um I
 
00:46:36.829 --> 00:46:36.839 align:start position:0%
do think it's really important that you
 
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
know you have the three conditions that
 
00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
have to be met and I think it needs to
 
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
be clear maybe it's clear enough in
 
00:46:43.589 --> 00:46:43.599 align:start position:0%
there because I wouldn't want my wife to
 
00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
be um having to recuse herself she's in
 
00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:49.240 align:start position:0%
the same household as me if I if those
 
00:46:51.069 --> 00:46:51.079 align:start position:0%
don't all meet so the number one
 
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be met because I don't get paid
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
by my organization um but we want to
 
00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
make sure that you keep that because I
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
think it's important for all three and I
 
00:46:59.230 --> 00:46:59.240 align:start position:0%
think the main thing you're trying to
 
00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
look at here is is the individual going
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
to enrich themselves or is their spouse
 
00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:06.040 align:start position:0%
or family member going to enrich
 
00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
themselves are they going to get some
 
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
Financial direct Financial benefit uh
 
00:47:13.109 --> 00:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
and I agree this is a very challenging
 
00:47:14.829 --> 00:47:14.839 align:start position:0%
area there's a lot of circumstances you
 
00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
got to look at but if you're putting
 
00:47:19.549 --> 00:47:19.559 align:start position:0%
sort of these top level uh guidelines
 
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
out there I think we you know I have a
 
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
lot of people in sgaa that are
 
00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:24.680 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard members and budget committee
 
00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
members some are paid most of them are
 
00:47:29.069 --> 00:47:29.079 align:start position:0%
paid some sort of stipend um we wouldn't
 
00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:31.400 align:start position:0%
want them to have be caught by this uh
 
00:47:33.549 --> 00:47:33.559 align:start position:0%
legislation so having some upper limit I
 
00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:36.280 align:start position:0%
think makes a lot of sense and um
 
00:47:38.829 --> 00:47:38.839 align:start position:0%
otherwise I I support the bill I think
 
00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
it's a good thing to give some guidance
 
00:47:42.309 --> 00:47:42.319 align:start position:0%
to our legislators to know when to
 
00:47:44.829 --> 00:47:44.839 align:start position:0%
recuse themselves so thank you I'll take
 
00:47:44.839 --> 00:47:46.230 align:start position:0%
recuse themselves so thank you I'll take
any

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:49.400 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um further
 
00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
questions I have one
 
00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:55.240 align:start position:0%
um in in a lot of these conversations
 
00:47:58.630 --> 00:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
we've had um it talks about uh real or
 
00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
perceived conflict
 
00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
um you were the only member so far to
 
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
have spoken from the public um is is
 
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
there a perception um that there are
 
00:48:16.069 --> 00:48:16.079 align:start position:0%
there are um items that uh legislators
 
00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
need to be aware of from the purposes of
 
00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:21.640 align:start position:0%
conflicts for the for the sake of
 
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
conflicts I think as you know as a
 
00:48:25.349 --> 00:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
member of the public and looking at this
 
00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
I think you want to see how Direct is
 
00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
that benefit you know I think a
 
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
firefighter coming in to speak about
 
00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:37.160 align:start position:0%
group two or group one teacher coming in
 
00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:39.640 align:start position:0%
um I think that that's it's such a big
 
00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:41.480 align:start position:0%
population that they they they're
 
00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
entitled to and as some of your other
 
00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:45.640 align:start position:0%
members have said in the committee a lot
 
00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:47.480 align:start position:0%
of the folks that are speaking have
 
00:48:49.069 --> 00:48:49.079 align:start position:0%
subject matter expertise more than
 
00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
others so if you really want to as
 
00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
legislators make an informed decision I
 
00:48:53.870 --> 00:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
think you need to be able to take that
 
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
in and is that influence or not it's
 
00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
sort of like state employees are they
 
00:48:59.349 --> 00:48:59.359 align:start position:0%
allowed to take positions on bills while
 
00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:01.640 align:start position:0%
they're on duty or not but they are
 
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
subject matter experts so I think you
 
00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
have to balance that but I think you
 
00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
have to look at the circumstance that
 
00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:09.160 align:start position:0%
are you if you're if you're the
 
00:49:11.309 --> 00:49:11.319 align:start position:0%
treasurer of the University system and
 
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:13.839 align:start position:0%
you're then on finance committee the
 
00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:15.880 align:start position:0%
finance division two or three whichever
 
00:49:18.349 --> 00:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
one does that obviously that from a
 
00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
member of the public I would say why is
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
why are they on their setting their
 
00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
budget to get some more money but if
 
00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
it's a if it's it depends how direct the
 
00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
benefit is and how big the group is I
 
00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
think is the big from a member of the
 
00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:31.480 align:start position:0%
public that's what would upset people
 
00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:33.720 align:start position:0%
more than anything um but we don't want
 
00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:36.280 align:start position:0%
to set legislation here that would catch
 
00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
people getting stipend from being able
 
00:49:41.829 --> 00:49:41.839 align:start position:0%
to help form uh legislation here up here
 
00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
whether they're and and or their their
 
00:49:45.789 --> 00:49:45.799 align:start position:0%
spouse you know they might not even be
 
00:49:47.069 --> 00:49:47.079 align:start position:0%
the person keep that in mind you have a
 
00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
family member that lives with you so you
 
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
want to keep that in mind but I think
 
00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:51.839 align:start position:0%
that's the main thing the public would
 
00:49:53.549 --> 00:49:53.559 align:start position:0%
be like to see is that people aren't
 
00:49:55.349 --> 00:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
enriching themselves by passing
 
00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
legislation I think that's kind of the
 
00:49:59.150 --> 00:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
bottom line here people get might get
 
00:50:01.349 --> 00:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
more power is that is that something
 
00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
people worry about I don't think people
 
00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
worry about that as much as somebody
 
00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:04.750 align:start position:0%
worry about that as much as somebody
getting

00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
getting
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
enriched thank you thank
 
00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
you further comments seeing none thank
 
00:50:13.829 --> 00:50:13.839 align:start position:0%
you very much I have no other pink cards
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
if there's anyone else in the audience
 
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
that would like to comment I'm perfectly
 
00:50:22.309 --> 00:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
happy to take a pink card seeing none I
 
00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:25.400 align:start position:0%

to certain historic commemorations as
 
00:51:58.190 --> 00:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
you will see the uh bill has two parts
 
00:52:01.630 --> 00:52:01.640 align:start position:0%
um one is as is customary as I explained
 
00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh to direct that the joint legislative
 
00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
historical committee accept a uh
 
00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
portrait of U former Senator Martha poer

Commission if you don't
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
mind and I will speak about that as as
 
00:52:34.789 --> 00:52:34.799 align:start position:0%
well um so as to the uh uh first part um
 
00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:36.640 align:start position:0%
I will say we have other member of The
 
00:52:38.309 --> 00:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
Joint legislative historical committee
 
00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
here um we've made an effort over many
 
00:52:42.829 --> 00:52:42.839 align:start position:0%
years to curate forits to represent
 
00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
people have made contributions to the
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
state you see the results all around uh
 
00:52:50.549 --> 00:52:50.559 align:start position:0%
the halls and um is brought forward a
 
00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:53.240 align:start position:0%
proposal to include a portrait of the
 
00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
former Senator Marth Clark um
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
and such a portrait was already
 
00:53:01.150 --> 00:53:01.160 align:start position:0%
commissioned we have it and uh so we'd
 
00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
like to have this legislation to direct
 
00:53:05.309 --> 00:53:05.319 align:start position:0%
the historical committee to accept the
 
00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
gift and to find a place for it on our
 
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
state house walls uh let me note as well
 
00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:12.040 align:start position:0%
that the committee has made major
 
00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
efforts over the last several years to
 
00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:15.640 align:start position:0%
kind of rationalize and organize the
 
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
portrait collection throughout the halls
 
00:53:21.150 --> 00:53:21.160 align:start position:0%
of the uh of the state house um and to
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
move some things around and to deal with
 
00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
the governor's portraits coming flowing
 
00:53:27.349 --> 00:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
out of the governor's office as as the
 
00:53:29.549 --> 00:53:29.559 align:start position:0%
time is and and then accepting other
 
00:53:31.349 --> 00:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
other ones and doing some rearranging
 
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
bringing things down to the first four
 
00:53:36.670 --> 00:53:36.680 align:start position:0%
that ought to be on the uh first four um
 
00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
making clearer the designation of the
 
00:53:41.589 --> 00:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
Civil War area that the uh American
 
00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
revolutionary and War of 1812 area and
 
00:53:47.109 --> 00:53:47.119 align:start position:0%
so on and so forth and in that process
 
00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:49.960 align:start position:0%
it means that we have been able to um
 
00:53:52.109 --> 00:53:52.119 align:start position:0%
ensure that there is space available for
 
00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
subsequent fors in the uh in the future
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
um we will hear uh I think from others
 
00:54:00.589 --> 00:54:00.599 align:start position:0%
about the extraordinary record of
 
00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
Senator fer Clark and I I just would
 
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
like to add to that um having worked
 
00:54:08.030 --> 00:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
with her for many years that you know
 
00:54:10.030 --> 00:54:10.040 align:start position:0%
it's hard to drive around the state
 
00:54:12.589 --> 00:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
without seeing things that have been the
 
00:54:14.670 --> 00:54:14.680 align:start position:0%
uh Touch of Senor Fuller Clark whether
 
00:54:16.990 --> 00:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
it's an environment elip the
 
00:54:19.309 --> 00:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
planetarium um and just countless
 
00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:22.200 align:start position:0%
countless bills uh as a House member and
 
00:54:24.910 --> 00:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
as a and a senate member and I think as
 
00:54:27.549 --> 00:54:27.559 align:start position:0%
the sponsorship of this bill reflects um
 
00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:30.040 align:start position:0%
she was an extraordinar bipartisan
 
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
legislator whether she was in the house
 
00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
or the Senate and I think that was long
 
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
recognized about her and that's why the
 
00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:39.160 align:start position:0%
sponsorship you will see uh reflects
 
00:54:42.589 --> 00:54:42.599 align:start position:0%
that as well so just to summarize on
 
00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
that um this is the usual form that we
 
00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
do um the state does not ever does not
 
00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
pay for portraits whether it's the
 
00:54:52.309 --> 00:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
governor or not uh privately raised
 
00:54:55.230 --> 00:54:55.240 align:start position:0%
funds create the the portrait and then
 
00:54:58.109 --> 00:54:58.119 align:start position:0%
um we need to have a bill that uh
 
00:55:01.069 --> 00:55:01.079 align:start position:0%
instructs the uh joint legislative
 
00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
historical committee to accept the the
 
00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
portrait and find a place for it now the
 
00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:10.400 align:start position:0%

know these anniversaries keep coming up
 
00:55:24.029 --> 00:55:24.039 align:start position:0%
don't they we did the the bicentennial
 
00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
of the state house we had the Civil War
 
00:55:28.109 --> 00:55:28.119 align:start position:0%
um and you know this is just an
 
00:55:30.190 --> 00:55:30.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us to celebrate New
 
00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire history um and uh about 20 no
 
00:55:36.549 --> 00:55:36.559 align:start position:0%
no I'm sorry about 12 years ago we
 
00:55:39.230 --> 00:55:39.240 align:start position:0%
recommenced the historic liquor bottle
 
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
program which had kind of been suspended
 
00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
for many years and reestablish that to
 
00:55:47.230 --> 00:55:47.240 align:start position:0%
about once a year have the Liquor
 
00:55:49.630 --> 00:55:49.640 align:start position:0%
Commission design uh a bottle and the
 
00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
funds that are raised from that have
 
00:55:54.190 --> 00:55:54.200 align:start position:0%
been going uh first uh they were
 
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
directed entirely to the hall of flat
 
00:55:58.390 --> 00:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
and the preservation of the Hall of
 
00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
flags and that great history that's
 
00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
represented there and we've done a lot
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
of work the you know new film on the
 
00:56:07.309 --> 00:56:07.319 align:start position:0%
glass new the new uh new stained glass
 
00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:10.200 align:start position:0%
over the the front door and um any kind
 
00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:11.720 align:start position:0%
of preservation and conservation that
 
00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
needs to be there and then we expanded
 
00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
um that that fund's use so that it can
 
00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
include other historical uses as as well
 
00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:22.720 align:start position:0%
um what we have done uh since the
 
00:56:27.029 --> 00:56:27.039 align:start position:0%
reestablishment of this is to direct the
 
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
um funds from a liquor bottle that is
 
00:56:33.069 --> 00:56:33.079 align:start position:0%
issued in relationship to a particular
 
00:56:36.549 --> 00:56:36.559 align:start position:0%
historic event to that events coffers we
 
00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
did that with the um Vice centenal of
 
00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
the state house so we had the bottles
 
00:56:42.349 --> 00:56:42.359 align:start position:0%
the couple bottles there that the
 
00:56:44.910 --> 00:56:44.920 align:start position:0%
revenue um and it can run from like 50
 
00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
to 880,000 potentially depending on the
 
00:56:49.589 --> 00:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
bottle depending on the marketing um and
 
00:56:52.109 --> 00:56:52.119 align:start position:0%
so now with the 250th anniversary uh
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
with the establishment of the C
 
00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
Centennial commission which against some
 
00:56:58.750 --> 00:56:58.760 align:start position:0%
are are on uh the
 
00:57:01.870 --> 00:57:01.880 align:start position:0%
commission uh affirmed the idea that if
 
00:57:03.549 --> 00:57:03.559 align:start position:0%
we could do that for them because they
 
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
had no funding uh from the state when
 
00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:07.400 align:start position:0%
the commission was established and need
 
00:57:09.390 --> 00:57:09.400 align:start position:0%
to raise their funds that this would be
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
a way to do that so the bill established
 
00:57:13.710 --> 00:57:13.720 align:start position:0%
a fund form and then directs the uh
 
00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
revenue from the bottles that are
 
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
created uh to commemorate the uh
 
00:57:21.390 --> 00:57:21.400 align:start position:0%
Declaration of Independence um that that
 
00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:22.520 align:start position:0%
those funds will come in we'll be able
 
00:57:25.789 --> 00:57:25.799 align:start position:0%
to use them um for the celebrations were
 
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
directed to do one is about um the uh
 
00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
Fort Constitution and there going big
 
00:57:33.589 --> 00:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
plans coming up for Fort Constitution uh
 
00:57:35.589 --> 00:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
and so this commission is supposed to
 
00:57:37.549 --> 00:57:37.559 align:start position:0%
work on that and we're also supposed to
 
00:57:40.589 --> 00:57:40.599 align:start position:0%
plan appropriate historical events at
 
00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
the at the state house and maybe else
 
00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
mostly the state house as we did with
 
00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
the bicentennial the the state house um
 
00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
for July 4th uh you know those days
 
00:57:56.270 --> 00:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
around July 4th of of 20 26 and um so
 
00:57:59.630 --> 00:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
that that's the two parts uh Mr chairman
 
00:58:02.190 --> 00:58:02.200 align:start position:0%
and i' be GL to take any questions thank
 
00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:04.880 align:start position:0%

00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
got a little picture of it if you'd like
 
00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:14.720 align:start position:0%
to see it's a beauty office yeah thank
 
00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
you um my question is um the historic
 
00:58:21.349 --> 00:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
and I for disclosure I'm Vice chair of
 
00:58:23.950 --> 00:58:23.960 align:start position:0%
that committee I'm also an assister Cal
 
00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
committee so bear with me um so I know
 
00:58:30.990 --> 00:58:31.000 align:start position:0%
where it's going thank you um so um
 
00:58:33.230 --> 00:58:33.240 align:start position:0%
regarding the portrait so that the
 
00:58:35.589 --> 00:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
historical committee can accept it and
 
00:58:37.549 --> 00:58:37.559 align:start position:0%
then decide what to do with it where to
 
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
hang it is that your intent yeah thank
 
00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
you for the question that's what we
 
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
always do great thank you along that
 
00:58:48.069 --> 00:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
line um I wanted to make sure or that
 
00:58:50.670 --> 00:58:50.680 align:start position:0%
you would be all right with the the line
 
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
in that in the bill itself speaks to the
 
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
state house um it's my understanding
 
00:58:58.510 --> 00:58:58.520 align:start position:0%
they may decide that it's more
 
00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate in the L rather than the
 
00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:03.720 align:start position:0%
state house so um that would be left up
 
00:59:04.990 --> 00:59:05.000 align:start position:0%
to them
 
00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
correct I think so um you know and thank
 
00:59:10.829 --> 00:59:10.839 align:start position:0%
you for your question because some of
 
00:59:12.069 --> 00:59:12.079 align:start position:0%
the things we've done the last few years
 
00:59:14.109 --> 00:59:14.119 align:start position:0%
you may notice that we um accepted some
 
00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
portraits uh that were at the over at
 
00:59:18.109 --> 00:59:18.119 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court right and we now have
 
00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:22.799 align:start position:0%
them in um room 100 and uh we have put
 
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
um some portraits over into the
 
00:59:26.670 --> 00:59:26.680 align:start position:0%
Legislative Office bu
 
00:59:28.990 --> 00:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
right um you know I I I think an
 
00:59:30.589 --> 00:59:30.599 align:start position:0%
argument might be made and we'll discuss
 
00:59:33.710 --> 00:59:33.720 align:start position:0%
this on the committee that given um her
 
00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:36.440 align:start position:0%
stature and the need in some ways to
 
00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
recognize um you know we have Donna side
 
00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
Tech hanging up there and and I think
 
00:59:44.109 --> 00:59:44.119 align:start position:0%
it's a a good thing for us to be able to
 
00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:46.240 align:start position:0%
have the public come in and and see the
 
00:59:47.789 --> 00:59:47.799 align:start position:0%
women who have contributed and we have
 
00:59:49.549 --> 00:59:49.559 align:start position:0%

once again I'm Donna sus representing
 
01:00:29.549 --> 01:00:29.559 align:start position:0%
Senate District 18 um I just wanted to
 
01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:31.480 align:start position:0%
highlight a couple things since my my
 
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
colleague really spoke very well to the
 
01:00:36.789 --> 01:00:36.799 align:start position:0%
magnitude of the legislation um I want
 
01:00:39.029 --> 01:00:39.039 align:start position:0%
to speak specifically to the portion
 
01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:40.760 align:start position:0%
about the portrait of Senator Fuller
 
01:00:42.670 --> 01:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
Clark which if you are interested in
 
01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
seeing the actual portrait is in my
 
01:00:46.589 --> 01:00:46.599 align:start position:0%
office in State House 120 you are
 
01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
welcome to come see it um she was first
 
01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
elected in 1990 to the house and served
 
01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
on the municipal and County government
 
01:00:55.990 --> 01:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
committee I know this because we were
 
01:00:57.710 --> 01:00:57.720 align:start position:0%
first elected together and served on
 
01:01:00.309 --> 01:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
that committee together um but Senator
 
01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
Fuller Clark's leadership in both the
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate um was truly
 
01:01:08.829 --> 01:01:08.839 align:start position:0%
distinguished she ultimately served in
 
01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
the position of Senator protm uh the
 
01:01:14.589 --> 01:01:14.599 align:start position:0%
assistant to the Senate President but
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
her body of work just in the legislature
 
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
alone is really quite extraordinary um
 
01:01:25.309 --> 01:01:25.319 align:start position:0%
she had 113 bills on which she was the
 
01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor that were signed into law
 
01:01:32.430 --> 01:01:32.440 align:start position:0%
623 bills that were signed into law that
 
01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:33.510 align:start position:0%
623 bills that were signed into law that
she

01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
she
 
01:01:37.150 --> 01:01:37.160 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored um but apart from the the
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
breath of legislation alone I think
 
01:01:42.990 --> 01:01:43.000 align:start position:0%
Senator Fuller Clark probably will when
 
01:01:45.069 --> 01:01:45.079 align:start position:0%
history books are written be known as a
 
01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
Distinguished Citizen uh because of the
 
01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:50.200 align:start position:0%
philanthropy of both her and her husband
 
01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
and because of the extraordinary impact
 
01:01:55.269 --> 01:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
she's had on the lives of people
 
01:01:57.829 --> 01:01:57.839 align:start position:0%
throughout the state of New Hampshire um
 
01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:00.200 align:start position:0%
through various positions um one of the
 
01:02:01.990 --> 01:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
things that my colleague didn't mention
 
01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:03.720 align:start position:0%
but that I think is really important for
 
01:02:06.349 --> 01:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
the record um the artist who painted the
 
01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:09.319 align:start position:0%
portrait is Ralph Stony Jacobs U Stony
 
01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
Jacobs is a resident of Whitefield New
 
01:02:16.549 --> 01:02:16.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and he has uh done numerous
 
01:02:20.109 --> 01:02:20.119 align:start position:0%
portraits um Senator Shaheen and Senator
 
01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
uh Excuse excuse me Senator Shaheen and
 
01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
Governor Lynch's portraits were done by
 
01:02:26.069 --> 01:02:26.079 align:start position:0%
Stony Jacobs there are portraits that
 
01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
hang throughout the United States um he
 
01:02:31.829 --> 01:02:31.839 align:start position:0%
is a a really renowned artist but as I
 
01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
said is a you know a resident of
 
01:02:35.789 --> 01:02:35.799 align:start position:0%
Whitefield New Hampshire so not only is
 
01:02:37.589 --> 01:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
the portrait of a local citizen but it
 
01:02:42.670 --> 01:02:42.680 align:start position:0%
was also uh painted by a local artist um
 
01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
and I would just in closing say right
 
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
now of the 213 portraits that hang in
 
01:02:51.349 --> 01:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
the state house and the complex nine of
 
01:02:54.269 --> 01:02:54.279 align:start position:0%
them are women um so I think it would be
 
01:02:56.829 --> 01:02:56.839 align:start position:0%
great to increase that percentage by
 
01:02:59.230 --> 01:02:59.240 align:start position:0%
accepting this additional portrait so
 
01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:01.240 align:start position:0%
with that I close my testimony and happy

those and I only heard that just during
 
01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:50.960 align:start position:0%

invited to but um we haven't gotten
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%

01:10:30.430 --> 01:10:30.440 align:start position:0%
to leave that one are we P do we do we
 
01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
like both of these like I don't just
 
01:10:35.350 --> 01:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
where are you guys at with with it in
 
01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:37.390 align:start position:0%
where are you guys at with with it in
terms

01:10:37.390 --> 01:10:37.400 align:start position:0%
terms
 
01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
of did we hold on to that bill I can't
 
01:10:42.310 --> 01:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
remember if we no we passed it on
 
01:10:45.870 --> 01:10:45.880 align:start position:0%
consent okay so the Senate has it okay
 
01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
we passed it um what was it 15 to zero I
 
01:10:50.189 --> 01:10:50.199 align:start position:0%
think we have one I couldn't remember if
 
01:10:52.990 --> 01:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
we had passed it or
 
01:10:56.270 --> 01:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
not this lays out some specific criteria
 
01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
which I think is really good that yeah
 
01:11:02.470 --> 01:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
exactly is it we'd have to look and see
 
01:11:05.950 --> 01:11:05.960 align:start position:0%
if it kind of like a combination so we
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
could pass
 
01:11:11.430 --> 01:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
both to the floor the house it's already
 
01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
to the Senate it's already to the Senate
 
01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so I don't know what their plans
 
01:11:16.750 --> 01:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
are with it maybe we could work it
 
01:11:18.510 --> 01:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
together in the committee of conference
 
01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:22.830 align:start position:0%
together in the committee of conference
or

01:11:22.830 --> 01:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
yeah oh he was talking about the ethics
 
01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:28.360 align:start position:0%
yeah the first
 
01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
bill the answer to
 
01:11:33.310 --> 01:11:33.320 align:start position:0%
that can you can you talk with the rich
 
01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
and see if he might know the answer yeah
 
01:11:37.669 --> 01:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
he's really smart and he knows a lot did
 
01:11:39.510 --> 01:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
you hear any of our conversation you can
 
01:11:41.310 --> 01:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
certainly sit at the microphone at least
 
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
we can all hear each other sorry sorry
 
01:11:45.669 --> 01:11:45.679 align:start position:0%
to put you on the spot but you're up on
 
01:11:47.629 --> 01:11:47.639 align:start position:0%
this stuff house bill is um for the
 
01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
Senate it's been assigned to the
 
01:11:51.550 --> 01:11:51.560 align:start position:0%
executive Department's Administration
 
01:11:53.189 --> 01:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
committee yeah and there there's no
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
hearing set yet yeah
 
01:11:59.229 --> 01:11:59.239 align:start position:0%
but in terms of how these two imagining
 
01:12:01.790 --> 01:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
we pass both of these would these two
 
01:12:04.030 --> 01:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
marry up pretty well or are we GNA have
 
01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
to choose one over the other you know
 
01:12:09.310 --> 01:12:09.320 align:start position:0%
what I mean this is very this is much
 
01:12:11.070 --> 01:12:11.080 align:start position:0%
more specific and much more narrow
 
01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
whereas the that our house bill was a
 
01:12:16.430 --> 01:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
little more broad you know it's how
 
01:12:19.709 --> 01:12:19.719 align:start position:0%
would these two meshes really what my
 
01:12:21.430 --> 01:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
question is and do we have to do
 
01:12:24.669 --> 01:12:24.679 align:start position:0%
anything with this Bild to mesh them
 
01:12:24.679 --> 01:12:26.149 align:start position:0%
anything with this Bild to mesh them
together

01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:12:28.870 --> 01:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
that well all sorts of things can happen
 
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
like that including Committees of
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
conference so um that's a policy
 
01:12:36.669 --> 01:12:36.679 align:start position:0%
decision I don't think I should comment
 
01:12:38.590 --> 01:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
on it it could happen what what is
 
01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
really good about this bill is that you
 
01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
know there are many moving Parts with
 
01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
our ethics Provisions there are two
 
01:12:47.870 --> 01:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
statutes there are the guidelines and
 
01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
there's 32 years of precedent in
 
01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
decisions and opinions and so if you
 
01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
make a lot of
 
01:12:59.070 --> 01:12:59.080 align:start position:0%
changes there can be unintended
 
01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
consequences in fact there will
 
01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
be and this does not doesn't do anything
 
01:13:08.229 --> 01:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
to affect other parts of our Provisions
 
01:13:11.390 --> 01:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
so the whole disclosure system stays in
 
01:13:14.350 --> 01:13:14.360 align:start position:0%
place and you know we've been educating
 
01:13:17.189 --> 01:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
legislators on how that works for all
 
01:13:22.750 --> 01:13:22.760 align:start position:0%
this time and so all this would do is at
 
01:13:26.629 --> 01:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
another level very nly defined for
 
01:13:28.950 --> 01:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
recusal and so for example on these
 
01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
examples of firefighters or retirement
 
01:13:36.070 --> 01:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
forth disclosure would still come into
 
01:13:42.310 --> 01:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
place in all those circumstances where
 
01:13:44.229 --> 01:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't rise to the level required
 
01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
for start at this you would so if you're
 
01:13:50.550 --> 01:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
in the retirement system and you've made
 
01:13:53.629 --> 01:13:53.639 align:start position:0%
that disclosure on the January form as
 
01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
we call it the beginning of the B
 
01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't have to do anything more in
 
01:13:59.950 --> 01:13:59.960 align:start position:0%
terms of disclosure unless it affects
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
you more than
 
01:14:03.870 --> 01:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
others then if you get to a level where
 
01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:06.760 align:start position:0%
you are involved as I understand this
 
01:14:09.310 --> 01:14:09.320 align:start position:0%
with being with
 
01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
the part of their time assistant that
 
01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
might do lobbying then that's when this
 
01:14:16.189 --> 01:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
will come into place and on the landlord
 
01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
tenant situation if you were part of the
 
01:14:21.310 --> 01:14:21.320 align:start position:0%
lobbying organization that the Real
 
01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
Estate Association or whatever they call
 
01:14:26.669 --> 01:14:26.679 align:start position:0%
it um then that would fall into the
 
01:14:28.669 --> 01:14:28.679 align:start position:0%
place here in terms of RS otherwise if
 
01:14:31.669 --> 01:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
you're a landlord you would file that
 
01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
disclosure in in the January filing the
 
01:14:35.950 --> 01:14:35.960 align:start position:0%
financial disclosure
 
01:14:38.550 --> 01:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
form so it leaves all of that into in
 
01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
place and and I I could Envision adding
 
01:14:43.590 --> 01:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
one part of the Declaration of intent
 
01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
form to have a box for I'm I'm required
 
01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:47.669 align:start position:0%
form to have a box for I'm I'm required
to

01:14:47.669 --> 01:14:47.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:14:49.629 --> 01:14:49.639 align:start position:0%
recuse that way it doesn't create any
 
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
more paperwork
 
01:14:53.550 --> 01:14:53.560 align:start position:0%
either and you need something like that
 
01:14:54.669 --> 01:14:54.679 align:start position:0%
on the house of senate floor if you're
 
01:14:56.189 --> 01:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
not going to you know you're not going
 
01:14:58.950 --> 01:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
to post that's amazing testimony you
 
01:15:01.470 --> 01:15:01.480 align:start position:0%
should type that up and and send it in
 
01:15:04.229 --> 01:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
as an opinion and before you go I'm
 
01:15:05.950 --> 01:15:05.960 align:start position:0%
sorry before you go on though back on
 
01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
the landlord tenant thing
 
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
disclosure um disclosure is enough um
 
01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
over the years we've heard that and we
 
01:15:16.629 --> 01:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
did have this on Judiciary we had a lot
 
01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
of landlords it seemed that they were
 
01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
not disclosing that they were landlords
 
01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:24.280 align:start position:0%
but through the Great Vine we heard what
 
01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
would be the process say so members know
 
01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
for disclosure it stays in place now
 
01:15:30.750 --> 01:15:30.760 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:15:35.229 --> 01:15:35.239 align:start position:0%
that if you're participating in verbal
 
01:15:38.709 --> 01:15:38.719 align:start position:0%
advocacy you're required currently to
 
01:15:42.110 --> 01:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
say before a committee or on the floor
 
01:15:45.430 --> 01:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
um I am a landlord there's no greater
 
01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
you know you don't have to go on and on
 
01:15:49.629 --> 01:15:49.639 align:start position:0%
about it I am a landlord that's the
 
01:15:51.950 --> 01:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
verbal disclosure and so the other
 
01:15:53.550 --> 01:15:53.560 align:start position:0%
disclosure should already have occurred
 
01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
on the financial disclosure form
 
01:15:58.990 --> 01:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
and if a bill is going to affect you
 
01:16:01.830 --> 01:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
more than other landlords then you will
 
01:16:04.669 --> 01:16:04.679 align:start position:0%
have to file the Declaration intent
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
form in terms of recusal you would
 
01:16:09.669 --> 01:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
probably have to be a member of the New
 
01:16:12.030 --> 01:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire realer Association which does
 
01:16:14.709 --> 01:16:14.719 align:start position:0%
lobbying you have to be paid by
 
01:16:16.950 --> 01:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
them so there'll be no change in terms
 
01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:18.310 align:start position:0%
them so there'll be no change in terms
of

01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
that okay and going to a represent
 
01:16:23.550 --> 01:16:23.560 align:start position:0%
attorney's concern about
 
01:16:26.470 --> 01:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
selectman my former concern as a former
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
selectman um if we had an issue this is
 
01:16:33.950 --> 01:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
just hypothetical years ago select milon
 
01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
communities were able to find out and
 
01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
they still do ahead of time who hasn't
 
01:16:41.229 --> 01:16:41.239 align:start position:0%
paid their taxes on their property and
 
01:16:45.070 --> 01:16:45.080 align:start position:0%
after three years um that can what is
 
01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:52.350 --> 01:16:52.360 align:start position:0%
now put a lean on it yeah and some
 
01:16:54.990 --> 01:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
Selectmen in some towns were buying
 
01:16:57.870 --> 01:16:57.880 align:start position:0%
those properties only for taxes becoming
 
01:16:59.750 --> 01:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
landlords or turning around and selling
 
01:17:03.189 --> 01:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
them and actually we heard today um the
 
01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
term was used um bear with me the term
 
01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:10.510 align:start position:0%
term was used um bear with me the term
was

01:17:10.510 --> 01:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
used people enriching themselves and
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
Selectmen in some towns were enriching
 
01:17:18.669 --> 01:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
themselves we now have a law that
 
01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
prevents them from doing that
 
01:17:25.149 --> 01:17:25.159 align:start position:0%
um I'm thinking if there are other bu
 
01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
that might come before the house such
 
01:17:33.390 --> 01:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
as oh I don't know placing a landfill
 
01:17:37.510 --> 01:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the town and a landlord
 
01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
excuse me a selectman I'm sorry a
 
01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
selectman wants it as far away from his
 
01:17:45.910 --> 01:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
property as he or she could get it uh
 
01:17:47.709 --> 01:17:47.719 align:start position:0%
would have some influence on that
 
01:17:47.719 --> 01:17:48.990 align:start position:0%
would have some influence on that
shouldn't

01:17:48.990 --> 01:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
shouldn't
 
01:17:53.430 --> 01:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
they then consider
 
01:17:55.629 --> 01:17:55.639 align:start position:0%
recusing this person as a legislator
 
01:17:59.229 --> 01:17:59.239 align:start position:0%
you're speaking about also uh well
 
01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
currently there would be a disclosure
 
01:18:06.189 --> 01:18:06.199 align:start position:0%
issue under this I it's the three-part
 
01:18:08.990 --> 01:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
requirement and so they would have to
 
01:18:12.629 --> 01:18:12.639 align:start position:0%
also be uh involved with um their
 
01:18:14.910 --> 01:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
organization lobbying testifying or
 
01:18:16.870 --> 01:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise attempting to influence the
 
01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:18.590 align:start position:0%
otherwise attempting to influence the
legislative

01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
01:18:21.470 --> 01:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
activity see this is this is where my
 
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
question comes in because I think in our
 
01:18:26.350 --> 01:18:26.360 align:start position:0%
other bill it puts it much closer to
 
01:18:28.110 --> 01:18:28.120 align:start position:0%
they would have to recuse whereas this
 
01:18:29.790 --> 01:18:29.800 align:start position:0%
one would be clear would you would it's
 
01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
all of the above you have to do one it's
 
01:18:34.590 --> 01:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
very narrow it's very narrow in scope
 
01:18:37.709 --> 01:18:37.719 align:start position:0%
and and where our other bill I think is
 
01:18:41.629 --> 01:18:41.639 align:start position:0%
much more uh Broad and potentially would
 
01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
have to refused so that's why I'm
 
01:18:44.669 --> 01:18:44.679 align:start position:0%
wondering how we're going to figure out
 
01:18:47.310 --> 01:18:47.320 align:start position:0%
the two bills measur question before we
 
01:18:50.149 --> 01:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
go on Jen um this is all really good
 
01:18:52.149 --> 01:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
discussion I don't know if it's being
 
01:18:54.990 --> 01:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
recorded or not if you stop recing
 
01:18:57.550 --> 01:18:57.560 align:start position:0%
because we' we've moved into a work
 
01:18:57.560 --> 01:19:04.070 align:start position:0%
because we' we've moved into a work
session

01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:07.310 --> 01:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
okay oh good because I was wondering I'm
 
01:19:08.990 --> 01:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
not taking notes but it's all really
 
01:19:11.910 --> 01:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
good information so I just I can go back
 
01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
later and type it up and put it in the
 
01:19:17.229 --> 01:19:17.239 align:start position:0%
notes if you want okay so we'll just say
 
01:19:20.390 --> 01:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
work session continued yeah that's good
 
01:19:22.470 --> 01:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
thank you go
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
ahead question okay it says on line nine
 
01:19:31.070 --> 01:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
receives uh Financial remuneration from
 
01:19:34.990 --> 01:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
the organization I get paid by the town
 
01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
$100 a meeting for 2400 bucks a year
 
01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
that's it holds a position to exercise
 
01:19:43.709 --> 01:19:43.719 align:start position:0%
substantial influence over the Affairs
 
01:19:45.310 --> 01:19:45.320 align:start position:0%
I'm chairman of the board of
 
01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
Selectmen now the organization has
 
01:19:50.149 --> 01:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
lobbied testified or otherwise attempted
 
01:19:52.390 --> 01:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
to influence the outcome of the official
 
01:19:54.669 --> 01:19:54.679 align:start position:0%
legislative activity the town of
 
01:19:56.510 --> 01:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
Northumberland belongs to the New
 
01:20:00.390 --> 01:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association which uh
 
01:20:04.270 --> 01:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
does Lobby did I just fit all three of
 
01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:06.110 align:start position:0%
does Lobby did I just fit all three of
those

01:20:06.110 --> 01:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
criteria maybe I think um it was um
 
01:20:11.510 --> 01:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn who suggested of
 
01:20:14.350 --> 01:20:14.360 align:start position:0%
putting a dollar amount in there perhaps
 
01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
too okay because the way it's written
 
01:20:20.590 --> 01:20:20.600 align:start position:0%
now since we belong to
 
01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
nhma I believe I fill all three of those
 
01:20:25.950 --> 01:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
up not to mention when you go down
 
01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
further I'm obviously a voting member of
 
01:20:30.590 --> 01:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
the governing body but are you an
 
01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
employee of the M Hampshire Municipal
 
01:20:36.189 --> 01:20:36.199 align:start position:0%
Association I think that is prop we're
 
01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
me we're a member but you personally no
 
01:20:42.669 --> 01:20:42.679 align:start position:0%
not personally the town is because it
 
01:20:44.270 --> 01:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
says a
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
legislator um receives Financial reation
 
01:20:49.669 --> 01:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
organization I think in that case
 
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
they're referring your example you'd be
 
01:20:55.229 --> 01:20:55.239 align:start position:0%
referring to the municipal associ as the
 
01:20:57.750 --> 01:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
organization which is doing the lobbying
 
01:21:00.350 --> 01:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
okay and I think that falls within the
 
01:21:03.189 --> 01:21:03.199 align:start position:0%
hierarchy that uh Representative Bob Lyn
 
01:21:04.709 --> 01:21:04.719 align:start position:0%
was talking about in terms of being an
 
01:21:07.270 --> 01:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
Adjunct professor as opposed to being a
 
01:21:10.669 --> 01:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
Chancellor for a university system um
 
01:21:16.030 --> 01:21:16.040 align:start position:0%
being a select member we you are um at
 
01:21:18.149 --> 01:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
sorry a lower level of that hierarchy
 
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
and you're only a member of the
 
01:21:21.990 --> 01:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
municipal Association again you're not
 
01:21:23.750 --> 01:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
paid by the municipal Association you're
 
01:21:26.709 --> 01:21:26.719 align:start position:0%
paid by your town right that so you're
 
01:21:31.030 --> 01:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
safe if you look at it one way it
 
01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
bus every single yeah I I find that
 
01:21:36.110 --> 01:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
interesting we might want to look at the
 
01:21:38.669 --> 01:21:38.679 align:start position:0%
wording of that um just for a little
 
01:21:40.750 --> 01:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
further clarification I think that makes
 
01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
sense that yeah no to look at this and
 
01:21:46.750 --> 01:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
and go for further clarification in in
 
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
terms of how we want this draft to yes
 
01:21:50.950 --> 01:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
Rich did you have something to add to
 
01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
that because you would have to be an
 
01:21:55.830 --> 01:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
employee either way I see this of the
 
01:21:59.310 --> 01:21:59.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.470 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:22:29.470 --> 01:22:29.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
you and you do vote for the budget you
 
01:22:34.430 --> 01:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
establish the budget and you vote for it
 
01:22:36.709 --> 01:22:36.719 align:start position:0%
and you vote for uh putting money into
 
01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:52.270 --> 01:22:52.280 align:start position:0%
okay you want us to go back up
 
01:22:55.390 --> 01:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
no so um
 
01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:55.860 align:start position:0%
no so um
we

01:22:55.860 --> 01:22:55.870 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:22:55.870 --> 01:22:57.629 align:start position:0%
we
[Music]

01:22:57.629 --> 01:22:57.639 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:22:59.910 --> 01:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
just asked so what do you guys think
 
01:23:01.550 --> 01:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
this and then
 
01:23:04.590 --> 01:23:04.600 align:start position:0%
we got some really good feedback from
 
01:23:07.669 --> 01:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
Rich Lambert which um so we I doubt that
 
01:23:09.910 --> 01:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
we confirmed that I'm gonna type this
 
01:23:14.189 --> 01:23:14.199 align:start position:0%
all up as a work session and the notes
 
01:23:16.910 --> 01:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
but I don't I'm gonna have to go back
 
01:23:19.110 --> 01:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah that's that's the benefit of
 
01:23:21.070 --> 01:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
the YouTube tape isn't it yes thank you
 
01:23:23.470 --> 01:23:23.480 align:start position:0%
very much representative wall for
 
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
stepping in um just so everyone's aware
 
01:23:29.910 --> 01:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
um we went down and testified on the in
 
01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
Senate Edna on the legislative youth
 
01:23:35.149 --> 01:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
advisory Council bill that they were
 
01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
going to exact they held off waiting for
 
01:23:40.830 --> 01:23:40.840 align:start position:0%
us so we kind of had
 
01:23:43.390 --> 01:23:43.400 align:start position:0%
to they didn't because in the middle of
 
01:23:49.709 --> 01:23:49.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:55.910 --> 01:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
so yeah I anyway I'm on I'm on tape um
 
01:24:01.950 --> 01:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
FYI so did we did um as far as the the
 
01:24:06.030 --> 01:24:06.040 align:start position:0%
605 Bill did we hear
 
01:24:09.709 --> 01:24:09.719 align:start position:0%
anything that the reason I I set up the
 
01:24:12.110 --> 01:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
work session after this um and I would
 
01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
have hoped there was a lot more people
 
01:24:17.430 --> 01:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
here but I guess what I'm looking for is
 
01:24:21.470 --> 01:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
are there things that you heard in that
 
01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
hearing that
 
01:24:27.550 --> 01:24:27.560 align:start position:0%
um makes us want to get additional
 
01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:29.310 align:start position:0%
um makes us want to get additional
information

01:24:29.310 --> 01:24:29.320 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:24:34.149 --> 01:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
Andor um look at different options for
 
01:24:38.750 --> 01:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
this um we have our very fine researcher
 
01:24:41.790 --> 01:24:41.800 align:start position:0%
here which is always helpful but in this
 
01:24:44.229 --> 01:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
particular case if there are things I
 
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
have no idea for example I have no idea
 
01:24:48.430 --> 01:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
what the
 
01:24:52.189 --> 01:24:52.199 align:start position:0%
IRS um language is that they referenced
 
01:24:54.669 --> 01:24:54.679 align:start position:0%
in here and and I don't think our
 
01:24:58.270 --> 01:24:58.280 align:start position:0%
researcher does either um I really
 
01:25:00.870 --> 01:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have even gone to the IRS to to
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
look for that I don't know why anyone
 
01:25:07.709 --> 01:25:07.719 align:start position:0%
would I don't know this is but that's
 
01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
why I wanted to find out if there were
 
01:25:13.189 --> 01:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
are things like that that we should look
 
01:25:17.109 --> 01:25:17.119 align:start position:0%
at before we go I also want to know just
 
01:25:20.270 --> 01:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
for a second I also want to know um and
 
01:25:23.149 --> 01:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
maybe this is a a Jennifer
 
01:25:25.149 --> 01:25:25.159 align:start position:0%
thing what what
 
01:25:28.629 --> 01:25:28.639 align:start position:0%
does our existing language that's in the
 
01:25:33.070 --> 01:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
Senate now how would that be affected by
 
01:25:37.149 --> 01:25:37.159 align:start position:0%
what came here I don't know that answer
 
01:25:40.270 --> 01:25:40.280 align:start position:0%
um so that's what I that's why I
 
01:25:42.270 --> 01:25:42.280 align:start position:0%
suggested we do this work session so
 
01:25:44.550 --> 01:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
that we kind of come to a an
 
01:25:46.830 --> 01:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
understanding so we all are un knowing
 
01:25:51.030 --> 01:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
what certain things are doing um but
 
01:25:53.629 --> 01:25:53.639 align:start position:0%
there's also no reason why we can't have
 
01:25:57.070 --> 01:25:57.080 align:start position:0%
another work session before we exact
 
01:26:00.750 --> 01:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
these two um my goal is to hang on to
 
01:26:03.550 --> 01:26:03.560 align:start position:0%
these things for a while so and let them
 
01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
mold I don't think it's a problem if if
 
01:26:09.910 --> 01:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
we my my question is can these work
 
01:26:11.629 --> 01:26:11.639 align:start position:0%
together because there're little this is
 
01:26:14.189 --> 01:26:14.199 align:start position:0%
much more narrow in scope it's very
 
01:26:16.590 --> 01:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
specific and all that and does this
 
01:26:19.350 --> 01:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
committee as um and I would say on
 
01:26:22.149 --> 01:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
consent sort of situation do we like one
 
01:26:23.709 --> 01:26:23.719 align:start position:0%
bill over the other and we shouldn't
 
01:26:25.390 --> 01:26:25.400 align:start position:0%
wait that long because if we don't like
 
01:26:26.990 --> 01:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
this and we like our bill well maybe we
 
01:26:28.510 --> 01:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
should kill hurry up and kill this thing
 
01:26:30.629 --> 01:26:30.639 align:start position:0%
and and then you leave it with the only
 
01:26:32.430 --> 01:26:32.440 align:start position:0%
the Senate to have our bill I know
 
01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit of politics but that
 
01:26:38.189 --> 01:26:38.199 align:start position:0%
that's the the body that we are in and
 
01:26:40.470 --> 01:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
if it's not though if we can get both of
 
01:26:42.669 --> 01:26:42.679 align:start position:0%
these sort of passing then maybe it's
 
01:26:44.350 --> 01:26:44.360 align:start position:0%
committee a conference then where we can
 
01:26:46.070 --> 01:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
figure out how we get it then then the
 
01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
pressure is off and we can work on it
 
01:26:49.629 --> 01:26:49.639 align:start position:0%
and that sort of thing so absolutely
 
01:26:52.189 --> 01:26:52.199 align:start position:0%
true I don't disagree with any of that
 
01:26:55.390 --> 01:26:55.400 align:start position:0%
thank you and um talking with
 
01:26:58.189 --> 01:26:58.199 align:start position:0%
representative TIY I we may need further
 
01:27:00.390 --> 01:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
clarification because he tell me if I'm
 
01:27:03.109 --> 01:27:03.119 align:start position:0%
wrong we talked about um those three
 
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
criteria and each one of them matches
 
01:27:07.229 --> 01:27:07.239 align:start position:0%
what he does as a select and I'm not
 
01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
inmore so it doesn't matter to me but um
 
01:27:12.629 --> 01:27:12.639 align:start position:0%
talked about person having substantial
 
01:27:15.870 --> 01:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
influence as a selectman and we talked a
 
01:27:17.790 --> 01:27:17.800 align:start position:0%
little bit about that wondered if there
 
01:27:19.470 --> 01:27:19.480 align:start position:0%
might need to be some clarification on
 
01:27:22.950 --> 01:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
the language just to be sure um that
 
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
select me or not affected and we did get
 
01:27:28.430 --> 01:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
clarification the fact that the
 
01:27:32.310 --> 01:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
selectman do pay into the New Hampshire
 
01:27:34.990 --> 01:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association but do not have a
 
01:27:37.270 --> 01:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
direct influence necessarily on what
 
01:27:42.229 --> 01:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
they decide um and it seems to fit in
 
01:27:46.229 --> 01:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
with the criteria that um I hope this is
 
01:27:49.510 --> 01:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
not being recorded um it
 
01:27:52.149 --> 01:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
seems okay you want to talk about it
 
01:27:52.159 --> 01:27:54.790 align:start position:0%
seems okay you want to talk about it
later

01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
later
 
01:27:57.750 --> 01:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
um just him with the criteria that um
 
01:27:59.870 --> 01:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
the hierarchy that represent Lynn talked
 
01:28:02.430 --> 01:28:02.440 align:start position:0%
about in terms of a professor an Adent
 
01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
Professor not having the same position
 
01:28:06.830 --> 01:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
and power of authority as the chancellor
 
01:28:09.629 --> 01:28:09.639 align:start position:0%
for University system a selectman has a
 
01:28:12.790 --> 01:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
power of authority at certain levels but
 
01:28:15.550 --> 01:28:15.560 align:start position:0%
uh with the municipal Association um
 
01:28:18.790 --> 01:28:18.800 align:start position:0%
only a membership of one of over 200
 
01:28:21.790 --> 01:28:21.800 align:start position:0%
communities or municipalities rather in
 
01:28:24.350 --> 01:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
the state so there's that difference but
 
01:28:26.669 --> 01:28:26.679 align:start position:0%
that we may need uh further
 
01:28:29.229 --> 01:28:29.239 align:start position:0%
clarification on language just so that
 
01:28:31.870 --> 01:28:31.880 align:start position:0%
others who aren't familiar with this uh
 
01:28:33.750 --> 01:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
would understand it
 
01:28:38.109 --> 01:28:38.119 align:start position:0%
better um let me ask if if this is of
 
01:28:40.830 --> 01:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
help to any of you because I'm I'm able
 
01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
to provide all of it if you would like
 
01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:45.149 align:start position:0%
to provide all of it if you would like
um

01:28:45.149 --> 01:28:45.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:49.189 --> 01:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
I I um bothered a number of people to
 
01:28:52.149 --> 01:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
provide me with pieces of information
 
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
one of which was the testimony that took
 
01:29:00.070 --> 01:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
place in the Senate on this bill um
 
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
there was some language there that is
 
01:29:06.109 --> 01:29:06.119 align:start position:0%
kind of helpful I think there was also
 
01:29:09.870 --> 01:29:09.880 align:start position:0%
the the information that came from the
 
01:29:12.990 --> 01:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
draft minutes of the Ethics Committee
 
01:29:15.709 --> 01:29:15.719 align:start position:0%
who talked about
 
01:29:18.629 --> 01:29:18.639 align:start position:0%
um let me just back up a second you
 
01:29:21.030 --> 01:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
realize this bill and I think she said
 
01:29:22.629 --> 01:29:22.639 align:start position:0%
it this
 
01:29:27.109 --> 01:29:27.119 align:start position:0%
bill um as came as a result of the
 
01:29:30.229 --> 01:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
opinion given to Senator Carson's
 
01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
request for an opinion right so that
 
01:29:37.870 --> 01:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
discussion of how they determined how
 
01:29:41.390 --> 01:29:41.400 align:start position:0%
the Ethics Committee came up with their
 
01:29:48.070 --> 01:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
reasoning steered this um this Duo of of
 
01:29:50.750 --> 01:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
Susi and Bradley to come up with this
 
01:29:53.870 --> 01:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
bill or they asked their Senate attorney
 
01:29:57.109 --> 01:29:57.119 align:start position:0%
to to do that so so there is some
 
01:29:59.470 --> 01:29:59.480 align:start position:0%
interesting conversation that went on
 
01:30:02.229 --> 01:30:02.239 align:start position:0%
they're not even sure and and this is
 
01:30:03.709 --> 01:30:03.719 align:start position:0%
here's the guy that took the notes in
 
01:30:06.910 --> 01:30:06.920 align:start position:0%
that committee but but my understanding
 
01:30:08.830 --> 01:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
of those minutes
 
01:30:11.590 --> 01:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
were they really weren't
 
01:30:16.750 --> 01:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
sure which section applied but they both
 
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
agreed why they
 
01:30:24.229 --> 01:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
were um not to recuse they weren't sure
 
01:30:27.390 --> 01:30:27.400 align:start position:0%
under they disagreed on which section
 
01:30:31.030 --> 01:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
applied to the to the situation but but
 
01:30:33.669 --> 01:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
that's that's a microcosm of how
 
01:30:37.629 --> 01:30:37.639 align:start position:0%
confusing this is if they can't
 
01:30:40.510 --> 01:30:40.520 align:start position:0%
decide how this works how the heck is
 
01:30:42.229 --> 01:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
the guy in division three in the middle
 
01:30:44.430 --> 01:30:44.440 align:start position:0%
of the row gon to decide that's my
 
01:30:47.149 --> 01:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
problem all along in all of this and I
 
01:30:50.470 --> 01:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
also think um here is the
 
01:30:53.109 --> 01:30:53.119 align:start position:0%
analysis this is this was confusing to
 
01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
me this is the computer uh the committee
 
01:30:58.310 --> 01:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
analysis on that bill and and there was
 
01:31:01.070 --> 01:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
a line that said they clearly are unable
 
01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
to exercise substantial influence over
 
01:31:06.830 --> 01:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:12.189 --> 01:31:12.199 align:start position:0%
organizations they're Senators um and
 
01:31:15.229 --> 01:31:15.239 align:start position:0%
and they are instructors within the
 
01:31:17.790 --> 01:31:17.800 align:start position:0%
university system so are we
 
01:31:20.109 --> 01:31:20.119 align:start position:0%
now it seems like we're dancing on the
 
01:31:23.109 --> 01:31:23.119 align:start position:0%
head of a pin um are we now worried
 
01:31:26.149 --> 01:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
about how big organization is Are We Now
 
01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
worried about what their position within
 
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
that organization is Are We Now worried
 
01:31:37.870 --> 01:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
about their ability to influence actions
 
01:31:41.550 --> 01:31:41.560 align:start position:0%
if that organization comes here it
 
01:31:46.109 --> 01:31:46.119 align:start position:0%
is and and and where is the line drawn
 
01:31:48.070 --> 01:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
if you're not worried about it I mean
 
01:31:49.910 --> 01:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
Everyone likes to bring up the idea of
 
01:31:53.629 --> 01:31:53.639 align:start position:0%
the janitor versus the CEO but there's a
 
01:31:56.590 --> 01:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
lot lot of positions in between there
 
01:32:00.229 --> 01:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
and and I don't think anyone and I don't
 
01:32:02.390 --> 01:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
know that this legislation I'll have to
 
01:32:04.149 --> 01:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
look at it more closely but I don't know
 
01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
if anyone has told me where that where
 
01:32:09.550 --> 01:32:09.560 align:start position:0%
that line Falls that this is a problem
 
01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:10.310 align:start position:0%
that line Falls that this is a problem
this

01:32:10.310 --> 01:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:32:13.070 --> 01:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
isn't and that's
 
01:32:16.350 --> 01:32:16.360 align:start position:0%
hard yes you have some very strong
 
01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:18.350 align:start position:0%
hard yes you have some very strong
points

01:32:18.350 --> 01:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
points
 
01:32:21.030 --> 01:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
and always have questions I don't have
 
01:32:24.910 --> 01:32:24.920 align:start position:0%
points I have yeah concerns concern um
 
01:32:27.109 --> 01:32:27.119 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's where I am at this point
 
01:32:29.149 --> 01:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
too because as I listen to testimony
 
01:32:31.390 --> 01:32:31.400 align:start position:0%
today I heard that it's really up to the
 
01:32:34.030 --> 01:32:34.040 align:start position:0%
individual to determine which is throws
 
01:32:35.950 --> 01:32:35.960 align:start position:0%
us right back to where we have been
 
01:32:37.590 --> 01:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
right we're not moving forward we're not
 
01:32:40.270 --> 01:32:40.280 align:start position:0%
getting as you said that clear line of
 
01:32:44.189 --> 01:32:44.199 align:start position:0%
on the walk up we don't know yep I it
 
01:32:46.709 --> 01:32:46.719 align:start position:0%
seems the more we delve into this the
 
01:32:50.709 --> 01:32:50.719 align:start position:0%
deeper the questions and it does seem to
 
01:32:54.629 --> 01:32:54.639 align:start position:0%
come down to that line in the of
 
01:32:58.870 --> 01:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
um circumstances um for each individual
 
01:33:01.109 --> 01:33:01.119 align:start position:0%
case well how does that help a
 
01:33:02.990 --> 01:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
legislator who's trying to before they
 
01:33:05.229 --> 01:33:05.239 align:start position:0%
even become a legislator if they're
 
01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
trying to decide whether to run and they
 
01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
are handed this booklet and say Here's
 
01:33:12.750 --> 01:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
all you need to know about whether
 
01:33:14.270 --> 01:33:14.280 align:start position:0%
you're going to be able to vote on the
 
01:33:16.470 --> 01:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
things that are important to
 
01:33:18.830 --> 01:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
you I don't think they you're going to
 
01:33:21.910 --> 01:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
have that ability to do that from that
 
01:33:30.750 --> 01:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:32.709 --> 01:33:32.719 align:start position:0%
I don't really need monkey monkey
 
01:33:35.950 --> 01:33:35.960 align:start position:0%
wrenches right really this way we're not
 
01:33:38.990 --> 01:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
looking at yet that way is the
 
01:33:41.390 --> 01:33:41.400 align:start position:0%
perception of the public we are
 
01:33:43.430 --> 01:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
wondering about strictly on everything
 
01:33:46.189 --> 01:33:46.199 align:start position:0%
we're talking about is the perception we
 
01:33:48.510 --> 01:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
have for fellow
 
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
members we should actually be looking
 
01:33:54.470 --> 01:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
more at how do they perceive theu
 
01:33:57.390 --> 01:33:57.400 align:start position:0%
and if they're not as bothered by
 
01:34:01.270 --> 01:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
it why the heck are we that terribly
 
01:34:05.550 --> 01:34:05.560 align:start position:0%
bothered by I mean no I I disagree I I
 
01:34:08.950 --> 01:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
think it is important very important to
 
01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
understand their level uh or their
 
01:34:17.830 --> 01:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
perspective but my personal ethics don't
 
01:34:20.629 --> 01:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
change based on whether somebody else
 
01:34:23.350 --> 01:34:23.360 align:start position:0%
thinks it's a problem here it to mind
 
01:34:25.470 --> 01:34:25.480 align:start position:0%
find don't change even by what's written
 
01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:26.550 align:start position:0%
find don't change even by what's written
in

01:34:26.550 --> 01:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:34:29.669 --> 01:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
this that is somebody's that is
 
01:34:32.310 --> 01:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
somebody's or some organization's
 
01:34:35.590 --> 01:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
opinion and strictly that an
 
01:34:38.910 --> 01:34:38.920 align:start position:0%
opinion uh you signed on to that I
 
01:34:42.189 --> 01:34:42.199 align:start position:0%
signed onto it doesn't mean I believe
 
01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
100% in it uh there are things right but
 
01:34:49.270 --> 01:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
getting back to your idea of whether it
 
01:34:51.950 --> 01:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
matters it does matter what the public
 
01:34:56.109 --> 01:34:56.119 align:start position:0%
perceives right but
 
01:34:59.870 --> 01:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
it but that doesn't change whether it
 
01:35:03.149 --> 01:35:03.159 align:start position:0%
even if they are not I still think this
 
01:35:05.590 --> 01:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
is an important issue for us
 
01:35:08.470 --> 01:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
to to review what I'm saying what I'm
 
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
getting at is maybe I misunderstood this
 
01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:11.669 align:start position:0%
getting at is maybe I misunderstood this
thing

01:35:11.669 --> 01:35:11.679 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:35:15.270 --> 01:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
here is 68 pages
 
01:35:19.149 --> 01:35:19.159 align:start position:0%
long to me as far as EIC gos that's way
 
01:35:23.910 --> 01:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
too big that's way too digging down
 
01:35:26.669 --> 01:35:26.679 align:start position:0%
as you can get yeah I tried to give it a
 
01:35:29.590 --> 01:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
real simple thing and and it got
 
01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:33.990 align:start position:0%
real simple thing and and it got
summarily

01:35:33.990 --> 01:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:36.669 --> 01:35:36.679 align:start position:0%
killed Mr Lambert I do think that we
 
01:35:39.470 --> 01:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
should produce another type of booklet
 
01:35:41.149 --> 01:35:41.159 align:start position:0%
that's the the idea is to have
 
01:35:42.950 --> 01:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
everything relating to the Ethics
 
01:35:45.270 --> 01:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
Committee and ethics laws and rules in
 
01:35:48.109 --> 01:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
that book in one place but that includes
 
01:35:49.870 --> 01:35:49.880 align:start position:0%
the procedural rules which no one needs
 
01:35:53.149 --> 01:35:53.159 align:start position:0%
to look at unless you're the unfortunate
 
01:35:55.109 --> 01:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
party in a
 
01:35:58.310 --> 01:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
complaint and it has two statutes and it
 
01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
has the guidelines a lot of which
 
01:36:02.629 --> 01:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
overlap and repeat and so there should
 
01:36:04.550 --> 01:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
be something shorter that members should
 
01:36:08.149 --> 01:36:08.159 align:start position:0%
have with them you'd mentioned having
 
01:36:10.830 --> 01:36:10.840 align:start position:0%
um and I have tried to work on that some
 
01:36:15.430 --> 01:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
but um but something much much
 
01:36:17.430 --> 01:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
shorter perhaps maybe only the
 
01:36:20.709 --> 01:36:20.719 align:start position:0%
guidelines and some summary of The Gift
 
01:36:23.310 --> 01:36:23.320 align:start position:0%
provisions of 14c which is something I
 
01:36:25.629 --> 01:36:25.639 align:start position:0%
do produce for
 
01:36:27.950 --> 01:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
orientation but and that's just a print
 
01:36:29.950 --> 01:36:29.960 align:start position:0%
out there should be some sort of booklet
 
01:36:32.750 --> 01:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
that would be smaller in format that and
 
01:36:34.629 --> 01:36:34.639 align:start position:0%
and the members could carry with them
 
01:36:37.709 --> 01:36:37.719 align:start position:0%
which would tell them when they need to
 
01:36:40.430 --> 01:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
recuse when they need to disclose what's
 
01:36:43.709 --> 01:36:43.719 align:start position:0%
an illegal gift that sort of
 
01:36:48.229 --> 01:36:48.239 align:start position:0%
thing no I don't disagree I I
 
01:36:52.590 --> 01:36:52.600 align:start position:0%
um I like the one page idea um you know
 
01:36:55.390 --> 01:36:55.400 align:start position:0%
I we we tried originally to whittle that
 
01:36:58.390 --> 01:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
down to one page and basically said if
 
01:37:01.550 --> 01:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
you think it's a problem it is and and
 
01:37:04.109 --> 01:37:04.119 align:start position:0%
if you're related to anybody that has
 
01:37:06.709 --> 01:37:06.719 align:start position:0%
that this is causing you a reason to
 
01:37:10.350 --> 01:37:10.360 align:start position:0%
change your vote that's a problem um and
 
01:37:12.390 --> 01:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
both of those were
 
01:37:15.550 --> 01:37:15.560 align:start position:0%
sarily uh tossed in the in the waste can
 
01:37:19.189 --> 01:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
by the Ethics Committee so
 
01:37:19.199 --> 01:37:20.910 align:start position:0%
by the Ethics Committee so
um

01:37:20.910 --> 01:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:24.310 --> 01:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
I I'm hard pressed to think that we're
 
01:37:26.790 --> 01:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
GNA come up with the solution that H
 
01:37:30.229 --> 01:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
pleases everyone I actually
 
01:37:35.189 --> 01:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
think what we are coming up to is a is
 
01:37:37.229 --> 01:37:37.239 align:start position:0%
and what we're creating not only with
 
01:37:39.910 --> 01:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
the bill that we pass through uh the
 
01:37:42.950 --> 01:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
house but also this one I think what we
 
01:37:44.830 --> 01:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
have is really something that they are
 
01:37:48.310 --> 01:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
going to use for adjudication purposes
 
01:37:51.750 --> 01:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
not as something that is going to help
 
01:37:54.910 --> 01:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
our fellow legislators or even potential
 
01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
future legislators that are trying to
 
01:37:59.030 --> 01:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
figure out if they would have ethical
 
01:38:02.270 --> 01:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
issues coming here I don't think that's
 
01:38:07.189 --> 01:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
somehow possible um but but is there
 
01:38:10.830 --> 01:38:10.840 align:start position:0%
anything that um let's just try to focus
 
01:38:14.510 --> 01:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
on this bill is there anything that that
 
01:38:18.510 --> 01:38:18.520 align:start position:0%
we either need to research other than
 
01:38:20.990 --> 01:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
this IRS the idea that it comes from the
 
01:38:24.750 --> 01:38:24.760 align:start position:0%
IRS and why and and
 
01:38:25.870 --> 01:38:25.880 align:start position:0%
and whether
 
01:38:29.910 --> 01:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
that's providing us any Keys um I
 
01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
started telling you what I had for
 
01:38:37.470 --> 01:38:37.480 align:start position:0%
information I can certainly give you the
 
01:38:40.589 --> 01:38:40.599 align:start position:0%
um this the information I've been given
 
01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
which is the um uh information from
 
01:38:46.109 --> 01:38:46.119 align:start position:0%
House Council who who provid us the
 
01:38:50.189 --> 01:38:50.199 align:start position:0%
draft minutes of of the Ethics Committee
 
01:38:52.750 --> 01:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
um we also have what else do we have
 
01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:55.830 align:start position:0%
um we also have what else do we have
Jennifer

01:38:55.830 --> 01:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:58.270 --> 01:38:58.280 align:start position:0%
um yep the hearing report from the
 
01:39:00.669 --> 01:39:00.679 align:start position:0%
Senate that was kind of that was just a
 
01:39:04.350 --> 01:39:04.360 align:start position:0%
front and back of a piece of paper um
 
01:39:09.109 --> 01:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
their hearing was um one 15if of what
 
01:39:11.589 --> 01:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
our hearing just was I mean there was
 
01:39:13.750 --> 01:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
only one person that testified and it
 
01:39:17.830 --> 01:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
was Senator Susi and and they asked I
 
01:39:19.990 --> 01:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
don't know 10
 
01:39:25.189 --> 01:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
questions if that so um
 
01:39:29.310 --> 01:39:29.320 align:start position:0%
I um I don't know what other things that
 
01:39:32.910 --> 01:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
you would like to know about um but I'm
 
01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
happy to get you copies of any of
 
01:39:38.629 --> 01:39:38.639 align:start position:0%
that you're in a you're in a unique
 
01:39:40.350 --> 01:39:40.360 align:start position:0%
position because you've already seen
 
01:39:43.589 --> 01:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
you've already had these arguments times
 
01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
two um yeah I no looking at this bill
 
01:39:50.430 --> 01:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
and all I I think they do try to bring
 
01:39:52.109 --> 01:39:52.119 align:start position:0%
us forward again the focus of the bill
 
01:39:55.030 --> 01:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
is the organization for the purposes of
 
01:39:57.189 --> 01:39:57.199 align:start position:0%
recusal so that's where this whole
 
01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
hierarchy thing comes in and that helps
 
01:40:01.950 --> 01:40:01.960 align:start position:0%
to clarify some I don't know if we're
 
01:40:03.910 --> 01:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
ever really going to get to
 
01:40:07.790 --> 01:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
where I mean it's been years years of
 
01:40:09.589 --> 01:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
struggling with the legislature on the
 
01:40:12.070 --> 01:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee to try to come up with
 
01:40:14.390 --> 01:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
simple definitions you can't do this you
 
01:40:17.589 --> 01:40:17.599 align:start position:0%
can't do that and we can't quite put our
 
01:40:20.310 --> 01:40:20.320 align:start position:0%
finger on it I think this comes
 
01:40:22.990 --> 01:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
closer uh when you look at the language
 
01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
is definitely simpler in this yeah it is
 
01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
um but but here again we're already
 
01:40:35.189 --> 01:40:35.199 align:start position:0%
pointing to things in this um that well
 
01:40:37.510 --> 01:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
why not the Selectmen you've gone you
 
01:40:39.390 --> 01:40:39.400 align:start position:0%
know you're exempting these people but
 
01:40:41.750 --> 01:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
you're not exempting selectman why why
 
01:40:44.149 --> 01:40:44.159 align:start position:0%
not um
 
01:40:46.270 --> 01:40:46.280 align:start position:0%
what and one of the things that was
 
01:40:48.550 --> 01:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
brought up was in terms of how much of
 
01:40:49.790 --> 01:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
the fact that you're paid to do a
 
01:40:52.430 --> 01:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
certain position but a concern that
 
01:40:54.189 --> 01:40:54.199 align:start position:0%
represent attorney has and I have as
 
01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
well is the influence the power cuz
 
01:40:59.149 --> 01:40:59.159 align:start position:0%
Selectmen have tremendous influence and
 
01:41:03.790 --> 01:41:03.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:07.550 --> 01:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
yeah um and and I that's why I was
 
01:41:10.550 --> 01:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
trying to broaden it it's selectman is
 
01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:11.390 align:start position:0%
trying to broaden it it's selectman is
one

01:41:11.390 --> 01:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:13.229 align:start position:0%
one
example

01:41:13.229 --> 01:41:13.239 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:41:16.390 --> 01:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
um I you can't believe how much power in
 
01:41:19.589 --> 01:41:19.599 align:start position:0%
a in an area the fire chief has um when
 
01:41:21.669 --> 01:41:21.679 align:start position:0%
you get down to all of the inspections
 
01:41:25.149 --> 01:41:25.159 align:start position:0%
of different things um it's enormous
 
01:41:27.350 --> 01:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
much more so than a fire than a select
 
01:41:29.510 --> 01:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
one as far as I'm concerned and not only
 
01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
that if you do not have a building
 
01:41:35.629 --> 01:41:35.639 align:start position:0%
inspector code enforcement that's the
 
01:41:39.510 --> 01:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
chief right well this is what autom goes
 
01:41:40.910 --> 01:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
down to them well this is what I'm
 
01:41:42.189 --> 01:41:42.199 align:start position:0%
saying so it's
 
01:41:45.310 --> 01:41:45.320 align:start position:0%
not to to completely this bill
 
01:41:48.310 --> 01:41:48.320 align:start position:0%
completely ignores
 
01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:50.070 align:start position:0%
completely ignores
that

01:41:50.070 --> 01:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:41:53.550 --> 01:41:53.560 align:start position:0%
um I think thank you Mr chair and I
 
01:41:56.510 --> 01:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
think it brings us forward as I said but
 
01:41:58.990 --> 01:41:59.000 align:start position:0%
we hadn't even thought of Fire Chiefs
 
01:42:00.990 --> 01:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
and but you're right and again it's a
 
01:42:03.910 --> 01:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
hierarchy in each uh municipality who
 
01:42:06.430 --> 01:42:06.440 align:start position:0%
has what power well they're exempting
 
01:42:09.550 --> 01:42:09.560 align:start position:0%
these people yeah but they didn't exempt
 
01:42:12.830 --> 01:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
Fire Chiefs and that's that's right
 
01:42:20.189 --> 01:42:20.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:23.310 --> 01:42:23.320 align:start position:0%
likeis yeah that that makes more sense
 
01:42:25.790 --> 01:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
that covers everything going down
 
01:42:27.910 --> 01:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities the fire departments the
 
01:42:30.950 --> 01:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
police department the water district all
 
01:42:34.950 --> 01:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
those things picked up yeah don't forget
 
01:42:37.149 --> 01:42:37.159 align:start position:0%
you also have the sewer
 
01:42:40.430 --> 01:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
Commissioners who could forget the Sewer
 
01:42:43.589 --> 01:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
Commission come on
 
01:42:43.599 --> 01:42:45.390 align:start position:0%
Commission come on
Alison

01:42:45.390 --> 01:42:45.400 align:start position:0%
Alison
 
01:42:48.149 --> 01:42:48.159 align:start position:0%
um that's kind of what this is all about
 
01:42:51.750 --> 01:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
actually you um I don't
 
01:42:53.830 --> 01:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
um I don't
 
01:42:57.030 --> 01:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
I don't know um I are we headed to a
 
01:42:59.229 --> 01:42:59.239 align:start position:0%
committee of conference on this do you
 
01:42:59.239 --> 01:43:04.830 align:start position:0%
committee of conference on this do you
think

01:43:04.830 --> 01:43:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:08.950 --> 01:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
um just not there yet I'd love to know
 
01:43:13.149 --> 01:43:13.159 align:start position:0%
Rich sorry no I I think he's having I I
 
01:43:14.629 --> 01:43:14.639 align:start position:0%
don't want to almost put him in the
 
01:43:17.310 --> 01:43:17.320 align:start position:0%
position to have to do this talk but can
 
01:43:19.470 --> 01:43:19.480 align:start position:0%
I just say one thing the Ethics
 
01:43:21.430 --> 01:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
Committee meets on Monday and the on the
 
01:43:23.870 --> 01:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
agenda is discussion of these two bills
 
01:43:26.790 --> 01:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
the two ethics bills that's true so
 
01:43:29.990 --> 01:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
Monday 1:00 Monday I think I'll be in
 
01:43:31.990 --> 01:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
the audience until you go into
 
01:43:35.109 --> 01:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
non-public and I leave again probably
 
01:43:36.910 --> 01:43:36.920 align:start position:0%
there will be three non-public sessions
 
01:43:41.070 --> 01:43:41.080 align:start position:0%
before we get to so it'll be 2 o'clock
 
01:43:44.669 --> 01:43:44.679 align:start position:0%
maybe okay I could call
 
01:43:48.189 --> 01:43:48.199 align:start position:0%
you unless I'm the the subject of one of
 
01:43:50.229 --> 01:43:50.239 align:start position:0%
those I don't know
 
01:43:55.910 --> 01:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:59.430 --> 01:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh I I guess what I would like is for
 
01:44:02.750 --> 01:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
for all of you and anyone else that's
 
01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
listening um
 
01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:07.629 align:start position:0%
listening um
to

01:44:07.629 --> 01:44:07.639 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:44:12.750 --> 01:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
offer ways of of um either simplify this
 
01:44:16.669 --> 01:44:16.679 align:start position:0%
is pretty simple this part but but how
 
01:44:21.149 --> 01:44:21.159 align:start position:0%
do we express this to if your colleague
 
01:44:22.830 --> 01:44:22.840 align:start position:0%
asks what are you doing on ethics what
 
01:44:24.669 --> 01:44:24.679 align:start position:0%
are you you going to say to them you
 
01:44:26.709 --> 01:44:26.719 align:start position:0%
know how
 
01:44:31.189 --> 01:44:31.199 align:start position:0%
does it seems that we have no limit to
 
01:44:35.270 --> 01:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
the number of questions even even the
 
01:44:38.270 --> 01:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
answers that someone has got in an
 
01:44:40.589 --> 01:44:40.599 align:start position:0%
opinion is turning back into more
 
01:44:45.350 --> 01:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
questions and coming back to ethics so
 
01:44:49.310 --> 01:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know I mean it it get it
 
01:44:52.189 --> 01:44:52.199 align:start position:0%
seemingly gets to even what your title
 
01:44:53.669 --> 01:44:53.679 align:start position:0%
is within an
 
01:44:53.679 --> 01:44:55.189 align:start position:0%
is within an
organization

01:44:55.189 --> 01:44:55.199 align:start position:0%
organization
 
01:44:58.070 --> 01:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know it seem it didn't
 
01:45:01.950 --> 01:45:01.960 align:start position:0%
seem like our version of this dealt as
 
01:45:03.990 --> 01:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
much with the employer
 
01:45:06.270 --> 01:45:06.280 align:start position:0%
employee I thought we handled that
 
01:45:08.189 --> 01:45:08.199 align:start position:0%
pretty well the employer employee
 
01:45:10.709 --> 01:45:10.719 align:start position:0%
relationship this seems to only deal
 
01:45:13.310 --> 01:45:13.320 align:start position:0%
with that employer or employee
 
01:45:17.870 --> 01:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
relationship um but not with you know if
 
01:45:20.709 --> 01:45:20.719 align:start position:0%
your brother is a contractor and you're
 
01:45:24.310 --> 01:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
in here voting on New Roads and that's
 
01:45:26.910 --> 01:45:26.920 align:start position:0%
going to benefit him this doesn't say
 
01:45:28.470 --> 01:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
anything about
 
01:45:31.229 --> 01:45:31.239 align:start position:0%
that so I don't
 
01:45:34.709 --> 01:45:34.719 align:start position:0%
know think of things that we need to do
 
01:45:39.070 --> 01:45:39.080 align:start position:0%
and communicate through Vanessa or I um
 
01:45:42.229 --> 01:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
for now I guess I'm gonna ask Jen to
 
01:45:44.390 --> 01:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
just look at what that if you can find
 
01:45:49.350 --> 01:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
out from maybe Rick Layman what what the
 
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
um the IRS portion of this and how
 
01:45:56.629 --> 01:45:56.639 align:start position:0%
relates and beyond that is there any
 
01:46:06.669 --> 01:46:06.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:16.350 --> 01:46:16.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:23.629 --> 01:46:23.639 align:start position:0%
this 14 C2 isn't it 14 C2 or4
 
01:46:26.350 --> 01:46:26.360 align:start position:0%
so I no no no I think it is
 
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
14c I thought this was 14 C2 it might be
 
01:46:33.470 --> 01:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:37.790 --> 01:46:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:40.990 --> 01:46:41.000 align:start position:0%
sections it didn't it
 
01:46:47.229 --> 01:46:47.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:04.270 --> 01:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:07.990 --> 01:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
right or if or it right
 
01:47:12.910 --> 01:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:15.270 --> 01:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
and you get extra
 
01:47:17.870 --> 01:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
pay you get all the pay of everybody
 
01:47:19.430 --> 01:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
that isn't
 
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
here um I am a little upset that our new
 
01:47:25.870 --> 01:47:25.880 align:start position:0%
M it wasn't
 
01:47:28.629 --> 01:47:28.639 align:start position:0%
here well I know but you think you were
 
01:47:30.310 --> 01:47:30.320 align:start position:0%
just appointed to a committee You' think
 
01:47:32.430 --> 01:47:32.440 align:start position:0%
you would be here I hope she understand
 
01:47:35.430 --> 01:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
hope she's not down in 104 waiting for
 
01:47:39.629 --> 01:47:39.639 align:start position:0%
us or something you know scare her
 
01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:51.840 --> 01:48:21.750 align:start position:0%
 
say

01:48:21.750 --> 01:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:51.709 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:48:51.709 --> 01:48:51.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:51.719 --> 01:49:21.709 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:49:21.709 --> 01:49:21.719 align:start position:0%
