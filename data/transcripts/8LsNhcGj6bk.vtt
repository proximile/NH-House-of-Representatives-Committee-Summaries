00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 align:start position:0%
a fantastic job and i'm truly
 
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh grateful to have him in this role
 
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
today we together will present the
 
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended fy 2223 budget
 
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
for the department of safety
 
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
the mission of the department of safety
 
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 align:start position:0%
is to continually enhance the safety
 
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
security and quality of life in new
 
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire through professional
 
00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
collaborative and innovative service to
 
00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:44.950 align:start position:0%
collaborative and innovative service to
all

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
i'm honored to to lead this dedicated
 
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
team of professionals in the department
 
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
of safety
 
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
and proud of how each division has
 
00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 align:start position:0%
responded to the challenges of covet 19
 
00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 align:start position:0%
whether providing support for the covert
 
00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
19 response
 
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
are making significant changes to
 
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
business processes
 
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
to ensure that public safety services
 
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
continue to be limited
 
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
during this unprecedented time
 
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
developing a biennial budget is
 
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
challenging under any circumstances
 
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
however the impact that cobra 19 has had
 
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
on state revenues made this budget
 
00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 align:start position:0%
significantly harder to compile demand
 
00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 align:start position:0%
for public safety services continues to
 
00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:21.990 align:start position:0%
for public safety services continues to
increase

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
increase
 
00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 align:start position:0%
salaries and benefits increase combined
 
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
with increased equipment
 
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
replacement cost the law enforcement
 
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.229 align:start position:0%
replacement cost the law enforcement
accountability

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
community and transparency as we all
 
00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 align:start position:0%
refer to as lee act recommendations and
 
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
our increased reliance on i.t
 
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and systems
 
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
have all increased the cost of doing
 
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.830 align:start position:0%
have all increased the cost of doing
business

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
these increased costs must be balanced
 
00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
by weaknesses in general funds
 
00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 align:start position:0%
highway funds and turnpike funds which
 
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
resulted in a decrease in funding
 
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
available to the department
 
00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
specifically 7.1 percent decline in
 
00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
9.7 decline in turnpike funds
 
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
and an 11.5 decline in highway funds
 
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
this budget funds all existing public
 
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
safety services required to maintain
 
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
public safety in new hampshire through
 
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
fy 22 and 23.
 
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
however funding constraints will result
 
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
in some reductions in delays in service
 
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
in certain areas we've worked extremely
 
00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 align:start position:0%
hard to make the difficult decisions
 
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
required to minimize
 
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
the impact that funding restrictions
 
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
will have over the next biennium
 
00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
specifically this budget more accurately
 
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
allocates retiree health and doit costs
 
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
across all dedicated funds to reduce the
 
00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 align:start position:0%
draw on the highway fund and general
 
00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:43.670 align:start position:0%
draw on the highway fund and general
fund

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
this budget reduces operating costs
 
00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:48.159 align:start position:0%
including reduction to equipment
 
00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:49.190 align:start position:0%
including reduction to equipment
replacement

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
replacement
 
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
and part-time funding to the minimum
 
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.309 align:start position:0%
and part-time funding to the minimum
amounts

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
amounts
 
00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
necessary for the continued delivery of
 
00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 align:start position:0%
public safety services
 
00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
this budget shifts some general funded
 
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
public safety services
 
00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 align:start position:0%
to existing dedicated funds to ensure
 
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
uninterrupted delivery of services in fy
 
00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
22 and 23.
 
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
these adjustments will need to be
 
00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
revisited in fy
 
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
2425 to address concerns surrounding the
 
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
long-term health
 
00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
of these dedicated funds finally
 
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
this budget unfunds 50 existed
 
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
existing full-time positions nine of
 
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
which are currently filled
 
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
throughout the presentation today myself
 
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
and steve will discuss how these
 
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
unfunded positions will impact public
 
00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 align:start position:0%
safety services across new hampshire
 
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
we fully understand the budgetary
 
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
constraints that covert 19 has placed on
 
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
state revenues
 
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
and have worked hard to minimize the
 
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
impact on services
 
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 align:start position:0%
funding all positions is a priority for
 
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
the department and
 
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
we respectfully request a consideration
 
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
be given to do so
 
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
if additional revenues become available
 
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
during this phase of the budget process
 
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
director lavoy will now spend some time
 
00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
discussing the important public safety
 
00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.310 align:start position:0%
discussing the important public safety
mission

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
mission
 
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 align:start position:0%
of each of our seven divisions and
 
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
provide a summary of changes
 
00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 align:start position:0%
current funding gaps and the expected
 
00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 align:start position:0%
impact on service
 
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
we're happy to take any questions that
 
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 align:start position:0%

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
and understandable for you
 
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
so hopefully we hit the mark there but
 
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
there's a lot going on at the department
 
00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
of safety
 
00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:09.759 align:start position:0%
and i think by the end of this
 
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
presentation you'll have a good
 
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
understanding about
 
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
what we do what's funded and then also
 
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
where some of our funding concerns are
 
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
the first page here is the
 
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
organizational summary of the department
 
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
as a whole
 
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
so we have seven divisions within the
 
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
department of safety
 
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
who are all committed to our mission of
 
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
continually enhancing the safety
 
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
security and the quality of life in new
 
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.150 align:start position:0%
security and the quality of life in new
hampshire

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
through professional collaborative and
 
00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
innovative service to all
 
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
in each one of these divisions um you've
 
00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:41.759 align:start position:0%
got the activity number that's listed
 
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
here the division of administration is
 
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.390 align:start position:0%
here the division of administration is
2320

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
2320
 
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
division of motor vehicles 2330 and so
 
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
on and so forth so those numbers
 
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
correspond with um
 
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
our activity numbers within the budget
 
00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
uh and so this presentation is built to
 
00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:54.950 align:start position:0%
uh and so this presentation is built to
follow

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
follow
 
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
the budget structure as well um and so
 
00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:58.230 align:start position:0%
the budget structure as well um and so
you'll

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
you'll
 
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
you'll see that we'll go in order uh
 
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
according to these
 
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
organizations here so to start off
 
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
um our overall budget for the department
 
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
of safety our summary pages
 
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
is shown here what you'll notice as we
 
00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:13.759 align:start position:0%
work through the presentation
 
00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
uh each division we're going to be
 
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
summarizing in total
 
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
and providing the pages that correspond
 
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
to the governor's budget
 
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
in the upper right hand corner here but
 
00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.550 align:start position:0%
in the upper right hand corner here but
for

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
fy 22 and 23 the department of safety
 
00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:28.950 align:start position:0%
fy 22 and 23 the department of safety
governor's

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
recommended budget is 203.5 million
 
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
dollars in fy 22
 
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
which represents a 5 increase over the
 
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.270 align:start position:0%
which represents a 5 increase over the
fy

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
fy
 
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
20 amount 21 amounts and 209.3 million
 
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
dollars in fy 23 which is a 33
 
00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
increase over the fy 22 amount
 
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
what you'll see over here is that the
 
00:07:52.869 --> 00:07:52.879 align:start position:0%
department of safety is really a people
 
00:07:52.879 --> 00:07:53.430 align:start position:0%
department of safety is really a people
driven

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
driven
 
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
organization we provide services to the
 
00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.110 align:start position:0%
organization we provide services to the
public

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
and so 63 of our budget is tied up in
 
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
salaries and benefits
 
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
the additional operating costs are a
 
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
combination of costs associated with
 
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
providing those services like equipment
 
00:08:11.909 --> 00:08:11.919 align:start position:0%
abilities utilities but there's there's
 
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
also a large amount of grant funding
 
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
distribute to uh municipalities to
 
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:17.909 align:start position:0%
distribute to uh municipalities to
locals

00:08:17.909 --> 00:08:17.919 align:start position:0%
locals
 
00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
other state agencies so each division
 
00:08:23.909 --> 00:08:23.919 align:start position:0%
will work through a similar format like
 
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
this to really try and summarize what's
 
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:25.990 align:start position:0%
this to really try and summarize what's
going

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
on with our increase we mentioned um
 
00:08:32.709 --> 00:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
that there's a um a five percent
 
00:08:34.949 --> 00:08:34.959 align:start position:0%
increase year over year
 
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
overall at the department level 649
 
00:08:42.469 --> 00:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
000 of that increase is due to
 
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
increases in salary and benefit costs
 
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
that amount would be significantly
 
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.190 align:start position:0%
that amount would be significantly
higher

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:47.200 align:start position:0%
higher
 
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh if it weren't for the 50 unfunded
 
00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:50.470 align:start position:0%
uh if it weren't for the 50 unfunded
positions

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner mentioned so we do
 
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
have 3.7
 
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
million dollars in salary and benefits
 
00:08:59.829 --> 00:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
savings from 50 unfunded positions
 
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
in fy 23 we do have a six million dollar
 
00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:03.430 align:start position:0%
in fy 23 we do have a six million dollar
increase

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
increase
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
and that's because of increases in
 
00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
salaries and wages we've got annual
 
00:09:09.269 --> 00:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
increments which will come due
 
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
we also have a 27th pay period so i'm
 
00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
sure you've heard about that from other
 
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
um other departments so far but there is
 
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
an extra pay in fy 23
 
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
which is going to move our costs up for
 
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
salaries and benefits
 
00:09:24.949 --> 00:09:24.959 align:start position:0%
there is a 9.3 million dollar increase
 
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
in fy 22
 
00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
that's primarily due to increases in
 
00:09:31.829 --> 00:09:31.839 align:start position:0%
expected federal fund expenditures
 
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
so those might be funding from covid
 
00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
related disaster funds from fema
 
00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:38.790 align:start position:0%
related disaster funds from fema
additional

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
federal funds that you know in the past
 
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
maybe we haven't done a great job
 
00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.350 align:start position:0%
maybe we haven't done a great job
estimating

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
estimating
 
00:09:45.829 --> 00:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
um for example we didn't used to include
 
00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
declared disasters within our budget
 
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.710 align:start position:0%
declared disasters within our budget
requests

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
requests
 
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
but through work with the fiscal
 
00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
committee it was determined we want to
 
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
include as many requests as we can
 
00:09:55.509 --> 00:09:55.519 align:start position:0%
based on good estimates that we have so
 
00:09:57.509 --> 00:09:57.519 align:start position:0%
we've included those in here and that's
 
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
a large part of the increase
 
00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:03.279 align:start position:0%
the total general highway and turnpike
 
00:10:03.279 --> 00:10:03.750 align:start position:0%
the total general highway and turnpike
uh

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
and cost of collections funding for the
 
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
department uh has decreased year over
 
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
year so we've got an 8.3 million dollar
 
00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.190 align:start position:0%
year so we've got an 8.3 million dollar
decrease

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
decrease
 
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
and as the commissioner mentioned that's
 
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
a 7.1 decline in general funds
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
9.7 in turnpike 11.5
 
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
in in costa collections which is also
 
00:10:22.069 --> 00:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
highway funds
 
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
i'll talk a little bit about that
 
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
distinction in a minute
 
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
just as a refresher for everyone but
 
00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
we do have an increase in our other
 
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
funding sources though
 
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
of 6.5 million in fy 22
 
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
and 1.7 million in fy 23.
 
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
and that's due in large part to what the
 
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner had mentioned
 
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
where we were shifting costs to our
 
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds
 
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
allocating those costs where where they
 
00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
truly should have always been paid in
 
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
prior years
 
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
um but we were really forced to take a
 
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
hard look at our our allocation process
 
00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
because of those um the weaknesses
 
00:10:59.590 --> 00:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
within the general and highway and
 
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
turnpike funds
 
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
and we were able to we were successfully
 
00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
able to move some funding
 
00:11:07.829 --> 00:11:07.839 align:start position:0%
into those dedicated funds appropriately
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
to reduce our draw in those areas and
 
00:11:11.829 --> 00:11:11.839 align:start position:0%
that's how we're able to maintain
 
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
all of our public safety services even
 
00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
though we have a significant decline in
 
00:11:15.839 --> 00:11:16.550 align:start position:0%
though we have a significant decline in
general

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
general
 
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
highway turnpike cost of collections
 
00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.230 align:start position:0%
highway turnpike cost of collections
funds

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
if you look at the chart up here you'll
 
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
see we've got color coding for each fund
 
00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:25.509 align:start position:0%
see we've got color coding for each fund
source

00:11:25.509 --> 00:11:25.519 align:start position:0%
source
 
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
many of our divisions are mixed funded
 
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
as the department is as a whole we've
 
00:11:32.949 --> 00:11:32.959 align:start position:0%
tried to carry the colors forward
 
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:34.240 align:start position:0%
through each division
 
00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
so as an example if we look at the 22
 
00:11:38.069 --> 00:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
budget here
 
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
this is for the department as a whole
 
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0%
where the budget
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
funds the department with 44.6 million
 
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
dollars in general funds
 
00:11:49.829 --> 00:11:49.839 align:start position:0%
which makes up 22 of the total 203.5
 
00:11:49.839 --> 00:11:50.470 align:start position:0%
which makes up 22 of the total 203.5
million

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
so then highway funds 34.3 cost of
 
00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:54.829 align:start position:0%
so then highway funds 34.3 cost of
collections

00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:54.839 align:start position:0%
collections
 
00:11:57.829 --> 00:11:57.839 align:start position:0%
30.3 cost of collections as a reminder
 
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
to everybody
 
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:02.240 align:start position:0%
as established and i got to look at my
 
00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
reference here article 6a of the
 
00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
constitution and then rsa99
 
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
a the any costs associated with the
 
00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
collection and administration of highway
 
00:12:13.279 --> 00:12:13.910 align:start position:0%
collection and administration of highway
funds

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
by the department of safety shall be
 
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
deducted before being credited to the
 
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
highway fund
 
00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:20.959 align:start position:0%
so what that means is essentially the
 
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
the um costs associated with the dmv
 
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
because the dmv collects uh all their
 
00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
fees that they collect end up going into
 
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
the highway fund is revenue
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
so the cost of the dmv and also the
 
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:32.720 align:start position:0%
costs of
 
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
the road toll bureau who collects the
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
state gas tax
 
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
those costs are taken off before the
 
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
money that they collect
 
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
and hits the highway fund the best way
 
00:12:45.509 --> 00:12:45.519 align:start position:0%
to think of this is actually as if
 
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
cost of collections equals highway funds
 
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
from a budget perspective
 
00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
but we're required to appropriate and
 
00:12:54.389 --> 00:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
report this way and so we continue to do
 
00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:55.350 align:start position:0%
report this way and so we continue to do
so

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
but that's an important distinction we
 
00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:58.720 align:start position:0%
do we do loop
 
00:13:00.389 --> 00:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
those in together because they both have
 
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
the same impact on the highway fund
 
00:13:03.269 --> 00:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
which is reducing
 
00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:04.959 align:start position:0%
reducing the amount of revenues that are
 
00:13:04.959 --> 00:13:06.389 align:start position:0%
reducing the amount of revenues that are
available

00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
so then purple is our turnpike color 8.6
 
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.230 align:start position:0%
so then purple is our turnpike color 8.6
million

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:10.240 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
and fy 22 which represents four percent
 
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
of the department's total
 
00:13:18.069 --> 00:13:18.079 align:start position:0%
the other funds are 55.3 million
 
00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:19.519 align:start position:0%
that's going to be all of our other
 
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds that includes the 911
 
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:22.389 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds that includes the 911
fund

00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
the fire fund watercraft safety
 
00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:27.839 align:start position:0%
criminal records and several other
 
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
smaller funds
 
00:13:31.829 --> 00:13:31.839 align:start position:0%
and then blue is federal 30.4 million or
 
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
15 percent of the total budget
 
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
so you'll see we tried to carry these
 
00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:37.519 align:start position:0%
colors forward for consistency moving
 
00:13:37.519 --> 00:13:38.310 align:start position:0%
colors forward for consistency moving
forward

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
um but but there's definitely even just
 
00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
visually you can see there's a reduction
 
00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:43.269 align:start position:0%
visually you can see there's a reduction
in

00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
our um our state i call them our
 
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
primary state fundings our general
 
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
highway and cost of collections
 
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
and turnpike fundings the last piece to
 
00:13:54.629 --> 00:13:54.639 align:start position:0%
bring your attention to is the section
 
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
on the right here related to our
 
00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.030 align:start position:0%
on the right here related to our
positions

00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
within the governor's budget and the
 
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
budget documents there are 1135
 
00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.069 align:start position:0%
budget documents there are 1135
classified

00:14:02.069 --> 00:14:02.079 align:start position:0%
classified
 
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
and 13 unclassified positions that are
 
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.150 align:start position:0%
and 13 unclassified positions that are
authorized

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
authorized
 
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
within the budget there are 72
 
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
classified and one
 
00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:13.519 align:start position:0%
unclassified positions that are unfunded
 
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
the commissioner mentioned that um you
 
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
know we have 50 positions
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
that are unfunded in uh 2223
 
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
up here you can see there's an
 
00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
additional 23 positions that are
 
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
previously unfunded state police
 
00:14:28.079 --> 00:14:28.949 align:start position:0%
previously unfunded state police
positions

00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:28.959 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:14:32.069 --> 00:14:32.079 align:start position:0%
these are sworn positions troopers
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
um sergeants and the like that were not
 
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
funded for several biennium
 
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
so um they're included in this total
 
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
but they're not newly unfunded the 50
 
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
positions that we are speaking to
 
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
um for the rest of the presentation are
 
00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
newly unfunded as in
 
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
they were funded in the 2021 biennium um
 
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
they were filled positions um there
 
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
might be some that are vacancies as well
 
00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
and um those 50 are now not funded in
 
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
this in this position in this budget
 
00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.470 align:start position:0%
this in this position in this budget
request

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
all right so if we move on to our first
 
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
area is the office of the commissioner
 
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
so the office of the commissioner um it
 
00:15:14.069 --> 00:15:14.079 align:start position:0%
consists of the commissioner and two
 
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioners
 
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
all seven divisions report directly to
 
00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
the commissioner
 
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
and the department's public information
 
00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:22.629 align:start position:0%
and the department's public information
officer

00:15:22.629 --> 00:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
officer
 
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
the office of highway safety the legal
 
00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
unit and the bureau
 
00:15:28.629 --> 00:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
of hearings are all organized within the
 
00:15:28.639 --> 00:15:29.269 align:start position:0%
of hearings are all organized within the
um

00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:31.749 --> 00:15:31.759 align:start position:0%
within the office of the commissioner
 
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
the office of highway safety
 
00:15:36.949 --> 00:15:36.959 align:start position:0%
they develop and implement our statewide
 
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
highway safety program
 
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
and it's really designed to reduce
 
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
traffic crashes
 
00:15:44.949 --> 00:15:44.959 align:start position:0%
and obviously reduce any resulting death
 
00:15:45.749 --> 00:15:45.759 align:start position:0%
or injury
 
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
and also property damage they administer
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
federally funded safety grant programs
 
00:15:52.829 --> 00:15:52.839 align:start position:0%
uh they plan and they
 
00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
implement all the federal funded highway
 
00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
safety projects across the state
 
00:15:59.749 --> 00:15:59.759 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of money that they award
 
00:16:02.069 --> 00:16:02.079 align:start position:0%
to locals for increased enforcement
 
00:16:02.079 --> 00:16:02.790 align:start position:0%
to locals for increased enforcement
activities

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
activities
 
00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
and local pds and also some
 
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
public relations activities to encourage
 
00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:09.829 align:start position:0%
public relations activities to encourage
the

00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
public to to buckle up because we do not
 
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
have a safety belt law in new hampshire
 
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
but we do want to encourage people to
 
00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
wear a safety belt whenever they can
 
00:16:21.749 --> 00:16:21.759 align:start position:0%
the legal unit is responsible for
 
00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
providing legal services to the entire
 
00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:24.470 align:start position:0%
providing legal services to the entire
department

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
and all the divisions in all of our
 
00:16:26.079 --> 00:16:27.749 align:start position:0%
and all the divisions in all of our
programs

00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:27.759 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
their duties include advising management

as you can see here what we'll do
 
00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
throughout is list where our unfunded
 
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
positions are
 
00:17:20.309 --> 00:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
in the structure and so in the office of
 
00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
the commissioner there's one unfunded
 
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
position in the high
 
00:17:24.549 --> 00:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
office of highway safety and two
 
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
unfunded positions
 
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
in the bureau of hearings steve
 
00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
yes with these uh positions that you're
 
00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.150 align:start position:0%
yes with these uh positions that you're
identifying

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
identifying
 
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
as unfunded could you tell us if these
 
00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:37.990 align:start position:0%
as unfunded could you tell us if these
are

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
as you're going through the briefing uh
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
part of the 50 new ones
 
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
or if those were there before
 
00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:49.919 align:start position:0%
sure so i think the only positions that
 
00:17:49.919 --> 00:17:50.230 align:start position:0%
sure so i think the only positions that
will

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:17:52.789 --> 00:17:52.799 align:start position:0%
that are identified uh in the
 
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
presentation are part of the 50.
 
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
so the 23 the state police 23 that i
 
00:17:59.510 --> 00:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned at the beginning
 
00:18:01.029 --> 00:18:01.039 align:start position:0%
are not included in the rest of the
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
presentation so it's only 50 the other
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clarification
 
00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
sure so the next page we move on to the
 
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
office of the commissioner's budget
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
request page
 
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
the governor's recommended budget
 
00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:22.390 align:start position:0%
the governor's recommended budget
requests

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
requests
 
00:18:25.669 --> 00:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
20.2 million dollars in fy 22 which is a
 
00:18:25.679 --> 00:18:26.310 align:start position:0%
20.2 million dollars in fy 22 which is a
5

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
5
 
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
increase over fy21 and a 20.4 million
 
00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
dollar increase in fy 23
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
which is a one percent increase over fy
 
00:18:35.039 --> 00:18:37.510 align:start position:0%
which is a one percent increase over fy
22.

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
22.
 
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
the 151 thousand dollar decrease in fy
 
00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:42.950 align:start position:0%
the 151 thousand dollar decrease in fy
22

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
22
 
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
is uh due to reductions in salary and
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
benefits from three unfunded positions
 
00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
uh that decrease is offset by a 292
 
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
000 increase i'm sorry by a 1.2 million
 
00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
dollar increase in fy 22
 
00:18:59.909 --> 00:18:59.919 align:start position:0%
due to the combined impact of retiree
 
00:19:01.029 --> 00:19:01.039 align:start position:0%
health expense
 
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
that got transferred out to the division
 
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
of state police and then increases in
 
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
federal grants and debt service payments
 
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
you can see from the funding perspective
 
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
here as far as in the blue
 
00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:13.039 align:start position:0%
we do have an increase in our our
 
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
projected federal expenditures
 
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
from 8.2 to 12.4 million that's really
 
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
driving this increase
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
year over year in fy23 we do have a 292
 
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar increase
 
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh that again is going to be due to
 
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
salary and benefit increases from
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
increments and then also the 27th pay
 
00:19:31.679 --> 00:19:33.029 align:start position:0%
increments and then also the 27th pay
period

00:19:33.029 --> 00:19:33.039 align:start position:0%
period
 
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
within the office of the commissioner
 
00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
there are a few
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
new positions that are funded within
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
this budget
 
00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:43.039 align:start position:0%
there are two new 100 federally funded
 
00:19:44.549 --> 00:19:44.559 align:start position:0%
positions within the office of highway
 
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
safety it's a field representative and
 
00:19:49.029 --> 00:19:49.039 align:start position:0%
an informational representative too
 
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
those are both 100 federally funded and
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
intended to help them achieve their
 
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
mission of improving
 
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.039 align:start position:0%
highway safety uh and also helping to
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
move money
 
00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
out of that area into uh the different
 
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
locals as needed
 
00:20:04.149 --> 00:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
and then we also have funding for a new
 
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
attorney three to oversee investigations
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
in coordination with the attorney
 
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
general's office so these would be
 
00:20:12.789 --> 00:20:12.799 align:start position:0%
department level investigations
 
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
and that's something that that was a gap
 
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
that needed to be filled that
 
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
we work closely with the attorney's
 
00:20:20.789 --> 00:20:20.799 align:start position:0%
general's office on determining the best
 
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
approach and it was determined in
 
00:20:23.909 --> 00:20:23.919 align:start position:0%
attorney 3
 
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
here at safety would be would be the
 
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
preferred option
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
we do have 45 authorized full-time
 
00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.510 align:start position:0%
we do have 45 authorized full-time
positions

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
that are classified and three
 
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
unclassified within the office of the
 
00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.149 align:start position:0%
unclassified within the office of the
commissioner

00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
and then in this area there are three
 
00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.190 align:start position:0%
and then in this area there are three
unfunded

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
unfunded
 
00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
full-time classified positions as well
 
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
and those positions will result result
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
in some delays in scheduling
 
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
and possibly some delays in grant and
 
00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
contract processing to local state
 
00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.510 align:start position:0%
contract processing to local state
agencies

00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
on the next page this is the list of
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
funding gaps within the office of the
 
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner so if additional revenue
 
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
becomes available at this stage in the
 
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
process we would seek to fund
 
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
the existing bureau of hearings
 
00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
positions that's an attorney for and
 
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
a secretary too and these positions
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
are used to schedule and conduct
 
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
adjudicative hearings
 
00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
they have if they're not filled there
 
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
will be
 
00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:26.559 align:start position:0%
delays in scheduling increased caseloads
 
00:21:26.559 --> 00:21:27.029 align:start position:0%
delays in scheduling increased caseloads
for

00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
the remaining examiners and there would
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
be delays also in the final report
 
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
issuance as as case loads just continued
 
00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
to increase
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
there would also be an increased risk of
 
00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
not meeting statutory deadlines for
 
00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.070 align:start position:0%
not meeting statutory deadlines for
certain

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
certain
 
00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
cases including administrative license
 
00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:43.270 align:start position:0%
cases including administrative license
suspensions

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
suspensions
 
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
we're not saying that would happen but
 
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
just the reality is with less staff
 
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
there's an increased risk and we do our
 
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
best to shift our resources
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're meeting those
 
00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
requirements first and foremost
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
and then the office of highway safety
 
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
position is a
 
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
program assistant two and this position
 
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:00.390 align:start position:0%
program assistant two and this position
is

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
used to process contract and grant
 
00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:04.480 align:start position:0%
documents with vendors and locals
 
00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
this is distributing that federal aid at
 
00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:09.039 align:start position:0%
the highway safety aid across the state
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
we have to reassign those
 
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to other people within
 
00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
the office of highway safety
 
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
but again we've got people who are fully
 
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
tasked with other duties
 
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
it would likely result in delays and
 
00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
could decrease the effectiveness of the
 
00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
funding if
 
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
it takes us an extra month or two to
 
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
make a grant award that's a month or two
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
that the local may not be able to
 
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
utilize those funds
 
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
and that could increase the risk of
 
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
highway safety
 
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
vehicle issues steve yes
 
00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:42.559 align:start position:0%
are these uh general funded
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
or highway-funded positions or whatever
 
00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
yeah these are these are a mix um
 
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
so the bureau of hearings is um
 
00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
is our highway funded positions the
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
highway safety position is partially
 
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
highway funded and partially
 
00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
what do i want to say because of the mix
 
00:23:15.909 --> 00:23:15.919 align:start position:0%
of funding
 
00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
each each of these positions would have
 
00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:20.830 align:start position:0%
each each of these positions would have
to

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
um like
 
00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
some would have to come from highway
 
00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:26.559 align:start position:0%
someone would have to come from
 
00:23:26.559 --> 00:23:27.190 align:start position:0%
someone would have to come from
someplace

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
someplace
 
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
else um well
 
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
yes and no so the
 
00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
we can we could change the funding mix
 
00:23:41.909 --> 00:23:41.919 align:start position:0%
um depending upon the source of funds
 
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
that were available
 
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
so if general funds were available we
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
can always add general funds to any area
 
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
because they're general funds
 
00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
if there were highway funds that's where
 
00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
we have less flexibility because now we
 
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
have to make sure we meet the
 
00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:54.789 align:start position:0%
have to make sure we meet the
requirement

00:23:54.789 --> 00:23:54.799 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
of to spend those funds because they are
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
restricted so
 
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
um so to your point if there were
 
00:24:03.269 --> 00:24:03.279 align:start position:0%
highway funds available or turnpike
 
00:24:03.279 --> 00:24:05.110 align:start position:0%
highway funds available or turnpike
funds

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
we would have to be careful about where
 
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
we use those but if there were general
 
00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:09.590 align:start position:0%
we use those but if there were general
funds

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
we would be able to utilize all of those
 
00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
thank you steve can i just add one point
 
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
sure yeah so i just wanted to just for
 
00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
clarification if you look so we're
 
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:22.559 align:start position:0%
looking to add an attorney
 
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
and as you can see we're trying to um
 
00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
get an attorney
 
00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
for which would be actually the number
 
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
two in the bureau hearings funded if
 
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:30.950 align:start position:0%
two in the bureau hearings funded if
possible

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
and completely separate um
 
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
duties of responsibilities why we wanted
 
00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:37.590 align:start position:0%
duties of responsibilities why we wanted
to

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:39.919 align:start position:0%
why i need to add an attorney three to
 
00:24:41.909 --> 00:24:41.919 align:start position:0%
our in-house legal counsel is
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
the complexity of our internal affairs
 
00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
and to ensure we have
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
a person managing them many of these
 
00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes are personnel violations some
 
00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
could border on criminal
 
00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
some can be walled off so you have to
 
00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:58.390 align:start position:0%
some can be walled off so you have to
have

00:24:58.390 --> 00:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
essentially two cases going at once the
 
00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
criminal side and the personnel side
 
00:25:05.269 --> 00:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
some of our investigations could involve
 
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
other agencies so what we found was
 
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
um to ensure that we're managing it and
 
00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
we have transparency in it so we don't
 
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
have one person
 
00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
making a decision there'd be you know
 
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
more broader oversight
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
that's why based on the duties and
 
00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
responsibilities they have in there now
 
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
with personnel with litigation with
 
00:25:28.149 --> 00:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
contracts with 91as we were falling um
 
00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
we weren't in a position of managing to
 
00:25:31.269 --> 00:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
success and
 
00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
and with the leak uh commission you know
 
00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
i found that
 
00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
that we definitely need more oversight
 
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
and we need
 
00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
a greater uh overall management of these
 
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
investigations and so that's that that
 
00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:45.909 align:start position:0%
investigations and so that's that that
is

00:25:45.909 --> 00:25:45.919 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:25:48.149 --> 00:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
what that position is about i had many
 
00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
conversations with
 
00:25:51.269 --> 00:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
you know the attorney general's office
 
00:25:58.950 --> 00:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
okay so moving on to um our first
 
00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
division which
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
uh again um it's based off the budget
 
00:26:05.279 --> 00:26:05.830 align:start position:0%
uh again um it's based off the budget
numbers

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
um but this is my favorite division
 
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
because it happens to be the one that
 
00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
i'm the director of
 
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
the vision of administration provides
 
00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:14.799 align:start position:0%
internal support services to all the
 
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
divisions in safety
 
00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
and our mission is to provide the
 
00:26:20.549 --> 00:26:20.559 align:start position:0%
highest quality support services in all
 
00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:21.919 align:start position:0%
of the areas that we
 
00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
oversee each bureau we're made up of six
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
different bureaus and each has a direct
 
00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:27.909 align:start position:0%
different bureaus and each has a direct
impact

00:26:27.909 --> 00:26:27.919 align:start position:0%
impact
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
on the unique public safety mission
 
00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.190 align:start position:0%
on the unique public safety mission
within

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
within
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
all of the department of safety and we
 
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
really view
 
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
ourselves as a force multiplier trying
 
00:26:39.029 --> 00:26:39.039 align:start position:0%
to minimize the administrative burden so
 
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
the divisions can focus
 
00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:43.039 align:start position:0%
um as much as possible just on mission
 
00:26:43.039 --> 00:26:43.909 align:start position:0%
um as much as possible just on mission
delivery

00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
delivery
 
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
um our our vision is that we're a
 
00:26:48.549 --> 00:26:48.559 align:start position:0%
recognized partner and a valuable asset
 
00:26:48.559 --> 00:26:49.110 align:start position:0%
recognized partner and a valuable asset
to

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
all the divisions in helping them run
 
00:26:52.149 --> 00:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
their business
 
00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
so we have six bureaus the financial
 
00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
management and planning bureau
 
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
manages all the finances for the
 
00:26:59.830 --> 00:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
department including the
 
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
coordination and the development of the
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
operating and the capital budget
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
this is your typical accounts payable
 
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
accounts receivable
 
00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:09.919 align:start position:0%
purchasing contracts all the fiscal
 
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
related items
 
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
um gnc items those types of things
 
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
the human resources management bureau
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
provides hr
 
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
functions to all employees and divisions
 
00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:20.799 align:start position:0%
within the department
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
we've got the payroll function under
 
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
human resources this also includes
 
00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
hiring under talent acquisition our
 
00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
organizational management area which
 
00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:31.919 align:start position:0%
works on reclassification of positions
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
when necessary when business needs
 
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:34.389 align:start position:0%
when necessary when business needs
change

00:27:34.389 --> 00:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
and then also performance management for
 
00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
employee evaluations
 
00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
and and discipline as needed and risk
 
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
management which is our
 
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
workers compensation family medical
 
00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:45.750 align:start position:0%

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
leave
 
00:27:48.549 --> 00:27:48.559 align:start position:0%
all those those challenging leave
 
00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
requests that employees have over time
 
00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
the asset and resource management bureau
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
maintains all of our fixed and mobile
 
00:27:55.919 --> 00:27:57.190 align:start position:0%
maintains all of our fixed and mobile
assets

00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
assets
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
they are also responsible for
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
warehousing all of our supplies
 
00:28:04.389 --> 00:28:04.399 align:start position:0%
and inventorying all of our fixed assets
 
00:28:04.399 --> 00:28:05.430 align:start position:0%
and inventorying all of our fixed assets
they

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919 align:start position:0%
they ship items to the divisions across
 
00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
and they also run an automotive garage
 
00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
where they perform repair on their fleet
 
00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
primarily our state police vehicles but
 
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
all of our fleet vehicles just state
 
00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
police is the largest customer
 
00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
we also have a mail room and the mail
 
00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:24.559 align:start position:0%
room is extremely busy
 
00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
they process about 1.8 million pieces of
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
incoming mail
 
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
about 1.6 pieces of outgoing mail a lot
 
00:28:33.269 --> 00:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
of that has to do with dmv
 
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
notifications license renewals um things
 
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
of that nature
 
00:28:39.029 --> 00:28:39.039 align:start position:0%
so you can imagine that's important that
 
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
that that mail continues to be moving
 
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
efficiently and then lastly we also are
 
00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
responsible for
 
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
the the plate room so we distribute over
 
00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
500 000 license plates to municipal
 
00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
agents uh
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
and the dmv substations across the state
 
00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:54.789 align:start position:0%
and the dmv substations across the state
the

00:28:54.789 --> 00:28:54.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
road toll bureau the road tow bureau
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
collects the state's road toll
 
00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
also known as the gas tax um and that
 
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
supports the highway fund
 
00:29:06.549 --> 00:29:06.559 align:start position:0%
so road toll collections each year are
 
00:29:06.559 --> 00:29:07.029 align:start position:0%
so road toll collections each year are
about

00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
188 million um 130 million of that
 
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
is unrestricted highway funds and
 
00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:15.110 align:start position:0%
is unrestricted highway funds and
another

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
58 million of that is restricted to
 
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
certain purposes
 
00:29:21.669 --> 00:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
um over at dot so there are funds used
 
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
to pay down debt
 
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
betterment funds those types of things
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
we also have an audit function in road
 
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:28.230 align:start position:0%
we also have an audit function in road
toll

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
toll
 
00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
and that function it's not
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
purely designed just to find additional
 
00:29:36.549 --> 00:29:36.559 align:start position:0%
revenues it's really designed to
 
00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
encourage voluntary compliance
 
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
by taxpayers when taxpayers realize
 
00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
there's an audit function
 
00:29:45.029 --> 00:29:45.039 align:start position:0%
they're more likely to comply with uh
 
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
with the law
 
00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
and so i think i think we have good
 
00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
compliance in that area
 
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
we also have a grants management bureau
 
00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
which is responsible for
 
00:29:54.389 --> 00:29:54.399 align:start position:0%
administering and reporting federal
 
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
grants for the department
 
00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
and specifically homeland security
 
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
grants that homeland security grant
 
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
program which distributes funds to both
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
locals and state agencies
 
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
and this bureau is extremely busy they
 
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
manage sub awards um
 
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
oftentimes over 400 sub awards at any
 
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
given time
 
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
to locals and state agencies and then
 
00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
last but not least our facilities
 
00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
management bureau
 
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
is responsible for the maintenance
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
construction groundskeeping
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
and also our energy efficiency projects
 
00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
at 44
 
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
dos facilities so we have a
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
large facilities footprint across the
 
00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.710 align:start position:0%
large facilities footprint across the
state

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
some of those facilities are our
 
00:30:34.389 --> 00:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
administrative services facilities but
 
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
we work closely with them and our team
 
00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
will will collaborate and help get
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
projects done as needed even in those
 
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
buildings that aren't
 
00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:45.039 align:start position:0%
strictly dos funded and as you can see
 
00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
we do have
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
several unfunded positions one of which
 
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
is the deputy director
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:57.269 --> 00:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
so moving on to the division of
 
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
administration budget
 
00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
steve yes yeah could you uh
 
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
send uh to us uh the
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
breakdown of what's funded
 
00:31:12.549 --> 00:31:12.559 align:start position:0%
by das and what's funded by uh
 
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
dos so that we have a
 
00:31:19.029 --> 00:31:19.039 align:start position:0%
understanding of that relationship sure
 
00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
as far as which facilities
 
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
right yes sure
 
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
got it okay
 
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
so um the division administration the
 
00:31:37.389 --> 00:31:37.399 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget for
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
2022 is 10.5 million dollars
 
00:31:44.549 --> 00:31:44.559 align:start position:0%
which is a 32 decrease over fy21
 
00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
and 10.9 million dollars in fy 23
 
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
which is a 1.1
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
increase over fy 22.
 
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
the one 1.2 million dollars of the
 
00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:57.909 align:start position:0%
the one 1.2 million dollars of the
decrease

00:31:57.909 --> 00:31:57.919 align:start position:0%
decrease
 
00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:01.519 align:start position:0%
is due to salary and benefits from 14
 
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
unfunded positions within the division
 
00:32:09.029 --> 00:32:09.039 align:start position:0%
the 3.7 million dollar decrease
 
00:32:11.509 --> 00:32:11.519 align:start position:0%
of or 3.7 million of the decrease in fy
 
00:32:11.519 --> 00:32:12.630 align:start position:0%
of or 3.7 million of the decrease in fy
22

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
22
 
00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
is due to um division specific operating
 
00:32:19.269 --> 00:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
costs so doit operating costs were
 
00:32:21.029 --> 00:32:21.039 align:start position:0%
changed we changed how we allocated
 
00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
those within this budget
 
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
in the past the department of i'm sorry
 
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
the division of administration
 
00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
uh for for whatever reason we we carried
 
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
the brunt of the
 
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
it costs and funded them with highway
 
00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:35.909 align:start position:0%
it costs and funded them with highway
funds

00:32:35.909 --> 00:32:35.919 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
we uh instead allocated those out
 
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
using pc count as a primary allocation
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
when possible
 
00:32:44.789 --> 00:32:44.799 align:start position:0%
to the different areas within the
 
00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
department which helped to
 
00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
reduce the draw and highway fund and
 
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
charge the dedicated funds appropriately
 
00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
for the it services that they were
 
00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:54.070 align:start position:0%
for the it services that they were
receiving

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
receiving
 
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
so that's a big chunk of of why there's
 
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
a decline here
 
00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
um and then i'll
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
i'll show you appendix a in a minute
 
00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
because this will come up several times
 
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
moving forward
 
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
there is a 325 000 increase in fy
 
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
23 and that's due to the increase in
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
salaries and benefits
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
from employee increments in the 27 pay
 
00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:17.430 align:start position:0%
from employee increments in the 27 pay
period

00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
period
 
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
and then the impact of the unfunded
 
00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
positions which we'll go into a little
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
bit more detail
 
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
is really just increasing in it'll
 
00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
negatively impact
 
00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:30.559 align:start position:0%
uh our ability as a division to deliver
 
00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
support services to all the other
 
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:32.870 align:start position:0%
support services to all the other
divisions

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
divisions
 
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
and will require them to to take up some
 
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
more of the administrative burden which
 
00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
is really the
 
00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
something that we don't want to do we
 
00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:42.640 align:start position:0%
want them focused on on mission delivery
 
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
and then also some road toll positions
 
00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
might negatively impact the highway fund
 
00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
so you can see here we've got our 13
 
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
classified and one
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:59.590 --> 00:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
and then this is the listing of our
 
00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
funding gaps related to admin
 
00:34:04.149 --> 00:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
so again if revenue became available we
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
would request
 
00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
that these positions be funded the
 
00:34:09.669 --> 00:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
deputy director
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
oops the deputy director of
 
00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.869 align:start position:0%
oops the deputy director of
administration

00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
administration
 
00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
this is an unclassified position that
 
00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:15.919 align:start position:0%
was established in
 
00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:19.919 align:start position:0%
fy 2021 and that's to provide additional
 
00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
support services to
 
00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
all the other divisions uh that role is
 
00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
really critical in helping us to
 
00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
implement the process and
 
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
reporting improvements that we'd like to
 
00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:31.109 align:start position:0%
reporting improvements that we'd like to
implement

00:34:31.109 --> 00:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
implement
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
to again minimize the administrative
 
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
burden that the divisions currently have
 
00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
while keeping them engaged and involved
 
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
in the budget process
 
00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
and contracting and all those services
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
there are three hr positions that are
 
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
unfunded and these will will
 
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
cause cause some problems because we'll
 
00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
have to reassign
 
00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
some significant duties to existing
 
00:34:55.589 --> 00:34:55.599 align:start position:0%
staff who are already
 
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
um already have a full load um
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
specifically the risk as we call it the
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
risk management area so
 
00:35:05.349 --> 00:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
family medical leave act workers
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
compensation americans with disabilities
 
00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:08.470 align:start position:0%
compensation americans with disabilities
act

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
act
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
any of those accommodation requests that
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
employees make
 
00:35:13.589 --> 00:35:13.599 align:start position:0%
those have to be processed there's a
 
00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:15.839 align:start position:0%
little bit of a legal component to it it
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
definitely requires
 
00:35:19.829 --> 00:35:19.839 align:start position:0%
timeliness as well we really need a
 
00:35:21.589 --> 00:35:21.599 align:start position:0%
full-time position for that but for the
 
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
time being
 
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
those roles are being completed by other
 
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
people within that area
 
00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
and we'd have to continue to do that
 
00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
moving forward if this position
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
financial management and planning we've
 
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
got accounting technician and
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
administrative assistant
 
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
and these positions are really critical
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
to the timely and accurate processing of
 
00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:45.839 align:start position:0%
all of our vendor payments
 
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
also working through our fiscal note
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
development and tracking for the
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
legislature so that's all
 
00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
managed centrally within this area and
 
00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:53.839 align:start position:0%
these individuals
 
00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
ensure that that occurs timely and
 
00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:57.430 align:start position:0%
ensure that that occurs timely and
accurately

00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
accurately
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
and then finally we've got our
 
00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
procurement activities which fall under
 
00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
these areas as well and so there'd
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
likely be delays and procurement
 
00:36:07.109 --> 00:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
across the board um and again pushing
 
00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
that down to the other
 
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
oh that's okay um i just
 
00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh in the uh areas where you have
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
several unfunded positions
 
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
would you mind uh providing us with
 
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
a uh this is my top priority this is
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
second this is third
 
00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
i mean i really i realize they're all
 
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
important but
 
00:36:43.349 --> 00:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
more than likely uh there's no way that
 
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
they're all going to get funded
 
00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
and so um out of your
 
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
50 unfunded positions uh
 
00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
it would be nice if we could have some
 
00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
sort of a
 
00:36:58.390 --> 00:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
priority list for um
 
00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
you know to look at and
 
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
i i believe uh representative heath
 
00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
also has a question oh thank you madam
 
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
chair this is
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
um just listening to the number of
 
00:37:14.069 --> 00:37:14.079 align:start position:0%
positions that you're eliminating
 
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
it sounds like it's really going to
 
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
impact a variety of things i mean when i
 
00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:19.990 align:start position:0%
impact a variety of things i mean when i
hear

00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
hear
 
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
issues with procurement um
 
00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
completing fiscal notes what about
 
00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:27.670 align:start position:0%
completing fiscal notes what about
services

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
that that are necessary um
 
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
i guess my first question is number one
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
um how much
 
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
money did you um lapse um
 
00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
in the past year and secondly isn't
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
there some way
 
00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
to really
 
00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
mitigate funds without impeding
 
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:57.349 --> 00:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
sure so so we're projecting to labs
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
approximately four million dollars in
 
00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
um this year another two
 
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh two and a half million in highway
 
00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:07.270 align:start position:0%
uh two and a half million in highway
funds

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
another two million in costa collections
 
00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
um so uh we've also we're also lapsing
 
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
just under a million and about a million
 
00:38:17.109 --> 00:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
00:38:19.829 --> 00:38:19.839 align:start position:0%
turnpike funds so uh there's a
 
00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
significant amount of funding that that
 
00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:21.990 align:start position:0%
significant amount of funding that that
we've

00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
we've
 
00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
we've been forced to lapse this year um
 
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
and that if if you recall that that was
 
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
really due to the unknown
 
00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
nature of the revenue sources so we had
 
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
a hiring freeze and
 
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
we've been working under those reduced
 
00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
numbers for for some time
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
um and and uh you know i i just
 
00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
i want to take a minute too and just let
 
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
you know that the
 
00:38:45.829 --> 00:38:45.839 align:start position:0%
staff at all divisions in the department
 
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
of safety they've done a tremendous job
 
00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
because we've all been impacted by this
 
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
and they've really remained positive and
 
00:38:53.829 --> 00:38:53.839 align:start position:0%
continue to get the job done
 
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
so um i think
 
00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
it's important for this committee to
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
understand what the impacts are
 
00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
and and we're doing this i don't want to
 
00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
be um
 
00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
we don't want to be um saying that
 
00:39:07.349 --> 00:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
there's a crisis
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
mode going on but just to be clear that
 
00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
these are the areas that would be
 
00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:11.829 align:start position:0%
these are the areas that would be
impacted

00:39:11.829 --> 00:39:11.839 align:start position:0%
impacted
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
and we'll have to shift resources we
 
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
still will be able to get the job done
 
00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
and so that's important to understand
 
00:39:19.589 --> 00:39:19.599 align:start position:0%
we're going to be able to get it done it
 
00:39:19.599 --> 00:39:20.069 align:start position:0%
we're going to be able to get it done it
just

00:39:20.069 --> 00:39:20.079 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
it's going to take us longer and if it
 
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
takes us longer it might increase the
 
00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:24.550 align:start position:0%
takes us longer it might increase the
risk

00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
risk
 
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
associated with not getting things done
 
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
more timely within those different
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
areas so i think you'll see that we've
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
spread these out
 
00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
over multiple different areas without
 
00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:35.839 align:start position:0%
having a large hit in one single area
 
00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
and that's one of the goals that we made
 
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
representative petra you have a question
 
00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
yes madam chair thank you and thank you
 
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
for taking my question i understand
 
00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
there's a significant backlog in
 
00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
background checks
 
00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
and uh i guess it's over a month in some
 
00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
situations could you address that please
 
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
i'll take that um sir which background
 
00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
checks are you referring to
 
00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
uh when when people purchase a firearm
 
00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
i guess that runs through your
 
00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
department and uh
 
00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
on on to the federal uh level uh
 
00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
sure sure yeah so there's actually
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
that's the permits and licensing unit
 
00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:20.150 align:start position:0%
that's the permits and licensing unit
which

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
representative umbarger had a uh had a
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
detailed explanation on that a few years
 
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
ago and helped us with our funding but
 
00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:27.349 align:start position:0%
ago and helped us with our funding but
um

00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:29.839 align:start position:0%
so in the permits and licensing sir they
 
00:40:32.069 --> 00:40:32.079 align:start position:0%
do uh the approvals for a new
 
00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
purchase of a handgun so if you went in
 
00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
to purchase a handgun
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh the ffl would uh communicate to the
 
00:40:41.109 --> 00:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
permits and licensing unit
 
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
um i would say over the last six
 
00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:46.079 align:start position:0%
i would say six to eight weeks we have
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
really redefined our business model down
 
00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:48.950 align:start position:0%
really redefined our business model down
there

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
and now our uh our turnaround time
 
00:40:55.589 --> 00:40:55.599 align:start position:0%
is uh i would say very good they've got
 
00:40:55.599 --> 00:40:55.990 align:start position:0%
is uh i would say very good they've got
some

00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
they're handling the calls one at a time
 
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
and the backlog there on our
 
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
approvals is i mean they're handling
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
many i can look
 
00:41:07.349 --> 00:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
i get a weekly dashboard within a half
 
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
hour so
 
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
the other area down there where we get
 
00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:11.839 align:start position:0%
questioned on is
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
out of state permits so that's an area
 
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
we have to monitor
 
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
return authorization to the courts on
 
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
firearms that have been taken
 
00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
by the court through a process um ex
 
00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
parte and then
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
the court requires us to do a check to
 
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
see if the weapon can
 
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
be turned back and then the backlog on
 
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
those were that were delayed
 
00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
so if a customer goes to us
 
00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
to a to an ffl uh shop to purchase a
 
00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:40.309 align:start position:0%
to a to an ffl uh shop to purchase a
weapon

00:41:40.309 --> 00:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
weapon
 
00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
we can either tell him or her that it is
 
00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:43.589 align:start position:0%
we can either tell him or her that it is
approved

00:41:43.589 --> 00:41:43.599 align:start position:0%
approved
 
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
and on approval we're getting those many
 
00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
of those done within 30 minutes denied
 
00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
which can be rather quick if there's you
 
00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
know a clear
 
00:41:55.349 --> 00:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
disqualifying offense or delayed and the
 
00:41:55.359 --> 00:41:56.069 align:start position:0%
disqualifying offense or delayed and the
delay

00:41:56.069 --> 00:41:56.079 align:start position:0%
delay
 
00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
means there is something that has come
 
00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
up on the criminal history
 
00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
that is not conclusive and it requires
 
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
us to do some research
 
00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
so we had been behind in the delays
 
00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
um the returns to the court but we've uh
 
00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
turned many of those around greatly
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
within the last
 
00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
four four weeks and i can get you more
 
00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.030 align:start position:0%
four four weeks and i can get you more
information

00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
um um offline but um i would say they're
 
00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
doing uh
 
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
significantly better today than we were
 
00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
in the last two months so we we we have
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
a team
 
00:42:31.829 --> 00:42:31.839 align:start position:0%
we've added uh we've got a state police
 
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
major that's overseeing it with the
 
00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
colonel so
 
00:42:37.109 --> 00:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
yes we did have significant backlogs but
 
00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
we've reduced many of those
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir thank you and if
 
00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
i could add to that
 
00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
representative p3 we actually have
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
later in the presentation you'll see
 
00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
we've added three positions to that
 
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
area in this budget which will further
 
00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
help us to address those
 
00:42:57.910 --> 00:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
those concerns representative lynn you
 
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me it's more it's more of a
 
00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
comment than a question i i have to say
 
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
a representative petri just uh
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
for your information my one of my best
 
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
friends is an
 
00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
ffl uh that lives in fremont and i just
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
happen i see him
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
you know at least twice a week and just
 
00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
recently we had a conversation in which
 
00:43:20.309 --> 00:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
he was telling me that
 
00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
um although there had been some you know
 
00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
some delay in getting the ffl
 
00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
getting the checks done that had
 
00:43:29.109 --> 00:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
improved significantly
 
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
in the last couple of months or so so he
 
00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
great so um the
 
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
four existing asset and resource
 
00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
management bureau positions
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
um these are really key roles in that
 
00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
area to help
 
00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
continue providing supplies to the other
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
divisions so the automotive shop manager
 
00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:56.950 align:start position:0%
divisions so the automotive shop manager
too

00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:43:59.270 --> 00:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
which oversees the garage the forms
 
00:44:01.109 --> 00:44:01.119 align:start position:0%
design and control clerk to make sure
 
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
that all of our forms
 
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
are up to date and they're accurate
 
00:44:06.829 --> 00:44:06.839 align:start position:0%
they're tied back to our administrative
 
00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
rules stock clerk and mail clerk again
 
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
keep the product moving keep those
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
things moving those those are critical
 
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
in the road toll bureau we have three
 
00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
road toll auditor twos
 
00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
and a counter clerk that are unfunded
 
00:44:23.829 --> 00:44:23.839 align:start position:0%
and as i mentioned the audit function is
 
00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
important we do collect over 188 million
 
00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
in revenues in that area and the audit
 
00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:30.790 align:start position:0%
in revenues in that area and the audit
function

00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
function
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
does help to encourage voluntary
 
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
compliance with taxpayers
 
00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
it's unlikely that we'd be able to
 
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
complete the same number of audits as we
 
00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
currently do
 
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
now there are some requirements for
 
00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
audits within certain programs that we
 
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
have to meet a
 
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
criteria on we would focus our resources
 
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
on meeting those
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:56.309 --> 00:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
would go undone and then the
 
00:44:59.510 --> 00:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
facility maintenance costs we've
 
00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
historically underfunded our facility
 
00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
maintenance costs for the department
 
00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
of safety last budget was the first time
 
00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
we were able to add additional funding
 
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
but then covet hit and we couldn't move
 
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
forward with any of the projects
 
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
or very few of the projects that we had
 
00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
intended and then the spending freeze uh
 
00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
made that even worse so
 
00:45:22.069 --> 00:45:22.079 align:start position:0%
there is additional funding that if
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
money was available that we would
 
00:45:25.109 --> 00:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
request to help us maintain our
 
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
facilities across the state
 
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
representative heath you have a question
 
00:45:31.589 --> 00:45:31.599 align:start position:0%
i do thank you very much
 
00:45:33.589 --> 00:45:33.599 align:start position:0%
madam chair um it's just a brief
 
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
question would it be possible um
 
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
for you to do a breakdown of
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh general funded positions federal
 
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
funded positions
 
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
buy bureaus i guess or divisions that
 
00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
you have
 
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
for us um in totals
 
00:45:57.829 --> 00:45:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
where you're deleting those where where
 
00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
the numbers are being reduced so that we
 
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
just kind of have kind of like a chart
 
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
that would be very good thank you okay
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
so total
 
00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
total uh total positions by division
 
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
um what's funded what's unfunded
 
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
source of funding for them and the
 
00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
funding source yeah
 
00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
okay we can do that yep and and split
 
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
funded steve correct
 
00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
yeah right yeah the vast majority are
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
going to be funded so we'll show that
 
00:46:27.599 --> 00:46:28.390 align:start position:0%
going to be funded so we'll show that
impact

00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
impact
 
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
all right yeah and so that's that split
 
00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:31.510 align:start position:0%
all right yeah and so that's that split
will

00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:46:35.349 --> 00:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
include general other and highway
 
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
and turnpike and turnpike and we'll show
 
00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
we'll show cost of collections where
 
00:46:42.069 --> 00:46:42.079 align:start position:0%
wherever it's appropriate
 
00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
okay on to sorry we're giving you so
 
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
many things to do
 
00:46:55.349 --> 00:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
steve but hey i i love it it's it's i
 
00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
enjoy doing
 
00:46:58.150 --> 00:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
this stuff so go ahead and throw it at
 
00:46:59.910 --> 00:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
me okay
 
00:47:03.109 --> 00:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
thank you um the division of motor
 
00:47:03.119 --> 00:47:03.829 align:start position:0%
thank you um the division of motor
vehicles

00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:03.839 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
um the division of motor vehicles uh the
 
00:47:08.309 --> 00:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
mission is to enhance public safety on
 
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
the roadways
 
00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire by ensuring that really
 
00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
everyone's properly credentialed
 
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
whether that's drivers vehicles service
 
00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.790 align:start position:0%
whether that's drivers vehicles service
providers

00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
providers
 
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
and also making sure that we've got
 
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
exceptional and efficient customer
 
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
service in the areas of licensing motor
 
00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:25.109 align:start position:0%
service in the areas of licensing motor
vehicles

00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
and motor vehicle related matters and
 
00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
the division is broken
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
up into five bureaus and then also an
 
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
administration unit
 
00:47:36.069 --> 00:47:36.079 align:start position:0%
the bureau of driver licensing is
 
00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
responsible for issuing driver licenses
 
00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
but also non-driver ids the driver
 
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:42.950 align:start position:0%
but also non-driver ids the driver
licenses

00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
they issue operator licenses commercial
 
00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
driver licenses
 
00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
real ids and part of that process of
 
00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
issuance might include
 
00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
a vision test or a knowledge test or
 
00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
road test for people getting their
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
license for the first time
 
00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
that's all handled by the by this bureau
 
00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
they have automated touchscreen testing
 
00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:04.069 align:start position:0%
they have automated touchscreen testing
system

00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
that is implemented and the licensing
 
00:48:08.549 --> 00:48:08.559 align:start position:0%
bureau also
 
00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
provides training for new and
 
00:48:11.829 --> 00:48:11.839 align:start position:0%
experienced uh motorcycle riders through
 
00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
a motorcycle rider training program
 
00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
each year they produce over 350 000
 
00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:19.030 align:start position:0%
each year they produce over 350 000
licenses

00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
they perform about 27 000 skills and
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
road tests
 
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
so that that's a big area for the dmv
 
00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
the bureau of financial responsibility
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
this is the area that maintains the
 
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
driving records
 
00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
individual driving history the status of
 
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
their license
 
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
vehicle registration privileges it's
 
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
really the repository for
 
00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
data gathered from all the law
 
00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:44.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies and circuit courts
 
00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
and district courts
 
00:48:48.069 --> 00:48:48.079 align:start position:0%
and also out out-of-state motor vehicle
 
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
agencies and so the bureau
 
00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
receives and processes records that come
 
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
in from these different sources
 
00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
they update individuals uh driving
 
00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
records and that
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
would include changes in to document
 
00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
convictions or suspensions and
 
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.109 align:start position:0%
convictions or suspensions and
revocations

00:49:03.109 --> 00:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
revocations
 
00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
and also restoration dates and and if
 
00:49:07.109 --> 00:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
there were any crashes or accidents that
 
00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
they were involved in
 
00:49:10.549 --> 00:49:10.559 align:start position:0%
this is also the area that collects the
 
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
um plea by mail
 
00:49:14.069 --> 00:49:14.079 align:start position:0%
tickets so when a violation is issued
 
00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
individual has the option to plea by
 
00:49:18.309 --> 00:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
mail with a payment to the dmv
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
those get processed here if they'd like
 
00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
to contest their ticket that's when the
 
00:49:23.829 --> 00:49:23.839 align:start position:0%
ticket then moves to the court system
 
00:49:23.839 --> 00:49:25.670 align:start position:0%
ticket then moves to the court system
instead

00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
instead
 
00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
the bureau of operations is responsible
 
00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:28.790 align:start position:0%
the bureau of operations is responsible
for

00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:49:30.549 --> 00:49:30.559 align:start position:0%
overseeing all the daily customer
 
00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
interactions whether that's in person or
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
over the phone or through email
 
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
they uh they operate 13 substations
 
00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
as well as the concord dmv location
 
00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
and they've done really focused on
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
customer service and trying to
 
00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
cross-train their staff
 
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
so that they can conduct any type of
 
00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle transaction that the
 
00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
customer needs
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
at any given time and so they've been
 
00:49:58.069 --> 00:49:58.079 align:start position:0%
very successful
 
00:50:00.549 --> 00:50:00.559 align:start position:0%
in doing that uh just as an idea in
 
00:50:00.559 --> 00:50:01.109 align:start position:0%
in doing that uh just as an idea in
typical

00:50:01.109 --> 00:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
typical
 
00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
pre-covet times there were over 20 000
 
00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
calls each month
 
00:50:07.109 --> 00:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
um that number's definitely increased
 
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
because we're now
 
00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
moving into an appointment based system
 
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
that's another area that i just want to
 
00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
take a take a brief minute to
 
00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
let the committee know so director
 
00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
galecki elizabeth bolecki is the
 
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
director of
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles she's really done a great
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
job in keeping the dmv
 
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
open and functioning during covid so a
 
00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
lot of other states
 
00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
um you know they decided to shut down
 
00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:32.230 align:start position:0%
um you know they decided to shut down
dmv

00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
dmv
 
00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
functions for a period of time we didn't
 
00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:35.990 align:start position:0%
functions for a period of time we didn't
in

00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire so the dmv was closed
 
00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
for two days while they shifted to an
 
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
appointment based system as opposed to
 
00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
just walk-ins
 
00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
and we've invested in technology the
 
00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
governor's office
 
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
helped us with with some gopher funding
 
00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
to do so and made some changes to the
 
00:50:53.349 --> 00:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
dmv process so now
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
um dmv remained open albeit there were
 
00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:56.549 align:start position:0%
um dmv remained open albeit there were
delays

00:50:56.549 --> 00:50:56.559 align:start position:0%
delays
 
00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to say there weren't
 
00:50:59.190 --> 00:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
delays we had less staff we couldn't
 
00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
schedule as many appointments
 
00:51:03.349 --> 00:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
but at least you know you knew when you
 
00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
were coming into the dmv you knew you
 
00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:05.430 align:start position:0%
were coming into the dmv you knew you
had

00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
a block of time you could schedule your
 
00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
day accordingly
 
00:51:11.349 --> 00:51:11.359 align:start position:0%
um and and i think that from what we
 
00:51:11.359 --> 00:51:11.990 align:start position:0%
um and and i think that from what we
hear

00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
hear
 
00:51:13.829 --> 00:51:13.839 align:start position:0%
the public's really pleased with the new
 
00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:15.599 align:start position:0%
appointment based process so
 
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
um dmv fundamentally changed how they
 
00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
did business during
 
00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
uh covid and and i think that they they
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
have some benefits that came from that
 
00:51:25.109 --> 00:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
uh bureau of registrations um so they
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
oversee registrations of vehicles
 
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh it's really vehicles trailers or
 
00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
boats uh essentially anything except for
 
00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
ohrvs off highway recreational vehicles
 
00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
and and they don't deal with the
 
00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles either but the purpose is to
 
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
protect the public really in this
 
00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:45.109 align:start position:0%
protect the public really in this
function

00:51:45.109 --> 00:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
function
 
00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
so if there's a collision or a theft or
 
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
a violation of law
 
00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:51.839 align:start position:0%
they can identify the vehicle and
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
that's an important part of of operating
 
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
a vehicle safely in the state
 
00:52:00.309 --> 00:52:00.319 align:start position:0%
we have a municipal agent automation
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
project that's our map system maap
 
00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
and this connects about 230 municipal
 
00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:07.589 align:start position:0%
and this connects about 230 municipal
agents

00:52:07.589 --> 00:52:07.599 align:start position:0%
agents
 
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
to the dmv and so that's how the
 
00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
municipal agents are able to
 
00:52:13.589 --> 00:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
issue plates and process dmv
 
00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
transactions at the local level
 
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
for for their for their residents um
 
00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
they process about 1.5 million
 
00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
registrations each year
 
00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
the bureau of title and anti-theft
 
00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:30.640 align:start position:0%
that area processes all new and
 
00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
duplicate titles
 
00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:33.839 align:start position:0%
applications for motor vehicles and
 
00:52:33.839 --> 00:52:35.510 align:start position:0%
applications for motor vehicles and
trailers

00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
trailers
 
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
they they enter the information for all
 
00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
vehicles sold through state
 
00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
authorized dealerships refinanced
 
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
vehicles and salvaged vehicles
 
00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
and they're all always reviewing those
 
00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
um title applications for fraud as well
 
00:52:50.549 --> 00:52:50.559 align:start position:0%
that's something we want to make sure
 
00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
that we stay on top of and
 
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
this is an important function because
 
00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
the the new hampshire automobile dealers
 
00:52:59.109 --> 00:52:59.119 align:start position:0%
really depend on
 
00:53:01.589 --> 00:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
timely processing of these titles so
 
00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
they can offer trade-in vehicles for
 
00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:03.910 align:start position:0%
they can offer trade-in vehicles for
sale

00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
sale
 
00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
soon after purchase we issue about 300
 
00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
333 000 titles each year and then
 
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
there's an administration section that
 
00:53:14.309 --> 00:53:14.319 align:start position:0%
manages dmd contracts procurements and
 
00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
audit functions
 
00:53:18.390 --> 00:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
for the division and you can see where
 
00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
the unfunded positions are are located
 
00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
within dmv
 
00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
um so here we have our budget request
 
00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget for the
 
00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
dmv for
 
00:53:32.069 --> 00:53:32.079 align:start position:0%
fy 22 is a total of 28.1 million dollars
 
00:53:35.589 --> 00:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
which is a 7.6 decrease from 21
 
00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
and it's a 29.1 million dollar request
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
in 23 which is a 3.3 percent increase
 
00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh over 22 96
 
00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry 963 000 of the 22 decrease
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
are due to decreases in salaries and
 
00:53:55.589 --> 00:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
benefits from 16 unfunded
 
00:53:58.630 --> 00:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
positions and also 150 000
 
00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
decrease in part-time funding um that
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
that was made
 
00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
again to meet the revenues that were
 
00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:05.910 align:start position:0%
again to meet the revenues that were
available

00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
1.3 million of the fy 22 decrease
 
00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
is due to a decrease in operating costs
 
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
including doit
 
00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
expenses debt service and facility
 
00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
maintenance costs
 
00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
in fy 23 832 000
 
00:54:23.829 --> 00:54:23.839 align:start position:0%
of the increase is due to increases in
 
00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
salaries and benefits from
 
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
increments and then that 27th pay period
 
00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
again with similar to admin we have
 
00:54:33.430 --> 00:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
significant reductions in
 
00:54:36.789 --> 00:54:36.799 align:start position:0%
full-time and part-time staffing levels
 
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
all services will still be produced and
 
00:54:41.349 --> 00:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
provided but there will likely be delays
 
00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
in certain areas
 
00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
and dmv is going to continue to work on
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
moving things online
 
00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:48.799 align:start position:0%
and processing transactions efficiently
 
00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
and fully leverage technology so that
 
00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
they can continue to improve customer
 
00:54:53.829 --> 00:54:53.839 align:start position:0%
service even without
 
00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
these um staffing uh resources that
 
00:54:59.910 --> 00:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
we've had in the past
 
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
steve can i um shouldn't i add just one
 
00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:03.109 align:start position:0%
steve can i um shouldn't i add just one
thing

00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
before we leave dmv i just want to say i
 
00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
just emphasize a little when colbert uh
 
00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
struck on or about march 3rd march 10th
 
00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
we opened the aoc
 
00:55:17.349 --> 00:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
between then and uh and currently
 
00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
director belicky has continued to finish
 
00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:20.950 align:start position:0%
director belicky has continued to finish
projects

00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:55:24.069 --> 00:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
to get services online
 
00:55:26.069 --> 00:55:26.079 align:start position:0%
everything that can be done online she's
 
00:55:27.589 --> 00:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
migrating that way she's done a
 
00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
tremendous job
 
00:55:31.109 --> 00:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
we had a comparison to our dmv to the
 
00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:32.720 align:start position:0%
other new england states and i would be
 
00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
proud to say that i think we are
 
00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
you know leading them all with not only
 
00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
the emphasis on customer service and
 
00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:39.839 align:start position:0%
lines but
 
00:55:41.589 --> 00:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
there's a tremendous impact on public
 
00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
safety there as steve said with the
 
00:55:44.789 --> 00:55:44.799 align:start position:0%
financial responsibility
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
um uh our interlock program you know
 
00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:48.870 align:start position:0%
um uh our interlock program you know
ensuring

00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
ensuring
 
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
um things uh travel to hearings as they
 
00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
but i just think it's important to note
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
that not only have we
 
00:55:58.470 --> 00:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
stayed open and we've she's kind of
 
00:55:59.670 --> 00:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
managed and been
 
00:56:03.349 --> 00:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
very very uh nimble through kobit
 
00:56:05.589 --> 00:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
they've finished projects and i think
 
00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
you know the future looks
 
00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
looks very bright so anything we can get
 
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
done online and then that allows us to
 
00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:11.670 align:start position:0%
done online and then that allows us to
shift

00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
shift
 
00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
people um that we're required to do it
 
00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
but the qmatic scheduling system has
 
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:16.390 align:start position:0%
but the qmatic scheduling system has
really

00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:56:18.789 --> 00:56:18.799 align:start position:0%
been a game changer for the dmv now
 
00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
folks are not waiting in line
 
00:56:23.430 --> 00:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
and uh so i think that i think um uh
 
00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for the continued support of
 
00:56:26.549 --> 00:56:26.559 align:start position:0%
the dmv and i think we're being very
 
00:56:28.470 --> 00:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
very responsible with these dollars and
 
00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
ensuring that
 
00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
the public benefits not only in customer
 
00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
service but on the safety piece
 
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank you yes and i would like to
 
00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
thank director balecki in particular for
 
00:56:43.710 --> 00:56:43.720 align:start position:0%

00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:45.190 align:start position:0%
making sure that all the legislators

legislators
 
00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
could get their get their plates as
 
00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
they as they needed them so
 
00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
yeah that was uh that was very nice uh
 
00:56:58.870 --> 00:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
representative petry you have a question
 
00:57:01.349 --> 00:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
yes i do madam chair um
 
00:57:04.069 --> 00:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
the um actually i got a comment uh you
 
00:57:05.829 --> 00:57:05.839 align:start position:0%
did an excellent job in uh
 
00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
delivering the ppe i know uh the
 
00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:10.640 align:start position:0%
beginning uh when we were escorted by
 
00:57:13.349 --> 00:57:13.359 align:start position:0%
state troopers that was interesting
 
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
and then the model changed to bringing
 
00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
the ppe to
 
00:57:19.030 --> 00:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
dmvs has that incurred an additional
 
00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:21.109 align:start position:0%
dmvs has that incurred an additional
cost

00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:57:23.109 --> 00:57:23.119 align:start position:0%
to the to the department or you just do
 
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
it in stride
 
00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
i can i can address that commissioner um
 
00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
so obviously whenever there's staffing
 
00:57:34.069 --> 00:57:34.079 align:start position:0%
uh involved there's the salary and
 
00:57:35.829 --> 00:57:35.839 align:start position:0%
benefits that are attached to them
 
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
uh but there's no additional costs
 
00:57:40.789 --> 00:57:40.799 align:start position:0%
necessarily besides the time
 
00:57:43.109 --> 00:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
the cost it is to take someone to manage
 
00:57:45.109 --> 00:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
that program
 
00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
all of those ppe and the distribution
 
00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:48.390 align:start position:0%
all of those ppe and the distribution
systems

00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
systems
 
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
all that's getting reimbursed with
 
00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
federal monies uh
 
00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
and so anything that we have been
 
00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
spending will will get recouped over
 
00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:56.069 align:start position:0%
spending will will get recouped over
time

00:57:56.069 --> 00:57:56.079 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:57:59.910 --> 00:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative murray you
 
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
yes thank you again uh this i may have
 
00:58:06.309 --> 00:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
done a fabulous job and this move to
 
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
online is that a permanent
 
00:58:10.789 --> 00:58:10.799 align:start position:0%
move will you continue to do all the
 
00:58:13.109 --> 00:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
stuff that you're doing now online
 
00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
post coven i'm looking is there a silver
 
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
lining here that some things may
 
00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:17.670 align:start position:0%
lining here that some things may
actually

00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
pertain going forward to some advantage
 
00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:22.559 align:start position:0%
to us um
 
00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
yeah i'll start and steve can back
 
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
cleanup yeah we're not going backwards
 
00:58:28.789 --> 00:58:28.799 align:start position:0%
so everything that we've migrated online
 
00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
is going to stay online
 
00:58:31.349 --> 00:58:31.359 align:start position:0%
and i think what would be helpful is
 
00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
maybe uh the director can forward uh
 
00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
representative umber we've got a nice
 
00:58:37.109 --> 00:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
chart of what we've done
 
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
and what the next projects are in the
 
00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
queue so we've gotta
 
00:58:42.309 --> 00:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
we've got a few more that um she's
 
00:58:43.349 --> 00:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
trying to get done
 
00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
but um yeah oh no these will be these
 
00:58:47.270 --> 00:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
will be permanent absolutely
 
00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
yeah and i give i give her credit the
 
00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
governor uh
 
00:58:52.549 --> 00:58:52.559 align:start position:0%
office on the capital investments but i
 
00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
think that you know with everybody's
 
00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
benefited from the
 
00:58:58.230 --> 00:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh the dollars and uh and again it's a
 
00:58:59.910 --> 00:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
credit to uh the director
 
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
you know she's done a nice job getting
 
00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
these projects completed
 
00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
yeah that would be very helpful
 
00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner if uh if she could send
 
00:59:09.119 --> 00:59:10.789 align:start position:0%
commissioner if uh if she could send
that

00:59:10.789 --> 00:59:10.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
yeah okay and i'll include that
 
00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
with our other requests for you
 
00:59:24.390 --> 00:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
okay uh you're back on steve
 
00:59:27.510 --> 00:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:59:32.069 --> 00:59:32.079 align:start position:0%
um so now we look at the
 
00:59:36.069 --> 00:59:36.079 align:start position:0%
16 unfunded positions in dmv
 
00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
and again you're going to see a theme
 
00:59:40.069 --> 00:59:40.079 align:start position:0%
here where there's going to be delays to
 
00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
service so the first
 
00:59:43.990 --> 00:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
group there's two positions in driver
 
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:45.670 align:start position:0%
group there's two positions in driver
licensing

00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
these positions are required to schedule
 
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
driver license examinations and conduct
 
00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:50.630 align:start position:0%
driver license examinations and conduct
them

00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:59:53.349 --> 00:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
and they've needed to offer road tests
 
00:59:55.109 --> 00:59:55.119 align:start position:0%
in all locations
 
00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
to prevent customers from having to
 
00:59:58.630 --> 00:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
travel too far for those critical
 
00:59:58.640 --> 00:59:59.349 align:start position:0%
travel too far for those critical
services

00:59:59.349 --> 00:59:59.359 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:00:01.349 --> 01:00:01.359 align:start position:0%
so without all a full complement of
 
01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
driver licensing
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
examiners we can't offer driver license
 
01:00:07.829 --> 01:00:07.839 align:start position:0%
exams at every dmv
 
01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
substation across the state
 
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
in the registration bureau there are
 
01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:14.069 align:start position:0%
in the registration bureau there are
five

01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:14.079 align:start position:0%
five
 
01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
full-time unfunded positions uh
 
01:00:20.309 --> 01:00:20.319 align:start position:0%
and those are required to prevent delays
 
01:00:22.309 --> 01:00:22.319 align:start position:0%
in the assistance that is provided to
 
01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
town clerks
 
01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
while they're processing those map
 
01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
transactions those registrations
 
01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
boat renewals dealer inspection station
 
01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:31.510 align:start position:0%
boat renewals dealer inspection station
applications

01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
applications
 
01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
also vanity plates and walking
 
01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:34.720 align:start position:0%
disability placards so
 
01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
those are all the general registration
 
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
functions that occur
 
01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
and these positions would negatively
 
01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:41.589 align:start position:0%
and these positions would negatively
impact

01:00:41.589 --> 01:00:41.599 align:start position:0%
impact
 
01:00:44.309 --> 01:00:44.319 align:start position:0%
all of those areas in the title bureau
 
01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:45.839 align:start position:0%
there's two positions
 
01:00:48.549 --> 01:00:48.559 align:start position:0%
an examiner and a supervisor three and
 
01:00:50.309 --> 01:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
those are required to prevent delays in
 
01:00:52.309 --> 01:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
processing the title documents
 
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
and as i mentioned before this is an
 
01:00:55.109 --> 01:00:55.119 align:start position:0%
area that the new hampshire automobile
 
01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
dealers are really
 
01:00:58.309 --> 01:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
focused on making sure we continue
 
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
timely processing
 
01:01:03.589 --> 01:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
in financial responsibility um
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
these are this is the area where your
 
01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
driving history record is updated
 
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
and so any violations or accidents need
 
01:01:13.109 --> 01:01:13.119 align:start position:0%
to be timely processed
 
01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
um so that your record is up to date and
 
01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
many of these transactions result in
 
01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:20.319 align:start position:0%
suspensions and revocation of privileges
 
01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
and so we want to make sure that those
 
01:01:23.589 --> 01:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
are updated and reversed in a timely
 
01:01:23.599 --> 01:01:23.990 align:start position:0%
are updated and reversed in a timely
manner

01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
manner
 
01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
as well in operations
 
01:01:29.109 --> 01:01:29.119 align:start position:0%
um there's four positions there and
 
01:01:31.109 --> 01:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
these are those direct service positions
 
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
at all the substations
 
01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:34.640 align:start position:0%
they conduct the counter transactions
 
01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
where even though we're moving more and
 
01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
more online um
 
01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
we still have a need for in-person
 
01:01:41.589 --> 01:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
transactions and so
 
01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
the less people we have the less uh
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
scheduled times we can
 
01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
we can fill um
 
01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:50.720 align:start position:0%
and then finally part-time employees in
 
01:01:51.990 --> 01:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
operation so
 
01:01:54.549 --> 01:01:54.559 align:start position:0%
the dmv relies very heavily on part-time
 
01:01:54.559 --> 01:01:55.990 align:start position:0%
the dmv relies very heavily on part-time
employees

01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:01:59.510 --> 01:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
that's how they shift uh and cover when
 
01:02:01.270 --> 01:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
full-time folks are unavailable do the
 
01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
annual leave or illness
 
01:02:05.349 --> 01:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
and so part-time would really helped to
 
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
fill us a need for us
 
01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
and also when there's search support
 
01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
needed so if there's an increase in
 
01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.029 align:start position:0%
needed so if there's an increase in
volume

01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:13.039 align:start position:0%
volume
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
uh we rely on our part-timers and
 
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
additional funding we did reduce the
 
01:02:19.109 --> 01:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
part-time budget
 
01:02:22.789 --> 01:02:22.799 align:start position:0%
we would look to to return that to
 
01:02:24.789 --> 01:02:24.799 align:start position:0%
the levels that are required if funding
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
was available
 
01:02:28.789 --> 01:02:28.799 align:start position:0%
there's also a new position request that
 
01:02:29.829 --> 01:02:29.839 align:start position:0%
was important
 
01:02:31.109 --> 01:02:31.119 align:start position:0%
that i wanted to mention that's the
 
01:02:33.589 --> 01:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
program assisted two and that's an
 
01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
area in the um ignition interlock
 
01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
program at dmv and so this person would
 
01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
be responsible for the oversight of
 
01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
those violations hearings
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
and management of that program for any
 
01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
drivers who
 
01:02:48.549 --> 01:02:48.559 align:start position:0%
were convicted of alcohol related
 
01:02:51.029 --> 01:02:51.039 align:start position:0%
convictions and moved into that program
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
and then again facility maintenance
 
01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
costs because of our different funding
 
01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:55.750 align:start position:0%
costs because of our different funding
sources

01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
sources
 
01:02:58.390 --> 01:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
because cost of collections supports dmv
 
01:02:58.400 --> 01:02:58.789 align:start position:0%
because cost of collections supports dmv
we

01:02:58.789 --> 01:02:58.799 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
um we budget for facility maintenance
 
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
costs for dmv locations within the dmv
 
01:03:05.109 --> 01:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
so much like an admin where we have
 
01:03:06.789 --> 01:03:06.799 align:start position:0%
facility maintenance for the other dos
 
01:03:06.799 --> 01:03:07.670 align:start position:0%
facility maintenance for the other dos
facilities

01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
here an additional 20 000 would be
 
01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
requested for the dmv
 
01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:15.510 align:start position:0%
requested for the dmv
facilities

01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:19.109 --> 01:03:19.119 align:start position:0%
okay moving on the next division
 
01:03:22.309 --> 01:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
yeah just a second a second
 
01:03:25.270 --> 01:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
they so the cost of collections is
 
01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
pretty much
 
01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:31.170 align:start position:0%
funded by the um
 
01:03:31.170 --> 01:03:32.309 align:start position:0%
funded by the um
[Music]

01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
funded by the um highway
 
01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:38.559 align:start position:0%
and turnpike is that correct just the
 
01:03:38.559 --> 01:03:39.430 align:start position:0%
and turnpike is that correct just the
highway

01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
highway
 
01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
just the highway okay so cost
 
01:03:44.069 --> 01:03:44.079 align:start position:0%
collections is funded by the highway
 
01:03:48.309 --> 01:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
and so any changes in this area
 
01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
would impact the highway fund
 
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
is that correct any changes would impact
 
01:03:55.829 --> 01:03:55.839 align:start position:0%
the highway fund
 
01:03:58.950 --> 01:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
yes okay but let me give you an example
 
01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
of some of the things that
 
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
some of the funding decisions our
 
01:04:05.589 --> 01:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
ability that we have
 
01:04:08.870 --> 01:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
if if we typically treat cost of
 
01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:09.670 align:start position:0%
if if we typically treat cost of
collections

01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
collections
 
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
and highway funds as interchangeable so
 
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
if additional general funds become
 
01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:17.670 align:start position:0%
if additional general funds become
available

01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
those general funds could replace
 
01:04:21.109 --> 01:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
highway funds within
 
01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:22.559 align:start position:0%
the department within the division of
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
state police or highway funds within the
 
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner's office
 
01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
which would reduce the highway fund draw
 
01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
and allow us to increase the cost of
 
01:04:32.069 --> 01:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
collections by the same amount
 
01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
so we have some flexibility if general
 
01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
funds become available
 
01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
to shift our funding sources uh around
 
01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:48.549 --> 01:04:48.559 align:start position:0%
um so next is our largest division the
 
01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
division of state police
 
01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
uh the division of state police is our
 
01:04:55.109 --> 01:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
statewide law enforcement agency
 
01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
and they enforce state criminal motor
 
01:04:59.510 --> 01:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
vehicle and other public safety laws
 
01:05:01.589 --> 01:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
across the state they have concurrent
 
01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction in towns with the
 
01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
population level under 3 000
 
01:05:07.029 --> 01:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
and primary jurisdiction on all
 
01:05:09.029 --> 01:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
interstate highways and they operate
 
01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
seven troop stations a marine patrol
 
01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:12.150 align:start position:0%
seven troop stations a marine patrol
facility

01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
aircraft hangar they also operate the
 
01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
state forensic lab
 
01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
criminal records unit permits and
 
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
licensing unit as you can see
 
01:05:22.069 --> 01:05:22.079 align:start position:0%
lots of different pieces here i'm not
 
01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
going to go into a lot of detail in each
 
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
one but i want to spend a little bit of
 
01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:26.309 align:start position:0%
one but i want to spend a little bit of
time

01:05:26.309 --> 01:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
describing what some of these key
 
01:05:30.309 --> 01:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
functions are
 
01:05:32.789 --> 01:05:32.799 align:start position:0%
so under the operations bureau they're
 
01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
the primary
 
01:05:35.910 --> 01:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle enforcement and criminal
 
01:05:37.349 --> 01:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
deterrence patrol
 
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh statewide uh and as i mentioned for
 
01:05:41.430 --> 01:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
communities that don't have their own
 
01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
police force whether it's
 
01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
because of cost concerns or just um or
 
01:05:49.270 --> 01:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
funding issues or size the troopers
 
01:05:51.029 --> 01:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
provide the whole range of law
 
01:05:51.039 --> 01:05:51.750 align:start position:0%
provide the whole range of law
enforcement

01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
services in those areas taking
 
01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
conducting controls taking calls for
 
01:05:58.710 --> 01:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
service covering accidents investigating
 
01:06:00.549 --> 01:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
criminal activity
 
01:06:04.470 --> 01:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
so the state police are split up into
 
01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
several troop stations um six troop
 
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
stations across the state
 
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's troupe a and epping which covers
 
01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
rockingham and stafford
 
01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
stratford counties that's covering 90s

interstate 95 the term spaulding
 
01:06:20.789 --> 01:06:20.799 align:start position:0%
turnpike and route 101
 
01:06:23.829 --> 01:06:23.839 align:start position:0%
as well as route 125.
 
01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
troop b in bedford they cover
 
01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county and portion of
 
01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
rockingham county that's attached to
 
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
interstate 93.
 
01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh troop c and keane they cover sullivan
 
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
and cheshire counties
 
01:06:38.309 --> 01:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
troop d in concord covers merrimack
 
01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
county and then also covers
 
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh 93 from hooksett to ashland
 
01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
and also they're responsible for all the
 
01:06:47.589 --> 01:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
coverage on 89.
 
01:06:50.309 --> 01:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
troop e is responsible for belknap and
 
01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
carroll counties
 
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
and then troop f uh is responsible for

coasts and grafton counties
 
01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
and troop f is actually the largest
 
01:06:59.349 --> 01:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
geographic area
 
01:07:01.990 --> 01:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
of um of any of the the primary troop
 
01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.670 align:start position:0%
of um of any of the the primary troop
stations

01:07:03.670 --> 01:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
stations
 
01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
that is with the exception of troop g
 
01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
which troop g has a
 
01:07:09.510 --> 01:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
statewide uh presence they are the
 
01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:10.470 align:start position:0%
statewide uh presence they are the
commercial

01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
01:07:13.349 --> 01:07:13.359 align:start position:0%

state police
 
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
so they implement state laws and federal

those vehicles are on the road
 
01:07:28.069 --> 01:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
and they also handle the overweight
 
01:07:30.549 --> 01:07:30.559 align:start position:0%
vehicle limits on roads and bridges
 
01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
and then finally the civilian group is
 
01:07:34.309 --> 01:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
under troop g
 
01:07:36.549 --> 01:07:36.559 align:start position:0%
the automotive equipment inspectors and
 
01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
they uh
 
01:07:40.549 --> 01:07:40.559 align:start position:0%
they enforce laws and rules uh related
 
01:07:40.559 --> 01:07:40.870 align:start position:0%
they enforce laws and rules uh related
to

01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:07:43.109 --> 01:07:43.119 align:start position:0%
auto dealerships and automotive
 
01:07:44.549 --> 01:07:44.559 align:start position:0%
inspection stations
 
01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh throughout the state uh the marine
 
01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:48.549 align:start position:0%
uh throughout the state uh the marine
patrol

01:07:48.549 --> 01:07:48.559 align:start position:0%
patrol
 
01:07:51.829 --> 01:07:51.839 align:start position:0%
is another section they're charged by
 
01:07:51.839 --> 01:07:52.549 align:start position:0%
is another section they're charged by
statute

01:07:52.549 --> 01:07:52.559 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
with enforcing voting laws and rules
 
01:07:57.349 --> 01:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
and they also provide training for the
 
01:08:00.150 --> 01:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
voting public and they also install
 
01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
navigational things so buoys um
 
01:08:07.109 --> 01:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
those types of things they uh patrol
 
01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
approximately 975 public bodies of water
 
01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
the jurisdiction includes any public
 
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
body of water that's
 
01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
larger than 10 acres in size and they
 
01:08:19.669 --> 01:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
also patrol the atlantic ocean
 
01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:22.880 align:start position:0%

01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
the mobile enforcement team is a
 
01:08:29.110 --> 01:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
specialized unit
 
01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
whose mission is to detect and enforce
 
01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
crimes and hazards on the roadways in
 
01:08:34.870 --> 01:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
communities throughout new hampshire
 
01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
and they've they work closely with local
 
01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
agencies in conjunction with drug
 
01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement units to combat
 
01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
illegal narcotic distributions in their
 
01:08:42.719 --> 01:08:45.030 align:start position:0%
illegal narcotic distributions in their
communities

01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
we also have a special services group
 
01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:48.229 align:start position:0%
we also have a special services group
which

01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
is really special services are
 
01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:51.910 align:start position:0%
is really special services are
additional

01:08:51.910 --> 01:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
additional
 
01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
specialties that troopers have in

so very specific and uh detailed uh
 
01:10:34.149 --> 01:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
stuff that they that they deal with then
 
01:10:34.159 --> 01:10:35.189 align:start position:0%
stuff that they that they deal with then
the

01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
other side of the investigative criminal
 
01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
justice information area is the justice
 
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
information bureau
 
01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
so this is the area that contains the
 
01:10:45.510 --> 01:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
permits and licensing unit criminal
 
01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:46.390 align:start position:0%

01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
uh the communications unit
 
01:10:50.229 --> 01:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
communications is
 
01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
a centralized dispatch center we've got
 
01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
staffing in two different locations one
 
01:10:56.709 --> 01:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
of which is in the uh
 
01:10:58.709 --> 01:10:58.719 align:start position:0%
the ipoc the incident planning and
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
operations center in concord
 
01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
we also have a backup location in true
 
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
beth which is located in twin mountain
 
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
and these staff they they dispatch
 
01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
for all state police all troops they
 
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
dispatch for
 
01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
liquor enforcement the state fire
 
01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:15.189 align:start position:0%
liquor enforcement the state fire
marshal

01:11:15.189 --> 01:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
marshal
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
department of natural and cultural
 
01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
resources and also
 
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
fish and game and that's uh the fish and
 
01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
game pieces
 
01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
is a is a new change that's occurred
 
01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
within this budget as well
 
01:11:27.430 --> 01:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
as far as dispatching full time from
 
01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
fish and game we've always dispatched
 
01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:30.630 align:start position:0%
fish and game we've always dispatched
part-time

01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
part-time
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
but now that's going to be a full-time
 
01:11:35.430 --> 01:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
dispatching function
 
01:11:39.030 --> 01:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
the the j-1 area that's the
 
01:11:42.070 --> 01:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
one network environment for justice it's
 
01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:42.390 align:start position:0%
one network environment for justice it's
a

01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a system that allows
 
01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
us to capture criminal justice
 
01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
information at the source
 
01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
and then transfer that to interested
 
01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:52.950 align:start position:0%
and then transfer that to interested
parties

01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
parties
 
01:11:56.070 --> 01:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
so it's transferring information from
 
01:11:59.830 --> 01:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
police to dmv to courts in
 
01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
back and forth and all every which way
 
01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
the goal is to reduce errors and reduce
 
01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
duplicate data entry and really just
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
improve the overall function of
 
01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
of the criminal justice system in the
 
01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:13.110 align:start position:0%
of the criminal justice system in the
state

01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:12:14.470 --> 01:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
and there's certain functions that have
 
01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
been moving to an online component
 
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
over time like e-tickets e-complaints
 
01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:20.630 align:start position:0%
over time like e-tickets e-complaints
e-citations

01:12:20.630 --> 01:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
e-citations
 
01:12:23.669 --> 01:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
and also live span fingerprint taking
 
01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
electronically through the live scan
 
01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
live scan machines
 
01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
the criminal records unit falls under
 
01:12:32.630 --> 01:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
this area they maintain the criminal
 
01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
history record information
 
01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
the which is the repository
 
01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
they also manage the afis system the
 
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
automated fingerprint identification
 
01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:43.750 align:start position:0%
automated fingerprint identification
system

01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
and ucr the uniform crime reporting
 
01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:48.470 align:start position:0%
and ucr the uniform crime reporting
system

01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
permits and licensing which um they
 
01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
operate the gun line as we mentioned the
 
01:12:54.550 --> 01:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner mentioned earlier
 
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
where federal firearm license dealers
 
01:12:57.990 --> 01:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
ffls request
 
01:12:59.750 --> 01:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
background checks for new hampshire
 
01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
residents purchasing handguns
 
01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:02.070 align:start position:0%
residents purchasing handguns
commercially

01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
commercially
 
01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
they also do backgrounds on individuals
 
01:13:06.790 --> 01:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
applying for non-resident concealed
 
01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:07.270 align:start position:0%
applying for non-resident concealed
pistol

01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
pistol
 
01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
licenses they also license armed and
 
01:13:12.870 --> 01:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
unarmed pis private investigators
 
01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
security guards bail bondsmen
 
01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
and also issue certificates for the use
 
01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:25.030 --> 01:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot going on in the
 
01:13:27.030 --> 01:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
division of state police
 
01:13:29.830 --> 01:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
there's definitely a sworn aspect with
 
01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
law enforcement activities there's also
 
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
the civilian aspect with a lot of
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
justice information
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
uh pieces but it's all it all falls
 
01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
under state policing purview
 
01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh representative heath you have a
 
01:13:42.870 --> 01:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
question yes i do thank you
 
01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
that is that was unbelievable your
 
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
presentation excellent
 
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
um that division is certainly
 
01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
clearly very significant now
 
01:13:57.910 --> 01:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
as a result of the commission the lia
 
01:13:57.920 --> 01:13:59.270 align:start position:0%
as a result of the commission the lia
commission

01:13:59.270 --> 01:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
all of those individuals are going to
 
01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
require um
 
01:14:04.950 --> 01:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
a degree of training based on the
 
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations that came out of the
 
01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:07.430 align:start position:0%
recommendations that came out of the
committee

01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
are you going to incur additional costs
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
as a result of that
 
01:14:19.669 --> 01:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
yes yeah we will in fact i'll jump ahead
 
01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
based on that question we do have um
 
01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
increased training costs these are
 
01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
estimates of course because we don't
 
01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
know what the true cost will be but
 
01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:29.110 align:start position:0%
know what the true cost will be but
whereas

01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
whereas
 
01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
we included this within the budget 131
 
01:14:32.630 --> 01:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
000 each year
 
01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
representative heath yeah
 
01:14:42.070 --> 01:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to add to the colonel and
 
01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
his uh staff
 
01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
do a monthly update on lee act as you
 
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
know i believe it was
 
01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
49 recommendations the government
 
01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:50.229 align:start position:0%
49 recommendations the government
governor

01:14:50.229 --> 01:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
governor
 
01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
approved all of them and so we're
 
01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
tracking you know
 
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
what we've done what are our deadlines
 
01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
you know there are many in there for
 
01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:57.750 align:start position:0%
you know there are many in there for
training

01:14:57.750 --> 01:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
community engagement uh integrating
 
01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
you know professionals uh uh mental
 
01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:04.229 align:start position:0%
you know professionals uh uh mental
wellness

01:15:04.229 --> 01:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
wellness
 
01:15:07.430 --> 01:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
with our tactical teams uh as well
 
01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
obviously as our uh
 
01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
our digital evidence collection project
 
01:15:13.350 --> 01:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
which includes the uh
 
01:15:15.189 --> 01:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
body cameras and the cruiser cameras but
 
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a global
 
01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
digital collection of good
 
01:15:23.669 --> 01:15:23.679 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much representative
 
01:15:23.679 --> 01:15:23.990 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much representative
lynn

01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
lynn
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am sure thank you uh my question
 
01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
was directed and i
 
01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
i think i saw in your in your last slide
 
01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
before the current one
 
01:15:38.229 --> 01:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
that there are nine vacancies in the
 
01:15:39.189 --> 01:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
forensic lab
 
01:15:41.830 --> 01:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm just how many people in total
 
01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
are in the forensic lab that seems like
 
01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
01:15:47.669 --> 01:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:50.229 --> 01:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
um yeah i can give you a minute i can
 
01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
tell you how many are are in total
 
01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
that it it is a lot i mean that's not
 
01:15:59.430 --> 01:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
nine vacancies there's nothing to um
 
01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
that that's that that's a lot and
 
01:16:07.669 --> 01:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
what what we would um
 
01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
again the challenge ends up being
 
01:16:13.590 --> 01:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
identifying those areas within the lab
 
01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
that have a deadline
 
01:16:16.709 --> 01:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
that there's a statutory deadline
 
01:16:18.630 --> 01:16:18.640 align:start position:0%
there's a case pending there's something
 
01:16:20.229 --> 01:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
that needs to happen within a period of
 
01:16:20.239 --> 01:16:21.110 align:start position:0%
that needs to happen within a period of
time

01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:16:24.149 --> 01:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
make prioritizing those activities
 
01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
with the understanding that there will
 
01:16:27.189 --> 01:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
be delays in other
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
in in other lab services that are
 
01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:32.550 align:start position:0%
in in other lab services that are
provided

01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:35.430 --> 01:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
let me see if i can if i can quickly
 
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
give you the
 
01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
the position count i'll jump in
 
01:16:42.310 --> 01:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
steve well steve's looking for uh judge
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
so as you know the lab
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
we've got three two major components the
 
01:16:47.430 --> 01:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
crims side on the left
 
01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
the toxicology side on the right and
 
01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
they also do digital evidence they've
 
01:16:54.390 --> 01:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
had a couple vacancies on the um
 
01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
cyber the um computer crime area but
 
01:16:59.669 --> 01:16:59.679 align:start position:0%
you know i know the colonel looks very
 
01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
closely at the backlogs whether it's on
 
01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
fingerprints or
 
01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
but i know with with the marijuana
 
01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
decrease of submissions to the lab it's
 
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
allowed them to
 
01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
concentrate more on the you know the
 
01:17:13.030 --> 01:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
narcotics of fentanyl and
 
01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:14.229 align:start position:0%
narcotics of fentanyl and
methamphetamine

01:17:14.229 --> 01:17:14.239 align:start position:0%
methamphetamine
 
01:17:16.630 --> 01:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
and um so the thing with the lab that we
 
01:17:18.149 --> 01:17:18.159 align:start position:0%
have to pay attention to is the the
 
01:17:20.229 --> 01:17:20.239 align:start position:0%
training time to get somebody in there
 
01:17:22.149 --> 01:17:22.159 align:start position:0%
whether they're on the fingerprint side
 
01:17:23.669 --> 01:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
of the house you know to get them to the
 
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
point or
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
ballistics the firearms comes to mind
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
because it takes a couple years really
 
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
to get trained up but
 
01:17:32.709 --> 01:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
um but we're i know that number seems
 
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
high but
 
01:17:37.669 --> 01:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
we're working very close to maintain um
 
01:17:39.990 --> 01:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
you know we're meeting all the deadlines
 
01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
for court
 
01:17:45.189 --> 01:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
and uh and that's but but again
 
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
you're right it is a you know there's a
 
01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
significant amount of vacancies there
 
01:17:50.229 --> 01:17:50.239 align:start position:0%
steve do you have the total number yeah
 
01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
so there's 31 total positions in the
 
01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
forensic lab
 
01:17:56.630 --> 01:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
there's 10 positions in the toxicology
 
01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:57.990 align:start position:0%
there's 10 positions in the toxicology
lab

01:17:57.990 --> 01:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
lab
 
01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
and then i'm looking for the urine codis
 
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
so so maybe what we can do steve offline
 
01:18:11.189 --> 01:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
we'll get
 
01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
we'll get the judge where those
 
01:18:14.229 --> 01:18:14.239 align:start position:0%
positions are in the lab
 
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
which ones are on krem which ones are on
 
01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:17.590 align:start position:0%
which ones are on krem which ones are on
top

01:18:17.590 --> 01:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
top
 
01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
i just don't want to waste any more time
 
01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
looking for it yeah no no that's fine
 
01:18:21.189 --> 01:18:21.199 align:start position:0%
that's fine
 
01:18:22.470 --> 01:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
and really i think you've really
 
01:18:24.149 --> 01:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
answered my question i i was really
 
01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
concerned about you know what
 
01:18:28.229 --> 01:18:28.239 align:start position:0%
if it was having a significant impact on
 
01:18:30.070 --> 01:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
on providing
 
01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
you know evidence that was needed in
 
01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
court or or you know that kind of thing
 
01:18:34.550 --> 01:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
and it's like
 
01:18:36.229 --> 01:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
it sounds like it sounds like you've
 
01:18:38.229 --> 01:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
been able to handle it but
 
01:18:39.910 --> 01:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
obviously things things would be better
 
01:18:41.590 --> 01:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
if you had if you had the
 
01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
you know at least some of those
 
01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
positions filled that
 
01:18:46.870 --> 01:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
sounds to me yeah we're clearly not
 
01:18:48.630 --> 01:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
ready to take a victory lap because as
 
01:18:50.070 --> 01:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
you know this past year has been tough
 
01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
to measure against with covet as to
 
01:18:54.070 --> 01:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
what's being submitted what isn't so
 
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
um but what we we worked very closely
 
01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
with them
 
01:18:59.590 --> 01:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh the toxicology side you know i had a
 
01:19:01.590 --> 01:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
meeting this morning on highway safety
 
01:19:03.189 --> 01:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
it's important for highway safety to get
 
01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
the tax results for the fatal
 
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
so um so we look at the i'll just say
 
01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:08.229 align:start position:0%
so um so we look at the i'll just say
this

01:19:08.229 --> 01:19:08.239 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:19:10.470 --> 01:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
we look at the metrics the kpis in every
 
01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:11.270 align:start position:0%
we look at the metrics the kpis in every
division

01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
division
 
01:19:13.510 --> 01:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
what what do you need to be doing and
 
01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
are you meeting your demands so
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
i'll i will look at that and i will have
 
01:19:18.630 --> 01:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
steve get a
 
01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
a a small memo back to representative
 
01:19:22.790 --> 01:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
bombardier on the lab
 
01:19:26.149 --> 01:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
i i do thank you very much i do have a
 
01:19:26.159 --> 01:19:27.350 align:start position:0%
i i do thank you very much i do have a
question

01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
i thought a couple three years ago that
 
01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
we added
 
01:19:35.430 --> 01:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
uh people to the toxicology
 
01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
side because of all the problems with
 
01:19:42.470 --> 01:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
fentanyl and meth and heroin and
 
01:19:45.910 --> 01:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
now i see that crystal meth is
 
01:19:47.590 --> 01:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
raising its ugly head here in new
 
01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire so
 
01:19:54.070 --> 01:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
we're not i hope we're not decreasing
 
01:19:56.229 --> 01:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
the number of people
 
01:20:01.669 --> 01:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
point point well taken
 
01:20:09.350 --> 01:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
just steve you don't need to give it to
 
01:20:12.629 --> 01:20:12.639 align:start position:0%
me now just okay
 
01:20:14.470 --> 01:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
yes we're we're going to get back
 
01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
together here and yep
 
01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
next week we'll get you the breakdown so
 
01:20:20.229 --> 01:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
you can see but the vast majority of
 
01:20:22.470 --> 01:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
those are not in the toxicology lab it's
 
01:20:24.629 --> 01:20:24.639 align:start position:0%
either one or two positions
 
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
i believe that i believe it's one but
 
01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
i'll get you the we'll get the yeah
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about it next time very good
 
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
so the state police budget request the
 
01:20:38.950 --> 01:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
governor's budget for fy 22
 
01:20:41.590 --> 01:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
recommended budget is 96.5 million
 
01:20:43.590 --> 01:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
dollars which is a 12.9
 
01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
increase over 21 and 99.8 million
 
01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:47.590 align:start position:0%
increase over 21 and 99.8 million
dollars

01:20:47.590 --> 01:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
in fy 23 which is a 3.5 percent increase
 
01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
over fy 22.
 
01:20:56.709 --> 01:20:56.719 align:start position:0%
um the significant changes here have to
 
01:20:56.719 --> 01:20:57.189 align:start position:0%
um the significant changes here have to
do

01:20:57.189 --> 01:20:57.199 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:21:00.550 --> 01:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
with um a 3.4 million dollar increase in
 
01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:01.189 align:start position:0%
with um a 3.4 million dollar increase in
22

01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
22
 
01:21:04.070 --> 01:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
and a 3.3 million dollar increase in 23
 
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
due to salary and benefit
 
01:21:07.669 --> 01:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
increases from expected employee
 
01:21:10.229 --> 01:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
increments and then that 27th pay period
 
01:21:11.990 --> 01:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
in fy 23.
 
01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
this was partially offset by a 1.3
 
01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:15.669 align:start position:0%
this was partially offset by a 1.3
million

01:21:15.669 --> 01:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:21:19.350 --> 01:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
decrease in fy 22 and a 1.4 million
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
decrease in 23 from savings associated
 
01:21:23.830 --> 01:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
with those 15
 
01:21:26.229 --> 01:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
unfunded civilian positions as i
 
01:21:28.229 --> 01:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned before there are 23
 
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
unfunded troopers um those are reflected
 
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
in the number 38 here
 
01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
under the unfunded classified position
 
01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
we're only really speaking to the 15
 
01:21:39.270 --> 01:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
unfunded positions
 
01:21:40.950 --> 01:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
throughout the presentation and as far
 
01:21:42.550 --> 01:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
as requesting funding
 
01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
to to refund those 15 only
 
01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
the 4.3 million dollar d increase in fy
 
01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
22 it's due in large part on the
 
01:21:53.990 --> 01:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
operating side
 
01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
to doit costs that i mentioned in the
 
01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:58.470 align:start position:0%
to doit costs that i mentioned in the
admin

01:21:58.470 --> 01:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
admin
 
01:22:00.470 --> 01:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
division used to be there were
 
01:22:02.950 --> 01:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
reallocated out to the appropriate areas
 
01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
based on
 
01:22:06.390 --> 01:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
which divisions used the doit services
 
01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
so that really
 
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
increased the depart division of state
 
01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
police's operating budget
 
01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
um in fy 22 and 23
 
01:22:16.870 --> 01:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
and then we also have a 1.6 million
 
01:22:18.310 --> 01:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
dollar increase due to increased
 
01:22:19.350 --> 01:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
operating costs
 
01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
because the cost of doing business is
 
01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
continuing to increase
 
01:22:24.870 --> 01:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle costs have increased for
 
01:22:26.470 --> 01:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
replacement cruisers
 
01:22:28.629 --> 01:22:28.639 align:start position:0%
um also the costs that we started to
 
01:22:29.669 --> 01:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
speak to about the
 
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh additional training related to lee
 
01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:32.709 align:start position:0%
uh additional training related to lee
act

01:22:32.709 --> 01:22:32.719 align:start position:0%
act
 
01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
those things are are driving just an
 
01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
overall increased cost of
 
01:22:39.590 --> 01:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
law enforcement in the state
 
01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
we also replaced 1.9 million dollars in
 
01:22:44.310 --> 01:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
01:22:47.910 --> 01:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
with 911 funds for these communications
 
01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
function and that's due to the
 
01:22:51.990 --> 01:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
weaknesses in general fund highway fund
 
01:22:53.830 --> 01:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
and turnpike fund revenues
 
01:22:56.790 --> 01:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
so we were able to eliminate that draw
 
01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:57.110 align:start position:0%
so we were able to eliminate that draw
on

01:22:57.110 --> 01:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
the the general fund
 
01:23:03.110 --> 01:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
so the lee act expenses this this slide
 
01:23:04.950 --> 01:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
shows the new funding that's included
 
01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
within the budget
 
01:23:09.189 --> 01:23:09.199 align:start position:0%
so this funding uh includes uh funding
 
01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
for body and cruiser cameras
 
01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire state police it's
 
01:23:15.189 --> 01:23:15.199 align:start position:0%
about a million dollars a year
 
01:23:17.189 --> 01:23:17.199 align:start position:0%
well that that's what's included we're
 
01:23:19.270 --> 01:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
not quite sure what the true cost will
 
01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
be yet there is an rfp that's
 
01:23:23.910 --> 01:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
out on the street and we may need to
 
01:23:25.990 --> 01:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
request additional funds based on
 
01:23:27.990 --> 01:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
where that that comes but our estimate
 
01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
is it's going to be around the million
 
01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:30.390 align:start position:0%
is it's going to be around the million
mark

01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
mark
 
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
that does include three positions as
 
01:23:34.470 --> 01:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
well to manage the program
 
01:23:35.830 --> 01:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
because what's important to understand
 
01:23:37.669 --> 01:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
with body and cruiser cameras
 
01:23:39.669 --> 01:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
is that this is a digital evidence
 
01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
program we're going to be creating
 
01:23:43.669 --> 01:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
new digital evidence streams we have to
 
01:23:45.189 --> 01:23:45.199 align:start position:0%
treat them like evidence we have to
 
01:23:46.950 --> 01:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
record them we have to index them we
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
have to be able to
 
01:23:51.030 --> 01:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
redact information that that's not
 
01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:52.070 align:start position:0%
redact information that that's not
applicable

01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
applicable
 
01:23:54.310 --> 01:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
when people request this information so
 
01:23:56.070 --> 01:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
just putting a camera on everybody
 
01:23:58.709 --> 01:23:58.719 align:start position:0%
isn't uh isn't really the right approach
 
01:23:59.750 --> 01:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure we have the
 
01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure behind it to support the
 
01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:02.390 align:start position:0%
infrastructure behind it to support the
program

01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:24:05.430 --> 01:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
um just add to that too this is to all
 
01:24:06.790 --> 01:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
our digital evidence
 
01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
every picture we have from fatal car
 
01:24:10.390 --> 01:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
crashes from
 
01:24:12.790 --> 01:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
crime scenes to a trooper making a car
 
01:24:13.830 --> 01:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
stop and
 
01:24:16.070 --> 01:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
taking a picture of a you know
 
01:24:18.229 --> 01:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
contraband in a glove box and
 
01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
how do we get it to headquarters how do
 
01:24:22.229 --> 01:24:22.239 align:start position:0%
we store it how do we maintain it
 
01:24:24.390 --> 01:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
how do we disseminate it how do we deal
 
01:24:25.830 --> 01:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
with 91as
 
01:24:28.149 --> 01:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
how do we have synergy with prosecution
 
01:24:29.669 --> 01:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
with defense attorneys
 
01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
and um again there's there's some
 
01:24:33.189 --> 01:24:33.199 align:start position:0%
unknowns that we won't know until the
 
01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
rfp comes back but we
 
01:24:36.390 --> 01:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure we do it right
 
01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
we're a little unique
 
01:24:40.950 --> 01:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
in our rfp because take for example
 
01:24:42.950 --> 01:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh the manchester police department
 
01:24:43.990 --> 01:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
their cars come
 
01:24:46.149 --> 01:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
in and out of one central location where
 
01:24:48.070 --> 01:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
they have their data downloaded
 
01:24:50.390 --> 01:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
they can do a hut swap we have troopers
 
01:24:52.629 --> 01:24:52.639 align:start position:0%
working in remote areas where
 
01:24:54.709 --> 01:24:54.719 align:start position:0%
they may not come to one central point
 
01:24:55.830 --> 01:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
they may you know
 
01:24:57.350 --> 01:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
maybe so we're looking at different
 
01:24:59.030 --> 01:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
options so now we're looking at
 
01:25:01.669 --> 01:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a you know an rfp on
 
01:25:03.430 --> 01:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
wireless options so it's the
 
01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
it's the downloading and storage which
 
01:25:07.110 --> 01:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
is the real
 
01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
um driver to this and uh i'm lucky to
 
01:25:11.590 --> 01:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
have ac rick bailey
 
01:25:13.350 --> 01:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
who's helping manage this project so
 
01:25:15.590 --> 01:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
rick is very very uh
 
01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
strong in in i.t and he's working very
 
01:25:20.629 --> 01:25:20.639 align:start position:0%
closely with dennis goulet on this
 
01:25:22.470 --> 01:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
will you be able to get us information
 
01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
on storage i remember back in the day
 
01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
when i was on criminal
 
01:25:28.629 --> 01:25:28.639 align:start position:0%
one of the barriers to um to these sorts
 
01:25:29.669 --> 01:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
of programs
 
01:25:31.669 --> 01:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
had to do with not so much the cost of
 
01:25:33.110 --> 01:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
the equipment but the cost of the
 
01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:34.149 align:start position:0%
the equipment but the cost of the
storage

01:25:34.149 --> 01:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
storage
 
01:25:36.950 --> 01:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
and the years since has storage become
 
01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:37.350 align:start position:0%
and the years since has storage become
less

01:25:37.350 --> 01:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
less
 
01:25:38.950 --> 01:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
expensive and will we be able to get
 
01:25:40.950 --> 01:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
some estimates around storage of what
 
01:25:43.030 --> 01:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
you will need in order to do this going
 
01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:43.990 align:start position:0%
you will need in order to do this going
forward

01:25:43.990 --> 01:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:25:46.709 --> 01:25:46.719 align:start position:0%
so we that is part of the um proposal so
 
01:25:49.110 --> 01:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
we'll know that when the rfp comes back
 
01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
so yes but to your point
 
01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
representative bucco you have a question
 
01:25:58.950 --> 01:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
yes uh yes i do thank you um
 
01:25:59.910 --> 01:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh
 
01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
i i thought in the last budget cycle we
 
01:26:03.030 --> 01:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
approved uh
 
01:26:05.510 --> 01:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
dash cams for all the cruisers has that
 
01:26:07.110 --> 01:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
been carried out or what what's the
 
01:26:08.709 --> 01:26:08.719 align:start position:0%
status of that program
 
01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
no so so what happened was we had a
 
01:26:13.590 --> 01:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
project in place that was looking
 
01:26:16.550 --> 01:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
just at in cruiser cameras but now we've
 
01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:17.350 align:start position:0%
just at in cruiser cameras but now we've
added

01:26:17.350 --> 01:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
added
 
01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
in cruiser um and the body cameras so we
 
01:26:21.990 --> 01:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
will have the best
 
01:26:24.229 --> 01:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
system in place i think so we're going
 
01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
to have uh
 
01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
you know full 360 uh coverage
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
so so this is this is in addition to
 
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
what was what was previously approved
 
01:26:38.790 --> 01:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
yes sir or that the dash cams that's
 
01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:39.350 align:start position:0%
yes sir or that the dash cams that's
correct

01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
but i just want to be clear with
 
01:26:42.629 --> 01:26:42.639 align:start position:0%
everyone well they are not in now
 
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
so we are waiting for you know the
 
01:26:47.110 --> 01:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
proposal back and we've got a timeline
 
01:26:48.950 --> 01:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
as to when we hope to get them in plan
 
01:26:51.430 --> 01:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
implemented you know into governor
 
01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
council on this oh
 
01:26:54.070 --> 01:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
okay that was my question i didn't know
 
01:26:55.990 --> 01:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
what the status of the program was yeah
 
01:26:57.830 --> 01:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:27:02.470 --> 01:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:08.709 --> 01:27:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:11.189 --> 01:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
so the um the other lee act we talked
 
01:27:13.110 --> 01:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
about increased trading costs the other
 
01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh cost is related to medical and
 
01:27:17.189 --> 01:27:17.199 align:start position:0%
psychological support
 
01:27:19.510 --> 01:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
um contracts with professionals to
 
01:27:21.189 --> 01:27:21.199 align:start position:0%
support the swat team
 
01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
so those are very stressful situations
 
01:27:25.110 --> 01:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
and one of the recommendations was that
 
01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
we have those resources available to
 
01:27:29.430 --> 01:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
those teams when they're
 
01:27:31.590 --> 01:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
when they're out in the field so there
 
01:27:33.910 --> 01:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
there's the sum of our of our lee act
 
01:27:36.870 --> 01:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
components um permits and licensing unit
 
01:27:39.430 --> 01:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned earlier we're funding
 
01:27:43.030 --> 01:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me just a moment uh
 
01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
i know that um police standards and
 
01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:47.669 align:start position:0%
i know that um police standards and
training

01:27:47.669 --> 01:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:27:50.790 --> 01:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
are going to be doing this
 
01:27:53.910 --> 01:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
type of training are you working with
 
01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:54.390 align:start position:0%
type of training are you working with
them

01:27:54.390 --> 01:27:54.400 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:27:58.550 --> 01:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it's included
 
01:28:01.270 --> 01:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
in their training program that they're
 
01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
going to be setting up
 
01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
over the next couple years
 
01:28:07.350 --> 01:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
that's a great question uh
 
01:28:09.270 --> 01:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
representative and yes uh
 
01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
director skipper was on the league
 
01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
commission and we have had
 
01:28:15.270 --> 01:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
lengthy conversations about you know
 
01:28:17.189 --> 01:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
once we develop these modules
 
01:28:20.229 --> 01:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
whether they're on uh unconscious bias
 
01:28:22.510 --> 01:28:22.520 align:start position:0%
or use of force or you know
 
01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:23.910 align:start position:0%
or use of force or you know
de-escalation

01:28:23.910 --> 01:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
de-escalation
 
01:28:25.830 --> 01:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
we're working together so that we can
 
01:28:27.030 --> 01:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
share and leverage them
 
01:28:30.709 --> 01:28:30.719 align:start position:0%
and um you know and so to use them
 
01:28:32.790 --> 01:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
across the board and you know a lot of
 
01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
this training has to get done at the
 
01:28:35.590 --> 01:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
local level you know
 
01:28:37.590 --> 01:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
everybody does not go to to police
 
01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
stanza trainer to get it so
 
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
to your point we're trying to work
 
01:28:42.229 --> 01:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
together to get
 
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
the most bang for our buck here on with
 
01:28:46.709 --> 01:28:46.719 align:start position:0%
these modules
 
01:28:51.030 --> 01:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:53.110 --> 01:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
so the permits and licensing positions
 
01:28:55.350 --> 01:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
we already spoke to those
 
01:28:58.629 --> 01:28:58.639 align:start position:0%
marine patrol new positions we do have
 
01:28:59.990 --> 01:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
two new marine patrol
 
01:29:03.270 --> 01:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
officer two positions those are both 100
 
01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
federally funded from the coast guard
 
01:29:07.350 --> 01:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
grant and those are to meet demands for
 
01:29:09.590 --> 01:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
services out on the seacoast
 
01:29:11.430 --> 01:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
patrols out in hampton beach and also
 
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
cargo escorts that are required to be
 
01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:13.990 align:start position:0%
cargo escorts that are required to be
done

01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:29:16.390 --> 01:29:16.400 align:start position:0%
um bringing cargo in required by
 
01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
homeland security
 
01:29:19.510 --> 01:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh and then last this isn't really
 
01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:21.199 align:start position:0%
there's no funding necessarily
 
01:29:22.629 --> 01:29:22.639 align:start position:0%
associated with this
 
01:29:24.310 --> 01:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
but there is unification of state
 
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
dispatch services
 
01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
so this budget formally unifies the
 
01:29:29.910 --> 01:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
dispatching operations
 
01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
between fish and game and state police i
 
01:29:34.390 --> 01:29:34.400 align:start position:0%
i think i had mentioned earlier it was a
 
01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:34.950 align:start position:0%
i think i had mentioned earlier it was a
um

01:29:34.950 --> 01:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
we were dispatching on a part-time basis
 
01:29:39.910 --> 01:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
now this will be on a full-time basis
 
01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
and what's key to understand here is
 
01:29:43.270 --> 01:29:43.280 align:start position:0%
that this is the
 
01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
emergency dispatch function only so
 
01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
fish and game operate what they call
 
01:29:49.590 --> 01:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
their law line
 
01:29:51.750 --> 01:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
which the public can call up and ask
 
01:29:52.950 --> 01:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
what do i do about
 
01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
a certain um a certain wildlife issue if
 
01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:56.629 align:start position:0%
a certain um a certain wildlife issue if
um

01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:58.390 --> 01:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
you know if i have a how do i what do i
 
01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
do with the bear that's in my backyard
 
01:30:04.470 --> 01:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
those calls will still go to uh fish and
 
01:30:06.310 --> 01:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
game those won't be routed through
 
01:30:09.030 --> 01:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
through dispatch um the dispatch will be
 
01:30:11.110 --> 01:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
for the emergency functions getting the
 
01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:11.750 align:start position:0%
for the emergency functions getting the
officers

01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
officers
 
01:30:14.550 --> 01:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
out to respond to emergency events uh
 
01:30:16.629 --> 01:30:16.639 align:start position:0%
out in the community
 
01:30:18.790 --> 01:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to add to representative
 
01:30:21.189 --> 01:30:21.199 align:start position:0%
if you look at those marine patrol two
 
01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
full-time positions i think what's
 
01:30:25.350 --> 01:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
important to add is they have struggled
 
01:30:28.070 --> 01:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
um for years i say struggle it's a
 
01:30:30.070 --> 01:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
challenge to recruit the part-timers
 
01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
and the colonel actually did an analysis
 
01:30:33.990 --> 01:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
of how much you can get
 
01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
out of two full full time working 12
 
01:30:38.390 --> 01:30:38.400 align:start position:0%
months a year
 
01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a part-time marine patrol
 
01:30:41.750 --> 01:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
officer so
 
01:30:43.590 --> 01:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
they really did the metrics and numbers
 
01:30:45.430 --> 01:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
on it and uh and it's incredible how
 
01:30:46.709 --> 01:30:46.719 align:start position:0%
much more you can get
 
01:30:49.750 --> 01:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
so i think it's a long-term benefit um
 
01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
and and i know we we have the funding
 
01:30:54.310 --> 01:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
for approximately 50 part-timers and we
 
01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:55.270 align:start position:0%
for approximately 50 part-timers and we
struggle

01:30:55.270 --> 01:30:55.280 align:start position:0%
struggle
 
01:30:59.350 --> 01:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
um every year to maybe hit the 34 steve
 
01:31:03.110 --> 01:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
maybe 35 part-time so i think this is uh
 
01:31:05.270 --> 01:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh i think it's it's very wise uh
 
01:31:08.310 --> 01:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:11.830 --> 01:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
thank you so then moving on if more
 
01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
funding becomes available
 
01:31:15.430 --> 01:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
um to the committee these are the areas
 
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
and state police we would seek
 
01:31:18.310 --> 01:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
additional funding for
 
01:31:20.070 --> 01:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
um so obviously we've already spoken
 
01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
about this but the the first
 
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
is uh funding within the lab for the
 
01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
nine positions
 
01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
in forensics codis and the talks lab um
 
01:31:31.350 --> 01:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
as we mentioned these are uh really
 
01:31:33.510 --> 01:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
required to meet demands for service
 
01:31:35.110 --> 01:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
and if we don't have these positions
 
01:31:37.030 --> 01:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
we'll be forced to um
 
01:31:39.189 --> 01:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
really rely on on existing staff and
 
01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
over time to meet any court deadlines
 
01:31:43.189 --> 01:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
and it will result in delays and some
 
01:31:44.709 --> 01:31:44.719 align:start position:0%
other services
 
01:31:46.709 --> 01:31:46.719 align:start position:0%
and then we also have six existing
 
01:31:49.110 --> 01:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
civilian positions
 
01:31:50.709 --> 01:31:50.719 align:start position:0%
these positions are required for
 
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
administrative support to the troops
 
01:31:55.350 --> 01:31:55.360 align:start position:0%
on the troopers and also direct delivery
 
01:31:57.270 --> 01:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
of public safety services
 
01:31:59.669 --> 01:31:59.679 align:start position:0%
and um the work for this all the all
 
01:32:01.590 --> 01:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
this work would have to be reassigned
 
01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
in many cases it would get reassigned to
 
01:32:05.430 --> 01:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
troopers and again
 
01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
we we don't like to shift administrative
 
01:32:09.430 --> 01:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
duties to a mission
 
01:32:11.110 --> 01:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh public safety service mission
 
01:32:12.550 --> 01:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
delivery person so
 
01:32:15.669 --> 01:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
we want to avoid that at all costs we
 
01:32:15.679 --> 01:32:16.950 align:start position:0%
we want to avoid that at all costs we
also

01:32:16.950 --> 01:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:32:21.189 --> 01:32:21.199 align:start position:0%
have the replacement vehicle plan
 
01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
so we would be seeking an additional 1.5
 
01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:26.390 align:start position:0%
so we would be seeking an additional 1.5
million

01:32:26.390 --> 01:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:32:29.750 --> 01:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
in 22 1.6 and 23 to fund and
 
01:32:33.510 --> 01:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
another 28 cruisers um our our
 
01:32:37.110 --> 01:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
cruiser plan um requires us to have
 
01:32:41.430 --> 01:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
about 410 vehicles for 355
 
01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
troopers and that's because um a trooper
 
01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
without a vehicle can't perform
 
01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
their their duty i mean that's that's a
 
01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
key piece of equipment
 
01:32:51.189 --> 01:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
without the right number of spare
 
01:32:53.110 --> 01:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
vehicles when a trooper has to bring
 
01:32:54.709 --> 01:32:54.719 align:start position:0%
their car in for service they can no
 
01:32:54.719 --> 01:32:55.270 align:start position:0%
their car in for service they can no
longer

01:32:55.270 --> 01:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
longer
 
01:32:58.149 --> 01:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
patrol um and those spare vehicles have
 
01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:33:01.510 --> 01:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
available um across the state because we
 
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
have the statewide footprint so it's not
 
01:33:05.189 --> 01:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
going to help us to have a spare vehicle
 
01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
up at twin mountain if it's needed down
 
01:33:08.550 --> 01:33:08.560 align:start position:0%
in key um
 
01:33:10.709 --> 01:33:10.719 align:start position:0%
and so that's the number of vehicles
 
01:33:11.910 --> 01:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
that we're looking for
 
01:33:15.030 --> 01:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
um each year we're each budget cycle
 
01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
we're unable to
 
01:33:17.669 --> 01:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
to purchase the amount that we need to
 
01:33:19.430 --> 01:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
really meet that threshold
 
01:33:21.030 --> 01:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
and most recently we've had our own
 
01:33:23.350 --> 01:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
orders reduced because of
 
01:33:26.070 --> 01:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
shortages that were because of the
 
01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
pandemic there were shortages in
 
01:33:31.270 --> 01:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
supplies and materials and so our orders
 
01:33:32.310 --> 01:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
have been reduced
 
01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
by six vehicles here to three vehicles
 
01:33:35.990 --> 01:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
there which doesn't sound like
 
01:33:37.750 --> 01:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
a lot but when you filter that in over
 
01:33:39.350 --> 01:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
time with a replacement plan
 
01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
that has a significant burden to us so
 
01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:42.470 align:start position:0%
that has a significant burden to us so
um

01:33:42.470 --> 01:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:44.709 --> 01:33:44.719 align:start position:0%
we do have replacement vehicles budgeted
 
01:33:46.229 --> 01:33:46.239 align:start position:0%
these would be additional vehicles to
 
01:33:48.070 --> 01:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
help us meet our um
 
01:33:50.709 --> 01:33:50.719 align:start position:0%
our replacement plan goals and then
 
01:33:52.629 --> 01:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
detective bureau over time
 
01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
this is an area that we've always
 
01:33:55.910 --> 01:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
struggled with um
 
01:33:59.030 --> 01:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
it's uh to meet demands for services uh
 
01:34:00.950 --> 01:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
investigative services major crime
 
01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:02.870 align:start position:0%
investigative services major crime
investigations

01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
investigations
 
01:34:06.149 --> 01:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
there's the work has to be done
 
01:34:08.070 --> 01:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
and um and it has to be done as soon as
 
01:34:09.669 --> 01:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
possible after the event
 
01:34:12.310 --> 01:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
um and um there's very little control
 
01:34:13.669 --> 01:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
that we have it's not like a typical
 
01:34:15.189 --> 01:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
administrative function where you have
 
01:34:17.030 --> 01:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
more control over overtime
 
01:34:18.870 --> 01:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
there's less control in these in these
 
01:34:21.350 --> 01:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
cases and so an additional 150
 
01:34:24.149 --> 01:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
000 in each year would would put us at a
 
01:34:26.070 --> 01:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
spot where we'd feel more comfortable
 
01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
um if not we have to rely on vacancies
 
01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:29.669 align:start position:0%
um if not we have to rely on vacancies
and

01:34:29.669 --> 01:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:32.870 --> 01:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
um and potentially transfers to to fund
 
01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
any overage in
 
01:34:35.350 --> 01:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
overtime that we might have to meet
 
01:34:37.590 --> 01:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
demands for service
 
01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
representative petrie you have a
 
01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:41.270 align:start position:0%
representative petrie you have a
question

01:34:41.270 --> 01:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:34:45.669 --> 01:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
yes yes madam chair uh thank you uh
 
01:34:47.430 --> 01:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
all-wheel drive vehicles is that what
 
01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
you're replacing the vehicles with
 
01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
or as many as you can yes
 
01:34:56.070 --> 01:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
the the the new cruiser build that we
 
01:34:58.149 --> 01:34:58.159 align:start position:0%
utilize uh the chargers are all wheel
 
01:34:59.430 --> 01:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
drives now
 
01:35:03.189 --> 01:35:03.199 align:start position:0%
and why is that if i may
 
01:35:06.310 --> 01:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
uh well the state police are uh respond
 
01:35:07.590 --> 01:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
to the motor vehicle
 
01:35:10.550 --> 01:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
crashes on snowy days kind of like i
 
01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's doing where you guys
 
01:35:14.310 --> 01:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
are but it's snowing in concord now
 
01:35:16.950 --> 01:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
and um and so having the all-wheel drive
 
01:35:18.709 --> 01:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
is is really critical if they're
 
01:35:21.750 --> 01:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
the first responders to uh to any motor
 
01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:23.360 align:start position:0%
vehicle accidents on on
 
01:35:26.310 --> 01:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
snowy on the snowy roadways very good
 
01:35:29.590 --> 01:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:35:32.709 --> 01:35:32.719 align:start position:0%
we also purchased tahoes um
 
01:35:34.709 --> 01:35:34.719 align:start position:0%
for the troopers in the north country
 
01:35:36.709 --> 01:35:36.719 align:start position:0%
and i in one trip to colebrook i was
 
01:35:39.109 --> 01:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
surprised to learn that it was the uh
 
01:35:41.510 --> 01:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
it was the mud that troopers couldn't
 
01:35:43.030 --> 01:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
even get their car their driveway they
 
01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
were leaving them
 
01:35:46.870 --> 01:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
at i believe colbert pd so but we didn't
 
01:35:48.709 --> 01:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
have the funds to get everybody one so
 
01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
we uh
 
01:35:51.030 --> 01:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
you know the all-wheel drive that's what
 
01:35:52.950 --> 01:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
we're migrating to and for the troopers
 
01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
up in the north country
 
01:35:56.950 --> 01:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
um when we can we've given them a
 
01:35:59.350 --> 01:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
four-wheel drive tahoe
 
01:36:01.350 --> 01:36:01.360 align:start position:0%
representative heath you have a question
 
01:36:03.510 --> 01:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
i do actually it's a request
 
01:36:07.109 --> 01:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair is it possible
 
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
to get this presentation i know we have
 
01:36:10.470 --> 01:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
it virtually
 
01:36:12.629 --> 01:36:12.639 align:start position:0%
digitally but is it possible to get a
 
01:36:13.830 --> 01:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
hard copy i
 
01:36:16.950 --> 01:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
find this format very useful in terms of
 
01:36:18.310 --> 01:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
when we're going to be working on the
 
01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:19.109 align:start position:0%
when we're going to be working on the
budget

01:36:19.109 --> 01:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
um to see what we could
 
01:36:25.270 --> 01:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
include in the budget if if there's any
 
01:36:27.189 --> 01:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
way possible that it could be mailed to
 
01:36:27.199 --> 01:36:28.390 align:start position:0%
way possible that it could be mailed to
us

01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:36:30.310 --> 01:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
or if we could i i wouldn't even mind
 
01:36:31.990 --> 01:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
picking it up in um
 
01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
concord if it's uh
 
01:36:39.430 --> 01:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
nikki can you take care of that for us
 
01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:41.679 align:start position:0%
yeah so uh the the department of
 
01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
transportation budget book that they
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
referred to this morning i should be
 
01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
getting hard copies of that
 
01:36:48.790 --> 01:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
so i can put in the uh the department of
 
01:36:50.550 --> 01:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
safety presentation
 
01:36:51.910 --> 01:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
and mail that out to you later that's
 
01:36:53.669 --> 01:36:53.679 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you so much
 
01:36:55.189 --> 01:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
it's just hard to have everything
 
01:36:57.189 --> 01:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
digitally because we've that
 
01:36:58.870 --> 01:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
we have to have all these different
 
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
computers open to
 
01:37:04.229 --> 01:37:04.239 align:start position:0%
see the information that we need
 
01:37:06.709 --> 01:37:06.719 align:start position:0%
it's just nice to have a hard copy i
 
01:37:06.719 --> 01:37:08.950 align:start position:0%
it's just nice to have a hard copy i
understand

01:37:08.950 --> 01:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:37:11.669 --> 01:37:11.679 align:start position:0%
so vicky we'll get you copies um so that
 
01:37:13.430 --> 01:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
you can include it in your mailing
 
01:37:15.350 --> 01:37:15.360 align:start position:0%
uh i can produce steve it's okay you
 
01:37:17.030 --> 01:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
don't have to worry about that i can
 
01:37:19.669 --> 01:37:19.679 align:start position:0%
i can run copies at the office and i
 
01:37:19.679 --> 01:37:20.070 align:start position:0%
i can run copies at the office and i
appreciate

01:37:20.070 --> 01:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
01:37:23.910 --> 01:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
that though make sure they're in color
 
01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
there you go we'll charge you we'll
 
01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
charge the color copies up to you
 
01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:36.070 --> 01:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
okay so um moving on we've only got
 
01:37:38.070 --> 01:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
maybe four divisions left so we're about
 
01:37:39.669 --> 01:37:39.679 align:start position:0%
halfway there
 
01:37:42.229 --> 01:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
um the division of homeland security and
 
01:37:44.149 --> 01:37:44.159 align:start position:0%
emergency management
 
01:37:46.390 --> 01:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
is responsible for coordinating the
 
01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
state's response to all
 
01:37:51.510 --> 01:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
major um human-caused or natural
 
01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:52.709 align:start position:0%
major um human-caused or natural
disasters

01:37:52.709 --> 01:37:52.719 align:start position:0%
disasters
 
01:37:56.229 --> 01:37:56.239 align:start position:0%
and they um they really form the core of
 
01:37:58.229 --> 01:37:58.239 align:start position:0%
our emergency response organization in
 
01:37:59.830 --> 01:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
the state so they operate the emergency
 
01:38:01.030 --> 01:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
operations center
 
01:38:03.189 --> 01:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
whenever it needs to be activated during
 
01:38:04.790 --> 01:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
major disaster events
 
01:38:07.510 --> 01:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
and this uh this division led by
 
01:38:08.870 --> 01:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
director jen harper
 
01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
has been really instrumental in our
 
01:38:13.270 --> 01:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
clovid19 response function across the
 
01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
state so
 
01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
the role of hsem if you think about it
 
01:38:18.310 --> 01:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
really is coordination
 
01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
um they bring the right people to the
 
01:38:22.709 --> 01:38:22.719 align:start position:0%
table to make sure that um
 
01:38:25.510 --> 01:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
we can respond to disasters across the
 
01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
state and
 
01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
um since this has started they've been
 
01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
an integral part of that
 
01:38:32.629 --> 01:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
response it's really been incredible to
 
01:38:32.639 --> 01:38:33.270 align:start position:0%
response it's really been incredible to
see

01:38:33.270 --> 01:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:38:36.550 --> 01:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
and um and be part of so
 
01:38:38.629 --> 01:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
they're broken into really four sections
 
01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
the operations sections
 
01:38:42.709 --> 01:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
monitors the day-to-day activities
 
01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
incidents and events that are happening
 
01:38:46.149 --> 01:38:46.159 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire that could require some
 
01:38:46.550 --> 01:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
01:38:48.149 --> 01:38:48.159 align:start position:0%
response so they'll be monitoring
 
01:38:50.070 --> 01:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
whether to see if it
 
01:38:52.629 --> 01:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
rises to a degree that requires some
 
01:38:55.830 --> 01:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
sort of action on the state's behalf
 
01:38:57.189 --> 01:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
they operate the state emergency
 
01:38:59.109 --> 01:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
operations center when it
 
01:39:01.990 --> 01:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
when it is operational which serves as
 
01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
the command and control center for the
 
01:39:04.709 --> 01:39:04.719 align:start position:0%
state during
 
01:39:07.830 --> 01:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
emergency and inner issues and then they
 
01:39:10.149 --> 01:39:10.159 align:start position:0%
support interagency coordination
 
01:39:13.030 --> 01:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
and also state statewide executive
 
01:39:15.189 --> 01:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
decision-making authorities in response
 
01:39:15.199 --> 01:39:15.590 align:start position:0%
decision-making authorities in response
to

01:39:15.590 --> 01:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh disasters and events
 
01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
the field services section is
 
01:39:22.550 --> 01:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
responsible for outreach to
 
01:39:25.030 --> 01:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
local communities and state agencies uh
 
01:39:26.310 --> 01:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
and they provide technical
 
01:39:28.790 --> 01:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
and assist organizational assistance for
 
01:39:30.870 --> 01:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
preparing to and responding to
 
01:39:34.470 --> 01:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
um hazards for mitigating
 
01:39:36.709 --> 01:39:36.719 align:start position:0%
natural or human-caused disasters and
 
01:39:36.719 --> 01:39:37.910 align:start position:0%
natural or human-caused disasters and
emergencies

01:39:37.910 --> 01:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
emergencies
 
01:39:39.510 --> 01:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
and the field representatives within
 
01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
this section they also act as liaisons
 
01:39:43.910 --> 01:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
with local communities when the eoc
 
01:39:47.109 --> 01:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
is is activated the planning and grant
 
01:39:47.119 --> 01:39:48.149 align:start position:0%
is is activated the planning and grant
section

01:39:48.149 --> 01:39:48.159 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:39:50.229 --> 01:39:50.239 align:start position:0%
they carry out the critical
 
01:39:52.149 --> 01:39:52.159 align:start position:0%
administrative and management functions
 
01:39:54.070 --> 01:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
related to the federal grants that are
 
01:39:55.669 --> 01:39:55.679 align:start position:0%
administered by hsem
 
01:39:58.149 --> 01:39:58.159 align:start position:0%
these include hazard mitigation grants
 
01:39:58.159 --> 01:39:58.709 align:start position:0%
these include hazard mitigation grants
um

01:39:58.709 --> 01:39:58.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:00.390 --> 01:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
and assistance to local emergency
 
01:40:02.229 --> 01:40:02.239 align:start position:0%
efforts and disaster aids the
 
01:40:04.950 --> 01:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
public assistance grants as well this
 
01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:05.830 align:start position:0%
public assistance grants as well this
section

01:40:05.830 --> 01:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:40:08.629 --> 01:40:08.639 align:start position:0%
develops the annual update for the state
 
01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
emergency operations plan
 
01:40:12.149 --> 01:40:12.159 align:start position:0%
the recovery annex the state hazard
 
01:40:13.590 --> 01:40:13.600 align:start position:0%
mitigation plan
 
01:40:14.950 --> 01:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
and then also the stakeholder
 
01:40:17.030 --> 01:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
preparedness reviews
 
01:40:18.870 --> 01:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
and then also we have the administrative
 
01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
section which includes the office of the
 
01:40:22.229 --> 01:40:22.239 align:start position:0%
director and the business and finance
 
01:40:22.239 --> 01:40:23.109 align:start position:0%
director and the business and finance
staff

01:40:23.109 --> 01:40:23.119 align:start position:0%
staff
 
01:40:25.030 --> 01:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
and community outreach office and so
 
01:40:26.790 --> 01:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
they help to provide overarching
 
01:40:27.990 --> 01:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
leadership to
 
01:40:30.390 --> 01:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
the rest of the areas from an
 
01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
administrative perspective
 
01:40:35.109 --> 01:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
representative petrie did you have a
 
01:40:35.119 --> 01:40:38.629 align:start position:0%
representative petrie did you have a
question

01:40:38.629 --> 01:40:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:41.350 --> 01:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
no madam chair that was a mistake oh no
 
01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:41.990 align:start position:0%
no madam chair that was a mistake oh no
problem

01:40:41.990 --> 01:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:40:45.270 --> 01:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:48.229 --> 01:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
the governor's recommended budget for fy
 
01:40:48.239 --> 01:40:49.109 align:start position:0%
the governor's recommended budget for fy
22

01:40:49.109 --> 01:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
22
 
01:40:52.629 --> 01:40:52.639 align:start position:0%
is 17.1 million dollars which is a 63.9
 
01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:54.719 align:start position:0%
percent increase over 21
 
01:40:58.070 --> 01:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
and 17.3 million dollars in fy 23 which
 
01:41:00.109 --> 01:41:00.119 align:start position:0%
is a 1.1 percent increase over
 
01:41:03.109 --> 01:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
fy22 that increase
 
01:41:06.070 --> 01:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
is due to increased disaster money
 
01:41:08.550 --> 01:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
estimated disaster money and support
 
01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
for um ongoing state and local disasters
 
01:41:13.030 --> 01:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
including covid19
 
01:41:15.030 --> 01:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
so in the past we really haven't done a
 
01:41:17.270 --> 01:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
good job of estimating our disaster
 
01:41:19.750 --> 01:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
grants and budgeting for them we've
 
01:41:21.189 --> 01:41:21.199 align:start position:0%
always relied on going through the
 
01:41:22.629 --> 01:41:22.639 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee process
 
01:41:25.430 --> 01:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
whenever a disaster occurred because um
 
01:41:27.109 --> 01:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
well for a while they were few and far
 
01:41:27.119 --> 01:41:27.830 align:start position:0%
well for a while they were few and far
between

01:41:27.830 --> 01:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:41:30.390 --> 01:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh recently they've been coming fast and
 
01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:31.189 align:start position:0%
uh recently they've been coming fast and
furious

01:41:31.189 --> 01:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
furious
 
01:41:33.590 --> 01:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
and so we decided that it's best if we
 
01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:34.870 align:start position:0%
and so we decided that it's best if we
adapt

01:41:34.870 --> 01:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
adapt
 
01:41:37.750 --> 01:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
if we if we estimate some funding moving
 
01:41:39.590 --> 01:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
forward for disasters
 
01:41:41.189 --> 01:41:41.199 align:start position:0%
which would help to ensure that we get
 
01:41:42.870 --> 01:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
the money out the door faster without
 
01:41:44.149 --> 01:41:44.159 align:start position:0%
going through the fiscal
 
01:41:46.070 --> 01:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
committee process outside of the budget
 
01:41:47.350 --> 01:41:47.360 align:start position:0%
development process
 
01:41:48.790 --> 01:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
and so that's what this represents are
 
01:41:50.550 --> 01:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
those increased estimates
 
01:41:52.229 --> 01:41:52.239 align:start position:0%
most of these are dealing with covid
 
01:41:53.430 --> 01:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
because we are expecting those
 
01:41:55.750 --> 01:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
expenditures to continue into the future
 
01:41:57.669 --> 01:41:57.679 align:start position:0%
uh into the future years and then who
 
01:41:59.669 --> 01:41:59.679 align:start position:0%
knows if there's another disaster
 
01:42:03.189 --> 01:42:03.199 align:start position:0%
that we'll be dealing with there this um
 
01:42:06.790 --> 01:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
in hsem there are two uh existing
 
01:42:08.310 --> 01:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
full-time positions within the
 
01:42:10.629 --> 01:42:10.639 align:start position:0%
operations section that are unfunded
 
01:42:12.790 --> 01:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
um both of these positions provide
 
01:42:14.070 --> 01:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
support to
 
01:42:17.430 --> 01:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
the eoc efforts um and and also the
 
01:42:19.350 --> 01:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
responses to locals for aid
 
01:42:21.510 --> 01:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
including the radiological emergency
 
01:42:23.430 --> 01:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
response activities that are associated
 
01:42:24.790 --> 01:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
with seabrook station
 
01:42:26.470 --> 01:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh we really need these positions to
 
01:42:28.390 --> 01:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
prevent reductions in training and
 
01:42:30.470 --> 01:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
exercise opportunities for staff for
 
01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:32.719 align:start position:0%
state agencies and local communities
 
01:42:35.590 --> 01:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
so again no programs would be impacted
 
01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:35.910 align:start position:0%
so again no programs would be impacted
or

01:42:35.910 --> 01:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:42:38.950 --> 01:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
cut but there would be reductions in our
 
01:42:40.790 --> 01:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
ability to provide those types of
 
01:42:42.149 --> 01:42:42.159 align:start position:0%
training services to
 
01:42:44.070 --> 01:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
to the locals without these two
 
01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:45.669 align:start position:0%
to the locals without these two
positions

01:42:45.669 --> 01:42:45.679 align:start position:0%
positions
 
01:42:47.350 --> 01:42:47.360 align:start position:0%
representative murray you have a
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair
 
01:42:51.350 --> 01:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh cohen won't last forever but there
 
01:42:52.950 --> 01:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
will be other emergencies
 
01:42:54.709 --> 01:42:54.719 align:start position:0%
do you have a sense of how much of this
 
01:42:56.550 --> 01:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
12 million from the federal will
 
01:42:56.560 --> 01:42:57.830 align:start position:0%
12 million from the federal will
continue

01:42:57.830 --> 01:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
continue
 
01:42:59.510 --> 01:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know beyond into like into the
 
01:43:02.149 --> 01:43:02.159 align:start position:0%
next biennium um or is this money just
 
01:43:03.350 --> 01:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
for the next two years
 
01:43:06.709 --> 01:43:06.719 align:start position:0%
any any sense about any idea
 
01:43:09.990 --> 01:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
um it no
 
01:43:13.189 --> 01:43:13.199 align:start position:0%
the real answer is no um it's it's
 
01:43:14.310 --> 01:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
really an estimate
 
01:43:17.430 --> 01:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
um based off of um what we're seeing as
 
01:43:18.470 --> 01:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
far as spending
 
01:43:21.750 --> 01:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
and and reimbursement requests but if if
 
01:43:24.229 --> 01:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
so i'll give you an example if um best
 
01:43:25.430 --> 01:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
case scenario
 
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
we head into 22 covet expenditures start
 
01:43:28.790 --> 01:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
going away
 
01:43:32.709 --> 01:43:32.719 align:start position:0%
we've got this thing covered maybe in 23
 
01:43:36.229 --> 01:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
there's one big snowstorm that requires
 
01:43:37.510 --> 01:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
disaster assistance
 
01:43:39.590 --> 01:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
maybe we don't need the 12.2 and it's
 
01:43:42.070 --> 01:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
only it's only 6 million
 
01:43:43.750 --> 01:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
i mean at that point the federal money
 
01:43:45.430 --> 01:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
needs to come into the state anyway for
 
01:43:47.189 --> 01:43:47.199 align:start position:0%
us to spend it
 
01:43:50.790 --> 01:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
but if worst case scenario
 
01:43:53.189 --> 01:43:53.199 align:start position:0%
there's new variants covet ends up being
 
01:43:54.790 --> 01:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
something we live with for another year
 
01:43:55.270 --> 01:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
or so
 
01:43:57.270 --> 01:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
in a different capacity we likely would
 
01:43:59.669 --> 01:43:59.679 align:start position:0%
need that full that full 12 million
 
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
and there's a very good chance also that
 
01:44:03.350 --> 01:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
we need
 
01:44:05.750 --> 01:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
20 million but we won't know that until
 
01:44:07.590 --> 01:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
other new disasters hit
 
01:44:10.550 --> 01:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
so we tried to we tried to create an
 
01:44:12.310 --> 01:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
estimate that was reasonable
 
01:44:13.830 --> 01:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
but the reality is we don't have a lot
 
01:44:16.629 --> 01:44:16.639 align:start position:0%
of good um precise way to estimate these
 
01:44:18.709 --> 01:44:18.719 align:start position:0%
funds at this time
 
01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
you know steve there's a lot there's a
 
01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
lot of important things that are done
 
01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:22.310 align:start position:0%
lot of important things that are done
there

01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:44:24.950 --> 01:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
at hsem like steve said the eoc but the
 
01:44:26.550 --> 01:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
administrative work that's going to be
 
01:44:28.310 --> 01:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
required for the next couple of years on
 
01:44:29.350 --> 01:44:29.360 align:start position:0%
this reimbursement
 
01:44:31.510 --> 01:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
i mean tremendous amount of work that's
 
01:44:32.709 --> 01:44:32.719 align:start position:0%
going to continue
 
01:44:35.030 --> 01:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
you know no matter when uh not only on
 
01:44:37.030 --> 01:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
the state side but on on the local side
 
01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:37.750 align:start position:0%
the state side but on on the local side
so

01:44:37.750 --> 01:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:44:40.470 --> 01:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
um so there's just a lot being done over
 
01:44:42.149 --> 01:44:42.159 align:start position:0%
there and the director is doing a
 
01:44:44.310 --> 01:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
doing a very good job and they've been
 
01:44:45.990 --> 01:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
working pretty much
 
01:44:48.790 --> 01:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
you know many times seven days a week so
 
01:44:49.990 --> 01:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
we're hoping there's some light at the
 
01:44:51.510 --> 01:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
end of the tunnel but there won't be for
 
01:44:55.109 --> 01:44:55.119 align:start position:0%
the administrative work for a while
 
01:44:58.229 --> 01:44:58.239 align:start position:0%
yep um so that's it so those are the two
 
01:45:00.149 --> 01:45:00.159 align:start position:0%
uh the funding gaps that if funds were
 
01:45:02.470 --> 01:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
available we would request
 
01:45:05.270 --> 01:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
we would request support for next
 
01:45:06.790 --> 01:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
division is the division of emergency
 
01:45:08.950 --> 01:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
services and communications
 
01:45:12.229 --> 01:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
they oversee our statewide 9-1-1 system
 
01:45:14.390 --> 01:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 is obviously most of us know
 
01:45:15.590 --> 01:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
that's the number you use for
 
01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:16.870 align:start position:0%
that's the number you use for
emergencies

01:45:16.870 --> 01:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
emergencies
 
01:45:19.030 --> 01:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
you call 9-1-1 you can text from any
 
01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:20.070 align:start position:0%
you call 9-1-1 you can text from any
phone

01:45:20.070 --> 01:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
phone
 
01:45:21.669 --> 01:45:21.679 align:start position:0%
and you'll be connected with dispatch
 
01:45:24.629 --> 01:45:24.639 align:start position:0%
within minutes of any type of emergency
 
01:45:27.030 --> 01:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
caller id technology helps us to
 
01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:27.669 align:start position:0%
caller id technology helps us to
identify

01:45:27.669 --> 01:45:27.679 align:start position:0%
identify
 
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
people can't speak and they're calling
 
01:45:31.109 --> 01:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 so we can um
 
01:45:32.709 --> 01:45:32.719 align:start position:0%
we can identify that there's there might
 
01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
be a need to send someone to follow up
 
01:45:38.229 --> 01:45:38.239 align:start position:0%
there's two um redundant public safety
 
01:45:39.430 --> 01:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
answering point
 
01:45:41.430 --> 01:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
system call centers psaps is what we
 
01:45:43.189 --> 01:45:43.199 align:start position:0%
call them we've got one in concord one
 
01:45:44.229 --> 01:45:44.239 align:start position:0%
in laconia
 
01:45:46.229 --> 01:45:46.239 align:start position:0%
um so we have a backup and what's
 
01:45:48.229 --> 01:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
interesting about these two psaps
 
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
is that um they are both operational at
 
01:45:52.149 --> 01:45:52.159 align:start position:0%
all times
 
01:45:54.390 --> 01:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
so anyone within laconia could pick up a
 
01:45:56.070 --> 01:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
call just like anyone in concord could
 
01:45:57.109 --> 01:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
pick up a call
 
01:45:59.430 --> 01:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
so it's better than even a hut site
 
01:46:00.390 --> 01:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
that's ready to go
 
01:46:03.750 --> 01:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's active at any point in time
 
01:46:05.350 --> 01:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
so it's really a it's really a great
 
01:46:07.189 --> 01:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
system that we have
 
01:46:10.229 --> 01:46:10.239 align:start position:0%
the division is split into um several
 
01:46:12.550 --> 01:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
different areas
 
01:46:14.070 --> 01:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
we've got an assistant director that
 
01:46:16.149 --> 01:46:16.159 align:start position:0%
oversees the technical support and data
 
01:46:16.159 --> 01:46:17.030 align:start position:0%
oversees the technical support and data
operations

01:46:17.030 --> 01:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
operations
 
01:46:19.750 --> 01:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
sections this is really the um the
 
01:46:21.590 --> 01:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that we need behind the
 
01:46:22.950 --> 01:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
911 system
 
01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
so the technical support maintains and
 
01:46:26.070 --> 01:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
supports the
 
01:46:29.189 --> 01:46:29.199 align:start position:0%
actual call system the 911
 
01:46:31.990 --> 01:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
next generation call center systems also
 
01:46:33.990 --> 01:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
all the connections that we have with
 
01:46:37.910 --> 01:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
the dispatch agencies across the state
 
01:46:41.109 --> 01:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
the data operations center
 
01:46:42.950 --> 01:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
they are they deal with all the
 
01:46:44.229 --> 01:46:44.239 align:start position:0%
databases that run
 
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
behind these systems to give the
 
01:46:48.390 --> 01:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
telecommunicators the information
 
01:46:50.390 --> 01:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
to determine where to send these calls
 
01:46:53.109 --> 01:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
to to provide information to dispatch to
 
01:46:54.790 --> 01:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
make sure that we get
 
01:46:56.790 --> 01:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
help as soon as possible and so that
 
01:46:58.149 --> 01:46:58.159 align:start position:0%
includes the
 
01:47:00.229 --> 01:47:00.239 align:start position:0%
automatic location information database
 
01:47:01.669 --> 01:47:01.679 align:start position:0%
that's the ali
 
01:47:04.390 --> 01:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
and then also the the the gis database
 
01:47:05.109 --> 01:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
01:47:08.470 --> 01:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
geographic information system um
 
01:47:10.390 --> 01:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
the other thing that uh runs in data
 
01:47:11.830 --> 01:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
operations are
 
01:47:14.470 --> 01:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
um the statewide emergency notification
 
01:47:16.550 --> 01:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
system whereas kind of the reverse 911
 
01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:17.030 align:start position:0%
system whereas kind of the reverse 911
where

01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:47:19.270 --> 01:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
that information gets sent out that
 
01:47:20.790 --> 01:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
there's there's an emergency that people
 
01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
need to be aware of
 
01:47:26.470 --> 01:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
the the operations section is the area
 
01:47:29.350 --> 01:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
that runs the psaps
 
01:47:33.430 --> 01:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
and again those are those are redundant
 
01:47:36.229 --> 01:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
systems so there's robust reliability
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
and they're far enough away that only in
 
01:47:38.159 --> 01:47:38.470 align:start position:0%
and they're far enough away that only in
a

01:47:38.470 --> 01:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:47:41.990 --> 01:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
um really severe um
 
01:47:43.990 --> 01:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
issue would we not have survivability of
 
01:47:45.109 --> 01:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
one location
 
01:47:47.830 --> 01:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
it's only the most catastrophic issues
 
01:47:49.910 --> 01:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
but but those calls are always coming in
 
01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:50.390 align:start position:0%
but but those calls are always coming in
and

01:47:50.390 --> 01:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:53.189 --> 01:47:53.199 align:start position:0%
they're open 24 7 uh seven days a week
 
01:47:53.199 --> 01:47:55.510 align:start position:0%
they're open 24 7 uh seven days a week
365.

01:47:55.510 --> 01:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
365.
 
01:47:58.950 --> 01:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
the bureau of opera interoperability
 
01:48:01.669 --> 01:48:01.679 align:start position:0%
um that's managed by the swic the
 
01:48:04.070 --> 01:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
statewide interoperability coordinator
 
01:48:06.550 --> 01:48:06.560 align:start position:0%
and they are responsible for overseeing
 
01:48:07.590 --> 01:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
the development
 
01:48:10.870 --> 01:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
of um interoperability within our
 
01:48:13.189 --> 01:48:13.199 align:start position:0%
communication systems across the state
 
01:48:15.830 --> 01:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
um and so that's um there's training for
 
01:48:18.310 --> 01:48:18.320 align:start position:0%
first responders that's that's involved
 
01:48:21.030 --> 01:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
um there's coordination of frequencies
 
01:48:22.709 --> 01:48:22.719 align:start position:0%
and and solutions for
 
01:48:25.109 --> 01:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
um different technologies that that may
 
01:48:27.830 --> 01:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
not communicate well with each other
 
01:48:29.590 --> 01:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
there's emergency alert messaging
 
01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:31.109 align:start position:0%
there's emergency alert messaging
coordination

01:48:31.109 --> 01:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
coordination
 
01:48:33.109 --> 01:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
and really connecting all federal state
 
01:48:34.870 --> 01:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
and local communication needs into a
 
01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:35.590 align:start position:0%
and local communication needs into a
single

01:48:35.590 --> 01:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
single
 
01:48:38.709 --> 01:48:38.719 align:start position:0%
coordinated response so that um anyone
 
01:48:40.229 --> 01:48:40.239 align:start position:0%
can talk to anyone that that's the
 
01:48:41.590 --> 01:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
ultimate goal
 
01:48:43.109 --> 01:48:43.119 align:start position:0%
and as you can imagine that's that's a
 
01:48:45.109 --> 01:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
challenge um with radio and
 
01:48:45.990 --> 01:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
communications just
 
01:48:47.350 --> 01:48:47.360 align:start position:0%
as much as as it is with other
 
01:48:49.750 --> 01:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
technologies and then within
 
01:48:51.910 --> 01:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
um that area as well is the radio
 
01:48:53.750 --> 01:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
communication maintenance function
 
01:48:56.709 --> 01:48:56.719 align:start position:0%
and so they they actually engineer and
 
01:48:56.719 --> 01:48:57.830 align:start position:0%
and so they they actually engineer and
install

01:48:57.830 --> 01:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
install
 
01:49:00.229 --> 01:49:00.239 align:start position:0%
um as well as conduct maintenance on all
 
01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:49:03.590 --> 01:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
um radio system towers and equipment
 
01:49:05.109 --> 01:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
that we have on towers
 
01:49:07.830 --> 01:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
that are on leased tower space so that
 
01:49:09.430 --> 01:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
includes our statewide
 
01:49:12.229 --> 01:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
microwave backhaul system and all the
 
01:49:13.990 --> 01:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
support facilities associated
 
01:49:16.390 --> 01:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
with those the generators that keep the
 
01:49:18.709 --> 01:49:18.719 align:start position:0%
um keep the towers operational and power
 
01:49:20.550 --> 01:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
goes out
 
01:49:23.109 --> 01:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
they they support two-way radio voice
 
01:49:25.750 --> 01:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
and data communication infrastructure
 
01:49:27.830 --> 01:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh that's owned and operated by all the
 
01:49:29.350 --> 01:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
divisions in the department
 
01:49:30.870 --> 01:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
um and there's also other state and
 
01:49:32.709 --> 01:49:32.719 align:start position:0%
local public safety partners that they
 
01:49:35.910 --> 01:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
that they assist with as well steve i
 
01:49:36.390 --> 01:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
just want
 
01:49:38.070 --> 01:49:38.080 align:start position:0%
i wanted to add i know that's a mouthful
 
01:49:41.030 --> 01:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
but i mean when you think just
 
01:49:44.070 --> 01:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
really is 911 communications statewide
 
01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
and they have really expanded the
 
01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:46.709 align:start position:0%
and they have really expanded the
footprint

01:49:46.709 --> 01:49:46.719 align:start position:0%
footprint
 
01:49:48.870 --> 01:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
the training but when we went through
 
01:49:49.750 --> 01:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
all the um
 
01:49:51.350 --> 01:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
demonstrations and events over the
 
01:49:53.350 --> 01:49:53.360 align:start position:0%
summer they had a
 
01:49:55.109 --> 01:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
you know communications truck that went
 
01:49:57.189 --> 01:49:57.199 align:start position:0%
out they downloaded all our uh
 
01:49:58.310 --> 01:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
helicopter video
 
01:50:00.070 --> 01:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
they made sure that you know all the
 
01:50:02.149 --> 01:50:02.159 align:start position:0%
events at the you know the command sites
 
01:50:03.910 --> 01:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
were streamed back to
 
01:50:06.149 --> 01:50:06.159 align:start position:0%
the emergency operations center so they
 
01:50:07.350 --> 01:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
really have uh
 
01:50:12.310 --> 01:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:14.790 --> 01:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
and so the division the governor's re
 
01:50:16.790 --> 01:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
recommended budget for the division of
 
01:50:18.629 --> 01:50:18.639 align:start position:0%
emergency services and communications
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
for fy 22
 
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
is 16.7 million dollars which is a 3.2
 
01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
percent increase
 
01:50:28.870 --> 01:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
over 21. and it's uh for 23 it's 17.4
 
01:50:31.270 --> 01:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
million dollars which is a 4.5
 
01:50:34.709 --> 01:50:34.719 align:start position:0%
increase over fy 22. these funds are
 
01:50:36.709 --> 01:50:36.719 align:start position:0%
supported by the 911 fund
 
01:50:39.030 --> 01:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
that's the 75 cent surcharge in your
 
01:50:39.990 --> 01:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
phone bills
 
01:50:43.030 --> 01:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
um and that supports this area of that
 
01:50:45.430 --> 01:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
increase 700 000 is due to salary and
 
01:50:46.790 --> 01:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
benefit changes
 
01:50:49.830 --> 01:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
um in fy 23 and then an uh
 
01:50:53.030 --> 01:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
fy 22 516 000
 
01:50:55.350 --> 01:50:55.360 align:start position:0%
are due to opera new operating costs
 
01:50:56.950 --> 01:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
increased operating costs
 
01:50:59.109 --> 01:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
as well as doit support and service
 
01:51:00.629 --> 01:51:00.639 align:start position:0%
agreement costs for the new
 
01:51:04.390 --> 01:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
p25 compliant land mobile radial system
 
01:51:05.030 --> 01:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
so we had a
 
01:51:07.589 --> 01:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
we had a capital project that completed
 
01:51:07.599 --> 01:51:08.149 align:start position:0%
we had a capital project that completed
uh

01:51:08.149 --> 01:51:08.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:51:11.669 --> 01:51:11.679 align:start position:0%
last year which updated all of our radio
 
01:51:11.679 --> 01:51:12.550 align:start position:0%
last year which updated all of our radio
system

01:51:12.550 --> 01:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:51:15.910 --> 01:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
to be um interoperable following this
 
01:51:17.750 --> 01:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
p25 compliance
 
01:51:20.310 --> 01:51:20.320 align:start position:0%
uh requirements and so that system's now
 
01:51:21.430 --> 01:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
up and running
 
01:51:23.990 --> 01:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
but that also requires service contracts
 
01:51:25.669 --> 01:51:25.679 align:start position:0%
for all the equipment and software that
 
01:51:27.030 --> 01:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
runs behind the system
 
01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
and so those costs are included here the
 
01:51:31.430 --> 01:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
operating costs also
 
01:51:34.070 --> 01:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
include some support for the new mutual
 
01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:34.550 align:start position:0%
include some support for the new mutual
link

01:51:34.550 --> 01:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
link
 
01:51:36.790 --> 01:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
interoperability system that was
 
01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:37.830 align:start position:0%
interoperability system that was
purchased

01:51:37.830 --> 01:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
purchased
 
01:51:41.030 --> 01:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
using cares act funding it was purchased
 
01:51:41.750 --> 01:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
to help
 
01:51:44.790 --> 01:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
us to communicate securely with um
 
01:51:46.870 --> 01:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
with the different cova 19 response
 
01:51:49.510 --> 01:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
areas whether that was testing centers
 
01:51:52.709 --> 01:51:52.719 align:start position:0%
vaccine distribution centers
 
01:51:55.270 --> 01:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
alternate care facilities all those
 
01:51:56.229 --> 01:51:56.239 align:start position:0%
different areas
 
01:51:58.950 --> 01:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
this system allowed us to combine video
 
01:52:00.470 --> 01:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
data all sorts of different
 
01:52:03.669 --> 01:52:03.679 align:start position:0%
disparate data streams in one area so we
 
01:52:05.350 --> 01:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
could coordinate statewide
 
01:52:06.950 --> 01:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
um and so moving forward that's going to
 
01:52:08.629 --> 01:52:08.639 align:start position:0%
be very useful
 
01:52:12.550 --> 01:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
system for us to maintain as a state
 
01:52:16.870 --> 01:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
so question on the uh
 
01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:20.159 align:start position:0%
the 911 fund
 
01:52:23.430 --> 01:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
is like a dedicated fund that just
 
01:52:26.950 --> 01:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
provides money for the emergency service
 
01:52:29.109 --> 01:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
and communications division
 
01:52:30.870 --> 01:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
that's correct yeah for emergency
 
01:52:34.470 --> 01:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:36.950 --> 01:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
and so there's there's enough money in
 
01:52:38.870 --> 01:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
there to cover
 
01:52:41.430 --> 01:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
all the needs there's enough money in
 
01:52:42.950 --> 01:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
there to cover all the needs
 
01:52:46.629 --> 01:52:46.639 align:start position:0%
yes yes um we did
 
01:52:49.350 --> 01:52:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh we did as i mentioned we had moved a
 
01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
portion of the
 
01:52:53.910 --> 01:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
dispatch expenses um to charge against
 
01:52:56.470 --> 01:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
the fund as well
 
01:52:59.830 --> 01:52:59.840 align:start position:0%
there's not enough to really sustain
 
01:53:02.229 --> 01:53:02.239 align:start position:0%
that in a long-term capacity
 
01:53:04.470 --> 01:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
um but there's enough to sustain that in
 
01:53:07.910 --> 01:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
the 22-23 budget
 
01:53:09.589 --> 01:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
so we're going to start getting into
 
01:53:11.910 --> 01:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
these areas now where we've made some
 
01:53:13.750 --> 01:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
funding adjustments
 
01:53:16.870 --> 01:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
to uh ensure that public safety services
 
01:53:20.470 --> 01:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
are funded in 2223 but we've had to make
 
01:53:21.910 --> 01:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
some decisions because of lack of
 
01:53:23.669 --> 01:53:23.679 align:start position:0%
funding related to general funds and
 
01:53:26.149 --> 01:53:26.159 align:start position:0%
this that that was one of them okay
 
01:53:29.910 --> 01:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:31.830 --> 01:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
um the other interesting part too i'd
 
01:53:33.910 --> 01:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
like to draw your attention to
 
01:53:36.229 --> 01:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
is um you know we're all people driven
 
01:53:37.350 --> 01:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
all the divisions are and the whole
 
01:53:38.790 --> 01:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
department is but
 
01:53:41.030 --> 01:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 especially is they've got 77
 
01:53:42.149 --> 01:53:42.159 align:start position:0%
percent of costs
 
01:53:44.310 --> 01:53:44.320 align:start position:0%
are associated with uh salaries and
 
01:53:46.470 --> 01:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
benefits i mean that's a significant
 
01:53:46.480 --> 01:53:47.109 align:start position:0%
benefits i mean that's a significant
piece

01:53:47.109 --> 01:53:47.119 align:start position:0%
piece
 
01:53:49.270 --> 01:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
and so we it's it's great that we're
 
01:53:51.189 --> 01:53:51.199 align:start position:0%
fully funded we fully funded all of our
 
01:53:53.510 --> 01:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
full-time positions in this division
 
01:53:55.750 --> 01:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
so we don't have any additional uh
 
01:53:57.189 --> 01:53:57.199 align:start position:0%
requests uh
 
01:54:00.629 --> 01:54:00.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:02.550 --> 01:54:02.560 align:start position:0%
next we move on to the division of fire
 
01:54:03.669 --> 01:54:03.679 align:start position:0%
standards and training
 
01:54:07.589 --> 01:54:07.599 align:start position:0%
and ems the division
 
01:54:10.390 --> 01:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh we call it f-stems for short so the
 
01:54:11.669 --> 01:54:11.679 align:start position:0%
division is committed to
 
01:54:13.270 --> 01:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
training educating and certifying
 
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
emergency and community responders
 
01:54:17.030 --> 01:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
to protect the citizens and visitors of
 
01:54:18.629 --> 01:54:18.639 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:54:21.270 --> 01:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
and they cover a vast demographic of
 
01:54:23.270 --> 01:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
first responders including firefighters
 
01:54:25.430 --> 01:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
ems providers public works and citizen
 
01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:26.870 align:start position:0%
ems providers public works and citizen
volunteers

01:54:26.870 --> 01:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
volunteers
 
01:54:29.830 --> 01:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
the bureau of fire fighting firefighter
 
01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:30.550 align:start position:0%
the bureau of fire fighting firefighter
training

01:54:30.550 --> 01:54:30.560 align:start position:0%

01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
oversees all fire and rescue
 
01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:33.750 align:start position:0%
oversees all fire and rescue
certifications

01:54:33.750 --> 01:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
certifications
 
01:54:36.709 --> 01:54:36.719 align:start position:0%
they conduct trainings um at the concord
 
01:54:37.990 --> 01:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
fire academy
 
01:54:39.910 --> 01:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
and then also at our north country
 
01:54:41.510 --> 01:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
facility in bethlehem
 
01:54:43.510 --> 01:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
and then they also are mobile so they
 
01:54:44.629 --> 01:54:44.639 align:start position:0%
will bring props
 
01:54:46.470 --> 01:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
and conduct certain trainings uh
 
01:54:47.910 --> 01:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
statewide so if there's a local
 
01:54:47.920 --> 01:54:48.629 align:start position:0%
statewide so if there's a local
department

01:54:48.629 --> 01:54:48.639 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:54:50.310 --> 01:54:50.320 align:start position:0%
that needs training and can't make it to
 
01:54:52.070 --> 01:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
concord or bethlehem
 
01:54:55.990 --> 01:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
we can go to them and conduct training
 
01:54:59.189 --> 01:54:59.199 align:start position:0%
in their in their neck of the woods the
 
01:55:01.189 --> 01:55:01.199 align:start position:0%
bureau of emergency medical services is
 
01:55:02.790 --> 01:55:02.800 align:start position:0%
responsible for coordinating
 
01:55:05.589 --> 01:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
emergency medical and trauma services uh
 
01:55:07.270 --> 01:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
that includes managing
 
01:55:09.589 --> 01:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
the training testing the licensing of
 
01:55:09.599 --> 01:55:10.550 align:start position:0%
the training testing the licensing of
ems

01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
ems
 
01:55:13.270 --> 01:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
providers and instructors and training
 
01:55:15.669 --> 01:55:15.679 align:start position:0%
agencies and dispatchers
 
01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
so they're they're really kind of an
 
01:55:19.589 --> 01:55:19.599 align:start position:0%
oversight role there
 
01:55:22.149 --> 01:55:22.159 align:start position:0%
the division is also responsible for
 
01:55:24.229 --> 01:55:24.239 align:start position:0%
collecting data
 
01:55:26.070 --> 01:55:26.080 align:start position:0%
and performing administrative
 
01:55:27.430 --> 01:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
investigations of those
 
01:55:30.390 --> 01:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
licensees the bureau of certification
 
01:55:31.910 --> 01:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
and support
 
01:55:33.750 --> 01:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
really is providing that administrative
 
01:55:35.189 --> 01:55:35.199 align:start position:0%
function for those two other areas
 
01:55:36.709 --> 01:55:36.719 align:start position:0%
making sure that things are scheduled
 
01:55:38.070 --> 01:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
and documented
 
01:55:41.430 --> 01:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
and captured appropriately and tracked
 
01:55:43.109 --> 01:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
and then there's some special projects
 
01:55:44.709 --> 01:55:44.719 align:start position:0%
and compliance work that
 
01:55:47.510 --> 01:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
also happens in the division um you know
 
01:55:49.030 --> 01:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
the ems regional court
 
01:55:50.550 --> 01:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
ensuring we've got coordination with our
 
01:55:53.030 --> 01:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
ems regional partners
 
01:55:56.550 --> 01:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
the the heart safe communities program
 
01:55:59.669 --> 01:55:59.679 align:start position:0%
which is um making sure the aeds are
 
01:55:59.679 --> 01:56:00.229 align:start position:0%
which is um making sure the aeds are
available

01:56:00.229 --> 01:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:56:02.390 --> 01:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
for communities across the state uh and
 
01:56:04.229 --> 01:56:04.239 align:start position:0%
then project first which is a grant
 
01:56:04.239 --> 01:56:05.189 align:start position:0%
then project first which is a grant
funded

01:56:05.189 --> 01:56:05.199 align:start position:0%
funded
 
01:56:07.270 --> 01:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
program that connected individuals who
 
01:56:08.310 --> 01:56:08.320 align:start position:0%
had uh
 
01:56:11.510 --> 01:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
an overdose with uh treatment resources
 
01:56:13.669 --> 01:56:13.679 align:start position:0%
uh within their communities and also
 
01:56:15.350 --> 01:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
training families on narcan
 
01:56:17.189 --> 01:56:17.199 align:start position:0%
administration to help try and get that
 
01:56:17.199 --> 01:56:18.070 align:start position:0%
administration to help try and get that
individual

01:56:18.070 --> 01:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:56:21.030 --> 01:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
to that treatment facility before an
 
01:56:24.709 --> 01:56:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:26.629 --> 01:56:26.639 align:start position:0%
the division of fire standards and
 
01:56:28.470 --> 01:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
training budget requests for
 
01:56:31.830 --> 01:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
fy 22 is 8.2 million dollars which is a
 
01:56:33.109 --> 01:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
five percent decrease
 
01:56:37.109 --> 01:56:37.119 align:start position:0%
over fy 21 and 8.3 million dollars
 
01:56:40.229 --> 01:56:40.239 align:start position:0%
uh which is a one percent well just
 
01:56:42.070 --> 01:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
under one percent increase over
 
01:56:46.149 --> 01:56:46.159 align:start position:0%
fy 22 218 thousand dollars in
 
01:56:49.669 --> 01:56:49.679 align:start position:0%
of the decrease in 22 is due to
 
01:56:52.870 --> 01:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
a decline in part-time salaries
 
01:56:56.149 --> 01:56:56.159 align:start position:0%
and 208 000 increase in 23 is due to the
 
01:56:57.189 --> 01:56:57.199 align:start position:0%
salary and benefit
 
01:57:00.229 --> 01:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
increments and the 27th pay period so
 
01:57:02.790 --> 01:57:02.800 align:start position:0%
that's what's causing the increase the
 
01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:04.189 align:start position:0%
that's what's causing the increase the
uh

01:57:04.189 --> 01:57:04.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:57:08.149 --> 01:57:08.159 align:start position:0%
22 decrease of 216 thousand dollars and
 
01:57:11.270 --> 01:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
168 000 decrease in 23
 
01:57:13.189 --> 01:57:13.199 align:start position:0%
are due to miscellaneous decreases in
 
01:57:14.550 --> 01:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
operating costs
 
01:57:16.310 --> 01:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
associated with the delivery of training
 
01:57:18.709 --> 01:57:18.719 align:start position:0%
programs um
 
01:57:20.709 --> 01:57:20.719 align:start position:0%
this is also a division where we've
 
01:57:22.229 --> 01:57:22.239 align:start position:0%
fully funded all
 
01:57:24.790 --> 01:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
uh all positions you look at the funding
 
01:57:26.629 --> 01:57:26.639 align:start position:0%
source the vast majority is funded from
 
01:57:28.390 --> 01:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
the fire fund here
 
01:57:31.189 --> 01:57:31.199 align:start position:0%
so the fire fund um is utilized to
 
01:57:31.199 --> 01:57:31.750 align:start position:0%
so the fire fund um is utilized to
support

01:57:31.750 --> 01:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:57:34.629 --> 01:57:34.639 align:start position:0%
this division uh for the fire academy
 
01:57:34.639 --> 01:57:35.030 align:start position:0%
this division uh for the fire academy
fire

01:57:35.030 --> 01:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
fire
 
01:57:37.830 --> 01:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
and ems and also the division of fire
 
01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:39.589 align:start position:0%
and ems and also the division of fire
safety

01:57:39.589 --> 01:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
safety
 
01:57:42.149 --> 01:57:42.159 align:start position:0%
we had to reduce some part-time salaries
 
01:57:44.709 --> 01:57:44.719 align:start position:0%
here in fire standards and training
 
01:57:47.350 --> 01:57:47.360 align:start position:0%
because those general fund concerns that
 
01:57:48.629 --> 01:57:48.639 align:start position:0%
we had prior
 
01:57:50.229 --> 01:57:50.239 align:start position:0%
forced us to change the funding of the
 
01:57:52.709 --> 01:57:52.719 align:start position:0%
fire safety division which is the fire
 
01:57:53.830 --> 01:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
marshal's office
 
01:57:56.310 --> 01:57:56.320 align:start position:0%
which we'll see as the next division
 
01:57:58.229 --> 01:57:58.239 align:start position:0%
because the fire marshal in the last
 
01:57:58.239 --> 01:57:58.870 align:start position:0%
because the fire marshal in the last
budget

01:57:58.870 --> 01:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:58:00.790 --> 01:58:00.800 align:start position:0%
we had moved partially onto the general
 
01:58:02.709 --> 01:58:02.719 align:start position:0%
fund about 50 50
 
01:58:06.070 --> 01:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
because last budget we were
 
01:58:07.589 --> 01:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
we were speaking to the committee and
 
01:58:09.109 --> 01:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
explaining that the fire fund can no
 
01:58:11.189 --> 01:58:11.199 align:start position:0%
longer support both of these divisions
 
01:58:14.390 --> 01:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
the revenue stream is flat the revenues
 
01:58:16.149 --> 01:58:16.159 align:start position:0%
are collected from
 
01:58:18.470 --> 01:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle record requests primarily
 
01:58:20.310 --> 01:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
from insurance companies looking to do
 
01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:21.750 align:start position:0%
from insurance companies looking to do
business

01:58:21.750 --> 01:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:58:24.629 --> 01:58:24.639 align:start position:0%
and and unfortunately that's not a high
 
01:58:24.639 --> 01:58:25.109 align:start position:0%
and and unfortunately that's not a high
growth

01:58:25.109 --> 01:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
growth
 
01:58:27.430 --> 01:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
area it's it's a flat it's as consistent
 
01:58:29.189 --> 01:58:29.199 align:start position:0%
and steady revenue stream
 
01:58:31.109 --> 01:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
but like our other divisions the cost of
 
01:58:32.870 --> 01:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
doing business keeps increasing
 
01:58:35.030 --> 01:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
so a flat revenue stream doesn't help us
 
01:58:36.790 --> 01:58:36.800 align:start position:0%
when costs are increasing even if it's
 
01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
not at
 
01:58:40.790 --> 01:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
an exorbitant rate of increase so
 
01:58:42.390 --> 01:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
one of the reductions we had to make
 
01:58:44.390 --> 01:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
because we moved the fire marshal back
 
01:58:45.589 --> 01:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
onto the fire fund
 
01:58:49.109 --> 01:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
100 was to reduce part-time salaries in
 
01:58:51.910 --> 01:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh f-stems these part-time employees are
 
01:58:52.950 --> 01:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
the instructors
 
01:58:55.350 --> 01:58:55.360 align:start position:0%
so these this will result in a reduction
 
01:58:56.950 --> 01:58:56.960 align:start position:0%
in course offerings
 
01:58:59.910 --> 01:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
um this will be partially offset with
 
01:59:00.629 --> 01:59:00.639 align:start position:0%
move to
 
01:59:03.270 --> 01:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
online course development so fire
 
01:59:04.629 --> 01:59:04.639 align:start position:0%
standards and training has been looking
 
01:59:06.870 --> 01:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
to incorporate online trainings
 
01:59:08.790 --> 01:59:08.800 align:start position:0%
either in whole or even in part within
 
01:59:09.910 --> 01:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
their existing
 
01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
criteria and so that'll reduce the costs
 
01:59:15.669 --> 01:59:15.679 align:start position:0%
of some of the courses that they offer
 
01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day there will be
 
01:59:19.510 --> 01:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
a reduction where that is will depend on
 
01:59:19.520 --> 01:59:20.310 align:start position:0%
a reduction where that is will depend on
demand

01:59:20.310 --> 01:59:20.320 align:start position:0%
demand
 
01:59:21.910 --> 01:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
so first and foremost we want to make
 
01:59:23.430 --> 01:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
sure we offer firefighter one
 
01:59:25.109 --> 01:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
firefighter two the certification
 
01:59:26.470 --> 01:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
courses because those
 
01:59:27.990 --> 01:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
are required to be a full-time
 
01:59:29.270 --> 01:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
firefighter in the state of new
 
01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:29.990 align:start position:0%
firefighter in the state of new
hampshire

01:59:29.990 --> 01:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:59:32.709 --> 01:59:32.719 align:start position:0%
um but it's the other courses that that
 
01:59:33.669 --> 01:59:33.679 align:start position:0%
might be um
 
01:59:36.070 --> 01:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
like uh um the ladder truck how to
 
01:59:37.270 --> 01:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
operate the ladder truck
 
01:59:39.510 --> 01:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
um specialty i'm making some things up
 
01:59:40.950 --> 01:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
i'm getting outside my
 
01:59:43.430 --> 01:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh direct knowledge on these things but
 
01:59:43.990 --> 01:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
there's other
 
01:59:46.550 --> 01:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
specialty type of trainings uh that that
 
01:59:47.669 --> 01:59:47.679 align:start position:0%
won't be offered
 
01:59:50.229 --> 01:59:50.239 align:start position:0%
or would be reduced in its offering um
 
01:59:52.149 --> 01:59:52.159 align:start position:0%
and so that that's one of the results of
 
01:59:54.470 --> 01:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
of the funding concerns that's impacted
 
01:59:56.550 --> 01:59:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh fire standards and training
 
01:59:57.990 --> 01:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
well you know what stephen i want to add
 
02:00:00.629 --> 02:00:00.639 align:start position:0%
you a spot on but we had to
 
02:00:02.629 --> 02:00:02.639 align:start position:0%
uh limit some of the training through
 
02:00:03.669 --> 02:00:03.679 align:start position:0%
cole but as you know
 
02:00:05.270 --> 02:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of the building was used for
 
02:00:07.270 --> 02:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
different cobot related events so
 
02:00:08.709 --> 02:00:08.719 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a big need moving
 
02:00:10.310 --> 02:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
forward to get these classes up and
 
02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:10.790 align:start position:0%
forward to get these classes up and
running

02:00:10.790 --> 02:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
running
 
02:00:13.350 --> 02:00:13.360 align:start position:0%
and which the director's paying
 
02:00:13.360 --> 02:00:14.070 align:start position:0%
and which the director's paying
attention

02:00:14.070 --> 02:00:14.080 align:start position:0%
attention
 
02:00:17.510 --> 02:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
to all right
 
02:00:19.750 --> 02:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
and then last but not least uh the
 
02:00:21.430 --> 02:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
division of fire safety
 
02:00:22.870 --> 02:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
the mission of the division of fire
 
02:00:24.950 --> 02:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
safety is to prevent death's injury and
 
02:00:27.189 --> 02:00:27.199 align:start position:0%
property loss by promoting a safe fire
 
02:00:28.709 --> 02:00:28.719 align:start position:0%
building and hazardous materials
 
02:00:30.550 --> 02:00:30.560 align:start position:0%
environment in new hampshire
 
02:00:33.350 --> 02:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
and they do this by through education
 
02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:34.149 align:start position:0%
and they do this by through education
engineering

02:00:34.149 --> 02:00:34.159 align:start position:0%
engineering
 
02:00:36.550 --> 02:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
investigation and enforcement and the
 
02:00:38.310 --> 02:00:38.320 align:start position:0%
division investigates all fires
 
02:00:39.589 --> 02:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
and building collapses and carbon
 
02:00:42.149 --> 02:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
monoxide releases other than automobiles
 
02:00:44.470 --> 02:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
so carbon monoxide releases in buildings
 
02:00:47.350 --> 02:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
which cause deaths and assist any local
 
02:00:48.149 --> 02:00:48.159 align:start position:0%
fire chief
 
02:00:49.990 --> 02:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
law enforcement or local governing board
 
02:00:51.990 --> 02:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
when assistance is requested
 
02:00:54.629 --> 02:00:54.639 align:start position:0%
so they're broken into four sections the
 
02:00:56.470 --> 02:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
bureau of investigations is where the
 
02:00:58.229 --> 02:00:58.239 align:start position:0%
fire investigators reside
 
02:00:59.910 --> 02:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
they investigate all fires and building
 
02:01:01.350 --> 02:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
collapses uh
 
02:01:03.589 --> 02:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
in addition they assist whenever
 
02:01:05.030 --> 02:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
whenever needed
 
02:01:07.910 --> 02:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
the bureau of planning and support
 
02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:09.270 align:start position:0%
the bureau of planning and support
services

02:01:09.270 --> 02:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:01:10.870 --> 02:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
they have several functions underneath
 
02:01:12.870 --> 02:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
them there's a hazmat unit which assists
 
02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:13.589 align:start position:0%
them there's a hazmat unit which assists
communities

02:01:13.589 --> 02:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
communities
 
02:01:17.109 --> 02:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
in developing has hazardous materials uh
 
02:01:19.830 --> 02:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
hazmat emergency action plans and also
 
02:01:21.189 --> 02:01:21.199 align:start position:0%
providing information
 
02:01:23.510 --> 02:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
on transportation manufacturing and
 
02:01:25.830 --> 02:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
storage of hazardous materials
 
02:01:28.149 --> 02:01:28.159 align:start position:0%
there's firework safety and enforcement
 
02:01:29.830 --> 02:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
unit which conducts inspections
 
02:01:32.149 --> 02:01:32.159 align:start position:0%
investigations and other activities
 
02:01:35.109 --> 02:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
for the proper use handling and storage
 
02:01:36.070 --> 02:01:36.080 align:start position:0%
and transportation
 
02:01:38.470 --> 02:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
of fireworks for manufacturers and the
 
02:01:39.990 --> 02:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
wholesale of retail
 
02:01:42.790 --> 02:01:42.800 align:start position:0%
the retail sales of fireworks also
 
02:01:45.350 --> 02:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
there's a public education section
 
02:01:47.990 --> 02:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
so they they manage a variety of fire
 
02:01:50.229 --> 02:01:50.239 align:start position:0%
life safety education components
 
02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
um things like think about um you know
 
02:01:54.149 --> 02:01:54.159 align:start position:0%
remember to replace your
 
02:01:56.870 --> 02:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh the battery in your smoke detector on
 
02:01:58.709 --> 02:01:58.719 align:start position:0%
on daylight savings time so
 
02:02:00.870 --> 02:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
things like that um to help people have
 
02:02:02.790 --> 02:02:02.800 align:start position:0%
um a safer
 
02:02:04.870 --> 02:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
fire environment in their homes and in
 
02:02:06.470 --> 02:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
their work
 
02:02:07.910 --> 02:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
then there's the bureau of building
 
02:02:09.990 --> 02:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
safety and construction
 
02:02:11.589 --> 02:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
and under that bro we've got the
 
02:02:14.149 --> 02:02:14.159 align:start position:0%
engineering and plans review section
 
02:02:15.830 --> 02:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
they're responsible for reviewing plans
 
02:02:17.750 --> 02:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
of all the state-owned buildings
 
02:02:19.589 --> 02:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
public school projects health care
 
02:02:19.599 --> 02:02:21.109 align:start position:0%
public school projects health care
facilities

02:02:21.109 --> 02:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
02:02:22.550 --> 02:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
anything licensed by the department of
 
02:02:24.629 --> 02:02:24.639 align:start position:0%
health and human services
 
02:02:26.229 --> 02:02:26.239 align:start position:0%
and they also have to inspect all
 
02:02:27.830 --> 02:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
construction projects for state-owned
 
02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:28.790 align:start position:0%
construction projects for state-owned
buildings

02:02:28.790 --> 02:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
02:02:30.550 --> 02:02:30.560 align:start position:0%
and that includes that includes us and
 
02:02:32.229 --> 02:02:32.239 align:start position:0%
the department of safety we work closely
 
02:02:33.589 --> 02:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
with them if we have a construction
 
02:02:35.270 --> 02:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
project in one of our facilities
 
02:02:37.510 --> 02:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
we have to also go through and get that
 
02:02:39.589 --> 02:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
permitting process
 
02:02:41.589 --> 02:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
the tramway amusement ride safety
 
02:02:42.870 --> 02:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
section also falls
 
02:02:45.189 --> 02:02:45.199 align:start position:0%
under this bureau so they oversee the
 
02:02:46.070 --> 02:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
safety of the state
 
02:02:47.990 --> 02:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
ski industry resources and other
 
02:02:50.070 --> 02:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
amusement rides
 
02:02:51.750 --> 02:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
to ensure compliance with all safety
 
02:02:53.910 --> 02:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
regulations for carnival
 
02:02:56.629 --> 02:02:56.639 align:start position:0%
enemies and ride operators in the state
 
02:02:58.390 --> 02:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
and then the modular housing program
 
02:03:00.550 --> 02:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
ensures that modular building components
 
02:03:01.910 --> 02:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
are constructed
 
02:03:03.270 --> 02:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
in accordance with building and fire
 
02:03:07.350 --> 02:03:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:09.669 --> 02:03:09.679 align:start position:0%
the budget request for the division of
 
02:03:11.830 --> 02:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
fire safety for fy 22
 
02:03:15.430 --> 02:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
is 4.5 million dollars which is a 14.9
 
02:03:17.350 --> 02:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
percent decrease from 21
 
02:03:20.550 --> 02:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
and 4.6 million dollars in fy 23 which
 
02:03:22.310 --> 02:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
is a one percent increase
 
02:03:25.510 --> 02:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
over fy 22. um the largest
 
02:03:27.910 --> 02:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
reason for this decline has to do with a
 
02:03:30.070 --> 02:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
change in the mechanical licensing
 
02:03:30.080 --> 02:03:30.870 align:start position:0%
change in the mechanical licensing
function

02:03:30.870 --> 02:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
function
 
02:03:33.350 --> 02:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
so this budget transfers the mechanical
 
02:03:34.470 --> 02:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
licensing function
 
02:03:35.990 --> 02:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
into the office of professional
 
02:03:37.990 --> 02:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
licensure and certification
 
02:03:42.229 --> 02:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
in fy 22 we work closely with um
 
02:03:44.709 --> 02:03:44.719 align:start position:0%
with oplc to to make that happen and
 
02:03:46.629 --> 02:03:46.639 align:start position:0%
both both departments felt that it was
 
02:03:47.510 --> 02:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
the right choice
 
02:03:50.229 --> 02:03:50.239 align:start position:0%
um and that's where it belonged um you
 
02:03:50.790 --> 02:03:50.800 align:start position:0%
can see
 
02:03:52.629 --> 02:03:52.639 align:start position:0%
from the funding here as i mentioned
 
02:03:55.669 --> 02:03:55.679 align:start position:0%
before in the past in 20 and 21
 
02:03:58.709 --> 02:03:58.719 align:start position:0%
the fire marshal had 2.4 and 2.9 million
 
02:04:00.470 --> 02:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of general funds
 
02:04:03.109 --> 02:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
uh to support their budget those funds
 
02:04:03.119 --> 02:04:03.510 align:start position:0%
uh to support their budget those funds
um

02:04:03.510 --> 02:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:05.510 --> 02:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
we had to make the difficult decision to
 
02:04:06.870 --> 02:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
fund all the other
 
02:04:08.950 --> 02:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
areas that we've talked about and we
 
02:04:10.550 --> 02:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
still had um
 
02:04:13.750 --> 02:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
have some funding gaps um regardless we
 
02:04:15.830 --> 02:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
we removed the general funding from the
 
02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
fire marshal
 
02:04:20.790 --> 02:04:20.800 align:start position:0%
so their functions are in the um
 
02:04:23.270 --> 02:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
are in are in the fire fund now what's
 
02:04:25.669 --> 02:04:25.679 align:start position:0%
left has to do with the modular building
 
02:04:27.510 --> 02:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
function the modular building function
 
02:04:29.109 --> 02:04:29.119 align:start position:0%
is a is a
 
02:04:32.149 --> 02:04:32.159 align:start position:0%
what we refer to as a 125
 
02:04:34.709 --> 02:04:34.719 align:start position:0%
generally funded area where we need to
 
02:04:36.709 --> 02:04:36.719 align:start position:0%
collect 125 percent
 
02:04:40.470 --> 02:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
of our expenditures um in in general
 
02:04:40.480 --> 02:04:41.109 align:start position:0%
of our expenditures um in in general
funds

02:04:41.109 --> 02:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:04:45.030 --> 02:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
and so that's what's left that small bit
 
02:04:48.390 --> 02:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
um the uh all the positions within fire
 
02:04:50.390 --> 02:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
safety have been funded the full-time
 
02:04:50.400 --> 02:04:51.109 align:start position:0%
safety have been funded the full-time
positions

02:04:51.109 --> 02:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
positions
 
02:04:53.189 --> 02:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
are all there there were reductions in
 
02:04:54.390 --> 02:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
part-time funding
 
02:04:58.229 --> 02:04:58.239 align:start position:0%
in this division as well and that's
 
02:05:00.390 --> 02:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
again that will result in delays in some
 
02:05:01.430 --> 02:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
of the building and
 
02:05:04.390 --> 02:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
life safety inspection and plan reviews
 
02:05:07.189 --> 02:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
that they're trying to complete
 
02:05:09.030 --> 02:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
but the programs themselves will
 
02:05:13.109 --> 02:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:16.950 --> 02:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
i am happy i'm happy to hear that you uh
 
02:05:22.310 --> 02:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
moved the what whatever you call it
 
02:05:26.310 --> 02:05:26.320 align:start position:0%
mechanical licensing yeah that's been uh
 
02:05:30.149 --> 02:05:30.159 align:start position:0%
that's been going on for how long to
 
02:05:32.950 --> 02:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
actually move that but uh i'm glad to
 
02:05:34.629 --> 02:05:34.639 align:start position:0%
hear it's happened
 
02:05:36.709 --> 02:05:36.719 align:start position:0%
so representative bucco you have a
 
02:05:36.719 --> 02:05:37.910 align:start position:0%
so representative bucco you have a
question

02:05:37.910 --> 02:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:05:41.350 --> 02:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
yeah yes thank you
 
02:05:44.390 --> 02:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
what is the source of the fire fund
 
02:05:45.990 --> 02:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
what is the social revenue of the fire
 
02:05:47.990 --> 02:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
fund the fire fund revenues
 
02:05:50.629 --> 02:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
come from um motor vehicle history
 
02:05:50.639 --> 02:05:51.510 align:start position:0%
come from um motor vehicle history
records

02:05:51.510 --> 02:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
records
 
02:05:53.830 --> 02:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
that are requested by mostly by
 
02:05:55.189 --> 02:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
insurance companies
 
02:06:00.229 --> 02:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
driving history records thank you
 
02:06:03.270 --> 02:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:06:06.229 --> 02:06:06.239 align:start position:0%
before i conclude here um just the very
 
02:06:07.189 --> 02:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
last page
 
02:06:08.629 --> 02:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
which is appendix a and it's been
 
02:06:10.790 --> 02:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
referred to throughout the presentation
 
02:06:13.750 --> 02:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
when when we uh presented uh at the
 
02:06:15.350 --> 02:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
governor's budget hearing
 
02:06:17.990 --> 02:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative ober had requested that
 
02:06:20.470 --> 02:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
we provide a crosswalk of two areas that
 
02:06:21.589 --> 02:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
we had mentioned
 
02:06:23.910 --> 02:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
one is retiree health the allocation and
 
02:06:25.109 --> 02:06:25.119 align:start position:0%
the changes we made
 
02:06:27.669 --> 02:06:27.679 align:start position:0%
and the other is doit so we provided
 
02:06:29.589 --> 02:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
that crosswalk here
 
02:06:32.229 --> 02:06:32.239 align:start position:0%
for your reference essentially what this
 
02:06:32.239 --> 02:06:32.709 align:start position:0%
for your reference essentially what this
shows

02:06:32.709 --> 02:06:32.719 align:start position:0%
shows
 
02:06:35.750 --> 02:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
is how in um we we took
 
02:06:37.669 --> 02:06:37.679 align:start position:0%
the retiree health costs which were
 
02:06:39.030 --> 02:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
being um
 
02:06:40.790 --> 02:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
the vast majority were being funded by
 
02:06:43.030 --> 02:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
the highway fund and we allocated them
 
02:06:43.040 --> 02:06:43.589 align:start position:0%
the highway fund and we allocated them
across

02:06:43.589 --> 02:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
across
 
02:06:45.189 --> 02:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
all the accounting units where the
 
02:06:47.270 --> 02:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
individuals worked
 
02:06:50.149 --> 02:06:50.159 align:start position:0%
originally to um to spread those costs
 
02:06:52.229 --> 02:06:52.239 align:start position:0%
to the dedicated funds uh wherever
 
02:06:52.239 --> 02:06:53.030 align:start position:0%
to the dedicated funds uh wherever
possible

02:06:53.030 --> 02:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
possible
 
02:06:56.470 --> 02:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
again to help to help reduce our draw
 
02:06:58.069 --> 02:06:58.079 align:start position:0%
from the highway fund because of the
 
02:06:59.750 --> 02:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
concerns with revenue
 
02:07:02.149 --> 02:07:02.159 align:start position:0%
similar to retiree health we did the
 
02:07:03.669 --> 02:07:03.679 align:start position:0%
same thing with doit
 
02:07:06.470 --> 02:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
we looked at the services being received
 
02:07:08.470 --> 02:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
and we allocated those
 
02:07:11.510 --> 02:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
some on pc count some based on
 
02:07:13.430 --> 02:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
what types of systems are operated by
 
02:07:15.830 --> 02:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
the division and allocated those
 
02:07:18.390 --> 02:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
across the area and that's why you see
 
02:07:20.790 --> 02:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
some fluctuations that are big between
 
02:07:22.390 --> 02:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
admin and state police and some
 
02:07:24.149 --> 02:07:24.159 align:start position:0%
fluctuations between the commissioner's
 
02:07:26.229 --> 02:07:26.239 align:start position:0%
office and some other areas
 
02:07:28.790 --> 02:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
so this was a request at that time so we
 
02:07:30.550 --> 02:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
provide this information for you so you
 
02:07:30.560 --> 02:07:30.870 align:start position:0%
provide this information for you so you
can

02:07:30.870 --> 02:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:07:33.109 --> 02:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
you can take a look at that if you're so
 
02:07:33.119 --> 02:07:35.189 align:start position:0%
you can take a look at that if you're so
interested

02:07:35.189 --> 02:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
interested
 
02:07:37.990 --> 02:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
but the key thing just in summary as the
 
02:07:39.109 --> 02:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner mentioned
 
02:07:41.750 --> 02:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
in his opening remarks um you know our
 
02:07:41.760 --> 02:07:42.629 align:start position:0%
in his opening remarks um you know our
our

02:07:42.629 --> 02:07:42.639 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:07:45.589 --> 02:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
our mission to continue to enhance
 
02:07:47.189 --> 02:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
public safety and security in new
 
02:07:47.199 --> 02:07:48.069 align:start position:0%
public safety and security in new
hampshire

02:07:48.069 --> 02:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:07:50.310 --> 02:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
it's going to continue with this budget
 
02:07:52.550 --> 02:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
um we're a large department
 
02:07:54.950 --> 02:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
it's important everything that we do i i
 
02:07:56.790 --> 02:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
hope you've seen the breadth of services
 
02:07:59.109 --> 02:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
that are provided here
 
02:08:00.550 --> 02:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
and and the governor's recommended
 
02:08:02.310 --> 02:08:02.320 align:start position:0%
budget does provide us with the
 
02:08:05.109 --> 02:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
funding we need to maintain public
 
02:08:07.750 --> 02:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
safety and we're not stopping anything
 
02:08:10.229 --> 02:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
however however there are reductions and
 
02:08:11.830 --> 02:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
delays in service that are going to
 
02:08:11.840 --> 02:08:12.470 align:start position:0%
delays in service that are going to
happen

02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
happen
 
02:08:14.870 --> 02:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
um because of these unfunded positions
 
02:08:15.910 --> 02:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
and that's why
 
02:08:17.990 --> 02:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
you know we do formally request if
 
02:08:19.830 --> 02:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
there's funding available that that's
 
02:08:21.270 --> 02:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
available to this committee that you
 
02:08:23.109 --> 02:08:23.119 align:start position:0%
could really strongly consider funding
 
02:08:24.390 --> 02:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
these positions
 
02:08:26.550 --> 02:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
um if anything becomes available during
 
02:08:28.870 --> 02:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
this phase in the budget process
 
02:08:31.109 --> 02:08:31.119 align:start position:0%
and uh be happy to answer any additional
 
02:08:31.910 --> 02:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
questions that
 
02:08:35.750 --> 02:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
that you may have yeah uh representative
 
02:08:37.430 --> 02:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
murray you had a question
 
02:08:40.310 --> 02:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
thank you again um are your priorities
 
02:08:42.310 --> 02:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
pretty much focused on personnel i think
 
02:08:44.470 --> 02:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
before someone asked about you coming up
 
02:08:46.069 --> 02:08:46.079 align:start position:0%
with the priorities of if we have to
 
02:08:46.950 --> 02:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
choose which
 
02:08:50.470 --> 02:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
um positions to fill uh you would give
 
02:08:50.480 --> 02:08:50.790 align:start position:0%
um positions to fill uh you would give
us

02:08:50.790 --> 02:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:08:54.229 --> 02:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
uh direction on that um are there other
 
02:08:56.069 --> 02:08:56.079 align:start position:0%
areas that are non-personnel that you
 
02:09:01.109 --> 02:09:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:03.750 --> 02:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
um their their commissioner you can jump
 
02:09:05.589 --> 02:09:05.599 align:start position:0%
in at any time but they're primarily
 
02:09:05.599 --> 02:09:06.470 align:start position:0%
in at any time but they're primarily
personnel

02:09:06.470 --> 02:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
02:09:10.069 --> 02:09:10.079 align:start position:0%
costs um the the big exception
 
02:09:13.270 --> 02:09:13.280 align:start position:0%
uh being the state police fleet
 
02:09:14.950 --> 02:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
and that's that's that's gonna be a
 
02:09:16.390 --> 02:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
balance um
 
02:09:19.750 --> 02:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
and so so there's not a depending on the
 
02:09:21.030 --> 02:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
funding that's available
 
02:09:22.629 --> 02:09:22.639 align:start position:0%
will will likely change what that
 
02:09:24.629 --> 02:09:24.639 align:start position:0%
priority becomes
 
02:09:25.990 --> 02:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
i was going to say the same thing the
 
02:09:30.550 --> 02:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:33.030 --> 02:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
representative heath you have a question
 
02:09:34.790 --> 02:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
02:09:36.870 --> 02:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
and my question is for commissioner
 
02:09:36.880 --> 02:09:38.229 align:start position:0%
and my question is for commissioner
quinn

02:09:38.229 --> 02:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
quinn
 
02:09:41.910 --> 02:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner this is a tough budget
 
02:09:46.149 --> 02:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
um monies have been moved around and it
 
02:09:49.270 --> 02:09:49.280 align:start position:0%
seems like it's kind of pieced together
 
02:09:51.030 --> 02:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
do you really think that you're really
 
02:09:53.430 --> 02:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
gonna be able to adequately
 
02:09:59.109 --> 02:09:59.119 align:start position:0%
perform the job that you need to do
 
02:10:01.189 --> 02:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
based on the amount of dollars that have
 
02:10:02.870 --> 02:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
been provided
 
02:10:05.270 --> 02:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
well we're doing it we're doing it today
 
02:10:06.149 --> 02:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:10:07.669 --> 02:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
you know if you look at the slide that's
 
02:10:09.669 --> 02:10:09.679 align:start position:0%
up there um
 
02:10:11.910 --> 02:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
we created this as an agency almost two
 
02:10:12.950 --> 02:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
02:10:16.069 --> 02:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
and we have seven divisions and together
 
02:10:17.830 --> 02:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
senior leadership came up with those
 
02:10:21.109 --> 02:10:21.119 align:start position:0%
that vision and mission statement and um
 
02:10:23.430 --> 02:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
and what i what i say at every new
 
02:10:23.440 --> 02:10:24.229 align:start position:0%
and what i what i say at every new
onboarding

02:10:24.229 --> 02:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
onboarding
 
02:10:26.149 --> 02:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
i try and meet every new employee there
 
02:10:27.589 --> 02:10:27.599 align:start position:0%
isn't a position here that's
 
02:10:29.189 --> 02:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
more more important we all have
 
02:10:30.709 --> 02:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
different titles and
 
02:10:32.870 --> 02:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
different salaries and grades but you
 
02:10:34.390 --> 02:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
know look at steve lavoy
 
02:10:36.550 --> 02:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
um nobody would understand better than
 
02:10:38.550 --> 02:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
me and you you know the impact he has on
 
02:10:39.430 --> 02:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
public safety
 
02:10:41.910 --> 02:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
and whether you're in uh the back office
 
02:10:43.030 --> 02:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
of uh dmv
 
02:10:45.030 --> 02:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
processing financial responsibility or
 
02:10:46.870 --> 02:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
you're you know you're leading the swat
 
02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:47.510 align:start position:0%
you're you know you're leading the swat
team

02:10:47.510 --> 02:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
team
 
02:10:50.550 --> 02:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
um they're all equally important so
 
02:10:53.430 --> 02:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that the budget's one
 
02:10:53.440 --> 02:10:54.390 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that the budget's one
thing

02:10:54.390 --> 02:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
thing
 
02:10:56.629 --> 02:10:56.639 align:start position:0%
the people are another so we have good
 
02:10:57.430 --> 02:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
good people
 
02:10:59.750 --> 02:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
and you know um and they're doing their
 
02:11:01.510 --> 02:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
job today as steve said
 
02:11:04.470 --> 02:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
we believe that we can uh we can deliver
 
02:11:04.480 --> 02:11:04.870 align:start position:0%
we believe that we can uh we can deliver
but

02:11:04.870 --> 02:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:11:07.350 --> 02:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
um as stated there's certain areas that
 
02:11:07.360 --> 02:11:08.229 align:start position:0%
um as stated there's certain areas that
uh

02:11:08.229 --> 02:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:11:11.430 --> 02:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
um that might need uh more attention
 
02:11:13.430 --> 02:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
or where you know some of the services
 
02:11:15.510 --> 02:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
might be delayed but um
 
02:11:17.030 --> 02:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
yeah every single day they're getting it
 
02:11:19.430 --> 02:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
done so
 
02:11:21.270 --> 02:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
so whatever help and i appreciate
 
02:11:22.550 --> 02:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
division two
 
02:11:24.229 --> 02:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
i wanted to say this the focus you've
 
02:11:26.069 --> 02:11:26.079 align:start position:0%
had i know you've been with us now for
 
02:11:27.669 --> 02:11:27.679 align:start position:0%
over two hours and i know you're looking
 
02:11:28.550 --> 02:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
at it and
 
02:11:30.310 --> 02:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
you know it's been like 10 years now
 
02:11:31.830 --> 02:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
that i've worked with division two
 
02:11:34.709 --> 02:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
and this is my first first round with
 
02:11:35.750 --> 02:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
the budget so
 
02:11:37.990 --> 02:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
um you know steve tried to put forward
 
02:11:38.790 --> 02:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
with me it was
 
02:11:41.030 --> 02:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
it's conservative it's realistic the
 
02:11:41.910 --> 02:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
other thing is
 
02:11:44.310 --> 02:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
every one of these divisions we work
 
02:11:46.149 --> 02:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
very close with the directors
 
02:11:49.430 --> 02:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
on this and um so so understanding what
 
02:11:51.030 --> 02:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
they have to do they have to try and
 
02:11:53.350 --> 02:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
you know you know uphold the mission
 
02:11:54.390 --> 02:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
statement so
 
02:11:57.589 --> 02:11:57.599 align:start position:0%
we're going to do i will say this
 
02:11:59.910 --> 02:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
they do their very best every single day
 
02:12:01.430 --> 02:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
and they will continue to do it
 
02:12:03.270 --> 02:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
and they appreciate whatever support you
 
02:12:04.470 --> 02:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
can give them
 
02:12:07.990 --> 02:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:11.510 --> 02:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
