I am opening the executive session
 
00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:26.799 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 191 and I am going to
 
00:25:33.549 --> 00:25:33.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:33.559 --> 00:25:36.070 align:start position:0%
 
introduction

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
introduction
 
00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:38.200 align:start position:0%
and I am
 
00:25:41.389 --> 00:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
introducing amendment number
 
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
0756 H
 
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
second seconded by representative rhods
 
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to recognize myself to
 
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
speak to my
 
00:25:53.389 --> 00:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
Amendment so we heard the testimony on
 
00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:03.080 align:start position:0%
and while I may personally agree with
 
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
the sponsor we we had a commitment to
 
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
our constituents that we were going to
 
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
leave the abortion laws the way they
 
00:26:12.269 --> 00:26:12.279 align:start position:0%
were however during the testimony it
 
00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
occurred to me that
 
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
frankly adults shouldn't be taking other
 
00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
people's children without their written
 
00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
permission for surgical procedures any
 
00:26:22.269 --> 00:26:22.279 align:start position:0%
surgical procedure at
 
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
all um which is the impetus for the
 
00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:28.360 align:start position:0%
amendment that I brought
 
00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
now I know some people still have um
 
00:26:32.389 --> 00:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
concerns with the part where it says
 
00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:35.919 align:start position:0%
that notorized written permission and
 
00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:38.600 align:start position:0%
the reason for that in in my mind is
 
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
because well it's twofold one you can't
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
bring a successful prosecution in that
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
case without proving the person knew the
 
00:26:48.389 --> 00:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
signature was false it was a false
 
00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
signature and you know kids forging
 
00:26:55.789 --> 00:26:55.799 align:start position:0%
notes goes way back to um Epstein's mom
 
00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
if anyone remembers that I probably
 
00:27:01.789 --> 00:27:01.799 align:start position:0%
dated myself to um to uh welcome back
 
00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
Carter um
 
00:27:08.389 --> 00:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
but I feel like it's it'll be very
 
00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:10.600 align:start position:0%
difficult to prosecute someone for that
 
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
if they um if it's not notorized and
 
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
second of all any surgical procedure is
 
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
scheduled um well well well in advance
 
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
as some of us know it could be months
 
00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
and that's plenty of time to to get to a
 
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
notary if you're going to have someone
 
00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
take your child to for a surgical
 
00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
procedure notaries nowadays I mean you
 
00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:31.240 align:start position:0%
can go into any Bank they're in there
 
00:27:32.669 --> 00:27:32.679 align:start position:0%
for free if you're a customer they're
 
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
they're all over the place we have
 
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
several in this building um they're
 
00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
everywhere so I feel like that wasn't
 
00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:40.360 align:start position:0%
that big of an impediment and so that's
 
00:27:43.269 --> 00:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
the reason for my um bringing this
 
00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
amendment we you like speak to you a
 
00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
second chairman thank you I just would
 
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
like to uh make a brief comment because
 
00:27:51.389 --> 00:27:51.399 align:start position:0%
you brought up about notary and I think
 
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
that there you know there is some
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
confusion but exactly like you said the
 
00:27:56.549 --> 00:27:56.559 align:start position:0%
notary isn't necessarily signing
 
00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
something to say that they agree or
 
00:27:59.509 --> 00:27:59.519 align:start position:0%
disagree with what you're asking them to
 
00:28:02.029 --> 00:28:02.039 align:start position:0%
notarize they're signing it to
 
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that the person that is
 
00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:05.720 align:start position:0%
signing is indeed who they said that
 
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
they are um and they're
 
00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:11.320 align:start position:0%
also they don't have to have anything to
 
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
do with anybody's medical records They
 
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
again are just certifying that this is
 
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
indeed that
 
00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:18.760 align:start position:0%
person yeah thank you that's that's
 
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
that's an important point that they
 
00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:23.240 align:start position:0%
don't generally um even read the
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
document um other than to look at what
 
00:28:27.549 --> 00:28:27.559 align:start position:0%
what the nature of it is and who's
 
00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:29.320 align:start position:0%
signing it they're more concerned with
 
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
the identity and um verification of the
 
00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:34.559 align:start position:0%
person signing further discussion yes
 
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:37.240 align:start position:0%
representative n um I thought it would
 
00:28:39.549 --> 00:28:39.559 align:start position:0%
be helpful um just on that note because
 
00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:41.320 align:start position:0%
I have been a notary I am no longer a
 
00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:43.960 align:start position:0%
notary and possibly things have changed
 
00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:46.120 align:start position:0%
um this is also in a different state but
 
00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
um as part of my record keeping I needed
 
00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:50.200 align:start position:0%
to keep a copy of um the license of
 
00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
anybody that I was notor um verifying
 
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
their identity and also whatever they
 
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
were signing so there is a there is an
 
00:28:58.990 --> 00:28:59.000 align:start position:0%
element of needing to to keep what
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
you're actually having them sign so that
 
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
does get retained at least as far as I I
 
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
I don't recall that I've never seen that
 
00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:07.960 align:start position:0%
that's a matter of fact I just had a a a
 
00:29:11.909 --> 00:29:11.919 align:start position:0%
pretty significant um legal thing in I
 
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
I'd have been very upset if they told me
 
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
they were keeping copies of it um
 
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:20.440 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair uh I
 
00:29:22.669 --> 00:29:22.679 align:start position:0%
still being a notary
 
00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
um have never kept a document a copy of
 
00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
a document because that's personal
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
information um some people do and and
 
00:29:36.549 --> 00:29:36.559 align:start position:0%
that's fine however um if you look at
 
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
the um oath that you are supposed to
 
00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:43.240 align:start position:0%
make the person who is signing
 
00:29:46.909 --> 00:29:46.919 align:start position:0%
it take the oath says do you solemnly
 
00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:49.039 align:start position:0%
swear that the document you are signing
 
00:29:51.029 --> 00:29:51.039 align:start position:0%
is known to you it is true to the best
 
00:29:53.149 --> 00:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
of your knowledge and you sign it of
 
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
your own free will act indeed and that
 
00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:58.360 align:start position:0%
is when the notary would sign the
 
00:30:01.149 --> 00:30:01.159 align:start position:0%
document if that person says no to any
 
00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
of the previous questions it
 
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
behooves but it doesn't Force the notary
 
00:30:12.269 --> 00:30:12.279 align:start position:0%
to say okay I'm not signing this uh but
 
00:30:16.669 --> 00:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
I never in I've been in notary
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
for 30 yard years i' I'm I personally
 
00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
have chosen not to keep any of that
 
00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:25.720 align:start position:0%
information because it's private yeah I
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
think that I don't think there's a
 
00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:30.440 align:start position:0%
statute away so I think that if if if a
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
certain notary wants to and the person
 
00:30:33.389 --> 00:30:33.399 align:start position:0%
agrees to let them because they can
 
00:30:34.509 --> 00:30:34.519 align:start position:0%
always say well no then I'll go to
 
00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
another notary but I would I would also
 
00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
point out that the document we're
 
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
talking about isn't anyone's medical
 
00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:42.440 align:start position:0%
records it just says I you know Joe
 
00:30:45.149 --> 00:30:45.159 align:start position:0%
Smith give permission to to Steve Smith
 
00:30:48.909 --> 00:30:48.919 align:start position:0%
to take um my child to an appointment at
 
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
this place it it doesn't have to have
 
00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:53.240 align:start position:0%
any particulars other than what they're
 
00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:56.200 align:start position:0%
doing um yes represent Murray thank you
 
00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:00.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um I have have a couple
 
00:31:02.789 --> 00:31:02.799 align:start position:0%
comments um one I wanted to share my
 
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
experience recently trying to get
 
00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
something notorized I do Communications
 
00:31:08.029 --> 00:31:08.039 align:start position:0%
and marketing and on Facebook you have
 
00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:11.480 align:start position:0%
to get um verify your identity if you
 
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
want to do advertising around certain
 
00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
subjects and it took me hours to one
 
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
find a notary you know UPS tells you oh
 
00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
there's a notary here I go to The UPS
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
Store there's no notary I go somewhere
 
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
else all the notary is out for the day
 
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
then I go somewhere else finally the
 
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
third place I went I could get the thing
 
00:31:29.549 --> 00:31:29.559 align:start position:0%
notorized I had to wait in line it took
 
00:31:34.029 --> 00:31:34.039 align:start position:0%
hours and um I'm not a parent with young
 
00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:36.440 align:start position:0%
children or who works during the day and
 
00:31:39.149 --> 00:31:39.159 align:start position:0%
is trying to balance work and um in
 
00:31:40.909 --> 00:31:40.919 align:start position:0%
child care and I think that this could
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
present a significant barrier that's
 
00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
also going to disproportionately impact
 
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
lowincome families who um I think I've
 
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
paid up to $40 for a notary before
 
00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:53.240 align:start position:0%
occasionally um those kind of expenses
 
00:31:55.549 --> 00:31:55.559 align:start position:0%
do add up and I also have questions just
 
00:31:57.269 --> 00:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
around like how this is actually
 
00:31:57.279 --> 00:31:58.990 align:start position:0%
around like how this is actually
enforced

00:31:58.990 --> 00:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
enforced
 
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:00.440 align:start position:0%
um you know is there someone in the
 
00:32:02.909 --> 00:32:02.919 align:start position:0%
hospital who's checking that the person
 
00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
who's bringing the kid um you know has
 
00:32:08.669 --> 00:32:08.679 align:start position:0%
this piece of paper signed saying that
 
00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:10.360 align:start position:0%
they have permission to bring the child
 
00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
there um yeah just not really sure how
 
00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:17.240 align:start position:0%
that is um actually enforceable in any
 
00:32:21.149 --> 00:32:21.159 align:start position:0%
way um thank you I I would I would say
 
00:32:23.549 --> 00:32:23.559 align:start position:0%
that it's it would be enforceable um
 
00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:26.120 align:start position:0%
after the fact type of a thing um for
 
00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
example if you found someone took your
 
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
child and you went to the police and
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
said this person took my child for a
 
00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
surgery and I never gave them permission
 
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:35.039 align:start position:0%
to do that that would where this would
 
00:32:37.629 --> 00:32:37.639 align:start position:0%
be in advance there's no Gatekeepers
 
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
keeping people from medical appointments
 
00:32:41.509 --> 00:32:41.519 align:start position:0%
it's more of you know this is something
 
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
you're not allowed to do if you break
 
00:32:44.669 --> 00:32:44.679 align:start position:0%
this law you could be charged um with
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
regard to the notary I would I would
 
00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:50.120 align:start position:0%
Point everyone to um www.1 notary.com
 
00:32:53.629 --> 00:32:53.639 align:start position:0%
it's one of literally hundreds of online
 
00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
notaries across the country that you can
 
00:32:58.990 --> 00:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
go on and within I would say it took me
 
00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:00.559 align:start position:0%
15 minutes to get something notorized
 
00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
and it was $25 a document so um and it's
 
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
getting more competitive all the time so
 
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
I would say that while I understand your
 
00:33:09.269 --> 00:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
concern I would suggest you open your
 
00:33:10.629 --> 00:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
aperture and look online there's
 
00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
notaries everywhere um and furthermore
 
00:33:14.509 --> 00:33:14.519 align:start position:0%
if you're going to go to a surgery like
 
00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:16.600 align:start position:0%
I said I would think that you've got
 
00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:18.760 align:start position:0%
plenty of time in advance when you know
 
00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:20.440 align:start position:0%
when it's going to H because we all know
 
00:33:22.269 --> 00:33:22.279 align:start position:0%
as um healthc careers today you're not
 
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
getting a surgery anytime soon um if you
 
00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
need one can I represent you can thank
 
00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:32.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh last year I tried to
 
00:33:34.629 --> 00:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
take my two of my grandchildren to get
 
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
their ears
 
00:33:38.549 --> 00:33:38.559 align:start position:0%
pierced the person that was doing it I
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
handed her a notorized
 
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
signature of my daughter and
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
son-in-law along with a copy of the
 
00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:49.919 align:start position:0%
children's birth certificates and they
 
00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
said we still can't do it because in
 
00:33:56.389 --> 00:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
another state we need separate notorized
 
00:33:59.230 --> 00:33:59.240 align:start position:0%
letters from each of the parents
 
00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:02.559 align:start position:0%
separately not both so in other states
 
00:34:05.029 --> 00:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
my point of this is in other states that
 
00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
is what they requiring in order now
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
that's just an
 
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:11.560 align:start position:0%
earpiercing they're
 
00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
requiring two signatures two separate
 
00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:17.720 align:start position:0%
parents notorized in order to do even a
 
00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
simple procedure like that so that's why
 
00:34:23.829 --> 00:34:23.839 align:start position:0%
I like this who knew the ear pring was
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
so contentious um you wanted to respond
 
00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
represent Murray I see
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh well that's actually helpful to know
 
00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
cuz one of the things I was wondering is
 
00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
if we have something like this regarding
 
00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:37.240 align:start position:0%
anything else like in Statue like other
 
00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
you know to take a kid on vacation you
 
00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
know do you need a notorized you so
 
00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
that's what I was curious if there are
 
00:34:44.109 --> 00:34:44.119 align:start position:0%
other places in Statue where we have
 
00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:46.919 align:start position:0%
something similar to this but um yeah
 
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
the en the enforcement piece is just
 
00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
kind of what makes us feel like it
 
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense to me because if
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
there's not a way to like stop it up
 
00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:57.839 align:start position:0%
front then what really is um the point
 
00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
of this other than like you're saying
 
00:35:02.829 --> 00:35:02.839 align:start position:0%
after the fact but after the kids had a
 
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
surgery now you're going you know what I
 
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
mean it just doesn't really like make
 
00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:08.200 align:start position:0%
sense to me but I guess my only response
 
00:35:10.589 --> 00:35:10.599 align:start position:0%
to that would be um under that theory
 
00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:11.720 align:start position:0%
then we should probably get rid of the
 
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
murder statute because you can't charge
 
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
anybody with it until after someone's
 
00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:17.800 align:start position:0%
stand representative Sher
 
00:35:20.349 --> 00:35:20.359 align:start position:0%
well I'm tempted to respond to the
 
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
chair's uh a baffling combat about the
 
00:35:29.349 --> 00:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:31.480 align:start position:0%
given that there's a private right of
 
00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:35.720 align:start position:0%
action um you know it doesn't matter
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
whether the written consent that was
 
00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:40.200 align:start position:0%
given to the doctor's office was
 
00:35:42.589 --> 00:35:42.599 align:start position:0%
notorized or not that the private right
 
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
of action is still going to stand it
 
00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:48.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't make it any harder to prove uh
 
00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
that a misdemeanor occurred if uh the
 
00:35:56.829 --> 00:35:56.839 align:start position:0%
document provided uh to uh the doctor uh
 
00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
was notorized or not uh uh so um I you
 
00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:03.800 align:start position:0%
know in the in the limited number of
 
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
cases where somebody's actually going to
 
00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
forge their parents signature um I I
 
00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:13.400 align:start position:0%
don't think it's going to be that hard
 
00:36:16.109 --> 00:36:16.119 align:start position:0%
to prove that that's what's happened and
 
00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:19.880 align:start position:0%
that the fact that it is notorized um or
 
00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
not is isn't really going to make it
 
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
different so I I I
 
00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:27.880 align:start position:0%
I I in that vein I also share uh sentive
 
00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:31.160 align:start position:0%
Murray's concern about you know people
 
00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
of less economic means both parents are
 
00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
working or you know a single parent has
 
00:36:41.109 --> 00:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
two jobs it's in theory it's easy for me
 
00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
easy for the chair to find a notary it's
 
00:36:46.349 --> 00:36:46.359 align:start position:0%
a total pain in the neck for somebody
 
00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
who's living their life out straight um
 
00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
and so I I you know I would be
 
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
supportive of this bill the word
 
00:36:55.349 --> 00:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
notorized wasn't in it to be honest with
 
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
you what um and what if any response do
 
00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:00.440 align:start position:0%
you have to the the online notaries are
 
00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:01.910 align:start position:0%
you have to the the online notaries are
available

00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
247 yeah I I don't know how many people
 
00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
are aware of that you know you know if
 
00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
if this isn't going to happen but if we
 
00:37:12.589 --> 00:37:12.599 align:start position:0%
did a great advertising campaign that
 
00:37:15.309 --> 00:37:15.319 align:start position:0%
the online notary service was available
 
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh but I I I just I just think it's a
 
00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:20.200 align:start position:0%
requirement that doesn't get you that
 
00:37:24.829 --> 00:37:24.839 align:start position:0%
much more to have it worth having it
 
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
there further discussion represent
 
00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
M yeah the one of the problems that I
 
00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
have with the amendment is it takes a
 
00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:37.480 align:start position:0%
bill uh that was vague to start with and
 
00:37:41.069 --> 00:37:41.079 align:start position:0%
makes it even more vague um I think the
 
00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:43.640 align:start position:0%
bill that came before us originally was
 
00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
very clearly uh an anti-abortion Bill
 
00:37:49.589 --> 00:37:49.599 align:start position:0%
and what this amendment does is it
 
00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:54.280 align:start position:0%
disguises that um and
 
00:37:57.870 --> 00:37:57.880 align:start position:0%
uh I think that um
 
00:37:59.230 --> 00:37:59.240 align:start position:0%
I think one of the things that I'm
 
00:38:02.309 --> 00:38:02.319 align:start position:0%
concerned about is just the chilling
 
00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:05.240 align:start position:0%
effect that a law like this in the books
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
um could have with people who find
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
themselves uh in this situation um I
 
00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:13.160 align:start position:0%
think one of the biggest issues is you
 
00:38:15.069 --> 00:38:15.079 align:start position:0%
know for a lot of folks is is is who do
 
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
you trust and unfortunately there are
 
00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
some situations where the parents aren't
 
00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:25.960 align:start position:0%
the people that uh that the young person
 
00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:28.760 align:start position:0%
for one reason or another decides to
 
00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
trust um and I think criminalizing uh
 
00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
behavior of folks who try to help people
 
00:38:38.069 --> 00:38:38.079 align:start position:0%
in that situation is something that we
 
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
should avoid
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
doing thank you um see no further I
 
00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:44.920 align:start position:0%
would ask the clerk to call the role
 
00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%

myself to make a motion of ought to pass

I'll recognize myself to make a mo uh to
 
00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
speak to my um
 
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
motion I I hear all the concerns um and
 
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh I I I could go either way on the
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
notary part um but I I feel like I'd
 
00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:54.280 align:start position:0%
rather start there it it's like I said
 
00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
it's not difficult um to get something
 
00:39:58.470 --> 00:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
notorized nowadays you can literally do
 
00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:00.200 align:start position:0%
it in 10 minutes without even getting
 
00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
dressed um but I I also understand that
 
00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
there could be some people unaware of
 
00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:08.200 align:start position:0%
that as many of us here today apparently
 
00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
were representative Murray thank you Mr
 
00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
chair um what representative Muse was
 
00:40:16.109 --> 00:40:16.119 align:start position:0%
just saying reminded me of um one of my
 
00:40:18.309 --> 00:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
concerns with the bill being around it
 
00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
not including other family members um
 
00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:23.720 align:start position:0%
I'm the oldest of five I've taken many
 
00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:26.680 align:start position:0%
of my younger siblings to um medical
 
00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
appointments particularly when one of my
 
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
sisters um was actively going through
 
00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:33.400 align:start position:0%
cancer treatment and I was bringing her
 
00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:35.240 align:start position:0%
down to Boston two to three times a week
 
00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:36.680 align:start position:0%
because my parents were working during
 
00:40:40.109 --> 00:40:40.119 align:start position:0%
the day um to get her treatments and to
 
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
add um an additional burden in a case
 
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
like that of going and getting you know
 
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
would I have had to get a notary every
 
00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:51.160 align:start position:0%
single time um I know that that case is
 
00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:53.720 align:start position:0%
um you know was not surgical at least
 
00:40:56.109 --> 00:40:56.119 align:start position:0%
not every single time I brought her down
 
00:40:58.870 --> 00:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
um but I just just think that there are
 
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of families that have people that
 
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
um are helping taking care of the kids
 
00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
you know grandparents there's a lot of
 
00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
mixed families in our in our state and I
 
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
do think that this will make it um
 
00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
harder for them as well to to get
 
00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:13.710 align:start position:0%
harder for them as well to to get

further uh seeing none I would ask CL

I'm going to jump a little bit out of
 
00:42:19.549 --> 00:42:19.559 align:start position:0%
order I'm going to open the executive
 
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill
 
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
recognize actually I was going to ask if
 
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
anyone wanted to make a motion on this
 
00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:32.680 align:start position:0%
one do you
 
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
okay I recognize representative Murray
 
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
to make a motion I make a motion of a to
 
00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
second absolutely I think um you know
 
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
we've as a body have passed uh bills
 
00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
legalizing cannabis again and again the
 
00:42:53.829 --> 00:42:53.839 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire have made it
 
00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
clear that they would like us to
 
00:42:58.270 --> 00:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
legalize cannabis um I think this bill
 
00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
is a common sense compromise not getting
 
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
into the weeds shall we say with uh
 
00:43:06.109 --> 00:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
dealing with the retail aspect of
 
00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:08.200 align:start position:0%
selling cannabis but simply focusing on
 
00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
legalizing it while ensuring that um
 
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
individuals out in public aren't going
 
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
to be exposed to cannabis um without
 
00:43:18.589 --> 00:43:18.599 align:start position:0%
their consent so I think that this is a
 
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
good Common Sense compromise bill um and
 
00:43:22.549 --> 00:43:22.559 align:start position:0%
that we should pass it out to
 
00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:24.800 align:start position:0%

00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:26.480 align:start position:0%

um would you like to speak to your
 
00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
motion I just think it's time that we
 
00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
take this step uh it's it's
 
00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
understood that uh uh we need to have
 
00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:27.800 align:start position:0%
more discipline in the schools
 
00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:31.720 align:start position:0%
uh for this sort of thing so I I think
 
00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's time that we take the step to
 
00:45:37.549 --> 00:45:37.559 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:42.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:44.349 --> 00:45:44.359 align:start position:0%
phones represent you might be on the
 
00:45:46.829 --> 00:45:46.839 align:start position:0%
wrong bill is
 
00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
206 um this
 
00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
is6 you're looking at I'm sorry you're
 
00:45:53.829 --> 00:45:53.839 align:start position:0%
in the Senate
 
00:45:58.069 --> 00:45:58.079 align:start position:0%
uh if you recall but would you like to
 
00:45:59.829 --> 00:45:59.839 align:start position:0%
um speak to your motion on this bill
 
00:46:02.549 --> 00:46:02.559 align:start position:0%
though I like that
 
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
one let me let me pull it up yeah this
 
00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:07.720 align:start position:0%
is the um police entry onto no
 
00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
trespassing land yeah I apologize Mr
 
00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:13.240 align:start position:0%
chairman if you could go to someone else
 
00:46:16.349 --> 00:46:16.359 align:start position:0%
forness I'll speak to my second
 
00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:19.240 align:start position:0%
um this bill would uh require law
 
00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement to get a search warrant to
 
00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:23.800 align:start position:0%
enter onto your private property um
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
where your private property is posted no
 
00:46:29.589 --> 00:46:29.599 align:start position:0%
trespassing currently there um is a
 
00:46:32.549 --> 00:46:32.559 align:start position:0%
rule at the Supreme Court level it's
 
00:46:35.549 --> 00:46:35.559 align:start position:0%
called The Open Fields Doctrine whereby
 
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
if property that you own that your house
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
sits on but is not part of the curtilage
 
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
which is defined as the area right
 
00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:45.839 align:start position:0%
around your house that you regularly use
 
00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:47.480 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement doesn't require a
 
00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
search warrant to go on that property so
 
00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:52.640 align:start position:0%
for example I own six acres um the area
 
00:46:54.309 --> 00:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
right outside my properties got some
 
00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
Woods got a a shooting range
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
theoretically the law enforcement could
 
00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:00.079 align:start position:0%
walk on there and look around anytime
 
00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
they wanted to um I don't post it so I
 
00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
don't care but if someone went to the
 
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
extent that they wanted it posted and
 
00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:08.680 align:start position:0%
they didn't want people on there um I
 
00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
feel like law enforcement needs to
 
00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
respect that the way that other citizens
 
00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
have to respect no trespassing signs now
 
00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:17.720 align:start position:0%
we did hear um from our law enforcement
 
00:47:19.309 --> 00:47:19.319 align:start position:0%
to their credit they said it's their
 
00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
policy currently to get a search warrant
 
00:47:23.470 --> 00:47:23.480 align:start position:0%
already if the land is posted no
 
00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
trespassing and I commend them for that
 
00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:27.800 align:start position:0%
um seeing that they're already doing it
 
00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
anyway I don't see a problem with
 
00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:31.880 align:start position:0%
putting it into statute just so that we
 
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
understand and if there is a case where
 
00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:35.800 align:start position:0%
they don't get one they can't fall back
 
00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
on the Open Fields Doctrine further
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
discussion represent
 
00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr chair um I was
 
00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
trying to go back in my notes to see
 
00:47:49.549 --> 00:47:49.559 align:start position:0%
exactly which a agency had testified but
 
00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
I think what's hard with this is the um
 
00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:55.880 align:start position:0%
broad applicability for um across
 
00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
agencies that wouldn't be getting search
 
00:47:59.829 --> 00:47:59.839 align:start position:0%
warrants so I know that there was one
 
00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
agency and then Municipal officials that
 
00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:04.760 align:start position:0%
also came and testified concerning that
 
00:48:08.309 --> 00:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
this bill would um interfere with their
 
00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
ability to do tasks such as surveying
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
land and that they don't have the
 
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
ability to you know it's not in their
 
00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
practice to go requesting search
 
00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:19.960 align:start position:0%
warrants so I think if this one had um a
 
00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
more limited scope specifically to law
 
00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement it would maybe be um more
 
00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
amendable to passing but as written they
 
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
had concerns that it would interfere
 
00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
with their ability to complete their
 
00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:35.480 align:start position:0%
responsibilities thank you um it's my
 
00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
recollection that we had this bill last
 
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
year when we passed it
 
00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:42.520 align:start position:0%
um and the this year's version I I
 
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
thought limited that considerably back
 
00:48:47.549 --> 00:48:47.559 align:start position:0%
from the broadness that that was there
 
00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:49.240 align:start position:0%
be just because of the concerns that
 
00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:51.880 align:start position:0%
were voiced by some I I would however
 
00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:52.710 align:start position:0%
were voiced by some I I would however
say

00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:55.240 align:start position:0%
that it it doesn't app most of the
 
00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
things that any municipality would have
 
00:48:58.670 --> 00:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
to do are part of the building in the
 
00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:00.640 align:start position:0%
house they there's no reason for them to
 
00:49:03.109 --> 00:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
go into the woods behind someone's house
 
00:49:05.309 --> 00:49:05.319 align:start position:0%
um surveyors are generally hired by the
 
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
homeowner I don't know that a survey is
 
00:49:09.549 --> 00:49:09.559 align:start position:0%
ever done for tax purposes because they
 
00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:11.720 align:start position:0%
already had the plats but yeah go ahead
 
00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
represent M thank you chairman um I
 
00:49:15.309 --> 00:49:15.319 align:start position:0%
found the notes it was it was the
 
00:49:17.309 --> 00:49:17.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation um and they
 
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
do land surveys you know when they're
 
00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:21.400 align:start position:0%
doing projects around highways and that
 
00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
sort Bridges you know that sort of thing
 
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
um the bill only has an exception for
 
00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
fishing game authorities so they um from
 
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
the Department of Transportation had
 
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
said that they would appreciate an
 
00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079 align:start position:0%
explicit exception for their Department
 
00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:36.640 align:start position:0%
as well um the New Hampshire Chiefs of
 
00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
police had also said that they were
 
00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
concerned um with it preventing law
 
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement from delivering civil
 
00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:44.680 align:start position:0%
notices or chasing a runaway that might
 
00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
go into um private property um and
 
00:49:50.109 --> 00:49:50.119 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill as well and then yeah
 
00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
the um Municipal Association didn't take
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh a strong position but said that the
 
00:49:56.750 --> 00:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
definition of government agent would
 
00:49:59.549 --> 00:49:59.559 align:start position:0%
include Municipal agents um and that
 
00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
they would be subject to the same
 
00:50:03.549 --> 00:50:03.559 align:start position:0%
processes but again don't have the same
 
00:50:06.309 --> 00:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
access to requesting a search warrant
 
00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
that law enforcement would have thank
 
00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
you um again my only response would be
 
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
that um this would only require a search
 
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
warrant from someone who is going to
 
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
search their property and the results of
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
this there's no penalty other than
 
00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:25.599 align:start position:0%
whatever they find would be inadmissible
 
00:50:28.829 --> 00:50:28.839 align:start position:0%
so um for example the the power people
 
00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
who were doing a survey um there's no
 
00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
nothing would happen to them if they
 
00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
went 20 feet onto someone's property
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
other than the fact I would say that
 
00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
currently if it's posted no trespassing
 
00:50:41.549 --> 00:50:41.559 align:start position:0%
I don't think that they can go on that
 
00:50:43.309 --> 00:50:43.319 align:start position:0%
property anyway um without talking to
 
00:50:46.030 --> 00:50:46.040 align:start position:0%
the owner first so it's really um I
 
00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
think we're we're arguing about how many
 
00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
angels could dance on the head of a pen
 
00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
um further discussion representative uh
 
00:50:55.710 --> 00:50:55.720 align:start position:0%
share um I I share representative
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
Murray's concerns and also being a
 
00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:01.400 align:start position:0%
constitutional law nerd um I share an
 
00:51:04.589 --> 00:51:04.599 align:start position:0%
additional concern uh paragraph two
 
00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
lines 18 through 23 carve out
 
00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
exceptions uh and two exceptions to uh
 
00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:17.960 align:start position:0%
the to the law and and those are two of
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
the well very brief lesson about search
 
00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
warrants there are a number of search
 
00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:25.069 align:start position:0%
warrants there are a number of search
warrant

00:51:25.069 --> 00:51:25.079 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
exceptions um and and two of them are
 
00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
consent covered by paragraph Roman
 
00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
numeral 2A another one is exent
 
00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
circumstances covered by paragraph B2B
 
00:51:39.789 --> 00:51:39.799 align:start position:0%
but there are other search warrant
 
00:51:42.549 --> 00:51:42.559 align:start position:0%
exceptions that by the way this is
 
00:51:42.559 --> 00:51:44.470 align:start position:0%
exceptions that by the way this is
written

00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
written
 
00:51:48.589 --> 00:51:48.599 align:start position:0%
don't function as exceptions uh by
 
00:51:51.069 --> 00:51:51.079 align:start position:0%
Statute so what we're doing is amending
 
00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional federal constitutional
 
00:51:55.109 --> 00:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
and state constitutional law to only
 
00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
validate two search War exeptions rather
 
00:51:59.750 --> 00:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
than any other search warn exceptions I
 
00:52:02.549 --> 00:52:02.559 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think uh that was probably
 
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
intentional on the part of the drafters
 
00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:07.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh who probably weren't aware of the
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
other exceptions uh but that's a problem
 
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
the second problem is the way the
 
00:52:14.670 --> 00:52:14.680 align:start position:0%
exigent circumstances exception is
 
00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:17.640 align:start position:0%
written suggests that all you need is
 
00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:20.920 align:start position:0%
exent circumstances you don't also need
 
00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
probable cause and uh I think that's a
 
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
drafting problem but
 
00:52:30.750 --> 00:52:30.760 align:start position:0%
constitutionally even if you have exent
 
00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances you still need probable
 
00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
cause I think that was a drafting
 
00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
mistake I don't think that was intended
 
00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
so those are my
 
00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
problems thank you further
 
00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:48.349 --> 00:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
M I think one of the things that we
 
00:52:50.589 --> 00:52:50.599 align:start position:0%
heard uh repeatedly during the public
 
00:52:53.309 --> 00:52:53.319 align:start position:0%
hearing was that um the folks who are
 
00:52:55.109 --> 00:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
actually responsible for administering
 
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
and enforcing the law have problems with
 
00:52:59.230 --> 00:52:59.240 align:start position:0%
this bill uh the marac County Attorney
 
00:53:02.190 --> 00:53:02.200 align:start position:0%
had a problem with it uh David Goldstein
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
uh from the Chiefs Police Association
 
00:53:05.589 --> 00:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
their chair of their legislative
 
00:53:08.349 --> 00:53:08.359 align:start position:0%
committee uh opposed the bill and one of
 
00:53:11.069 --> 00:53:11.079 align:start position:0%
the reasons he opposed the bill uh is
 
00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:13.400 align:start position:0%
because he believes it may impact the
 
00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
timely service of protective orders um I
 
00:53:19.150 --> 00:53:19.160 align:start position:0%
think part of the issue we run into
 
00:53:21.710 --> 00:53:21.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes on bills like this which I
 
00:53:23.470 --> 00:53:23.480 align:start position:0%
classify as a bill in search of a
 
00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:25.880 align:start position:0%
problem um thanks to a National
 
00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
Organization that's been trying to get
 
00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
it pass in New Hampshire for several
 
00:53:32.069 --> 00:53:32.079 align:start position:0%
years now um we don't where are the
 
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
cases where were the people complaining
 
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
to our committee that they they had been
 
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
uh you know somehow offended because we
 
00:53:42.589 --> 00:53:42.599 align:start position:0%
didn't have a law like this or how their
 
00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
privacy wasn't being
 
00:53:47.349 --> 00:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
protected um we didn't hear from them
 
00:53:50.030 --> 00:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
what we what we heard from were law
 
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement people and and a county
 
00:53:54.069 --> 00:53:54.079 align:start position:0%
attorney who were basically telling us
 
00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
that this bill has problems and and you
 
00:54:00.349 --> 00:54:00.359 align:start position:0%
know uh when you combine it with the
 
00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:03.640 align:start position:0%
fact that literally nobody showed up
 
00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:05.640 align:start position:0%
other than the sponsor to actually argue
 
00:54:08.309 --> 00:54:08.319 align:start position:0%
for why the bill was necessary uh and we
 
00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
had a bunch of very creditable people
 
00:54:13.390 --> 00:54:13.400 align:start position:0%
lined up to tell us why the bill is not
 
00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
necessary I think that's pretty
 
00:54:17.309 --> 00:54:17.319 align:start position:0%
compelling reason for us not to pass
 
00:54:17.319 --> 00:54:20.390 align:start position:0%
compelling reason for us not to pass
this

00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you further discussion um I
 
00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
would just say that with regard to the
 
00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:28.640 align:start position:0%
um the service of process or any other
 
00:54:31.390 --> 00:54:31.400 align:start position:0%
reason someone would legitimately um
 
00:54:33.789 --> 00:54:33.799 align:start position:0%
want to be on someone's property the the
 
00:54:35.870 --> 00:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
way to serve process is to walk to their
 
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
front door and knock um if you have to
 
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
serf process in the woods behind their
 
00:54:42.829 --> 00:54:42.839 align:start position:0%
house um there's some questions about
 
00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
that um this bill does nothing to stop
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
anyone from going on someone's property
 
00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
and going to their door this is strictly
 
00:54:52.430 --> 00:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
about people's property not around the
 
00:54:55.230 --> 00:54:55.240 align:start position:0%
curtilage of their home so with that I'd
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
ask the clerk to call the road the
 
00:54:58.750 --> 00:54:58.760 align:start position:0%

yes thank you um I just still had some
 
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
concerns because I asked a lot of
 
00:59:22.990 --> 00:59:23.000 align:start position:0%
questions for this one and they were
 
00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
unable to clarify uh the who's the
 
00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
what's the Wares are going to be
 
00:59:29.789 --> 00:59:29.799 align:start position:0%
carrying this uh equipment and that's
 
00:59:32.230 --> 00:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
pretty concerning for
 
00:59:34.589 --> 00:59:34.599 align:start position:0%
me represent Ro you like to speak to you
 
00:59:38.589 --> 00:59:38.599 align:start position:0%
a second yes thank you Mr chairman um I
 
00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
know that I know that this bill brings a
 
00:59:43.390 --> 00:59:43.400 align:start position:0%
lot of emotion and
 
00:59:45.630 --> 00:59:45.640 align:start position:0%
respectfully I believe I understand the
 
00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill sponsor and the
 
00:59:50.510 --> 00:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
problem that I had with a similar bill
 
00:59:54.309 --> 00:59:54.319 align:start position:0%
that we passed last year was the amount
 
00:59:56.670 --> 00:59:56.680 align:start position:0%
of substance that is was allowed to be
 
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
carried on a person and this year I
 
01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
understand that they're they're changing
 
01:00:05.029 --> 01:00:05.039 align:start position:0%
uh some terminology because you know
 
01:00:08.349 --> 01:00:08.359 align:start position:0%
terminology is constantly changing and
 
01:00:09.870 --> 01:00:09.880 align:start position:0%
but there were several concerns that
 
01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:13.720 align:start position:0%
were brought up one was if if this um
 
01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
illegal substance is taken and it is
 
01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:19.000 align:start position:0%
found that it is you know tainted then
 
01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
what happens to it that that was an
 
01:00:24.349 --> 01:00:24.359 align:start position:0%
unanswered question um additionally I I
 
01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
remember there was testimony um from my
 
01:00:28.549 --> 01:00:28.559 align:start position:0%
colleague from Portsmith and he and he
 
01:00:31.069 --> 01:00:31.079 align:start position:0%
was very passionate and he said that you
 
01:00:32.309 --> 01:00:32.319 align:start position:0%
know he's confident that one of the
 
01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
reasons that you know that that overd
 
01:00:37.390 --> 01:00:37.400 align:start position:0%
deaths are going down is because we've
 
01:00:41.549 --> 01:00:41.559 align:start position:0%
taken um an all all the above approach
 
01:00:44.029 --> 01:00:44.039 align:start position:0%
however nothing in this bill does
 
01:00:45.870 --> 01:00:45.880 align:start position:0%
anything about helping people with
 
01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:47.720 align:start position:0%
substance abuse
 
01:00:51.069 --> 01:00:51.079 align:start position:0%
it's it to me it is it is very enabling
 
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
and I do not like the idea of you know
 
01:00:56.829 --> 01:00:56.839 align:start position:0%
just a small amount that that is left up
 
01:00:56.839 --> 01:00:57.470 align:start position:0%
just a small amount that that is left up
to

01:00:57.470 --> 01:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:00:59.829 --> 01:00:59.839 align:start position:0%
interpretation um and I would like to
 
01:01:02.349 --> 01:01:02.359 align:start position:0%
see I would like to see some kind of an
 
01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
an effect to help these people instead
 
01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:07.240 align:start position:0%
of just making it easier and
 
01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:09.750 align:start position:0%
of just making it easier and
additionally

01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:13.480 align:start position:0%
um as far as the all are above
 
01:01:16.270 --> 01:01:16.280 align:start position:0%
approach we are ignoring the fact of the
 
01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
people that are actually pushing and
 
01:01:20.589 --> 01:01:20.599 align:start position:0%
pedaling these these substances onto our
 
01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
parents onto our children and they're
 
01:01:24.270 --> 01:01:24.280 align:start position:0%
dying so until we're going to hold the
 
01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
people accountable that are pedaling the
 
01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
drugs I'm not going to continue to vote
 
01:01:31.109 --> 01:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
to allow it to
 
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
happen thank you Representative no thank
 
01:01:38.029 --> 01:01:38.039 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um I apologize I wasn't up
 
01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
to speed we skipped one but uh I do
 
01:01:42.990 --> 01:01:43.000 align:start position:0%
actually have an amendment for this bill
 
01:01:45.069 --> 01:01:45.079 align:start position:0%
I handed it I will I will um I'll
 
01:01:47.029 --> 01:01:47.039 align:start position:0%
recognize you um
 
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
to introduce an amendment that will end
 
01:01:50.829 --> 01:01:50.839 align:start position:0%
up probably being like the minority
 
01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
Amendment and it'll go to the floor with
 
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
okay um and and the point was a little
 
01:01:57.470 --> 01:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
bit of a drafting error on my part I'm
 
01:01:59.109 --> 01:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
sure is is you know to take out the
 
01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
nominal amount um but what we did with
 
01:02:03.390 --> 01:02:03.400 align:start position:0%
this bill just to to refresh everybody's
 
01:02:05.269 --> 01:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
memory because we we did actually pass
 
01:02:08.349 --> 01:02:08.359 align:start position:0%
this bill out of committee last year and
 
01:02:10.069 --> 01:02:10.079 align:start position:0%
we passed it through the house the Full
 
01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
House last year um and it died in the
 
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
Senate but but we we passed this bill um
 
01:02:17.109 --> 01:02:17.119 align:start position:0%
so I I think it's interesting that we're
 
01:02:19.349 --> 01:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
rehashing and especially considering we
 
01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
passed a similar version of this bill
 
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
but it was a bill that allowed for more
 
01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
than this does so we we explicit went
 
01:02:29.470 --> 01:02:29.480 align:start position:0%
and spoke with um with interested
 
01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
parties and folks who who may have had
 
01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
some concerns with the first one and so
 
01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:34.520 align:start position:0%
we went and we said all right we we
 
01:02:36.589 --> 01:02:36.599 align:start position:0%
couldn't get this past Senate how do we
 
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
actually make this a passable Bill and
 
01:02:40.430 --> 01:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
so what we have before us with the
 
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
amendment of course is the the kind of
 
01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
you know streamlined uh really taking it
 
01:02:49.349 --> 01:02:49.359 align:start position:0%
down to its heart and so explicitly what
 
01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
this does um is that it allows for um
 
01:02:55.109 --> 01:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
organizations harm reduction
 
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
organizations and public health
 
01:02:58.589 --> 01:02:58.599 align:start position:0%
organizations that are registered with
 
01:02:59.950 --> 01:02:59.960 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:02.200 align:start position:0%
Services so not just anybody not these
 
01:03:03.950 --> 01:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
things are not just for everybody this
 
01:03:05.789 --> 01:03:05.799 align:start position:0%
is for organizations that we explicitly
 
01:03:08.710 --> 01:03:08.720 align:start position:0%
entrust with uh with matters of harm
 
01:03:10.750 --> 01:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
reduction not we're we're not talking
 
01:03:13.309 --> 01:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
about um penalties here because this is
 
01:03:15.069 --> 01:03:15.079 align:start position:0%
this just isn't that those aren't going
 
01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
to be registered with dhh this is
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
looking at it from a different way so
 
01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
when we see um in all of the the above
 
01:03:22.789 --> 01:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
approach we're not going to have all of
 
01:03:24.829 --> 01:03:24.839 align:start position:0%
the above approaches in one bill this is
 
01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:26.440 align:start position:0%
a bill that speaks to to one thing that
 
01:03:29.470 --> 01:03:29.480 align:start position:0%
is missing from our our uh from our
 
01:03:31.990 --> 01:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
system that that would help us uh that
 
01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
would expand our capacity to be able to
 
01:03:37.789 --> 01:03:37.799 align:start position:0%
understand um what substances are on our
 
01:03:41.069 --> 01:03:41.079 align:start position:0%
streets as quickly uh as possible so
 
01:03:43.390 --> 01:03:43.400 align:start position:0%
that we can respond effectively and
 
01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
immediately so that we can be nimble and
 
01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
address the issue as as it comes um so I
 
01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
just yeah I I just wanted to to make
 
01:03:55.029 --> 01:03:55.039 align:start position:0%
sure that that's said because really we
 
01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
we put a lot of work work into making
 
01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
sure that this was a passable bill um
 
01:04:00.430 --> 01:04:00.440 align:start position:0%
and addressing the concerns that folks
 
01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
had last year so I really I really hope
 
01:04:07.069 --> 01:04:07.079 align:start position:0%
um um and yes it is it is emotional I I
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
I do really hope that we take a second
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
thought um and and think about passing
 
01:04:16.069 --> 01:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
this again in a you know a thank you
 
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
further discussion a representative here
 
01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:20.069 align:start position:0%
further discussion a representative here
at

01:04:20.069 --> 01:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
gther I'm just a little surprised just
 
01:04:27.470 --> 01:04:27.480 align:start position:0%
as the um sponsor is um if we could save
 
01:04:31.630 --> 01:04:31.640 align:start position:0%
one life this bill would be worth it for
 
01:04:36.190 --> 01:04:36.200 align:start position:0%
me thank you thank you represent
 
01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
Muse so one of the biggest concerns uh
 
01:04:42.029 --> 01:04:42.039 align:start position:0%
from last year was uh the inclusion of a
 
01:04:45.269 --> 01:04:45.279 align:start position:0%
nominal amount so uh it was the idea
 
01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
that somebody uh who was let's say
 
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
testing a pill for the presence of
 
01:04:51.029 --> 01:04:51.039 align:start position:0%
fentanyl would be able to have some
 
01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
small amount of that drug uh for use of
 
01:04:55.390 --> 01:04:55.400 align:start position:0%
testing and they wouldn't be prosecuted
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
for having that what we've done this
 
01:05:00.190 --> 01:05:00.200 align:start position:0%
year is with uh representative n's
 
01:05:03.150 --> 01:05:03.160 align:start position:0%
amendment is that's removed so it won't
 
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
be legal to have any quantity of a
 
01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
controlled substance under this bill
 
01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
what what the bill does though is it
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
offers the same level of protection for
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
people in those Public Health agencies
 
01:05:16.589 --> 01:05:16.599 align:start position:0%
and people who are actually engaged in
 
01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
testing these drugs that we currently
 
01:05:21.269 --> 01:05:21.279 align:start position:0%
confer uh to people who work in Labs who
 
01:05:23.710 --> 01:05:23.720 align:start position:0%
test therapeutic cannabis if you take a
 
01:05:26.029 --> 01:05:26.039 align:start position:0%
look at our therapeutic cannabis statute
 
01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's put that's
 
01:05:30.589 --> 01:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
actually right in there um is an
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
exemption for those folks from being
 
01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:35.720 align:start position:0%
prosecuted for possession of Controlled
 
01:05:37.630 --> 01:05:37.640 align:start position:0%
Substances while they're actually you
 
01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
know doing this type of lab testing so
 
01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
there's precedent for what we're doing
 
01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
and I think there's there's a real need
 
01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
for this bill um and i' I'd be the first
 
01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
to tell you I don't want to take any
 
01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
tools away from law enforcement um when
 
01:05:55.230 --> 01:05:55.240 align:start position:0%
it comes to enforcing our drug laws but
 
01:05:57.870 --> 01:05:57.880 align:start position:0%
what I absolutely would like to do is
 
01:06:02.269 --> 01:06:02.279 align:start position:0%
put more tools into the hands of of
 
01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
people with the potential for saving
 
01:06:06.150 --> 01:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
their lives I mean this I think one of
 
01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
the things that that has been proven uh
 
01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
over the years with uh Technologies like
 
01:06:15.069 --> 01:06:15.079 align:start position:0%
fentanyl test strips um is that not
 
01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
everybody uses them but people do use
 
01:06:18.990 --> 01:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
them and when people use them they
 
01:06:20.269 --> 01:06:20.279 align:start position:0%
really can make a difference and they
 
01:06:22.789 --> 01:06:22.799 align:start position:0%
can save lives and it's great to take a
 
01:06:25.710 --> 01:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
hard line um but I think the hard line
 
01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
ends when it's your kid you know and I
 
01:06:31.710 --> 01:06:31.720 align:start position:0%
mean if if if you had if you had a child
 
01:06:33.549 --> 01:06:33.559 align:start position:0%
who was in that situation a kid who was
 
01:06:35.190 --> 01:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
off at college for the first time and
 
01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
had fallen in with uh some people you
 
01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
would have rathered them not to fall in
 
01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
with uh would you want them to have the
 
01:06:43.470 --> 01:06:43.480 align:start position:0%
presence of mind to use something like
 
01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
this before they consumed the drug and
 
01:06:47.950 --> 01:06:47.960 align:start position:0%
the answer to me will be yes my
 
01:06:49.870 --> 01:06:49.880 align:start position:0%
preference is never that they use the
 
01:06:52.589 --> 01:06:52.599 align:start position:0%
drug but if they're going to do it you
 
01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
know damn it make sure it's not going to
 
01:06:56.710 --> 01:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
kill you and and that's what we're
 
01:06:58.510 --> 01:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
accomplishing with this
 
01:07:02.029 --> 01:07:02.039 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you for the
 
01:07:04.589 --> 01:07:04.599 align:start position:0%
discussion I would say that speaking for
 
01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
myself um I'm not sure what happened
 
01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
with the bill last year I thought we
 
01:07:10.349 --> 01:07:10.359 align:start position:0%
actually passed it I don't recall if I
 
01:07:11.950 --> 01:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
voted for it or not I thought that it
 
01:07:13.710 --> 01:07:13.720 align:start position:0%
became law or some version of it did in
 
01:07:18.309 --> 01:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
the last session um having said that um
 
01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
I've done some research myself and I I I
 
01:07:22.190 --> 01:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
you know with regard to trying to find
 
01:07:23.630 --> 01:07:23.640 align:start position:0%
out what kind of dangerous drugs are in
 
01:07:26.109 --> 01:07:26.119 align:start position:0%
the system well we we already have
 
01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
someone doing that and they're the
 
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
police when they arrest someone and they
 
01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
have drugs on them they are sent to a
 
01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
lab and they are tested because you
 
01:07:34.430 --> 01:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
can't charge somebody without proving
 
01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
that the substance they had is a
 
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
controlled substance so the police
 
01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
generally speaking know what drugs are
 
01:07:43.630 --> 01:07:43.640 align:start position:0%
on our streets and they make it quite
 
01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
known that um you need to watch out this
 
01:07:48.029 --> 01:07:48.039 align:start position:0%
drug is out there that drug is out there
 
01:07:50.589 --> 01:07:50.599 align:start position:0%
as they try to interdict these drugs I
 
01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:53.480 align:start position:0%
don't think that this will add anything
 
01:07:55.789 --> 01:07:55.799 align:start position:0%
to what they're already doing um other
 
01:07:57.589 --> 01:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
than allowing people to take their own
 
01:08:01.069 --> 01:08:01.079 align:start position:0%
supply of drugs to go be tested um I I I
 
01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
just frankly I I've never I can't
 
01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
Envision a situation where someone who's
 
01:08:09.069 --> 01:08:09.079 align:start position:0%
purchased some some Sentinel or some
 
01:08:11.990 --> 01:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
heroin is going to travel about to a
 
01:08:14.190 --> 01:08:14.200 align:start position:0%
place to have it tested um before they
 
01:08:16.030 --> 01:08:16.040 align:start position:0%
use it generally speaking it goes pretty
 
01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:19.839 align:start position:0%
quickly into their system so um while I
 
01:08:24.669 --> 01:08:24.679 align:start position:0%
I I 100% support the the the emotion and
 
01:08:26.349 --> 01:08:26.359 align:start position:0%
the the thoughts behind trying to save
 
01:08:28.630 --> 01:08:28.640 align:start position:0%
people this way I would say that it's
 
01:08:30.789 --> 01:08:30.799 align:start position:0%
redundant um we're already paying law
 
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement to check on the supply of
 
01:08:35.709 --> 01:08:35.719 align:start position:0%
illegal drugs and I really wish we would
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
spend as much effort to try and and get
 
01:08:40.789 --> 01:08:40.799 align:start position:0%
rid of these drugs off our streets
 
01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:43.759 align:start position:0%
totally than somehow giving tacit um
 
01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
approval of their use by allowing people
 
01:08:49.070 --> 01:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
to have them checked um I'd ask clerk to
 
01:08:50.349 --> 01:08:50.359 align:start position:0%
call the role the motional flow is in
 
01:08:51.950 --> 01:08:51.960 align:start position:0%
expedient to
 
01:08:54.910 --> 01:08:54.920 align:start position:0%

there'll be a minority motion um
 
01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment um being submitted with the
 
01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
Minority Report is that
 
01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:38.390 align:start position:0%
Minority Report is that
correct

01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
okay and with
 
01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:43.480 align:start position:0%
that um yeah I learned about that myself
 
01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
it's new um with that I close the
 
01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:48.149 align:start position:0%

01:09:59.430 --> 01:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going to open the executive session
 
01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
321 and I recognize representative rhods
 
01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
to make a motion thank you Mr chairman
 
01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
um I move Amendment 20250 0347 H um was
 
01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
given out last week and I believe there
 
01:10:19.390 --> 01:10:19.400 align:start position:0%
was extra copies over on that table if
 
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
anybody is looking around for it
 
01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:33.470 --> 01:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
47h I second would you like to speak to
 
01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
your motion sure thank you Mr chairman
 
01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh so this this bill uh when it was
 
01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
brought to us it it was one that I think
 
01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
we all actually really really liked um
 
01:10:46.110 --> 01:10:46.120 align:start position:0%
and the intention from the sponsor was
 
01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
to say look I'm I'm trying to pay the
 
01:10:50.590 --> 01:10:50.600 align:start position:0%
fine that you know that I received um
 
01:10:53.070 --> 01:10:53.080 align:start position:0%
for making the speed limit be maybe more
 
01:10:55.830 --> 01:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
of a suggestion and
 
01:10:57.430 --> 01:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
but sometimes people just need more time
 
01:11:01.950 --> 01:11:01.960 align:start position:0%
to do that so you know what he did was
 
01:11:03.550 --> 01:11:03.560 align:start position:0%
during you know while he was testifying
 
01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
their re questions as far as you know
 
01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
making it be you know the initial 30
 
01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
days and then asking like for two
 
01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
extensions and so forth so uh what this
 
01:11:14.350 --> 01:11:14.360 align:start position:0%
amendment is doing is basically replace
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
all for the bill it is giving the person
 
01:11:19.830 --> 01:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to to make their plea
 
01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
either in person or online and it gives
 
01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
them from the initial start 90 days pay
 
01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
the fine and then if the 90 days comes
 
01:11:30.669 --> 01:11:30.679 align:start position:0%
and goes and you know they're they've
 
01:11:32.430 --> 01:11:32.440 align:start position:0%
made their good faith and they need an
 
01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
additional time this allows the DMV to
 
01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
come up with a set of
 
01:11:40.669 --> 01:11:40.679 align:start position:0%
rules to allow for an additional 90 days
 
01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
to pay their fine um I would just like
 
01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
to say I as an example if it's Christmas
 
01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
time and you know a person's a an hourly
 
01:11:50.229 --> 01:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
employee there's probably a good chance
 
01:11:52.149 --> 01:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be working for
 
01:11:53.669 --> 01:11:53.679 align:start position:0%
maybe four or five days you know for
 
01:11:56.030 --> 01:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
that whole entire holiday season and uh
 
01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
this would just give somebody the
 
01:11:58.750 --> 01:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to not be in more trouble
 
01:12:01.470 --> 01:12:01.480 align:start position:0%
when they're trying to correct what they
 
01:12:03.790 --> 01:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
did thank you uh who made a second
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
representative Sher would you like to
 
01:12:07.149 --> 01:12:07.159 align:start position:0%
speak to your uh motion yes uh briefly
 
01:12:09.790 --> 01:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
um I worked with uh representative a the
 
01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor on this bill uh on the
 
01:12:15.310 --> 01:12:15.320 align:start position:0%
underlying bill um and the idea as
 
01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
captured by representative roads is you
 
01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
know there's there's people who have
 
01:12:23.950 --> 01:12:23.960 align:start position:0%
less significant means uh to manage
 
01:12:26.110 --> 01:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
things like fine
 
01:12:29.790 --> 01:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
uh that uh and and it would just want to
 
01:12:32.350 --> 01:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
create a little more looseness in the
 
01:12:35.950 --> 01:12:35.960 align:start position:0%
joints um so that we're not sending them
 
01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
off to court and suspending their
 
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
license and doing all the things that
 
01:12:42.189 --> 01:12:42.199 align:start position:0%
come with failures to pay fine so it's
 
01:12:44.350 --> 01:12:44.360 align:start position:0%
just opening the window a little bit
 
01:12:47.189 --> 01:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
broader and I think it's a good idea
 
01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Murray thank you Mr
 
01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
chair um I appreciate this bill on the
 
01:12:55.950 --> 01:12:55.960 align:start position:0%
amendment for sure I
 
01:12:58.910 --> 01:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
um maybe 8 years ago now when I was in
 
01:13:02.430 --> 01:13:02.440 align:start position:0%
my early 20s got a speeding fine um that
 
01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
was over $200 and I absolutely learned
 
01:13:07.390 --> 01:13:07.400 align:start position:0%
my lesson I never sped that fast again
 
01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
but at the time um I barely made over
 
01:13:13.790 --> 01:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
$300 a week um and that fine it I
 
01:13:15.709 --> 01:13:15.719 align:start position:0%
basically you know had a month of eating
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches
 
01:13:18.669 --> 01:13:18.679 align:start position:0%
because I had to pay almost a week's pay
 
01:13:21.629 --> 01:13:21.639 align:start position:0%
for this fine in that 30-day period so
 
01:13:24.270 --> 01:13:24.280 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate that we're passing this
 
01:13:26.590 --> 01:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
hopefully out of committee otpa and that
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
other people won't be in the same
 
01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
situation in the
 
01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:32.880 align:start position:0%

okay I'm going to open the executive
 
01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
session on House
 
01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:48.709 align:start position:0%
session on House
Bill

01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:48.719 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:45:51.950 --> 01:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
194 and recognize representative roads
 
01:45:54.229 --> 01:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
to make a motion thank you Mr chairman I
 
01:45:58.030 --> 01:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
moved to retain House Bill 194 a second
 
01:45:58.910 --> 01:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
uh would you like to speak to your
 
01:46:02.470 --> 01:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
motion oh thank you um although I I left
 
01:46:07.350 --> 01:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
my notes in in our office in there I let
 
01:46:09.589 --> 01:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
me rephrase that I I heard the the
 
01:46:11.390 --> 01:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
frustration um there are many people
 
01:46:13.350 --> 01:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
that testified and you know about child
 
01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:14.990 align:start position:0%
that testified and you know about child
custody

01:46:14.990 --> 01:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
custody
 
01:46:17.870 --> 01:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
and I I don't see that the way that that
 
01:46:19.589 --> 01:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
particular bill was written that the
 
01:46:21.950 --> 01:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
concerns that the the people have are
 
01:46:24.629 --> 01:46:24.639 align:start position:0%
going to be addressed in in that bill um
 
01:46:26.990 --> 01:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
The Way It Was Written things were very
 
01:46:28.950 --> 01:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
very vague a lot of thing left a lot
 
01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
open for interpretation and it left a
 
01:46:34.990 --> 01:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
lot open for who would be responsible
 
01:46:37.790 --> 01:46:37.800 align:start position:0%
for what when it came to the enforcement
 
01:46:40.470 --> 01:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
of How It Was Written so um I think the
 
01:46:41.950 --> 01:46:41.960 align:start position:0%
best thing to do is to retain it let the
 
01:46:43.550 --> 01:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
sponsors come back let some of the
 
01:46:45.109 --> 01:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
stakeholders come back and see how they
 
01:46:46.870 --> 01:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
can make it actually be a workable
 
01:46:49.790 --> 01:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you um I'll speak to my
 
01:46:53.550 --> 01:46:53.560 align:start position:0%
second I think the the
 
01:46:55.589 --> 01:46:55.599 align:start position:0%
foundation of the bill is a good bill I
 
01:46:58.030 --> 01:46:58.040 align:start position:0%
think that it needs to be um clarified
 
01:47:00.229 --> 01:47:00.239 align:start position:0%
narrowed distilled so that there's no
 
01:47:04.070 --> 01:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
ambiguity or as little as possible and
 
01:47:06.709 --> 01:47:06.719 align:start position:0%
um because the the law exists already
 
01:47:09.109 --> 01:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
and it it is
 
01:47:11.229 --> 01:47:11.239 align:start position:0%
Criminal it just seems that what we
 
01:47:12.910 --> 01:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
heard from the testimony was people had
 
01:47:14.470 --> 01:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
a really difficult time getting the law
 
01:47:17.430 --> 01:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement to take action on it and
 
01:47:20.750 --> 01:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
therefore it wasn't helpful um also I
 
01:47:23.189 --> 01:47:23.199 align:start position:0%
want the sponsors to take into account
 
01:47:26.030 --> 01:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
that violating an order already um is
 
01:47:29.790 --> 01:47:29.800 align:start position:0%
potentially criminal um by virtue of
 
01:47:31.270 --> 01:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
contempt of court should the court
 
01:47:35.350 --> 01:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
choose to do so so I don't see um
 
01:47:37.830 --> 01:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily that we need to increase any
 
01:47:39.510 --> 01:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
penalties I think we just need to make
 
01:47:42.149 --> 01:47:42.159 align:start position:0%
sure that law enforcement is aware of
 
01:47:44.229 --> 01:47:44.239 align:start position:0%
their ability to enforce this and and
 
01:47:47.350 --> 01:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
indeed obligation in some cases um so I
 
01:47:49.390 --> 01:47:49.400 align:start position:0%
I I support the retaining the bill
 
01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:50.830 align:start position:0%
I I support the retaining the bill
further

01:47:50.830 --> 01:47:50.840 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:47:53.790 --> 01:47:53.800 align:start position:0%
discussion representa Muse
 
01:47:56.950 --> 01:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
I would say that um this is probably a
 
01:47:59.310 --> 01:47:59.320 align:start position:0%
bill that is less in our Strike Zone
 
01:48:01.669 --> 01:48:01.679 align:start position:0%
than some of the other ones uh that have
 
01:48:04.390 --> 01:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
that have come before us um and I would
 
01:48:07.070 --> 01:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
say more time to actually you know
 
01:48:08.790 --> 01:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
consider some of the implications and
 
01:48:10.510 --> 01:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
some of the potential unintended
 
01:48:13.189 --> 01:48:13.199 align:start position:0%
consequences you know including
 
01:48:13.199 --> 01:48:14.790 align:start position:0%
consequences you know including
potentially

01:48:14.790 --> 01:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
01:48:18.350 --> 01:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
um uh penalizing an overprotective
 
01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
parent with a Criminal conviction I
 
01:48:22.870 --> 01:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
think those are things that we need to
 
01:48:25.669 --> 01:48:25.679 align:start position:0%
really pay close attention to yeah I
 
01:48:27.910 --> 01:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
agree I'm I'm always very uncomfortable
 
01:48:31.070 --> 01:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
um when 99% of a
 
01:48:33.790 --> 01:48:33.800 align:start position:0%
law um belongs in another committee but
 
01:48:36.310 --> 01:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
yet 1% sticks it with us and it's not
 
01:48:39.070 --> 01:48:39.080 align:start position:0%
really our I believe uh one of the
 
01:48:40.669 --> 01:48:40.679 align:start position:0%
strengths of character we show is when
 
01:48:44.229 --> 01:48:44.239 align:start position:0%
we admit it's not our expertise so um
 
01:48:45.629 --> 01:48:45.639 align:start position:0%
that that's important that all those
 
01:48:47.870 --> 01:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
issues that are also being addressed by
 
01:48:49.270 --> 01:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
the appropriate committee right now in
 
01:48:51.709 --> 01:48:51.719 align:start position:0%
another bill um that touches on this a
 
01:48:53.950 --> 01:48:53.960 align:start position:0%
little bit right now so I think that's
 
01:48:56.109 --> 01:48:56.119 align:start position:0%
more appropriate representative share um
 
01:48:57.750 --> 01:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
and and my concern with the bill has
 
01:49:00.910 --> 01:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
always been um I just don't want to get
 
01:49:03.070 --> 01:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
criminal I don't want the police to show
 
01:49:06.669 --> 01:49:06.679 align:start position:0%
up at a scene when a a parent a divorced
 
01:49:11.149 --> 01:49:11.159 align:start position:0%
parent drops their child off two hours
 
01:49:14.310 --> 01:49:14.320 align:start position:0%
after they were supposed to and I can
 
01:49:17.430 --> 01:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
see in the wrong in the very emotional
 
01:49:20.750 --> 01:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
Circumstance the other parent uh calling
 
01:49:23.750 --> 01:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
the police because of that it's just
 
01:49:26.870 --> 01:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
child custody arrangements are messy
 
01:49:30.709 --> 01:49:30.719 align:start position:0%
enough as it is to to have you know the
 
01:49:32.350 --> 01:49:32.360 align:start position:0%
AG griev parent calling the police to
 
01:49:34.510 --> 01:49:34.520 align:start position:0%
their return is just it's not a good
 
01:49:37.950 --> 01:49:37.960 align:start position:0%
place to go no I I I think the the
 
01:49:40.910 --> 01:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
problem that really this bill is trying
 
01:49:43.750 --> 01:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
to address is
 
01:49:47.229 --> 01:49:47.239 align:start position:0%
actually the backlogs in our courts is
 
01:49:48.870 --> 01:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
really what the problem is is because
 
01:49:50.550 --> 01:49:50.560 align:start position:0%
the appropriate venue to have this
 
01:49:51.910 --> 01:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
discussion would be in front of the
 
01:49:54.870 --> 01:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
judge on the existing order but the fact
 
01:49:56.550 --> 01:49:56.560 align:start position:0%
that it takes them months to get in
 
01:49:59.229 --> 01:49:59.239 align:start position:0%
there um by that time you know there's
 
01:50:00.870 --> 01:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
there's 50 other things that have happen
 
01:50:02.790 --> 01:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
so I I think the problem that we're
 
01:50:04.149 --> 01:50:04.159 align:start position:0%
eventually going to have to face and
 
01:50:07.390 --> 01:50:07.400 align:start position:0%
deal with is is the the um pressure on
 
01:50:09.229 --> 01:50:09.239 align:start position:0%
our courts and the availability of
 
01:50:13.350 --> 01:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
judges to actually hand out Justice um
 
01:50:15.109 --> 01:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
see no further discussion I'd ask the
 
01:50:16.830 --> 01:50:16.840 align:start position:0%

01:50:19.550 --> 01:50:19.560 align:start position:0%

01:51:10.270 --> 01:51:10.280 align:start position:0%
0499 H second thank you motion made and
 
01:51:11.950 --> 01:51:11.960 align:start position:0%
seconded um would you like to speak to
 
01:51:15.430 --> 01:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
your motion absolutely thank you um the
 
01:51:18.589 --> 01:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
amendment I'm bringing forward um was
 
01:51:21.149 --> 01:51:21.159 align:start position:0%
made after looking over the last report
 
01:51:23.589 --> 01:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
we got on the Northern border Alliance
 
01:51:26.830 --> 01:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
and most of this is uh information
 
01:51:29.270 --> 01:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
that's already included in the report um
 
01:51:34.430 --> 01:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
is mainly codifying it into um statute
 
01:51:36.470 --> 01:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
and then it is requiring additional
 
01:51:39.109 --> 01:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
information be reported specifically
 
01:51:41.069 --> 01:51:41.079 align:start position:0%
around um the Customs and Border
 
01:51:43.589 --> 01:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
Protection related in incidents and also
 
01:51:46.669 --> 01:51:46.679 align:start position:0%
around um the individuals who are
 
01:51:51.310 --> 01:51:51.320 align:start position:0%
being um otherwise uh engaged with
 
01:51:54.709 --> 01:51:54.719 align:start position:0%
through this program they live um the
 
01:51:57.030 --> 01:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
intention for that is if you look at the
 
01:51:58.589 --> 01:51:58.599 align:start position:0%
last report I I said all the numbers
 
01:52:00.470 --> 01:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
when I was introducing the bill but
 
01:52:01.669 --> 01:52:01.679 align:start position:0%
essentially out of the like the hundreds
 
01:52:05.470 --> 01:52:05.480 align:start position:0%
of people that have um had interactions
 
01:52:07.149 --> 01:52:07.159 align:start position:0%
with the law enforcement through the
 
01:52:09.990 --> 01:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
northern border Alliance program um only
 
01:52:13.629 --> 01:52:13.639 align:start position:0%
four were cited as border related
 
01:52:16.229 --> 01:52:16.239 align:start position:0%
incidents um so the hope is with getting
 
01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
more of this information we can
 
01:52:21.589 --> 01:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
determine one like how effective this
 
01:52:23.550 --> 01:52:23.560 align:start position:0%
program is and what its intended
 
01:52:25.950 --> 01:52:25.960 align:start position:0%
purposes are supposed to be and if there
 
01:52:29.709 --> 01:52:29.719 align:start position:0%
are better ways um for us to support law
 
01:52:32.990 --> 01:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement up by the border um whether
 
01:52:34.189 --> 01:52:34.199 align:start position:0%
it's through this program or not but
 
01:52:35.430 --> 01:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
basically we need the information to
 
01:52:37.830 --> 01:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
make adequate decisions around funding
 
01:52:39.589 --> 01:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
and how we support law enforcement up by
 
01:52:43.430 --> 01:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
the border thank you um I will speak to
 
01:52:46.550 --> 01:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
my second and and I will say that as a
 
01:52:47.910 --> 01:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
supporter of the northern border
 
01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
Alliance I think
 
01:52:53.669 --> 01:52:53.679 align:start position:0%
that we should make all information
 
01:52:56.830 --> 01:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
available um I uh we just passed a bill
 
01:52:58.910 --> 01:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
recently regarding the federal
 
01:53:00.390 --> 01:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
activities in the state we wanted to
 
01:53:02.149 --> 01:53:02.159 align:start position:0%
know their information I see this is no
 
01:53:03.910 --> 01:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
different I don't see any problem with
 
01:53:06.629 --> 01:53:06.639 align:start position:0%
producing the evidence that a program is
 
01:53:08.310 --> 01:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
either successful or as you said
 
01:53:09.790 --> 01:53:09.800 align:start position:0%
unsuccessful and if it needs to be
 
01:53:13.270 --> 01:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
modified so I think that this is a good
 
01:53:14.629 --> 01:53:14.639 align:start position:0%
bill and there's no problem with
 
01:53:16.629 --> 01:53:16.639 align:start position:0%
producing this information I went to the
 
01:53:18.750 --> 01:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
Border this summer um I went up there
 
01:53:20.830 --> 01:53:20.840 align:start position:0%
and took a tour and met some of uh the
 
01:53:22.910 --> 01:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
fine Troopers who were working on this
 
01:53:24.430 --> 01:53:24.440 align:start position:0%
and I also talked to members of the
 
01:53:26.350 --> 01:53:26.360 align:start position:0%
public in the area um as I went around
 
01:53:28.390 --> 01:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
and walked around and some of the
 
01:53:29.790 --> 01:53:29.800 align:start position:0%
walking was out in the middle of the
 
01:53:33.870 --> 01:53:33.880 align:start position:0%
woods um in the public I I found no one
 
01:53:36.149 --> 01:53:36.159 align:start position:0%
who was not supportive of this because
 
01:53:39.109 --> 01:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
of the fact that they are U many of them
 
01:53:40.550 --> 01:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
who live up there on that border they do
 
01:53:42.390 --> 01:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
feel that conquered in a way has kind of
 
01:53:44.550 --> 01:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
forgotten them up there um they were
 
01:53:46.750 --> 01:53:46.760 align:start position:0%
appreciative of the the higher level of
 
01:53:50.430 --> 01:53:50.440 align:start position:0%
police presence in the area um and they
 
01:53:52.870 --> 01:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
really liked the idea that they were not
 
01:53:55.950 --> 01:53:55.960 align:start position:0%
alone up there and the federal um people
 
01:53:58.069 --> 01:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
we had on the border were just not
 
01:53:59.910 --> 01:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
enough and this was a force multiplier
 
01:54:01.870 --> 01:54:01.880 align:start position:0%
for them so I'd be interested to see the
 
01:54:03.229 --> 01:54:03.239 align:start position:0%
information that comes back from it as
 
01:54:05.669 --> 01:54:05.679 align:start position:0%
well I'd also say on the report that we
 
01:54:08.550 --> 01:54:08.560 align:start position:0%
already got I wonder if that just
 
01:54:11.310 --> 01:54:11.320 align:start position:0%
reflects what our law enforcement did
 
01:54:14.030 --> 01:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
versus what the federal government did
 
01:54:15.669 --> 01:54:15.679 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see the difference between
 
01:54:17.390 --> 01:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
that in other words are our law
 
01:54:19.310 --> 01:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement helping on those but it's
 
01:54:20.750 --> 01:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
not being captured because it's on the
 
01:54:22.870 --> 01:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
other one so I'm I'm interested to so I
 
01:54:24.990 --> 01:54:25.000 align:start position:0%
think it's a good bill further
 
01:54:27.390 --> 01:54:27.400 align:start position:0%
conversation discussion see none I ask
 
01:54:28.950 --> 01:54:28.960 align:start position:0%

bill this bill seeks to deal with the
 
02:12:56.709 --> 02:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
problem of um restricting information
 
02:12:58.109 --> 02:12:58.119 align:start position:0%
that's obtained off our driver's
 
02:13:00.149 --> 02:13:00.159 align:start position:0%

people while I I 100% support the idea
 
02:13:09.629 --> 02:13:09.639 align:start position:0%
that we heard during um we heard during
 
02:13:13.390 --> 02:13:13.400 align:start position:0%
testimony at the hearing from numerous
 
02:13:15.950 --> 02:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
private companies and organizations that
 
02:13:17.950 --> 02:13:17.960 align:start position:0%
this would cause a lot of problem as
 
02:13:21.709 --> 02:13:21.719 align:start position:0%
written um and that that's certainly not
 
02:13:24.830 --> 02:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
what we're looking to do so I want to
 
02:13:26.910 --> 02:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
retain it and take a second look at it
 
02:13:28.470 --> 02:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
um and maybe if if there's something we
 
02:13:30.109 --> 02:13:30.119 align:start position:0%
can do about it we'll do it again in the
 
02:13:31.910 --> 02:13:31.920 align:start position:0%

representative rhods I'll speak to my
 
02:14:43.669 --> 02:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
motion okay so we know we heard from the
 
02:14:45.390 --> 02:14:45.400 align:start position:0%
sponsor what the bill was trying to do
 
02:14:47.750 --> 02:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
the bill is trying to we he had a
 
02:14:49.950 --> 02:14:49.960 align:start position:0%
constituent who got a motor vehicle
 
02:14:49.960 --> 02:14:51.470 align:start position:0%
constituent who got a motor vehicle
citation

02:14:51.470 --> 02:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
citation
 
02:14:53.350 --> 02:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
he appealed it as he should to the
 
02:14:56.589 --> 02:14:56.599 align:start position:0%
courts um but part of his appeal that he
 
02:14:58.510 --> 02:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to make the argument to the court
 
02:15:00.750 --> 02:15:00.760 align:start position:0%
was that the officer was in some way
 
02:15:03.109 --> 02:15:03.119 align:start position:0%
inappropriate with him and he sought to
 
02:15:04.950 --> 02:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
use the body Cam and introduce it as
 
02:15:07.310 --> 02:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
evidence in his defense by the time it
 
02:15:07.320 --> 02:15:08.109 align:start position:0%
evidence in his defense by the time it
got

02:15:08.109 --> 02:15:08.119 align:start position:0%
got
 
02:15:11.229 --> 02:15:11.239 align:start position:0%
around the department had erased it as
 
02:15:13.669 --> 02:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
per their normal procedures for when it
 
02:15:16.990 --> 02:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
goes beyond a certain date so the bill
 
02:15:19.069 --> 02:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
as introduced sought to put certain
 
02:15:21.270 --> 02:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
dates and it get complicated and then we
 
02:15:22.910 --> 02:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
figured out that the easiest way to do
 
02:15:24.990 --> 02:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
this would just add to the existing body
 
02:15:27.709 --> 02:15:27.719 align:start position:0%
Camp statue where it already says they
 
02:15:30.549 --> 02:15:30.559 align:start position:0%
have to hold on to body Camp footage for
 
02:15:33.270 --> 02:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
pending criminal cases or valid court or
 
02:15:35.790 --> 02:15:35.800 align:start position:0%
administrative order Etc or we just add
 
02:15:38.109 --> 02:15:38.119 align:start position:0%
it or violation level offense so if
 
02:15:39.870 --> 02:15:39.880 align:start position:0%
there's a citation they've got to hold
 
02:15:42.390 --> 02:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
on to it until it's disposed of um and
 
02:15:44.510 --> 02:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
if the person pays it and there's no if
 
02:15:46.069 --> 02:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
the time period goes by where the person
 
02:15:47.669 --> 02:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
hasn't appealed the citation then they
 
02:15:49.990 --> 02:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
can destroy it so it's pretty simple
 
02:15:52.790 --> 02:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
further discussion question questions
 
02:16:34.389 --> 02:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:36.549 --> 02:16:36.559 align:start position:0%
it's a it says section one but then the
 
02:16:39.549 --> 02:16:39.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:47.309 --> 02:16:47.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:53.589 --> 02:16:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:56.990 --> 02:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
so let me let me Express why I ask that
 
02:16:59.910 --> 02:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
question my problem with this bill has
 
02:17:05.230 --> 02:17:05.240 align:start position:0%

02:17:07.870 --> 02:17:07.880 align:start position:0%

02:17:10.070 --> 02:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
