00:07:55.919 --> 00:08:01.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:02.869 --> 00:08:02.879 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
first thing that i want to do is just
 
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
get into definition of roles which
 
00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
is not too much except that
 
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
representative walper has very
 
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
graciously agreed uh to be
 
00:08:17.589 --> 00:08:17.599 align:start position:0%
the the clerk for the subcommittee so we
 
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
thank him for that and he kind of has a
 
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.309 align:start position:0%
thank him for that and he kind of has a
groove

00:08:20.309 --> 00:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
groove
 
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
going from that for the work that he
 
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
does with the regular committee um
 
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
aside from that as we go forward this is
 
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
not a public hearing or anything of that
 
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
nature this is this is
 
00:08:34.709 --> 00:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
is it too much away from you
 
00:08:34.719 --> 00:08:36.230 align:start position:0%
is it too much away from you
closer

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
closer
 
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
how's that better
 
00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.230 align:start position:0%
how's that better
okay

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:40.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
i do project but
 
00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.750 align:start position:0%
i do project but
so

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
but because this is a work session the
 
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
intention here is to
 
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
go through uh address some of the
 
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
concerns that were brought up with
 
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
respect to the testimony on the bill
 
00:08:57.269 --> 00:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
and actually go through brainstorming
 
00:08:59.350 --> 00:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
and working through
 
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
how we can address any of those concerns
 
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
overcome them with the intention of
 
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
developing potentially some future
 
00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:08.959 align:start position:0%
legislation that the next legislature
 
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
can act on so that being said
 
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
it's a very dynamic thing we're going to
 
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
have a lot of discussion within the
 
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
members of the committee itself
 
00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
but a lot of the subject experts are you
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
guys that are out there sitting in the
 
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
chairs and so
 
00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.150 align:start position:0%
chairs and so
um

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
if we get to a point in the agenda where
 
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
we're discussing something and you have
 
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
did i lose it if you have input with
 
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
respect to hey i have some data here
 
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
that would help inform why this is or is
 
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
not or if you have insights into how we
 
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
might form an approach to to tackling a
 
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:44.870 align:start position:0%
might form an approach to to tackling a
problem

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:45.990 align:start position:0%
problem
then

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
raise your hand and i i anticipate
 
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
people will be coming in and out of the
 
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
discussion as we go forward
 
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
can you hear me now jen it looks like it
 
00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
died again okay so she's adjusting
 
00:09:59.670 --> 00:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
so that being said i just want to kind
 
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
of give a quick review of where the
 
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
committee basically was following the
 
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
public hearing so the public hearing
 
00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.470 align:start position:0%
public hearing so the public hearing
the

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
the bill itself was um
 
00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
removing the remit the right of removal
 
00:10:16.069 --> 00:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
from the respondent to the superior
 
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
court and basically holding that just
 
00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
for the claimant and we heard a lot of
 
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
testimony and the testimony really
 
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
indicated that new hampshire was only
 
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
one of two states that allows removal by
 
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
the respondent and when it has been
 
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
challenged in the records
 
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
the courts have have not held in favor
 
00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959 align:start position:0%
of that so
 
00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
we felt
 
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
that the bill
 
00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:41.839 align:start position:0%
was on
 
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
pretty solid legal footing
 
00:10:48.069 --> 00:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
from that perspective however um as we
 
00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
heard testimony and a lot of folks that
 
00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
had concerns with the bill they were
 
00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
bringing up concerns in a lot of other
 
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
areas and the committee really felt a
 
00:10:59.190 --> 00:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
little bit nervous
 
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
about approving the legislation at that
 
00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:03.839 align:start position:0%
time based on those concerns
 
00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:06.399 align:start position:0%
and also felt that there was an
 
00:11:09.509 --> 00:11:09.519 align:start position:0%
opportunity to maybe identify some of
 
00:11:10.949 --> 00:11:10.959 align:start position:0%
the issues with the human rights
 
00:11:10.959 --> 00:11:11.990 align:start position:0%
the issues with the human rights
commission

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
and you know provide some legislative
 
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
help um if if that will help kind of
 
00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
shore things up as we go forward and so
 
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.870 align:start position:0%
shore things up as we go forward and so
really

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
from my perspective and we can kind of
 
00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
talk about that i think that is where
 
00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:27.519 align:start position:0%
the committee was and that is why they
 
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
decided to go forward with the interim
 
00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.790 align:start position:0%
decided to go forward with the interim
study

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:31.829 align:start position:0%
study
session

00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:31.839 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
and so um that's kind of where i'm at
 
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
with that before i go on to looking at
 
00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:37.519 align:start position:0%
the scope
 
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
does anybody else have any additional
 
00:11:43.509 --> 00:11:43.519 align:start position:0%
thoughts with respect to that or
 
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
would like to add anything to that
 
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:11:52.389 --> 00:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
there you go nice job
 
00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:54.959 align:start position:0%
uh yeah it seems to me that what we
 
00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
really got from the hearings
 
00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:58.870 align:start position:0%
really got from the hearings
was

00:11:58.870 --> 00:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:12:01.509 --> 00:12:01.519 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of issues with
 
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
how these cases are handled especially
 
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
the timeliness of it
 
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things that i think we
 
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
should be spending some time
 
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
investigating and seeing if we can come
 
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
up with some kind of way
 
00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:17.839 align:start position:0%
of expediting this because when we're in
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
three years five years
 
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
to me that's just totally unacceptable
 
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's
 
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
it's maybe worse than nothing
 
00:12:30.389 --> 00:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
yeah so that that was definitely one of
 
00:12:32.629 --> 00:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
the concerns the other concerns was with
 
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
the due process and
 
00:12:38.069 --> 00:12:38.079 align:start position:0%
that if the right of removal was taken
 
00:12:38.079 --> 00:12:38.949 align:start position:0%
that if the right of removal was taken
away

00:12:38.949 --> 00:12:38.959 align:start position:0%
away
 
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
are you taking away some of the due
 
00:12:44.069 --> 00:12:44.079 align:start position:0%
process rights of the respondents i i
 
00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
think the process is pretty robust but
 
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
definitely i think that is something
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
that we have to consider because it was
 
00:12:52.629 --> 00:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
a concern that was brought up and
 
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
reinforced many times so
 
00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
if you go down to the next bullet
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
on the agenda
 
00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
basically and i put question marks on
 
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
these um because these were these were
 
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
just my thoughts and i i just want to
 
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
throw this you know first out to the
 
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
members of the committee but also out to
 
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
uh the folks in the audience
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
you know just based on some of the
 
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
comments from representative walper and
 
00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
the testimony we heard
 
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
really to get by in here
 
00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
the big concerns i heard was due process
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
so i think
 
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
from my perspective i would like to have
 
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
the committee look at that i don't think
 
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
that there is a guarantee
 
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
to a jury trial i don't think that due
 
00:13:38.949 --> 00:13:38.959 align:start position:0%
process always rises to that level
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
but what is the due process in this case
 
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
and what is the standard for saying that
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
that is adequate due process or not due
 
00:13:46.079 --> 00:13:47.110 align:start position:0%
that is adequate due process or not due
process

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
so kind of understanding that
 
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
and also representative walper as you
 
00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
brought up the timeliness
 
00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
we did hear testimony about three years
 
00:13:58.949 --> 00:13:58.959 align:start position:0%
we did hear testimony about five years
 
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
so the question is
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
what were the circumstances in those
 
00:14:02.639 --> 00:14:03.590 align:start position:0%
what were the circumstances in those
cases

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
were those the average
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
uh median were those outlier situations
 
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
what kind of drove
 
00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
those episodes and so i think you know
 
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the norm is that
 
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
an outlier if it is an outlier what
 
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
drove that outlier those are some of the
 
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
things i think
 
00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
that we need to understand um
 
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
if we're going to go and really move
 
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
forward to a solution so
 
00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.269 align:start position:0%
forward to a solution so
um

00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:29.279 --> 00:14:30.710 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:33.269 --> 00:14:33.279 align:start position:0%
due process timeliness again i'll throw
 
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
it out to the rest of the committee
 
00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
um i don't want to
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
blow the scope out too far
 
00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.069 align:start position:0%
blow the scope out too far
but

00:14:40.069 --> 00:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:41.839 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any additional
 
00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
thoughts or concerns something beyond
 
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
rosanna smith
 
00:14:59.670 --> 00:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
thank you so much mr chair and i look
 
00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
forward to working with my colleagues on
 
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
this um
 
00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:05.430 align:start position:0%
this um
i

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
am aware and i think
 
00:15:07.519 --> 00:15:08.870 align:start position:0%
am aware and i think
um

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not alone in being aware that some
 
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
of the problems
 
00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:14.949 align:start position:0%
of the problems
um

00:15:14.949 --> 00:15:14.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:17.829 --> 00:15:17.839 align:start position:0%
that the commission for human rights are
 
00:15:21.189 --> 00:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
facing in new hampshire are being faced
 
00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:24.839 align:start position:0%
in other states also
 
00:15:24.839 --> 00:15:26.629 align:start position:0%
in other states also
and

00:15:26.629 --> 00:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:26.639 --> 00:15:27.750 align:start position:0%
and
how

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:15:30.629 --> 00:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
those down in terms of whether they are
 
00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
state specific
 
00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
or whether they have to do with the
 
00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
organizational structure
 
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
of each of the commissions in the states
 
00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.870 align:start position:0%
of each of the commissions in the states
or

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
as we all know when they say it's not
 
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
about the money it usually is about the
 
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
money whether it has to do with that
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answers to any of those
 
00:15:55.199 --> 00:15:56.470 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answers to any of those
questions

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
but if what we are looking at is a
 
00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:09.990 align:start position:0%
rather than
a

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
narrow problem
 
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
a more targeted problem dealing with due
 
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
i'm in a
 
00:16:24.629 --> 00:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
a state of
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
well a lack of clarity as to
 
00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
whether any of those
 
00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
broader issues
 
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
have any relevance
 
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
the last thing i want to do is to focus
 
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
on a broad issue and then miss the
 
00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.110 align:start position:0%
on a broad issue and then miss the
opportunity

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
to focus on issues very narrow and
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
specific to new hampshire
 
00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:47.839 align:start position:0%
i just
 
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
feel better by sharing my concern
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:56.790 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:59.509 --> 00:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
is your concern just trying to
 
00:17:01.389 --> 00:17:01.399 align:start position:0%
understand where new
 
00:17:04.949 --> 00:17:04.959 align:start position:0%
hampshire uh
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
sits relative to the other states um
 
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
or or
 
00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
mr chair that might be a very good way
 
00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:15.839 align:start position:0%
of looking at it
 
00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:16.630 align:start position:0%
of looking at it
um

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
and the purpose in looking at it that
 
00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
would way not would not be because
 
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
misery loves company
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
but it would be because we might um
 
00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.549 align:start position:0%
but it would be because we might um
learn

00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
learn
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
from the experience
 
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
of other states about how to find our
 
00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.230 align:start position:0%
of other states about how to find our
way

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.669 align:start position:0%
way
through

00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
uh so i thank you for making some sense
 
00:17:48.549 --> 00:17:48.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
well i i think it's a good comment
 
00:17:53.909 --> 00:17:53.919 align:start position:0%
because it it it is uh
 
00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
how do we approach it what are other
 
00:17:57.669 --> 00:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
states doing um
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
so is your thinking if we were to look
 
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
at it relative to
 
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
other states is that a whole separate
 
00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
agenda item that you would look at just
 
00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:09.039 align:start position:0%
in general or would you like to look at
 
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
it to say for example due process
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
how do other states process their claims
 
00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:16.470 align:start position:0%
how do other states process their claims
versus

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
versus
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
how does our state process their claims
 
00:18:21.029 --> 00:18:21.039 align:start position:0%
how do they render their decisions
 
00:18:23.909 --> 00:18:23.919 align:start position:0%
versus how do we render our decisions
 
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
what are their timelines and what are
 
00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
their relative resources which i think
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
would get at the time in this issue so
 
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
do you think
 
00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:32.630 align:start position:0%
do you think
that

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
comparative analysis of other states
 
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
versus our state would fall within the
 
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
scope of looking at you know the process
 
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
and time in this issue or do you think
 
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
it should
 
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
be expanded beyond that what are your
 
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.110 align:start position:0%
be expanded beyond that what are your
thoughts

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
thoughts
 
00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
well i think it makes sense to see how
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
other states are handling
 
00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
these two issues but that still leaves
 
00:18:59.110 --> 00:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
on the table
 
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
and maybe it should be left on the table
 
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
whether we're missing something
 
00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
that is even more relevant
 
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
to what the commission for human rights
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
is facing then due process and
 
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
timeliness and i don't know the answer
 
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
mr chairman and i last thing i want to
 
00:19:18.559 --> 00:19:19.430 align:start position:0%
mr chairman and i last thing i want to
do

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
is bury us in so much um
 
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
material that we're paralyzed and that
 
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
we're incapable of moving forward and so
 
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
that is really my concern which is why i
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
like your approach because it's narrow
 
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
it's focused and we know their problems
 
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
i guess at some point
 
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
i'd i'd like to have an asterisk
 
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
that says
 
00:19:47.669 --> 00:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
or recognizing that we might
 
00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:54.559 align:start position:0%
find that our attention would be better
 
00:19:54.559 --> 00:19:56.150 align:start position:0%
find that our attention would be better
focused

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
focused
 
00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:58.640 align:start position:0%
in another area so we wouldn't begin
 
00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
with that but if somehow something
 
00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
rears its ugly head and it would be an
 
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
ugly head
 
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.470 align:start position:0%
ugly head
um

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't pretend it's not there
 
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
well what i think i mean i think there's
 
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
validity in that but
 
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
i i do think you know keeping a an
 
00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.630 align:start position:0%
i i do think you know keeping a an
initially

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
initially
 
00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.310 align:start position:0%
initially
focused

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
focused
 
00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.070 align:start position:0%
focused
lens

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
lens
 
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
based on some of the concerns raised in
 
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
the testimony but
 
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
part of that could be and we do have a
 
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
whole summer where we can after jen goes
 
00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:38.559 align:start position:0%
to scotland and comes back we could
 
00:20:41.669 --> 00:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
we could maybe do a comparative analysis
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
you know looking at process
 
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
and obviously
 
00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:48.559 align:start position:0%
our initial goal with looking at process
 
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
is going to be understanding the due
 
00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:52.559 align:start position:0%
process is it adequate
 
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
but from that comparative analysis other
 
00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
things may come out um
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
which may inform us and give us
 
00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
something else but i think
 
00:21:03.669 --> 00:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
um maybe that might be a good way to
 
00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
kind of thread that needle um
 
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
i think that makes a lot of sense i do
 
00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
have one comment i don't know why we all
 
00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
believe it or not it's on my bucket list
 
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
00:21:22.149 --> 00:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
um yes
 
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
um you know when i was
 
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
looking at the bill you know
 
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
to prepare for the study committee i
 
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
kind of like i went kind of like around
 
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
in circles because i did research a
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
couple of states and
 
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
just basically um what i found was that
 
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
other states are having the very very
 
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
same issue um and so before getting lost
 
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
in that little loop i just thought no go
 
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
back to the bill focus on you know the
 
00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:48.870 align:start position:0%
back to the bill focus on you know the
question

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
questions of due process end of um
 
00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to follow up on
 
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
what representative smith was saying
 
00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.510 align:start position:0%
what representative smith was saying
because

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:14.230 align:start position:0%
because
the

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.350 align:start position:0%
the
the

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:18.559 align:start position:0%
broad concepts of due process or
 
00:22:18.559 --> 00:22:19.669 align:start position:0%
broad concepts of due process or
or

00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:22:19.679 --> 00:22:24.310 align:start position:0%
or
timeliness

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
by analogy i i guess if
 
00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.190 align:start position:0%
by analogy i i guess if
well

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
i'm more mechanical so if
 
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
if um
 
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
it's i don't think we need to be so
 
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
concerned about how the vehicle looks or
 
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
how fast it goes or what it sounds like
 
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
i think we actually have to
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
look at the mechanics of the build
 
00:22:48.549 --> 00:22:48.559 align:start position:0%
and how it's working and
 
00:22:51.029 --> 00:22:51.039 align:start position:0%
from my perspective you know from the
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
testimony that we heard
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
the delay in large part goes to the
 
00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:58.950 align:start position:0%
the delay in large part goes to the
mechanics

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
mechanics
 
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
how the commission is working and i
 
00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:02.149 align:start position:0%
how the commission is working and i
guess

00:23:02.149 --> 00:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
guess
 
00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
that's what i'd like to do some
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
diagnosis of is why
 
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
i was surprised at the number of
 
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
hearings and why there aren't more
 
00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.750 align:start position:0%
hearings and why there aren't more
hearings

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
more frequently
 
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
and who's hearing those hearings
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
and why is there such a delay in
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
scheduling hearings
 
00:23:23.039 --> 00:23:23.830 align:start position:0%
scheduling hearings
so

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
rather and i i like the approach in
 
00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:30.559 align:start position:0%
terms of the issues and i agree with the
 
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
issues of due process and timeliness but
 
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
i'd sort of like to get into the
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
mechanics and how that system is working
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
and how we might be able to
 
00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:42.710 align:start position:0%
and how we might be able to
either

00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:44.789 --> 00:23:44.799 align:start position:0%
modify it or
 
00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.510 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at mechanics though
 
00:23:58.870 --> 00:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
you're still looking at mechanics to
 
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
basically accelerate the process
 
00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:02.310 align:start position:0%
basically accelerate the process
and

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
but you want to understand the process
 
00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:05.909 align:start position:0%
but you want to understand the process
what's

00:24:05.909 --> 00:24:05.919 align:start position:0%
what's
 
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
how does it go
 
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
who's hearing what and when
 
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
right i mean we we heard testimony over
 
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
and over again
 
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh in
 
00:24:18.149 --> 00:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
no offense to anybody but that that the
 
00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
system currently as it's structured is
 
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.430 align:start position:0%
system currently as it's structured is
dysfunctional

00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
dysfunctional
 
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
in that it takes so long to process
 
00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
a case
 
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:26.870 align:start position:0%
a case
that

00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh by the time by the time you get a
 
00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:32.710 align:start position:0%
uh by the time by the time you get a
decision

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
a an employee is already disenfranchised
 
00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.549 align:start position:0%
a an employee is already disenfranchised
so

00:24:38.549 --> 00:24:38.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that
 
00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:41.350 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that
we

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:42.149 align:start position:0%
we
if

00:24:42.149 --> 00:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:24:42.159 --> 00:24:42.950 align:start position:0%
if
it

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:24:45.909 --> 00:24:45.919 align:start position:0%
it may take more than just simply trying
 
00:24:49.269 --> 00:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
to speed up the process it
 
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
it may take
 
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
a redesign of the process to make that
 
00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.710 align:start position:0%
a redesign of the process to make that
happen

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:58.549 --> 00:24:58.559 align:start position:0%
and i and i don't disagree that we can
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
look at other places you know
 
00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
we just saw an article from
 
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
massachusetts having the same problems
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
apparently that we're having here
 
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh and and maybe it's endemic
 
00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:10.789 align:start position:0%
uh and and maybe it's endemic
but

00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that we ought to come up
 
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
with a new hampshire solution that works
 
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i have a
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
question mr chairman yes um
 
00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
would it be helpful um to have a
 
00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
a performance audit by the legislative
 
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
budget assistant would this be under
 
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
that purview
 
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
i would deflect that question to
 
00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
maybe in her capacity as a former
 
00:25:44.789 --> 00:25:44.799 align:start position:0%
finance chair may know that better than
 
00:25:44.799 --> 00:25:47.269 align:start position:0%
finance chair may know that better than
i

00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:49.909 --> 00:25:49.919 align:start position:0%
well that's always a good suggestion
 
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
there is um
 
00:25:54.149 --> 00:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
a procedure for doing that there's a
 
00:25:54.159 --> 00:25:55.430 align:start position:0%
a procedure for doing that there's a
committee

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.750 align:start position:0%
committee
that

00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
that screens requests from legislators
 
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
and then makes suggestions
 
00:26:03.919 --> 00:26:04.950 align:start position:0%
and then makes suggestions
to

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:26:08.789 --> 00:26:08.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:12.549 --> 00:26:12.559 align:start position:0%
staff and they take a look and see if it
 
00:26:12.559 --> 00:26:13.750 align:start position:0%
staff and they take a look and see if it
if

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:16.559 align:start position:0%
how you would effectively design all of
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
that is good
 
00:26:21.269 --> 00:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
but that takes a lot of time too and at
 
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
this point
 
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of um
 
00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
direct uh
 
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
our action and
 
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
is somewhat limited i mean come november
 
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:34.559 align:start position:0%
1st we don't exist anymore
 
00:26:35.669 --> 00:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
for this
 
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
committee um
 
00:26:39.029 --> 00:26:39.039 align:start position:0%
there's no question that we could
 
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
include in our report um
 
00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
that we think it would be helpful
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
to have such an audit and then that
 
00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
could go forward but it's nothing that
 
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
we can do now
 
00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:54.789 align:start position:0%
we can do now
before

00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:54.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
many months pass
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lorenzo
 
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any thoughts or
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
comments with respect is anybody uh
 
00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
in the galley
 
00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
any thoughts comments with respect to uh
 
00:27:11.679 --> 00:27:22.389 align:start position:0%
any thoughts comments with respect to uh
yes

00:27:22.389 --> 00:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:22.399 --> 00:27:40.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
oh there it is
 
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.110 align:start position:0%
oh there it is
um

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
there has recently been an article
 
00:27:48.549 --> 00:27:48.559 align:start position:0%
discussing the problems at the
 
00:27:48.559 --> 00:27:50.149 align:start position:0%
discussing the problems at the
massachusetts

00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
commission against discrimination
 
00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
i don't think that the problem that
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
they're experiencing is the same
 
00:28:00.149 --> 00:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
as the one that we're experiencing here
 
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire though and that's
 
00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
because in massachusetts the defendant
 
00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
does not have this right of removal
 
00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:09.669 align:start position:0%
does not have this right of removal
so

00:28:09.669 --> 00:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
imagine you're an employee
 
00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.549 align:start position:0%
imagine you're an employee
in

00:28:14.549 --> 00:28:14.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
trying to work their way through the
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
process at mcad
 
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
you may
 
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
be mired
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
in a long investigative process
 
00:28:27.029 --> 00:28:27.039 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
00:28:27.039 --> 00:28:28.149 align:start position:0%
that's not
working

00:28:28.149 --> 00:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
working
 
00:28:28.159 --> 00:28:29.350 align:start position:0%
working
very

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.389 align:start position:0%
very
efficiently

00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
efficiently
 
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
and promptly
 
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
for several years until you get a pc
 
00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:36.070 align:start position:0%
for several years until you get a pc
finding

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
finding
 
00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
but at least at the end of that process
 
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get yanked to
 
00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
superior court to start all over again
 
00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.430 align:start position:0%
superior court to start all over again
period

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
period
 
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
but that's what's happening here in new
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
hampshire in new hampshire employees are
 
00:28:49.919 --> 00:28:50.870 align:start position:0%
hampshire in new hampshire employees are
stuck

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
stuck
 
00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
at the commission
 
00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
trying to help
 
00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
overburdened investigators for a long
 
00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.590 align:start position:0%
overburdened investigators for a long
time

00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:00.799 align:start position:0%
and then they finally get a pc finding
 
00:29:04.149 --> 00:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
and the defense defense uh council
 
00:29:05.669 --> 00:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
because they can
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:15.029 --> 00:29:15.039 align:start position:0%
okay sorry uh instead of pc probable
 
00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
cause in mcat is the massachusetts
 
00:29:20.389 --> 00:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
commission against discrimination anyway
 
00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
i i i what i'm proposing is that the
 
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
situation is worse here for employees
 
00:29:28.389 --> 00:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
than it is in massachusetts that's all
 
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
that i wanted to
 
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
oh me i'm megan douglas i'm an attorney

00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
does anybody else have any other
 
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
importer thoughts
 
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:09.269 --> 00:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
sorry i guess i'm turned on again i'm
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
heather burns
 
00:30:12.389 --> 00:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
from upton and hatfield on center street
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
here in concord
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
and i've been practicing employment law
 
00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire for about 30 years
 
00:30:20.789 --> 00:30:20.799 align:start position:0%
i went to the law school here in concord
 
00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
i've done a lot of work over the years
 
00:30:25.029 --> 00:30:25.039 align:start position:0%
with the human rights commission and i
 
00:30:27.029 --> 00:30:27.039 align:start position:0%
think as to the timely issue that you
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
were asking about
 
00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
i think that things have been made much
 
00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
more difficult over time for the
 
00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:34.549 align:start position:0%
more difficult over time for the
commission

00:30:34.549 --> 00:30:34.559 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
because they have so few investigators
 
00:30:40.149 --> 00:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
they're down to four investigators
 
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
as well as the executive director and
 
00:30:44.549 --> 00:30:44.559 align:start position:0%
the assistant executive director and i
 
00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
think it just makes it difficult
 
00:30:50.549 --> 00:30:50.559 align:start position:0%
to sort of timely do investigation of
 
00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
these cases and so to me i think that's
 
00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
really the number one answer to
 
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
why it's difficult i know that i
 
00:30:59.110 --> 00:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
understand that they recently lost an
 
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
investigator so i think they had five
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
and then they went back down to four
 
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of cases that go through
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire human rights
 
00:31:09.029 --> 00:31:09.039 align:start position:0%
commission and to have it really handled
 
00:31:11.509 --> 00:31:11.519 align:start position:0%
by primarily for investigators just
 
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
makes it very challenging for them to
 
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
conduct investigations within the three
 
00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:16.950 align:start position:0%
conduct investigations within the three
years

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:31:19.029 --> 00:31:19.039 align:start position:0%
that comes under our statute in new
 
00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:21.039 align:start position:0%
hampshire to have a claim
 
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
that could be filed in court under rsa
 
00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:25.269 align:start position:0%
that could be filed in court under rsa
354-a

00:31:25.269 --> 00:31:25.279 align:start position:0%
354-a
 
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
you have to be able to
 
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
file your claim in court within three
 
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
years if you can't file it within three
 
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
years you no longer have a claim under
 
00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
the state statute and there's definitely
 
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
been instances in probably recent years
 
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
where the human rights commission cannot
 
00:31:42.149 --> 00:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
render they can't finish their their
 
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
investigation and render the probable
 
00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
cause finding within a three-year period
 
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
of time
 
00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
so i do think lack of resources is an
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
issue and i'm happy to answer any other
 
00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
questions you have because i have great
 
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
familiarity with practicing before
 
00:31:58.630 --> 00:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
many many people before the human rights
 
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you does anybody have a
 
00:32:08.789 --> 00:32:08.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
so i mean i think i think for me
 
00:32:13.509 --> 00:32:13.519 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit at the heart of it
 
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
is it is it a question of mechanics is
 
00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
it a question of resources
 
00:32:17.679 --> 00:32:18.710 align:start position:0%
it a question of resources
um

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:20.559 align:start position:0%
that's i think what we want to get into
 
00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
so that we have a better understanding
 
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
of that and if it's a question of the
 
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
mechanics as representative gordon was
 
00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
saying where can we shore that up if
 
00:32:30.389 --> 00:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
it's a question of resources you know
 
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
what can we do in that area but but i
 
00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:33.830 align:start position:0%
what can we do in that area but but i
think

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
the role of this committee is to really
 
00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.710 align:start position:0%
the role of this committee is to really
understand

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:32:40.149 --> 00:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
those elements the resources the
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
mechanics so that whatever we recommend
 
00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
is going to truly address uh the problem
 
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
so that that's our goal here so does
 
00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any other thoughts um
 
00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
just on the scope issue and and
 
00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
broadly speaking where we should be
 
00:32:54.159 --> 00:32:56.070 align:start position:0%
broadly speaking where we should be
going

00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
yes sorry i had one more comment that i
 
00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to address um
 
00:33:03.029 --> 00:33:03.039 align:start position:0%
about representative gordon's question
 
00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
about why um there aren't really more
 
00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
hearings being held at the commission
 
00:33:08.159 --> 00:33:09.430 align:start position:0%
hearings being held at the commission
and

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
from my personal experience representing
 
00:33:12.789 --> 00:33:12.799 align:start position:0%
a lot of complainants of the commission
 
00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
i think that what happens is because it
 
00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
takes the commission an awful long time
 
00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
to conduct investigations of cases
 
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of employees who are represented
 
00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
by counsel in cases by someone like
 
00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
myself or megan douglas
 
00:33:29.669 --> 00:33:29.679 align:start position:0%
we end up pulling those cases out of the
 
00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
commission and we file them in court
 
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
ourselves on behalf of the complainant
 
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
because we're not sure that the
 
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
commission will be even able to conduct
 
00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
an investigation within the three-year
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
time frame required by the statute
 
00:33:45.029 --> 00:33:45.039 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:33:47.509 --> 00:33:47.519 align:start position:0%
for those complainants oftentimes
 
00:33:50.389 --> 00:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
unrepresented who are the ones who do
 
00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
wait out the commission process and they
 
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
wait for a full investigation for those
 
00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
fortunate enough to get a probable cause
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
finding by the human rights commission
 
00:34:02.789 --> 00:34:02.799 align:start position:0%
a lot of times at that point the
 
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
employer then takes the case and removes
 
00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
them to court and starts the process all
 
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
over again we've had we've had
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
many potential plaintiffs contact our
 
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
law firm about cases where they've been
 
00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:17.839 align:start position:0%
at the human rights commission three
 
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
four or so years excuse me they get a
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%
probable cause finding and the reason
 
00:34:25.829 --> 00:34:25.839 align:start position:0%
they're reaching out to our firm is that
 
00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
as soon as they had a probable cause
 
00:34:28.869 --> 00:34:28.879 align:start position:0%
finding and they were hoping that they
 
00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
would be able to have a hearing before
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
the human rights commission the employer
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
then removes them to the superior court
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
and an unrepresented employee really
 
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:39.839 align:start position:0%
knows that it it's almost impossible for
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
he or she to succeed in the superior
 
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
court system if they're pro se and so
 
00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:45.919 align:start position:0%
they're reaching out looking for a
 
00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
lawyer but they're already at the point
 
00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:49.919 align:start position:0%
where they've already been brought to
 
00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
court so i think that's really the
 
00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
answer as to why there's not all that
 
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
many hearings and when you look at how
 
00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
many hearings the human rights
 
00:34:58.069 --> 00:34:58.079 align:start position:0%
commission has held
 
00:35:00.069 --> 00:35:00.079 align:start position:0%
i think that's why i think the lack of
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
hearings is that once there's a probable
 
00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
cause finding
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of the time the employers remove
 
00:35:07.109 --> 00:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
the case to superior court and say we're
 
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
not going to go through the hearing
 
00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
process at all the commission
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
but obviously i'm happy to hear from the
 
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
commission i'm sure you'll want to hear
 
00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
from the commission directly as well but
 
00:35:18.069 --> 00:35:18.079 align:start position:0%
that's my perspective from getting uh
 
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
calls from clients and following the
 
00:35:21.589 --> 00:35:21.599 align:start position:0%
commission thank you ms burns i saw
 
00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um ani malachi from the human
 
00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
rights commission
 
00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:39.839 align:start position:0%
um okay so there are a lot of things
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
we're talking apples oranges pineapples
 
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
some things are apples by themselves
 
00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
some things are oranges and some things
 
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
are fruit salad
 
00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:50.150 align:start position:0%
are fruit salad
so

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
with an understanding that there'll be a
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
lot of that as we work through and
 
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
understanding the mechanics of the
 
00:35:59.349 --> 00:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
conversation is really important
 
00:36:01.349 --> 00:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
one of the things that is also important
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
to note is
 
00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:05.839 align:start position:0%
in terms of the last four years so we
 
00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
can look back way into the beginning but
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
i've been there for the last four years
 
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
so one of the important things to look
 
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
at relative to hearings and the quote
 
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
unquote lack thereof if you look at the
 
00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:19.990 align:start position:0%
unquote lack thereof if you look at the
document

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
document
 
00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
in the folder that you have
 
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
as soon as you open it on the left hand
 
00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:26.950 align:start position:0%
as soon as you open it on the left hand
side

00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
side
 
00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
it says new hampshire commission for
 
00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
human rights white paper so if you just
 
00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
skip to the very last page
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
or even if you look through
 
00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:37.589 align:start position:0%
or even if you look through
this

00:36:37.589 --> 00:36:37.599 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh the the pages what you'll see is
 
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
all of the cases so this is from 20
 
00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2021.
 
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
if you look at the
 
00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:48.150 align:start position:0%
if you look at the
the

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
cases that are named there those are
 
00:36:53.349 --> 00:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
things that were scheduled for hearings
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
and what our pros part of our process is
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
there's mediation in the beginning an
 
00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
off an opportunity for that
 
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
sometimes one party other or the other
 
00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:05.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to which is their right
 
00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
however once is a probable cause finding
 
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
then we move into what's called
 
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
conciliation which really is a mandatory
 
00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
mediation same process
 
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
we had
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%
last year or fiscal year 21 we were
 
00:37:17.839 --> 00:37:19.829 align:start position:0%
last year or fiscal year 21 we were
scheduling

00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:19.839 align:start position:0%
scheduling
 
00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
three of those a month but now we have
 
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
moved into
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
scheduling two a week in terms of
 
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
conciliations now
 
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
a hearing happens a hearing is scheduled
 
00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
but the hearing happens
 
00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
if one of several things doesn't happen
 
00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:39.839 align:start position:0%
if the case does not conciliate
 
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
then it moves on to schedule a hearing
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
if the respondent withdraws it or if the
 
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
complainant withdraws it both of those
 
00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
all three of those things happen
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
now we will and we literally had one
 
00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
yesterday that was scheduled for a
 
00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
hearing but it conciliated which means
 
00:37:59.829 --> 00:37:59.839 align:start position:0%
that it settled so
 
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
for this fiscal year so far we have a 51
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
settle rate
 
00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
for conciliated cases so there isn't a
 
00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
need for the hearing if it settles
 
00:38:15.829 --> 00:38:15.839 align:start position:0%
the commission has two
 
00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
almost competing
 
00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
factors it wants the individual that's
 
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
been aggrieved to be made whole if that
 
00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
can be done through mediation or
 
00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
conciliation great
 
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
and the con and the commission also
 
00:38:31.589 --> 00:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
wants there to be no more discrimination
 
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sure we all want that sitting in
 
00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
this room however we are not going to
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
not allow a complainant to
 
00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
be made whole for the mere fact of us
 
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
having a hearing
 
00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
so if they are if they agree to whatever
 
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
the terms are if the two parties can
 
00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
come together great that person is made
 
00:38:53.589 --> 00:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
whole and if you look at this document
 
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of the cases that
 
00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
settled there are instances where
 
00:39:01.349 --> 00:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
someone may have a marginal case someone
 
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
may have a very strong case and we have
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
heard this we'll say anecdotally that
 
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
they've gone to seek an attorney and the
 
00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
attorney will not represent them until
 
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
they have gotten a probable cause
 
00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
finding from us and so that process
 
00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
takes it long takes as long as it takes
 
00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
and then once they've received a
 
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
probable cause
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
there are times where they are more
 
00:39:23.829 --> 00:39:23.839 align:start position:0%
likely to obtain an attorney to then
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
move it on in the process whether that
 
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
remains with us whether it goes to court
 
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
there are some there are some charges
 
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
that are you know just awful and very
 
00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
easy to prove you've got a smoking gun
 
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
you've got text messages you have emails
 
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
you have a lot of evidence that makes it
 
00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
easy to be able to prove that this thing
 
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
happened and unfortunately with these
 
00:39:47.829 --> 00:39:47.839 align:start position:0%
incidents is and it's not like a car
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
wreck where there's debris left on the
 
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
street there are some issues where
 
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of he said she said and
 
00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
there has to be either depositions or
 
00:39:59.109 --> 00:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
our investigation in order to
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
substantiate whatever the claim is
 
00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
whether the complainant whether this
 
00:40:05.589 --> 00:40:05.599 align:start position:0%
actually happened to them or whether
 
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
there was a non-discriminatory reason
 
00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
for whatever the action the adverse
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
action was
 
00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
relative to the person filing the charge
 
00:40:16.069 --> 00:40:16.079 align:start position:0%
so i know lots of fruit salad happening
 
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
here but i think all of those things are
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:25.829 --> 00:40:25.839 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for being here and
 
00:40:30.069 --> 00:40:30.079 align:start position:0%
for sharing that with us
 
00:40:30.079 --> 00:40:31.349 align:start position:0%
for sharing that with us
um

00:40:31.349 --> 00:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to ask a difficult
 
00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:34.630 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to ask a difficult
question

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
and of course you don't have to answer
 
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
are you
 
00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:40.630 align:start position:0%
are you
satisfied

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
satisfied
 
00:40:42.069 --> 00:40:42.079 align:start position:0%
with how
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
the commission is structured
 
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
and how it is
 
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
carrying out
 
00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
its uh functions
 
00:40:53.589 --> 00:40:53.599 align:start position:0%
that is a really excellent and hard
 
00:40:53.599 --> 00:40:55.190 align:start position:0%
that is a really excellent and hard
question

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of parts to that and i
 
00:40:58.230 --> 00:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
may have to look over at my attorney to
 
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
make sure i say this correctly
 
00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
part of it is
 
00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
so there are statutory reasons why we do
 
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
what we do as you well know
 
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
i mean i think the thing that would make
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
things move faster if there are if
 
00:41:13.109 --> 00:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
people aren't allowed to
 
00:41:16.069 --> 00:41:16.079 align:start position:0%
amend charges or you know those little
 
00:41:17.829 --> 00:41:17.839 align:start position:0%
things well they're actually very big
 
00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
things if i don't remember all of the
 
00:41:22.349 --> 00:41:22.359 align:start position:0%
things in the beginning i can
 
00:41:22.359 --> 00:41:23.910 align:start position:0%
things in the beginning i can
continuously

00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
continuously
 
00:41:27.589 --> 00:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
amend my charge so every new amendment
 
00:41:29.589 --> 00:41:29.599 align:start position:0%
which is that person's right at this
 
00:41:32.309 --> 00:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
point that needs to be investigated so
 
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
if i am making a charge and i um if i'm
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
saying that two things happened and
 
00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
actually there were four things now that
 
00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
i remember and um and but we've already
 
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
started the investigation of the two
 
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
things and i want to add the other two
 
00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
things that information then needs to go
 
00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
to the respondent and they need time to
 
00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:54.950 align:start position:0%
to the respondent and they need time to
respond

00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
okay so you seem to
 
00:41:59.589 --> 00:41:59.599 align:start position:0%
feel that um
 
00:42:01.589 --> 00:42:01.599 align:start position:0%
the first thing you would mention is
 
00:42:01.599 --> 00:42:03.270 align:start position:0%
the first thing you would mention is
that

00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.069 align:start position:0%
that
the

00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:04.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
the statute or the rules i'm not sure
 
00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
which because i'm not checking
 
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:08.870 align:start position:0%
which because i'm not checking
um

00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
should be changed to um
 
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
limit the um
 
00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:17.430 align:start position:0%
limit the um
uh

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
the complainant's uh right to amend
 
00:42:23.349 --> 00:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
the complaint um no that's not what i'm
 
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
saying um it it is that individual's
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
right in any investigation to be able to
 
00:42:31.829 --> 00:42:31.839 align:start position:0%
support whatever
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
whatever claims they're making just like
 
00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
it's the right of the respondent to be
 
00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
able to respond to those rights i think
 
00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
what i'm really trying to say
 
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
is i don't know that there's anything
 
00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
less that we can do if there's anything
 
00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:47.599 align:start position:0%
based on how we do what we do any rights
 
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
that we could take away from someone to
 
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
more to expedite our process i mean
 
00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
ultimately it's the number of the number
 
00:42:58.230 --> 00:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
of cases that come in or the number of
 
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
charges that come in and the number of
 
00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
people we have allocated to do the work
 
00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
is is the is the issue
 
00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
if i could
 
00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
once more then
 
00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
okay um if you're interested in taking
 
00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:13.750 align:start position:0%
okay um if you're interested in taking
away

00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
away
 
00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
rights and i don't think you are you've
 
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
come to the wrong committee you know
 
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
i i feel quite confident that i could
 
00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
speak to everybody on the committee in
 
00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
saying that so let me try again
 
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
you have a very difficult position
 
00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
you are in charge of a commission
 
00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh the effects of
 
00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
the work that you do
 
00:43:43.109 --> 00:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
enhance or
 
00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
the ability of those people both
 
00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
employers and employees to carry on the
 
00:43:55.109 --> 00:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
work that they're supposed to do i
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
understand it's a difficult job
 
00:43:59.270 --> 00:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
i understand you have a budget that you
 
00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
work for and you have i understand you
 
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
have the number of staff people that you
 
00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:03.829 align:start position:0%
have the number of staff people that you
have

00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:03.839 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:44:07.109 --> 00:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
what i want to know is
 
00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
when you go home at night
 
00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
is there a time when you say
 
00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:14.230 align:start position:0%
is there a time when you say
if

00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
we could do this or if we could do that
 
00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
or if we could make this change we could
 
00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
better carry out
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
our responsibilities
 
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
i i understand what the situation is not
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
great what i want to know is how can we
 
00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
change the situation if we're going to
 
00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
keep everything the way it is and have
 
00:44:35.109 --> 00:44:35.119 align:start position:0%
no recommendations for change then we
 
00:44:37.109 --> 00:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
can all go outside and enjoy the lovely
 
00:44:37.119 --> 00:44:38.150 align:start position:0%
can all go outside and enjoy the lovely
day

00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.309 align:start position:0%
day
um

00:44:40.309 --> 00:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
you are in the position to know more
 
00:44:44.069 --> 00:44:44.079 align:start position:0%
than we
 
00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
what changes could
 
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
or should be made so that you could
 
00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
better carry out your obligations
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
can you share anything with us or would
 
00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
you just assume not
 
00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:57.430 align:start position:0%
you just assume not
um

00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:58.950 --> 00:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
i would want to
 
00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
look at a few other things that i could
 
00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
potentially suggest um one of the things
 
00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:06.079 align:start position:0%
to to immediately answer the question um
 
00:45:08.069 --> 00:45:08.079 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we did do as an
 
00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
as an organization is look at the
 
00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
internal sort of the administrative
 
00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
process of our case processing to see
 
00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
where we could um cut out any
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
inefficiencies to be able to move cases
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
i hate to say faster
 
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
but you're still doing the due process
 
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
you're you're not shortcutting anything
 
00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
but what were we doing inside if
 
00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
anything that needed to be amended or
 
00:45:37.349 --> 00:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
changed or
 
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
shortened in our process and we've made
 
00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
those changes um and so
 
00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
cases are moving along internally faster
 
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
ultimately the answer really is going to
 
00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:49.750 align:start position:0%
ultimately the answer really is going to
be

00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
those things that i can't control inside
 
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
of the office and i'm not speaking
 
00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
statutorily but looking at staff
 
00:45:59.349 --> 00:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
the other things besides
 
00:46:01.829 --> 00:46:01.839 align:start position:0%
simply in air quotes simply the case
 
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
work and the other part of our statute
 
00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
is outreach education and training and
 
00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
if we're doing more of that hopefully
 
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
then there are fewer cases if you're
 
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
reaching out and doing more of that work
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
then employers are clear
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
what it is that they need to do or
 
00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't do employees are clear what
 
00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
they have access to and and what
 
00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
responsibilities the employers are
 
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
what the things that they're responsible
 
00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:30.069 align:start position:0%
what the things that they're responsible
for

00:46:30.069 --> 00:46:30.079 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
maybe it's creative problem solving and
 
00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
every business has a packet or something
 
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
through the secretary of state's office
 
00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:39.839 align:start position:0%
that helps them understand what they're
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to do for their employees maybe
 
00:46:44.069 --> 00:46:44.079 align:start position:0%
that's something we could do
 
00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
but i mean
 
00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
that's a long answer to a longer
 
00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:49.109 align:start position:0%
that's a long answer to a longer
question

00:46:49.109 --> 00:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to
 
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
to think through and spitball and we can
 
00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
have conversations if it's allowed over
 
00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
the course of the summer to come up with
 
00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
different ideas i'm very open to that i
 
00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
come in with an open hand
 
00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
wanting to talk to you very
 
00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
transparently about what we're doing how
 
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
we're doing it
 
00:47:09.829 --> 00:47:09.839 align:start position:0%
what it looks like and if there are ways
 
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
for us to make this better then let's do
 
00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:14.950 align:start position:0%
for us to make this better then let's do
that

00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative smith
 
00:47:35.349 --> 00:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:31.829 align:start position:0%
 
with

00:48:31.829 --> 00:48:31.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:31.839 --> 00:48:45.670 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much for the question
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
it really is resources um as was stated
 
00:48:58.069 --> 00:48:58.079 align:start position:0%
before uh four we've hired another so we
 
00:48:59.910 --> 00:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
have five which means we'll be fully
 
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
staffed as of this friday
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
so our full staff of investigators is
 
00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
five investigators for the state
 
00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
if there are more and i'm i'm certainly
 
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
putting in things this is a budget year
 
00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
so i'm making my ask
 
00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
but if there are more investigators then
 
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity to
 
00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:20.630 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity to
to

00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:49:24.309 --> 00:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
assign more cases which can then limit
 
00:49:26.549 --> 00:49:26.559 align:start position:0%
how long someone is waiting prior to the
 
00:49:28.549 --> 00:49:28.559 align:start position:0%
start of an investigation
 
00:49:28.559 --> 00:49:29.510 align:start position:0%
start of an investigation
so

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
could could it happen in a year sure it
 
00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely could and it is required to
 
00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
have more staff in order to process
 
00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
those the way our process works is the
 
00:49:41.109 --> 00:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
oldest case
 
00:49:43.349 --> 00:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
that is waiting for assignment is then
 
00:49:45.589 --> 00:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
assigned to an investigator the
 
00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
expectation is at the bare minimum that
 
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
they finish that they complete four
 
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
cases a month
 
00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of investigation that does not
 
00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
include any cases that are settled
 
00:49:58.630 --> 00:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
whether through mediation or concealed
 
00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
well conciliation conciliated cases are
 
00:50:02.309 --> 00:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
investigated but
 
00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:04.640 align:start position:0%
any cases that are mediated so we offer
 
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
mediation from the very beginning you
 
00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
know once people have gotten their
 
00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
paperwork then we start offering
 
00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
mediation which that has those numbers
 
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
that percentage has increased as well so
 
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
there are more cases closing whether
 
00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
whether it's by mediation which is
 
00:50:23.349 --> 00:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
before an investigation even starts or
 
00:50:23.359 --> 00:50:24.390 align:start position:0%
before an investigation even starts or
after

00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
after
 
00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:25.270 align:start position:0%
after
um

00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.079 align:start position:0%
having the additional staff does make a
 
00:50:29.829 --> 00:50:29.839 align:start position:0%
difference because you can assign those
 
00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
cases more of those cases out so there
 
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
are fewer hopefully people waiting
 
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't stop the number of cases
 
00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
so far this year
 
00:50:47.349 --> 00:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:49.589 --> 00:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
yeah so so far
 
00:50:52.309 --> 00:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal or calendar
 
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal so so far this state fiscal year
 
00:50:59.670 --> 00:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
we've had over 900 inquiries to us so
 
00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
that's not necessarily that's not going
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
to be a number of cases but people are
 
00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
calling so
 
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of traffic that's coming
 
00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
in the door having more staff to assign
 
00:51:12.549 --> 00:51:12.559 align:start position:0%
cases to very important however that
 
00:51:14.309 --> 00:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't stop the number of people that
 
00:51:16.309 --> 00:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
are calling for information and those
 
00:51:18.549 --> 00:51:18.559 align:start position:0%
people are businesses hey you know
 
00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
there's someone here who needs an
 
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
accommodation what should i do
 
00:51:26.069 --> 00:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
there are employees i asked for an
 
00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
accommodation and i didn't get it what
 
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
do i do
 
00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:30.640 align:start position:0%
and then there are people that are
 
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
certainly calling for training and so we
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
provide those trainings for those
 
00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
individuals so
 
00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
it is a matter of resources um i believe
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
where we are right now we have shored up
 
00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
a lot of how we do our process
 
00:51:48.829 --> 00:51:48.839 align:start position:0%
internally to streamline it
 
00:51:52.069 --> 00:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
without without sacrificing
 
00:51:55.270 --> 00:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
the complainant's opportunity to bring
 
00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:56.309 align:start position:0%
the complainant's opportunity to bring
additional

00:51:56.309 --> 00:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:51:58.549 --> 00:51:58.559 align:start position:0%
uh to amend their charges or bring
 
00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
information in as well as we've not
 
00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
sacrificed the respondents opportunity
 
00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:06.640 align:start position:0%
to respond to those charges
 
00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
but once we get into a case
 
00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:11.510 align:start position:0%
but once we get into a case
you

00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
the process is a little bit at the mercy
 
00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
of the people responding to the request
 
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:57.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:05.910 align:start position:0%
 
wait

00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
so uh thank you for the follow-up the
 
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
five years outlier so let's just start
 
00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:12.390 align:start position:0%
five years outlier so let's just start
there

00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:14.720 align:start position:0%
statutorily you have two years some have
 
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
been three years but the five-year case
 
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
that was testified before that that's an
 
00:53:23.109 --> 00:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
outlier um could a system be designed so
 
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
that you could move through the system
 
00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
so the so the other part is it's the
 
00:53:35.349 --> 00:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
staffing that's missing if you're
 
00:53:35.359 --> 00:53:36.710 align:start position:0%
staffing that's missing if you're
waiting

00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
waiting
 
00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
and then once the case is assigned
 
00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
you can move through that case in a year
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
some are fewer that summer some of it is
 
00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
less than that
 
00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
some could be a little more it depends
 
00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
on how complex it is but i could say
 
00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
that the year would could be an average
 
00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
but you're going to have to wait
 
00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
because of the staffing
 
00:53:59.190 --> 00:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
and staffing not only means the number
 
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
of in
 
00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
the number of investigators that we have
 
00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
right now but it also deals with prior
 
00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
to 2011
 
00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
turnover from then to now so if there's
 
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
turnover if you have 25 cases and you
 
00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
have 25 and you have 25 and you leave
 
00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
whatever the reason you leave your case
 
00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
load let's say you've completed five and
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
there's 20 that's now divided between
 
00:54:25.349 --> 00:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
these two people so now they have 35
 
00:54:25.359 --> 00:54:26.950 align:start position:0%
these two people so now they have 35
each

00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
each
 
00:54:30.549 --> 00:54:30.559 align:start position:0%
your cases may if they're older then
 
00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:32.800 align:start position:0%
yours are going to be investigated first
 
00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
that are that are distributed between
 
00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
the other investigators so the ones that
 
00:54:42.549 --> 00:54:42.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
now if there's a better way to do that
 
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
i'm open to it
 
00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
if this one has been waiting longer
 
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
do you take the other one or do you take
 
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
the one that was yours
 
00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
that now needs to be
 
00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
the uh so there's a couple of things
 
00:55:12.069 --> 00:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
that there's the investigative element
 
00:55:14.549 --> 00:55:14.559 align:start position:0%
that's ongoing but you also mentioned
 
00:55:17.109 --> 00:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
that there's an education element an
 
00:55:20.309 --> 00:55:20.319 align:start position:0%
intake element all of that stuff are
 
00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
those handled by the same resources uh
 
00:55:25.829 --> 00:55:25.839 align:start position:0%
is the cross over there or
 
00:55:28.870 --> 00:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
are they in discrete buckets
 
00:55:31.109 --> 00:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um buckets so
 
00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
the investigators specifically and only
 
00:55:37.349 --> 00:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
do investigations
 
00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
outreach education and training is
 
00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
pretty much myself and the assistant
 
00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:42.470 align:start position:0%
pretty much myself and the assistant
director

00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
director
 
00:55:44.069 --> 00:55:44.079 align:start position:0%
on top of the other things that we're
 
00:55:44.079 --> 00:55:45.030 align:start position:0%
on top of the other things that we're
doing

00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
intake we have an intake person it was a
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
part-time position and
 
00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
that was
 
00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
change so i changed that to be a
 
00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
full-time position which it's vacant at
 
00:55:58.390 --> 00:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
the moment so we are hiring for that
 
00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
person but it is now a full-time and
 
00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
then hopefully the part-time the
 
00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
part-time position can um
 
00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
in this upcoming budget would have the
 
00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
funding put back so you'd have one and a
 
00:56:12.069 --> 00:56:12.079 align:start position:0%
half people doing intake because of all
 
00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
of what's involved there's that's that's
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
the first time anyone reaches us so
 
00:56:18.549 --> 00:56:18.559 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of paperwork and there are
 
00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
processes involved in in taking that
 
00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:23.910 align:start position:0%
processes involved in in taking that
information

00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
tracking the information making sure
 
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
it's put into what if we take the charge
 
00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
put into our system properly so
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
so that the investigator will have
 
00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
everything that they need once a case is
 
00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:35.990 align:start position:0%
everything that they need once a case is
assigned

00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
assigned
 
00:56:37.589 --> 00:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
and so it's my understanding as well
 
00:56:39.510 --> 00:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
that there was work done with you and
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
the attorney general to kind of optimize
 
00:56:45.349 --> 00:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
the mechanics of the process um is that
 
00:56:46.549 --> 00:56:46.559 align:start position:0%
to kind of
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
talk to representative gordon's concern
 
00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
that happened recently and has that been
 
00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
implemented um so uh
 
00:56:56.069 --> 00:56:56.079 align:start position:0%
what we what we did as a as a unit as an
 
00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
as an agency um prior to the group
 
00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
meeting um i jill perlow was our
 
00:57:05.109 --> 00:57:05.119 align:start position:0%
client's client services representative
 
00:57:07.349 --> 00:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
um jill perlow and i did a lot of work
 
00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
on looking at the statute looking at our
 
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
rules looking at our process to see
 
00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
where we could
 
00:57:17.829 --> 00:57:17.839 align:start position:0%
make some time savings where we could be
 
00:57:19.589 --> 00:57:19.599 align:start position:0%
more efficient
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
and also
 
00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
sean locke who's now our
 
00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
client services representative was a
 
00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
part of that process as well and we
 
00:57:29.109 --> 00:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
walked through so i created sort of what
 
00:57:31.349 --> 00:57:31.359 align:start position:0%
i thought with their assistance and then
 
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
walk through that process with the staff
 
00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
to see um because they're they're going
 
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
to have to use this
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
how how does this work will this is this
 
00:57:41.109 --> 00:57:41.119 align:start position:0%
better um
 
00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
what changes can we make based on what
 
00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:45.839 align:start position:0%
you're seeing uh to make the effect to
 
00:57:47.829 --> 00:57:47.839 align:start position:0%
make it more efficient and they had
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
suggestions on the report writing which
 
00:57:52.309 --> 00:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
is significantly shorter but still has
 
00:57:54.549 --> 00:57:54.559 align:start position:0%
quality information so that someone
 
00:57:56.789 --> 00:57:56.799 align:start position:0%
who's not represented can understand
 
00:57:59.270 --> 00:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
whether why their case uh why their
 
00:58:01.270 --> 00:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
charge was probable cause or not
 
00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
probable not probable cause
 
00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:06.640 align:start position:0%
and so i feel very secure in what we've
 
00:58:09.349 --> 00:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
walked through and with their assistance
 
00:58:12.150 --> 00:58:12.160 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we were legally doing
 
00:58:14.069 --> 00:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
everything that we should be doing while
 
00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
still trying to find any time savings
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
that we could for the entire process
 
00:58:22.150 --> 00:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
so um and we're not going to go through
 
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
all of this here because obviously we're
 
00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
going to have the whole summer to kind
 
00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
of allow things to germinate a bit but
 
00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
in in the discussions that you were
 
00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
having with that team
 
00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:32.390 align:start position:0%
having with that team
um

00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:34.789 --> 00:58:34.799 align:start position:0%
where they're because you're basically
 
00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:36.640 align:start position:0%
doing that within your own rule-making
 
00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
power but
 
00:58:41.589 --> 00:58:41.599 align:start position:0%
were there statutory barriers that you
 
00:58:43.829 --> 00:58:43.839 align:start position:0%
came up against during that process and
 
00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
that evaluation where you said you know
 
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
we don't know if this makes sense or
 
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
works and that's a statutory area where
 
00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
if that could maybe be revisited
 
00:58:57.750 --> 00:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
that's another opportunity to optimize
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
the process was any discussion going on
 
00:59:03.030 --> 00:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
in that area um yes there are a couple
 
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
of the letters that we write um that we
 
00:59:08.549 --> 00:59:08.559 align:start position:0%
send out that provide for more time for
 
00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
final answers um and so actually what we
 
00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
did was we just moved that particular
 
00:59:17.910 --> 00:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
that particular letter that's sent out
 
00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
to both parties
 
00:59:22.870 --> 00:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
up sooner so that it wouldn't hinder
 
00:59:25.829 --> 00:59:25.839 align:start position:0%
the report writing and the conclusion um
 
00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
i it would take a smarter person than me
 
00:59:32.230 --> 00:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
with a esquire after their name to
 
00:59:36.789 --> 00:59:36.799 align:start position:0%
determine if it is a due process issue
 
00:59:39.030 --> 00:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me if we removed that letter all
 
00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:40.230 align:start position:0%
excuse me if we removed that letter all
together

00:59:40.230 --> 00:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
that was one of the things that we
 
00:59:43.829 --> 00:59:43.839 align:start position:0%
wanted to really think through to make
 
00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
sure that in our quest to have time
 
00:59:49.589 --> 00:59:49.599 align:start position:0%
savings and to be more efficient that we
 
00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:52.640 align:start position:0%
were not limiting someone's due process
 
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
and i believe
 
00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
that was why we said well we won't
 
00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
change that because you know we have a
 
01:00:00.069 --> 01:00:00.079 align:start position:0%
rule we have rules that need to be
 
01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
updated as well and that's certainly
 
01:00:03.829 --> 01:00:03.839 align:start position:0%
something we could fix in our rules but
 
01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
if i remember correctly we didn't want
 
01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
to make that change because we didn't
 
01:00:07.359 --> 01:00:08.470 align:start position:0%
to make that change because we didn't
want

01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
want
 
01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
the person to not have the opportunity
 
01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
and it's called a summation letter and
 
01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
the attorneys here will know what i'm
 
01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
speaking of um attorney douglas and
 
01:00:19.829 --> 01:00:19.839 align:start position:0%
attorney burns um so
 
01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
to to not take away the right of the
 
01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
person to have that letter we just moved
 
01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
it a little sooner in the process so
 
01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:29.030 align:start position:0%
it a little sooner in the process so
that

01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
everything could be submitted in enough
 
01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
time to
 
01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
to complete a report
 
01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
i would need to
 
01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
and that that's a good question i would
 
01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
need to sit and look at it from a stance
 
01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
of removing if there's anything that we
 
01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
don't really need because it's not not
 
01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
taking away rights but something that's
 
01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
maybe more obsolete
 
01:00:53.829 --> 01:00:53.839 align:start position:0%
and could be gotten rid of because it
 
01:00:56.470 --> 01:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't really add to the process
 
01:00:59.109 --> 01:00:59.119 align:start position:0%
i would have to look with those eyes
 
01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
because when we went through the process
 
01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
we weren't necessarily looking to remove
 
01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
things we were looking to
 
01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
move things potentially so that the
 
01:01:12.309 --> 01:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
process would move faster if that makes
 
01:01:12.319 --> 01:01:15.430 align:start position:0%
process would move faster if that makes
sense

01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
representative smith thank you very much
 
01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
could i just repeat the chair's question
 
01:01:24.069 --> 01:01:24.079 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't need a long answer in
 
01:01:25.829 --> 01:01:25.839 align:start position:0%
your work with
 
01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
the people who were helping you on this
 
01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
did you find anything you can just say
 
01:01:33.829 --> 01:01:33.839 align:start position:0%
yes or no really did you find anything
 
01:01:33.839 --> 01:01:35.109 align:start position:0%
yes or no really did you find anything
that

01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
you recognized
 
01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
could improve the situation if the
 
01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
and you don't have to answer or you
 
01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:50.720 align:start position:0%
could say you don't know
 
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
i'll say i don't know for right now
 
01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
because thank you there's a lot of
 
01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
pieces perfect thank you
 
01:01:58.870 --> 01:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
representative dilorenzo uh thank you mr
 
01:02:02.789 --> 01:02:02.799 align:start position:0%
chair um miss malachi um
 
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
my question is around um
 
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
whether cases are ever triaged
 
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
and i ask because i realize that some
 
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.510 align:start position:0%
and i ask because i realize that some
complaints

01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
of discrimination are more egregious
 
01:02:18.789 --> 01:02:18.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:20.789 --> 01:02:20.799 align:start position:0%
and i would not
 
01:02:20.799 --> 01:02:23.029 align:start position:0%
and i would not
expect

01:02:23.029 --> 01:02:23.039 align:start position:0%
expect
 
01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
in the railroad i would not expect those
 
01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
cases to go
 
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
in the bottom of the pile or you know as
 
01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
its turn comes up could you respond to
 
01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
that please um yes thank you
 
01:02:39.349 --> 01:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
um historically what we have done is
 
01:02:41.349 --> 01:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
things as they come in
 
01:02:43.029 --> 01:02:43.039 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
they they move forward as their co as
 
01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
they come in
 
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
if there's someone who has
 
01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh let's say there's a sexual harassment
 
01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
situation where there is a crime that's
 
01:02:56.789 --> 01:02:56.799 align:start position:0%
committed that person has more than just
 
01:02:59.029 --> 01:02:59.039 align:start position:0%
rights with us so they can certainly
 
01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
file a police report and they can
 
01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
continue to move forward with us as well
 
01:03:06.309 --> 01:03:06.319 align:start position:0%
and there's a recommendation while we
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
will absolutely take the charge
 
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
that they also go to the police
 
01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.710 align:start position:0%
that they also go to the police
department

01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:03:15.109 --> 01:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
no to answer the question we have not
 
01:03:17.589 --> 01:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
triaged cases because
 
01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
there's been uh quite the the backlog to
 
01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
the thought has been to move this one
 
01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:28.309 align:start position:0%
the thought has been to move this one
ahead

01:03:28.309 --> 01:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:30.309 --> 01:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
of someone who's been waiting six months
 
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
or whatever the time frame um but if
 
01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
it's something that is criminal and
 
01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
innate criminal in nature
 
01:03:39.829 --> 01:03:39.839 align:start position:0%
we will absolutely
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
still take the charge but refer
 
01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:45.039 align:start position:0%
them or make the suggestion that they
 
01:03:47.029 --> 01:03:47.039 align:start position:0%
check with the police as well
 
01:03:49.029 --> 01:03:49.039 align:start position:0%
if there's something that's particularly
 
01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
heinous then we would talk to the ag's
 
01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
office to see
 
01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
how do we how do we
 
01:03:57.510 --> 01:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
move this one ahead
 
01:03:59.270 --> 01:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
of someone else when you have other
 
01:04:01.829 --> 01:04:01.839 align:start position:0%
attorneys attorneys will talk right so
 
01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
you'll know that i've moved your case
 
01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
ahead and they will know that i've moved
 
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
your case ahead of of them and they've
 
01:04:10.069 --> 01:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
been in waiting longer so we would ask
 
01:04:12.549 --> 01:04:12.559 align:start position:0%
for what guidance we would need to be
 
01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
able to do that if if there was a case
 
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
that was particularly heinous
 
01:04:23.349 --> 01:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
01:04:27.349 --> 01:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
handling cases
 
01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
and shuttling them to other places for
 
01:04:32.549 --> 01:04:32.559 align:start position:0%
instance i understand that
 
01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
the human rights commission
 
01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
does housing
 
01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:39.029 align:start position:0%
does housing
discrimination

01:04:39.029 --> 01:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
01:04:41.829 --> 01:04:41.839 align:start position:0%
deals with housing discrimination um
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
complaints on behalf of hud
 
01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:46.069 align:start position:0%
complaints on behalf of hud
um

01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:46.079 --> 01:04:47.430 align:start position:0%
um
does

01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
what about
 
01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839 align:start position:0%
an employment complaint could that be
 
01:04:51.839 --> 01:04:53.270 align:start position:0%
an employment complaint could that be
shuttled

01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
shuttled
 
01:04:57.270 --> 01:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
from the eeoc or to the eeoc
 
01:04:59.430 --> 01:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so currently
 
01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
we do not have a hud contract so
 
01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
we because statutorily we we cover
 
01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
housing we can take a housing case we do
 
01:05:09.589 --> 01:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
give people the opportunity to go
 
01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
directly to hud should they choose their
 
01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
timeline is different
 
01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
for eeoc because we have a work sharing
 
01:05:18.069 --> 01:05:18.079 align:start position:0%
agreement with them
 
01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
we take the case on behalf of the eeoc
 
01:05:25.109 --> 01:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
depending on the number of employees and
 
01:05:28.309 --> 01:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
then it's dual filed
 
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
usually the way it works is because our
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
statute is a shorter time so 180 days
 
01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
we'll take it if it's anything more than
 
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
180 days up to 300 days someone would
 
01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
file with the eeoc
 
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
and then they would investigate their
 
01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
case if someone goes to the eeoc
 
01:05:48.549 --> 01:05:48.559 align:start position:0%
sometimes they'll reach out to us and
 
01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
say hey this person filed there in new
 
01:05:52.230 --> 01:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire and they'll refer it back to
 
01:05:53.829 --> 01:05:53.839 align:start position:0%
us and sometimes they'll continue
 
01:05:56.549 --> 01:05:56.559 align:start position:0%
they'll keep the case
 
01:05:59.109 --> 01:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
then a follow-up second follow-up at any
 
01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
time did the um
 
01:06:03.029 --> 01:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
human rights commission have an
 
01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:06.640 align:start position:0%
agreement with hud on cases um yes prior
 
01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
to 2000 i believe i think there was a
 
01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
rule change
 
01:06:13.029 --> 01:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
or excuse me
 
01:06:16.710 --> 01:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
a statutory change with hud and the
 
01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
commission fell out of um
 
01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
alignment with those federal rules and
 
01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
it's called substantial equivalency and
 
01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:25.029 align:start position:0%
it's called substantial equivalency and
so

01:06:25.029 --> 01:06:25.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
we are currently working with hud so
 
01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
last session
 
01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
there was a piece of legislation i
 
01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
believe it was sb 126 that finally was
 
01:06:36.549 --> 01:06:36.559 align:start position:0%
able to there were several tries last
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
year it was accomplished the rule the
 
01:06:41.349 --> 01:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
statute was changed as it relates to
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
housing to allow us to move forward with
 
01:06:47.109 --> 01:06:47.119 align:start position:0%
beginning the conversation for a work
 
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
sharing agreement with hud so we're
 
01:06:53.589 --> 01:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for
 
01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thanks for taking
 
01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
my question the
 
01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:10.630 align:start position:0%
my question the
the

01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:11.430 align:start position:0%
the
uh

01:07:11.430 --> 01:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
i'm presuming that if it
 
01:07:14.789 --> 01:07:14.799 align:start position:0%
because it's a commission that the
 
01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
commissioners are the ones who are
 
01:07:19.829 --> 01:07:19.839 align:start position:0%
actually hearing the hearings themselves
 
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
is that correct that is correct
 
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:22.870 align:start position:0%
is that correct that is correct
and

01:07:22.870 --> 01:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:25.349 --> 01:07:25.359 align:start position:0%
is that an issue at all with regard to
 
01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
scheduling commissioners for hearings is
 
01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
there any delay created by that
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question um
 
01:07:37.029 --> 01:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
there is there hasn't been uh what we'll
 
01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
do is schedule three hearings or three
 
01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:40.870 align:start position:0%
do is schedule three hearings or three
possible

01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:07:43.029 --> 01:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
hearings for one particular month and
 
01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
then it's always three commissioners
 
01:07:47.589 --> 01:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
that are the hearing panel
 
01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
and it cannot be the commissioner who
 
01:07:53.190 --> 01:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
made the decision on the case
 
01:07:56.069 --> 01:07:56.079 align:start position:0%
what has routinely happened is those
 
01:07:58.230 --> 01:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
cases will either settle
 
01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
or removed by respondent or
 
01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
or removed by complainant so
 
01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
we don't have
 
01:08:09.109 --> 01:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of hearings
 
01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
of course this law could change that and
 
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
we would have more hearings
 
01:08:14.789 --> 01:08:14.799 align:start position:0%
and that would be something we would
 
01:08:18.709 --> 01:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:21.030 --> 01:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
if i could just follow up so
 
01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
you indicate you're having three
 
01:08:24.950 --> 01:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
hearings per month is
 
01:08:27.349 --> 01:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
is that because we set the number at
 
01:08:30.229 --> 01:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
three hearings or does that
 
01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
is that the adequate number to
 
01:08:35.829 --> 01:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
to hold all the hearings um i apologize
 
01:08:39.030 --> 01:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
three we schedule three per month
 
01:08:41.829 --> 01:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
and what will happen is those three will
 
01:08:41.839 --> 01:08:43.269 align:start position:0%
and what will happen is those three will
routinely

01:08:43.269 --> 01:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
routinely
 
01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
settle or they are removed by either
 
01:08:48.149 --> 01:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
respondent or complainant so we don't
 
01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
actually we will not have three per
 
01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:51.669 align:start position:0%
actually we will not have three per
month

01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
month
 
01:08:54.309 --> 01:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
we schedule three and then they're
 
01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
either they they disappear in a good way
 
01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
i get that they
 
01:09:09.269 --> 01:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
you're scheduling three per month in the
 
01:09:11.669 --> 01:09:11.679 align:start position:0%
hopes that we'll have at least one
 
01:09:11.679 --> 01:09:13.829 align:start position:0%
hopes that we'll have at least one
potentially

01:09:13.829 --> 01:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
potentially one hearing but
 
01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
that takes care of
 
01:09:20.070 --> 01:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
scheduling three months takes care of
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
all your hearings so you don't have any
 
01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
um i'm not sure that i understand the
 
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
question so so just to maybe so is your
 
01:09:34.789 --> 01:09:34.799 align:start position:0%
question representative gordon is the
 
01:09:36.789 --> 01:09:36.799 align:start position:0%
three hearings per month because that's
 
01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
required what's required to clear the
 
01:09:41.349 --> 01:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
cases or is that because you're resource
 
01:09:41.359 --> 01:09:42.709 align:start position:0%
cases or is that because you're resource
constrained

01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
constrained
 
01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
and so how where do you come at the the
 
01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:46.390 align:start position:0%
and so how where do you come at the the
three

01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
cases per month
 
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
well there's there's a lot of runway
 
01:09:53.669 --> 01:09:53.679 align:start position:0%
that goes with that so before the case
 
01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
before something is scheduled for a
 
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
hearing you know once the report is
 
01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:58.950 align:start position:0%
hearing you know once the report is
complete

01:09:58.950 --> 01:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
complete
 
01:09:58.960 --> 01:09:59.910 align:start position:0%
complete
and

01:09:59.910 --> 01:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
and then there's conciliation that's
 
01:10:04.870 --> 01:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
scheduled because you you have to so
 
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
that's then scheduled the if the person
 
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
is represented whether both sides
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes both parties are represented
 
01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's one so there's scheduling
 
01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
that has to take place if they're
 
01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes attorneys that's not their
 
01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
only client so they may have depositions
 
01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
they may be in court people are on
 
01:10:24.390 --> 01:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
vacation a variety of things happen so
 
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
as soon as possible uh conciliation is
 
01:10:29.910 --> 01:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
scheduled and then if the conciliation
 
01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:31.110 align:start position:0%
scheduled and then if the conciliation
fails

01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
fails
 
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
then we move on and schedule the hearing
 
01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
but the parties can still be talking in
 
01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
the background even if the conciliation
 
01:10:40.630 --> 01:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
fails so it's not just a one and done so
 
01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
we had a conciliation yesterday if it
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
didn't if it didn't um if it didn't
 
01:10:47.590 --> 01:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
settle then we would have had the
 
01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
pre-hearing conference to get that on
 
01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
the calendar but the two parties can
 
01:10:53.590 --> 01:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
still talk and then even though it's
 
01:10:56.149 --> 01:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
scheduled they could still
 
01:10:58.229 --> 01:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
settle and then it removes itself and
 
01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
then it's off the calendar
 
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
but if there was a surge coming down the
 
01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
pipeline for example
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
um in that situation okay we have a big
 
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
surge coming would you schedule five to
 
01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
say you know
 
01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
or would you say no we are resource
 
01:11:17.350 --> 01:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
limited we can only schedule the three
 
01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
even with that surge coming down the
 
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
pipeline um that's a really good
 
01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
question i i think we would have to look
 
01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
at it to figure out what's the right
 
01:11:28.870 --> 01:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
amount to schedule to make sure that um
 
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
we would be serving the surge right so
 
01:11:34.709 --> 01:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
if if using your hypothetical example if
 
01:11:36.550 --> 01:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
five is the right number then we would
 
01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
schedule five but we would still be
 
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
doing all of the behind-the-scenes work
 
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
there would still be conciliations there
 
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
would just have to be more of them
 
01:11:47.830 --> 01:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
um and to to to go from that way or we
 
01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
would look at
 
01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
with with the ag's office if there was a
 
01:11:54.630 --> 01:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
rules change that we needed to make or a
 
01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
statutory change to support that then we
 
01:11:59.110 --> 01:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
would have that conversation sooner
 
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
rather than later obviously and then
 
01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
speak with you all if there are changes
 
01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
that we needed statutorily do we need to
 
01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
have an alj do we need to do something
 
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
different that's not something that we
 
01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
do i don't know but but as but as it
 
01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
stands right now to kind of get
 
01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
representative gordon's question if you
 
01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
see a surge coming down the pike and
 
01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
you've got a schedule five you're going
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
to do what you have to do to schedule
 
01:12:25.110 --> 01:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
the five and you know so it's not fixed
 
01:12:27.669 --> 01:12:27.679 align:start position:0%
in stone that it's going to be three no
 
01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
just one quick question
 
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
from a process perspective so
 
01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:34.950 align:start position:0%
from a process perspective so
the

01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:12:36.630 --> 01:12:36.640 align:start position:0%
the commissioner who's investigating
 
01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
they make the probable cause
 
01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
determination and then it goes on for
 
01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
the final resolution and that's where
 
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
the other three commissioners come in
 
01:12:47.590 --> 01:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
who conducts the conciliat the
 
01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:57.430 align:start position:0%
who conducts the conciliat the
conciliation

01:12:57.430 --> 01:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
conciliation
 
01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:58.229 align:start position:0%
conciliation
uh

01:12:58.229 --> 01:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
is i'm presuming that
 
01:13:02.709 --> 01:13:02.719 align:start position:0%
if it's a mediation that there's some
 
01:13:05.350 --> 01:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
mediator is that an employee of the
 
01:13:08.229 --> 01:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
commission who who does that yes that
 
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
beautiful woman sitting right over there
 
01:13:12.149 --> 01:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
does our conciliations
 
01:13:14.709 --> 01:13:14.719 align:start position:0%
and when she is not in the office for a
 
01:13:18.630 --> 01:13:18.640 align:start position:0%
little while i will be handling them
 
01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
okay and
 
01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
is that for all of them this one person
 
01:13:25.030 --> 01:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
does all of them correct
 
01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
we do them in person or we do them
 
01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
virtually we have we can or we can do a
 
01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:43.510 align:start position:0%
virtually we have we can or we can do a
hybrid

01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
i'm always confused but the
 
01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:48.550 align:start position:0%
i'm always confused but the
the

01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:50.709 --> 01:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
you we talked about different buckets
 
01:13:50.719 --> 01:13:51.669 align:start position:0%
you we talked about different buckets
and

01:13:51.669 --> 01:13:51.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
the fact that you're getting 600
 
01:13:57.189 --> 01:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
inquiries coming in just asking
 
01:13:59.350 --> 01:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
questions but that's a different group
 
01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
of people that are
 
01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
involved in that's they're in a
 
01:14:04.390 --> 01:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
different bucket that's a different
 
01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
group of people
 
01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
than the people who are actually doing
 
01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
the litigation process
 
01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:12.790 align:start position:0%
the litigation process
and

01:14:12.790 --> 01:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
and you indicated that you're doing
 
01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:15.590 align:start position:0%
and you indicated that you're doing
training

01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:14:19.030 --> 01:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
and i guess that was the question if
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
if they're separate buckets
 
01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
to the extent you're getting these 600
 
01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
inquiries that's not affecting the
 
01:14:29.350 --> 01:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
timing of the litigation process itself
 
01:14:32.229 --> 01:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
correct so the intake coordinator
 
01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
is handling those intake phone calls
 
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
those i have a question regardless of
 
01:14:40.149 --> 01:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
who it's from and it's also i think i
 
01:14:42.630 --> 01:14:42.640 align:start position:0%
have a charge so it's all of that so all
 
01:14:45.430 --> 01:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
of that is considered intake
 
01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
every call that comes in does not
 
01:14:50.310 --> 01:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
manifest manifest itself into an actual
 
01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
charge so
 
01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
you know so the there's all of that is
 
01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
in one bucket but that's the intake
 
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
person that is not an investigator
 
01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
that's doing that work
 
01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
and that's not
 
01:15:04.149 --> 01:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
the assistant director or myself so they
 
01:15:07.110 --> 01:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
are somewhat separated if if i'm
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:19.030 --> 01:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
so um i think
 
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
that's been a very good discussion but
 
01:15:26.709 --> 01:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
what i'd like to do now
 
01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
is just kind of get into having fleshed
 
01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
that out a little bit
 
01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
just kind of talk through
 
01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:34.709 align:start position:0%
just kind of talk through
um

01:15:34.709 --> 01:15:34.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
so we we talked a little bit about the
 
01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:38.390 align:start position:0%
so we we talked a little bit about the
mechanics

01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
mechanics
 
01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:39.590 align:start position:0%
mechanics
and

01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:42.080 align:start position:0%
how can the mechanics be shored up
 
01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
there's been work that's been done uh
 
01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
with the commission and the attorney
 
01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:48.470 align:start position:0%
with the commission and the attorney
general

01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
general
 
01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
are there legislative elements that we
 
01:15:53.350 --> 01:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
can do to help other resource elements
 
01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
so i think the question now is
 
01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
in order to get
 
01:15:59.110 --> 01:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
a better view
 
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
of exactly what is needed
 
01:16:03.910 --> 01:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
what kind of information do we want to
 
01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
kind of gather so that when we come back
 
01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
in september we have that in front of us
 
01:16:11.350 --> 01:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
so what what do we think that the
 
01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
approach should be
 
01:16:15.510 --> 01:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
with respect to that
 
01:16:22.149 --> 01:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
well i do okay
 
01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:30.950 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:16:32.950 --> 01:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
i think the first thing that i would
 
01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
want to have is a clear picture of
 
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
what's going on
 
01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
i hear 900
 
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
inquiries this fiscal year
 
01:16:44.229 --> 01:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
i hear three hearings a month i hear
 
01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:46.840 align:start position:0%
conciliation has to happen i have this
 
01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
report that says cases are settling
 
01:16:53.430 --> 01:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
and being removed
 
01:16:54.709 --> 01:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
i'd like to have a much clearer
 
01:16:58.390 --> 01:16:58.400 align:start position:0%
breakdown of if we got 900 phone calls
 
01:17:00.870 --> 01:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
how many of those end up in charges how
 
01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
many of those charges end up
 
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:06.390 align:start position:0%
you know
because

01:17:06.390 --> 01:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
like the hrc may be drinking from a fire
 
01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:16.070 align:start position:0%
like the hrc may be drinking from a fire
hose

01:17:16.070 --> 01:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:17.910 --> 01:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
and if that's the case then
 
01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
that's something that needs to be
 
01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:20.229 align:start position:0%
that's something that needs to be
addressed

01:17:20.229 --> 01:17:20.239 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
01:17:22.709 --> 01:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
not in the cur at the in the present
 
01:17:22.719 --> 01:17:24.550 align:start position:0%
not in the cur at the in the present
moment

01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
moment
 
01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:25.750 align:start position:0%
moment
by

01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:26.630 align:start position:0%
by
by

01:17:26.630 --> 01:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:29.030 align:start position:0%
by
um

01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
well it'd be it'd end up being a
 
01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
staffing issue right now
 
01:17:35.590 --> 01:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
as opposed to or maybe there was
 
01:17:37.030 --> 01:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
something that we could do that would be
 
01:17:39.270 --> 01:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
changing the process but uh i think
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of work already done
 
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
on that from what i've already heard
 
01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
um so that'd be that's that's the first
 
01:17:47.590 --> 01:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
thing i want to have i want to be able
 
01:17:49.990 --> 01:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
to get a grasp on
 
01:17:52.630 --> 01:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
what's the scope of this
 
01:17:54.709 --> 01:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
and it's one thing to hear the five your
 
01:17:57.110 --> 01:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
case is an outlier
 
01:17:59.189 --> 01:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
and there's a three-year window and
 
01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
people are removing
 
01:18:03.910 --> 01:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
things from the hrc because of the
 
01:18:06.310 --> 01:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
three-year window
 
01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:07.669 align:start position:0%
three-year window
but

01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:18:10.229 --> 01:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
i don't have any idea of
 
01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
how this is actually working
 
01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
and and and the relative
 
01:18:17.430 --> 01:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
where these numbers take us
 
01:18:19.590 --> 01:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative smith
 
01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chairman mr
 
01:18:24.149 --> 01:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
chairman i would like to go back perhaps
 
01:18:25.990 --> 01:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
an hour
 
01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
to a question that representative
 
01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:29.750 align:start position:0%
to a question that representative
dilorenzo

01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
dilorenzo
 
01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:31.030 align:start position:0%
dilorenzo
raised

01:18:31.030 --> 01:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
raised
 
01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:31.990 align:start position:0%
raised
and

01:18:31.990 --> 01:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:32.870 align:start position:0%
and
i

01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps glibly said well this is the
 
01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
process this had to do with the
 
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
legislative budget audit
 
01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:41.590 align:start position:0%
legislative budget audit
and

01:18:41.590 --> 01:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
listening now for an hour to um comments
 
01:18:49.270 --> 01:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
from attorneys who have
 
01:18:52.149 --> 01:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
been involved with the commission
 
01:18:57.350 --> 01:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
and to the um articulate comments um
 
01:18:58.870 --> 01:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%

um i would like to make a suggestion
 
01:19:09.189 --> 01:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:19:11.350 --> 01:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:12.470 align:start position:0%
that is
that

01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:13.350 align:start position:0%
that

this
 
01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:15.910 align:start position:0%
this
subcommittee

subcommittee
 
01:19:17.669 --> 01:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
without any
 
01:19:17.679 --> 01:19:20.149 align:start position:0%
without any
delay

01:19:20.149 --> 01:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
delay
 
01:19:26.229 --> 01:19:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:26.239 --> 01:19:31.990 align:start position:0%
 
to

01:19:31.990 --> 01:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:34.149 --> 01:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
the joint committee
 
01:19:34.159 --> 01:19:35.590 align:start position:0%
the joint committee
on

01:19:35.590 --> 01:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
legislative audits
 
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
and the fiscal committee
 
01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:41.910 align:start position:0%
and the fiscal committee
and

01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:42.790 align:start position:0%
and
the

01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:45.110 align:start position:0%
the
lba

01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
lba
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
so that everybody knows
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
draft a letter saying that based on what
 
01:19:52.870 --> 01:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
we have heard
 
01:19:56.550 --> 01:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:57.990 align:start position:0%
 
we

01:19:57.990 --> 01:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:20:01.229 --> 01:20:01.239 align:start position:0%
believe that in order to
 
01:20:01.239 --> 01:20:02.790 align:start position:0%
believe that in order to
intelligently

01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
intelligently
 
01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
suggest what legislative actions
 
01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
could or should be taken
 
01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:09.270 align:start position:0%
could or should be taken
to

01:20:09.270 --> 01:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
make the commission function
 
01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:14.149 align:start position:0%
make the commission function
optimally

01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
optimally
 
01:20:16.470 --> 01:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
try to put in place as soon as possible
 
01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:22.790 align:start position:0%
try to put in place as soon as possible
um

01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:26.229 --> 01:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
a performance audit not not a financial
 
01:20:30.310 --> 01:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
audit but a performance audit
 
01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
of the commission
 
01:20:36.390 --> 01:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
we understand that um
 
01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
you know the full
 
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
legislature isn't
 
01:20:41.990 --> 01:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
going to meet again until the fall but
 
01:20:43.590 --> 01:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
we do not need
 
01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:45.030 align:start position:0%
we do not need
full

01:20:45.030 --> 01:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
full
 
01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:48.229 align:start position:0%
full
legislative

01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
we do not have fill legislative action
 
01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
for this to happen
 
01:20:54.790 --> 01:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
because the legit the joint committee
 
01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
makes a suggestion to the fiscal
 
01:20:58.950 --> 01:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
committee the fiscal committee
 
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
asks the lba
 
01:21:03.669 --> 01:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
is this something that's doable all that
 
01:21:06.149 --> 01:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
could take place between now
 
01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
and the fall
 
01:21:09.189 --> 01:21:09.199 align:start position:0%
which isn't to say the audit would take
 
01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
place between now and fall but at least
 
01:21:13.830 --> 01:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
we could start the process because i
 
01:21:17.110 --> 01:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
came in here this morning
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
thinking having read the agenda thinking
 
01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
it would make sense to focus on
 
01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
the areas that the chair of the
 
01:21:27.669 --> 01:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
subcommittee identified
 
01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
but now
 
01:21:33.669 --> 01:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
realizing that the situation
 
01:21:33.679 --> 01:21:34.709 align:start position:0%
realizing that the situation
is

01:21:34.709 --> 01:21:34.719 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:21:34.719 --> 01:21:36.790 align:start position:0%
is
different

01:21:36.790 --> 01:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:21:38.470 --> 01:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
whether it's more complicated less
 
01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
complicated i don't know but it's
 
01:21:42.230 --> 01:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
different from one that could be
 
01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:44.470 align:start position:0%
different from one that could be
[Music]

01:21:44.470 --> 01:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:21:47.669 --> 01:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
resolved by addressing
 
01:21:50.550 --> 01:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
timeliness and due process
 
01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
and so i think that as usual
 
01:21:57.510 --> 01:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
representative dilorenzo had a very
 
01:22:00.470 --> 01:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
so what would they be doing
 
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
process wise
 
01:22:06.870 --> 01:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
between now and the fall if we were to
 
01:22:09.030 --> 01:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
draft such a letter
 
01:22:11.189 --> 01:22:11.199 align:start position:0%
um they you know the fiscal committee
 
01:22:12.870 --> 01:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
meets all summer
 
01:22:15.189 --> 01:22:15.199 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
they meet once a month but they meet
 
01:22:20.709 --> 01:22:20.719 align:start position:0%
all summer um they could start the
 
01:22:20.719 --> 01:22:22.709 align:start position:0%
all summer um they could start the
process

01:22:22.709 --> 01:22:22.719 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh rather than if they if they thought
 
01:22:27.189 --> 01:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
that it was appropriate they could start
 
01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
the process rather than wait
 
01:22:32.629 --> 01:22:32.639 align:start position:0%
until january to
 
01:22:32.639 --> 01:22:34.390 align:start position:0%
until january to
um

01:22:34.390 --> 01:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
have a new legislature
 
01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know what's on
 
01:22:46.149 --> 01:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
the lba agenda i don't know how many
 
01:22:46.159 --> 01:22:47.590 align:start position:0%
the lba agenda i don't know how many
other

01:22:47.590 --> 01:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:22:50.229 --> 01:22:50.239 align:start position:0%
performance audits are ahead
 
01:22:50.239 --> 01:22:52.149 align:start position:0%
performance audits are ahead
um

01:22:52.149 --> 01:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:54.629 --> 01:22:54.639 align:start position:0%
of you know
 
01:22:57.030 --> 01:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
you have priorities on the list
 
01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:59.030 align:start position:0%
you have priorities on the list
but

01:22:59.030 --> 01:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:23:02.149 --> 01:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that no matter what a good
 
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
job we do on timeliness
 
01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:13.270 --> 01:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
cut to the chase so to speak so
 
01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
the performance audit what kind of
 
01:23:20.149 --> 01:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
output would be in that what data would
 
01:23:22.709 --> 01:23:22.719 align:start position:0%
we get from that oh have you never seen
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
a performance audit
 
01:23:27.669 --> 01:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
representative mclean
 
01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
you have been denied one of the greatest
 
01:23:34.229 --> 01:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
resources available to the new hampshire
 
01:23:34.239 --> 01:23:37.510 align:start position:0%
resources available to the new hampshire
legislature

01:23:37.510 --> 01:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:40.149 align:start position:0%
 
in

01:23:40.149 --> 01:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:43.669 --> 01:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:47.110 --> 01:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
the audit division of highly trained and
 
01:23:49.830 --> 01:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
skilled people
 
01:23:52.229 --> 01:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
would take the question that came to
 
01:23:55.110 --> 01:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
them from the legislature
 
01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:57.030 align:start position:0%
them from the legislature
would

01:23:57.030 --> 01:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:23:58.950 --> 01:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
do their own
 
01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
initial research based on the rsas and
 
01:24:03.750 --> 01:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:05.189 align:start position:0%
and uh
rules

01:24:05.189 --> 01:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:24:08.629 --> 01:24:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
and discussing with the agency identify
 
01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:12.790 align:start position:0%
and discussing with the agency identify
areas

01:24:12.790 --> 01:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
areas
 
01:24:14.830 --> 01:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
that need
 
01:24:17.430 --> 01:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
um further look
 
01:24:19.669 --> 01:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
and they will using a number of
 
01:24:22.629 --> 01:24:22.639 align:start position:0%
resources available to them
 
01:24:25.430 --> 01:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
really do a thorough investigation of
 
01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
how the organization is structured how
 
01:24:30.390 --> 01:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
it carries at its mandate um
 
01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
how it holds itself responsible how the
 
01:24:36.310 --> 01:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
broader government
 
01:24:38.550 --> 01:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
holds the agency responsible all of
 
01:24:39.669 --> 01:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
those things
 
01:24:43.270 --> 01:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
with always suggestions
 
01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:44.470 align:start position:0%
with always suggestions
for

01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:24:47.430 --> 01:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
how to address the concerns
 
01:24:50.229 --> 01:24:50.239 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
i would urge you
 
01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:53.990 align:start position:0%
i would urge you
to

to
 
01:24:56.790 --> 01:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
contact michael kane who is the our
 
01:24:58.709 --> 01:24:58.719 align:start position:0%
legislative budget analyst ask him to
 
01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:00.719 align:start position:0%
give you some examples
 
01:25:00.719 --> 01:25:01.990 align:start position:0%
give you some examples
of

01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
a relevant performance audits so that
 
01:25:08.229 --> 01:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
you can get a better sense and i think
 
01:25:11.350 --> 01:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
that knowing your background and knowing
 
01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
your interest in just the facts ma'am
 
01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:25:17.669 --> 01:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
you are
 
01:25:20.070 --> 01:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
going to fall in love
 
01:25:31.110 --> 01:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:33.430 --> 01:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
mr chairman um
 
01:25:35.350 --> 01:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
a couple of years ago the house
 
01:25:37.990 --> 01:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
judiciary committee um
 
01:25:40.149 --> 01:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
and i believe it was with criminal
 
01:25:43.990 --> 01:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
justice committee um we
 
01:25:47.189 --> 01:25:47.199 align:start position:0%
had we reviewed the audit from the for
 
01:25:47.199 --> 01:25:48.229 align:start position:0%
had we reviewed the audit from the for
the

01:25:48.229 --> 01:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
parole board and it was really
 
01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
interesting it was like a lot of work
 
01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
very interesting um
 
01:25:56.550 --> 01:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
great process and
 
01:25:59.350 --> 01:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
the person who did the audit is very
 
01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
very very knowledgeable about you know
 
01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
policy and procedure and
 
01:26:06.149 --> 01:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
stuff like that but
 
01:26:10.229 --> 01:26:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:12.149 --> 01:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
so i mean we could certainly draft such
 
01:26:13.830 --> 01:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
a letter and i'll
 
01:26:16.550 --> 01:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
do some follow-up with you on that um
 
01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
would it make sense to continue to
 
01:26:20.550 --> 01:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
gather our own data though in tandem
 
01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
with that i think yes oh i would think
 
01:26:25.990 --> 01:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
so i would think so because um so
 
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
and we might in the end when we gather
 
01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
that data see some things that we could
 
01:26:34.149 --> 01:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
suggest for future legislation right
 
01:26:34.159 --> 01:26:35.030 align:start position:0%
suggest for future legislation right
away

01:26:35.030 --> 01:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
away
 
01:26:38.550 --> 01:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
and we we ought to do that if we can but
 
01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
meantime i think we would be
 
01:26:46.390 --> 01:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:47.910 --> 01:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
to help us
 
01:26:51.990 --> 01:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
get to um a position where where
 
01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.110 align:start position:0%
get to um a position where where
we're

01:26:53.110 --> 01:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:26:55.110 --> 01:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
giving approp
 
01:26:57.510 --> 01:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate attention to a very
 
01:26:57.520 --> 01:26:59.590 align:start position:0%
appropriate attention to a very
important

01:26:59.590 --> 01:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:27:01.189 --> 01:27:01.199 align:start position:0%
part of our state government which is
 
01:27:04.390 --> 01:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
the commission on human rights
 
01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:09.189 align:start position:0%
the commission on human rights
okay

01:27:09.189 --> 01:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
yes uh
 
01:27:14.550 --> 01:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:16.550 --> 01:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
could you go to the table please because
 
01:27:18.790 --> 01:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
and turn on the mic because this is
 
01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:19.669 align:start position:0%
and turn on the mic because this is
being

01:27:19.669 --> 01:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:27:21.590 --> 01:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
videoed and people can't hear you
 
01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:23.189 align:start position:0%
videoed and people can't hear you
otherwise

01:27:23.189 --> 01:27:23.199 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative smith thank you
 
01:27:27.910 --> 01:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
representative mclean for the record
 
01:27:30.149 --> 01:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
for the record marissa chase executive
 
01:27:31.270 --> 01:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
director of the new hampshire
 
01:27:33.510 --> 01:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
association for justice i know you've
 
01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
all been drinking from a fire hose over
 
01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
this past hour and a half but i just
 
01:27:39.430 --> 01:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that you knew
 
01:27:40.870 --> 01:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
you know we talked a little bit about
 
01:27:43.110 --> 01:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
the due process issue but
 
01:27:44.470 --> 01:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
megan and heather have done some
 
01:27:45.910 --> 01:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
research on that i didn't know if you
 
01:27:48.149 --> 01:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to hear about that today
 
01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
and i believe they did want to respond
 
01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:50.629 align:start position:0%
and i believe they did want to respond
to

01:27:50.629 --> 01:27:50.639 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
some of the prior conversation i just
 
01:27:53.590 --> 01:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
don't know what your schedule and
 
01:27:54.950 --> 01:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
timeline is like whatever obviously
 
01:27:59.590 --> 01:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:02.629 --> 01:28:02.639 align:start position:0%
so if ms burns wants to come up and
 
01:28:03.750 --> 01:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
would be great perhaps they could both
 
01:28:05.430 --> 01:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
come up together is that okay with you
 
01:28:07.270 --> 01:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
it's fine with me if it's fine with them
 
01:28:19.510 --> 01:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:21.430 --> 01:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much again
 
01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to answer one of the
 
01:28:26.070 --> 01:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
questions that you'd had a moment ago
 
01:28:27.830 --> 01:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
before there was the suggestion and
 
01:28:30.229 --> 01:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
discussion of the performance audit um
 
01:28:32.149 --> 01:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
and that was you were sort of asking
 
01:28:34.390 --> 01:28:34.400 align:start position:0%
about sort of almost the light life
 
01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
cycle of a case that goes through the
 
01:28:37.590 --> 01:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
commission and i just wondered if i
 
01:28:39.910 --> 01:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
might help at least from the plaintiff's
 
01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
perspective explain how the process does
 
01:28:45.510 --> 01:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
happen and i don't know the absolute
 
01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
full internal workings of the commission
 
01:28:48.870 --> 01:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
but you heard from the executive
 
01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
director so she's told you a little bit
 
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
about it but just in terms of the whole
 
01:28:55.590 --> 01:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
life cycle it seemed like a lot of the
 
01:28:57.189 --> 01:28:57.199 align:start position:0%
questions we were getting
 
01:28:58.790 --> 01:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
made it sound like you sort of thought
 
01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
that things were getting bogged down by
 
01:29:03.189 --> 01:29:03.199 align:start position:0%
the time you get to the hearing process
 
01:29:04.870 --> 01:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
and from my perspective i don't really
 
01:29:06.390 --> 01:29:06.400 align:start position:0%
think that's what's happening i think
 
01:29:08.229 --> 01:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
that the bogging down is not happening
 
01:29:09.669 --> 01:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
by the time you get to the hearings and
 
01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
so i don't think it matters whether
 
01:29:12.709 --> 01:29:12.719 align:start position:0%
there's that the commission can do three
 
01:29:14.229 --> 01:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
hearings a month or five hearings a
 
01:29:16.629 --> 01:29:16.639 align:start position:0%
month the question is how long does it
 
01:29:19.270 --> 01:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
take to have an investigation done in
 
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
the process because essentially this is
 
01:29:24.229 --> 01:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
what happens you file um you file a
 
01:29:27.110 --> 01:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
charge if you're an unrepresented person
 
01:29:29.189 --> 01:29:29.199 align:start position:0%
you call their phone number and you get
 
01:29:31.430 --> 01:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
that intake person that that executive
 
01:29:33.590 --> 01:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
director molokai was talking about and
 
01:29:35.590 --> 01:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
then they would prepare a charge for you
 
01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
and send it out to you and if it looks
 
01:29:39.189 --> 01:29:39.199 align:start position:0%
correct then you sign it in front of a
 
01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
notary and then you file with the
 
01:29:42.229 --> 01:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
commission oftentimes if you're
 
01:29:43.750 --> 01:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
represented by an attorney the
 
01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
attorney's office prepares the charge
 
01:29:47.750 --> 01:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
and it gets filed in the commission in
 
01:29:49.669 --> 01:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
the same way you have to sign in front
 
01:29:50.950 --> 01:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
of a notary
 
01:29:53.030 --> 01:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
saying that it's true and accurate
 
01:29:54.629 --> 01:29:54.639 align:start position:0%
then it gets filed
 
01:29:56.709 --> 01:29:56.719 align:start position:0%
and from the plaintiff's perspective
 
01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
that's sort of when the waiting game
 
01:30:01.350 --> 01:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
begins because it takes a very long time
 
01:30:03.189 --> 01:30:03.199 align:start position:0%
for the case to even get to the point
 
01:30:04.830 --> 01:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
where it can be assigned to an
 
01:30:07.350 --> 01:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
investigator and we monitor cases that
 
01:30:08.950 --> 01:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
we have in the commission
 
01:30:11.590 --> 01:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
it can often take more than a year
 
01:30:13.350 --> 01:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes more than 18 months for the
 
01:30:14.790 --> 01:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
case to even get assigned to an
 
01:30:17.030 --> 01:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
investigator so from our perspective
 
01:30:19.110 --> 01:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
that's where the process is is just
 
01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
getting bogged down and again i think
 
01:30:22.229 --> 01:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
it's because of the lack of the
 
01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
investigative resources because
 
01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
that's the most that's the piece that
 
01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:27.590 align:start position:0%
that's the most that's the piece that
the

01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:30:28.709 --> 01:30:28.719 align:start position:0%
human rights commission from the
 
01:30:31.110 --> 01:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
employment cases spends its most time
 
01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
doing is is doing the investigation so
 
01:30:34.790 --> 01:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
you have to wait for the case to get
 
01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:36.719 align:start position:0%
inside to an investigator
 
01:30:39.110 --> 01:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
then the investigator is assigned the
 
01:30:40.629 --> 01:30:40.639 align:start position:0%
only other thing that really happens
 
01:30:42.950 --> 01:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
during that whole process is after the
 
01:30:45.350 --> 01:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
complaint is first filed a letter gets
 
01:30:47.510 --> 01:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
sent out asking for the respondent to
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
file a response to the charge and
 
01:30:51.830 --> 01:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
usually they're given i believe it's 60
 
01:30:53.910 --> 01:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
days to do that and sometimes they ask
 
01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
for an additional 30 days
 
01:30:57.430 --> 01:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't really make a difference
 
01:30:58.950 --> 01:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
even if there's that slight delay at
 
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
that point in the process because then
 
01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
you're in a big waiting game waiting
 
01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
for the case to be assigned to an
 
01:31:07.270 --> 01:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
investigator and that's what takes
 
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
really the most time is between the time
 
01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
that the response to the charge gets
 
01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
filed then for the case to have to get
 
01:31:16.709 --> 01:31:16.719 align:start position:0%
assigned to an investigator and then for
 
01:31:18.790 --> 01:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
the investigator to do the investigation
 
01:31:20.950 --> 01:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
and write up the investigation once
 
01:31:22.629 --> 01:31:22.639 align:start position:0%
there's a write-up of the investigation
 
01:31:24.550 --> 01:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
it's our understanding that it then goes
 
01:31:26.790 --> 01:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
to the investigating commissioner to
 
01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
make a determination on on probable
 
01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
cause or no probable cause and then once
 
01:31:34.390 --> 01:31:34.400 align:start position:0%
that happens then the probable cause of
 
01:31:36.149 --> 01:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
the no probable cause finding is sent
 
01:31:37.510 --> 01:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
out there is something called a
 
01:31:39.910 --> 01:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
summation letter that gets sent out
 
01:31:42.229 --> 01:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
before it goes to to the commissioner
 
01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
just essentially telling the parties
 
01:31:46.470 --> 01:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
the sort of an overview of what has been
 
01:31:48.629 --> 01:31:48.639 align:start position:0%
done in the investigation
 
01:31:50.149 --> 01:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
so that if the parties have additional
 
01:31:51.510 --> 01:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
information they want to give to the
 
01:31:54.870 --> 01:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
commission they have time to do that
 
01:31:56.790 --> 01:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
so that is how the process works from
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
our perspective i hope that's helpful to
 
01:32:00.390 --> 01:32:00.400 align:start position:0%
you to just sort of understand the life
 
01:32:03.510 --> 01:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
cycle of of how one of these cases goes
 
01:32:05.189 --> 01:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to answer any questions as
 
01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
i am able
 
01:32:09.750 --> 01:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
well i uh thank you for your input i i
 
01:32:11.669 --> 01:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
was kind of sort of piecing that
 
01:32:14.390 --> 01:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
together through the testimony but i
 
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
think it would be helpful and to kind of
 
01:32:19.830 --> 01:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
follow up on what representative wolper
 
01:32:21.830 --> 01:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
was asking for me
 
01:32:23.830 --> 01:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
not being a lawyer but being a person
 
01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
who makes light bulbs
 
01:32:26.550 --> 01:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:32:29.030 --> 01:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
being able to look at a process
 
01:32:30.790 --> 01:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
and map the process and that might be
 
01:32:31.910 --> 01:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we asked the
 
01:32:34.470 --> 01:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
director to do over the summer is put
 
01:32:37.350 --> 01:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
together a map of the process so that we
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
can understand
 
01:32:40.390 --> 01:32:40.400 align:start position:0%
where all those pieces to get together
 
01:32:41.910 --> 01:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
and visually so that i'm not kind of
 
01:32:43.830 --> 01:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
drawing back on this memory but if we
 
01:32:45.510 --> 01:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
could put that together
 
01:32:47.590 --> 01:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
and just say okay this is step one step
 
01:32:50.390 --> 01:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
two step three what's involved in that
 
01:32:51.910 --> 01:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
and also
 
01:32:56.470 --> 01:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
it would be interesting to understand um
 
01:32:57.990 --> 01:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
what is
 
01:32:59.590 --> 01:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
are the average times and what is
 
01:33:01.990 --> 01:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
driving some of those outliers so
 
01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
representative walpole was talking about
 
01:33:07.990 --> 01:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
well there's an intake of 900 cases
 
01:33:09.830 --> 01:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
how does that break down
 
01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
and for those
 
01:33:14.390 --> 01:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
cases that fall outside of
 
01:33:16.790 --> 01:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
the the normal like what is what is the
 
01:33:18.709 --> 01:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
average and for those cases that fall
 
01:33:20.310 --> 01:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
outside of the norm
 
01:33:23.270 --> 01:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
what is the breakdown on those um and is
 
01:33:25.510 --> 01:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
it indeed from the intake step and i
 
01:33:27.030 --> 01:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
think that will
 
01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
drive us all to the mechanics side or to
 
01:33:31.270 --> 01:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
the resource side
 
01:33:33.990 --> 01:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
but i think from my perspective
 
01:33:37.270 --> 01:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
um having just a process flow where we
 
01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
kind of look at each step it's mapped
 
01:33:41.910 --> 01:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
out for us and we understand
 
01:33:44.390 --> 01:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
what those outputs are so we
 
01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
we have a better understanding for what
 
01:33:48.310 --> 01:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
is the norm
 
01:33:50.149 --> 01:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
because we keep hearing three years and
 
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
five years and we really want to get to
 
01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
is that the norm is that the outlier and
 
01:33:56.709 --> 01:33:56.719 align:start position:0%
what is driving those outliers because i
 
01:33:58.870 --> 01:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
think that's important so that would be
 
01:34:00.870 --> 01:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
information in addition to the fiscal
 
01:34:02.830 --> 01:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
audit uh
 
01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
that performance i wrote it down
 
01:34:09.270 --> 01:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
i wrote with the big p in there
 
01:34:11.110 --> 01:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
01:34:14.870 --> 01:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
useful information to have so
 
01:34:17.830 --> 01:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
mr chair could could i just ask a yes
 
01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:21.590 align:start position:0%
mr chair could could i just ask a yes
question

01:34:21.590 --> 01:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:25.030 --> 01:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
attorney burns you mentioned the
 
01:34:27.910 --> 01:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
waiting a year to get an investigator
 
01:34:31.669 --> 01:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
once an investigator is assigned
 
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
what might typically be the time frame
 
01:34:36.149 --> 01:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
for them to make a probable cause
 
01:34:36.159 --> 01:34:41.350 align:start position:0%
for them to make a probable cause
determination

01:34:41.350 --> 01:34:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:44.830 --> 01:34:44.840 align:start position:0%
i can honestly tell you in the past few
 
01:34:47.669 --> 01:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
years it can take more than three years
 
01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:49.360 align:start position:0%
to get to the point where you get to a
 
01:34:51.430 --> 01:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
probable cause finding because we've had
 
01:34:53.270 --> 01:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
cases that have been in the process of
 
01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
being investigated at the commission
 
01:34:58.229 --> 01:34:58.239 align:start position:0%
where we have ended up having to pull
 
01:35:00.310 --> 01:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
them out of the commission just before
 
01:35:02.950 --> 01:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
the three-year statute of limitations
 
01:35:05.590 --> 01:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
because if we don't do that then we lose
 
01:35:07.189 --> 01:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
our claim under our state
 
01:35:10.229 --> 01:35:10.239 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination statute rsa 354-a a
 
01:35:12.470 --> 01:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
complainant has to file the suit in
 
01:35:15.109 --> 01:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
court within three years and we have had
 
01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
several cases where we could not get a
 
01:35:18.550 --> 01:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
finding within that
 
01:35:20.310 --> 01:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
three-year time frame and therefore we
 
01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
had to pull the case out and file i have
 
01:35:25.590 --> 01:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
not had an experience of five years and
 
01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
i do a tremendous amount of employment
 
01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
work but i i certainly have had three
 
01:35:33.189 --> 01:35:33.199 align:start position:0%
so i think could i could i just
 
01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:38.550 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:35:38.550 --> 01:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:39.510 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:35:39.510 --> 01:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:35:40.950 --> 01:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
did you want to comment on that or i
 
01:35:43.510 --> 01:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
just wanted to
 
01:35:46.790 --> 01:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
put a little more meat on what heather
 
01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
just explained
 
01:35:51.750 --> 01:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
heather i you'll correct me if i'm wrong
 
01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:52.470 align:start position:0%
heather i you'll correct me if i'm wrong
but

01:35:52.470 --> 01:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:35:54.870 --> 01:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
you could let
 
01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
um that three year deadline
 
01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
to file in superior court lapse
 
01:36:03.990 --> 01:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
but the problem with that is is that you
 
01:36:05.350 --> 01:36:05.360 align:start position:0%
then you then
 
01:36:09.109 --> 01:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
roll the dice on getting a
 
01:36:11.669 --> 01:36:11.679 align:start position:0%
p a probable cause finding or or a no
 
01:36:13.990 --> 01:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
probable cause finding if you get a
 
01:36:15.990 --> 01:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
probable cause finding
 
01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:17.750 align:start position:0%
probable cause finding
then

01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:36:20.629 --> 01:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
in my experience the defense defendants
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
counsel is going to remove you to
 
01:36:23.510 --> 01:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
superior court
 
01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:25.669 align:start position:0%
superior court
anyway

01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
01:36:27.990 --> 01:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
if you get a no probable cause finding
 
01:36:30.020 --> 01:36:30.030 align:start position:0%
then then the employees um
 
01:36:30.030 --> 01:36:31.910 align:start position:0%
then then the employees um
[Music]

01:36:31.910 --> 01:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
done in terms of relief except unless
 
01:36:38.149 --> 01:36:38.159 align:start position:0%
they have grounds for appeal to uh you
 
01:36:39.510 --> 01:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
know grounds
 
01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
to appeal the quality of the
 
01:36:43.510 --> 01:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
investigation or the application
 
01:36:45.270 --> 01:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
misapplication of law in the
 
01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:46.550 align:start position:0%
misapplication of law in the
investigation

01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
01:36:48.229 --> 01:36:48.239 align:start position:0%
giving rise to the no probable cause
 
01:36:48.239 --> 01:36:49.189 align:start position:0%
giving rise to the no probable cause
finding

01:36:49.189 --> 01:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
finding
 
01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
so i
 
01:36:52.790 --> 01:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
heather did i i mean is it just accurate
 
01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:54.550 align:start position:0%
heather did i i mean is it just accurate
okay

01:36:54.550 --> 01:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:36:56.310 --> 01:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
and could i just follow up with with
 
01:36:58.950 --> 01:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
attorney burns on the so
 
01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
there's a substantial period of time
 
01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
it's taking them to make a determination
 
01:37:05.189 --> 01:37:05.199 align:start position:0%
with regard to probable cause and
 
01:37:05.199 --> 01:37:06.870 align:start position:0%
with regard to probable cause and
typically

01:37:06.870 --> 01:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
typically
 
01:37:09.109 --> 01:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
probable cause is
 
01:37:11.430 --> 01:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
a standard that's
 
01:37:13.030 --> 01:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
somewhere more than a reasonable
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
suspicion but
 
01:37:17.430 --> 01:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
less than more likely than not which is
 
01:37:19.590 --> 01:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
that's what our supreme court says
 
01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:20.390 align:start position:0%
that's what our supreme court says
so

01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
but what i'm gathering is
 
01:37:25.830 --> 01:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
this determination of probable cause is
 
01:37:27.990 --> 01:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
more than
 
01:37:30.550 --> 01:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
what you would see in a criminal context
 
01:37:33.109 --> 01:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
of a determination of probable cause
 
01:37:38.149 --> 01:37:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:41.109 --> 01:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
than you might otherwise see is is that
 
01:37:43.990 --> 01:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
a fair representation it's hard to say i
 
01:37:46.149 --> 01:37:46.159 align:start position:0%
i will i will say first off i don't do
 
01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
any criminal work at all so what
 
01:37:51.510 --> 01:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
probable cause honestly means um in the
 
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
criminal context i'd have to go back
 
01:37:55.270 --> 01:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
more than 30 years to when i was in law
 
01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:56.070 align:start position:0%
more than 30 years to when i was in law
school

01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:37:58.709 --> 01:37:58.719 align:start position:0%
i don't dare do that um
 
01:37:58.719 --> 01:38:01.590 align:start position:0%
i don't dare do that um
but

01:38:01.590 --> 01:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:04.470 --> 01:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
i i i can't say that i can give you a
 
01:38:05.910 --> 01:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
black and white answer as to what
 
01:38:08.070 --> 01:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
probable cause means and i would i would
 
01:38:11.350 --> 01:38:11.360 align:start position:0%
prefer honestly to defer to either um
 
01:38:13.750 --> 01:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
executive director malachi or assistant
 
01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
executive director
 
01:38:18.149 --> 01:38:18.159 align:start position:0%
burke cohen because i think that
 
01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
depending on if you asked a plaintiff's
 
01:38:21.830 --> 01:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
attorney or a defendant's attorney you
 
01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
might get a different view on what
 
01:38:25.910 --> 01:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
probable cause is but certainly if
 
01:38:27.669 --> 01:38:27.679 align:start position:0%
attorney douglas has a comment i'm happy
 
01:38:28.790 --> 01:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
to let her
 
01:38:31.270 --> 01:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
the commission does have a rule defining
 
01:38:35.030 --> 01:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
probable cause and i'm gonna state it as
 
01:38:37.430 --> 01:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
close to
 
01:38:40.149 --> 01:38:40.159 align:start position:0%
the exact language that i can recall
 
01:38:41.350 --> 01:38:41.360 align:start position:0%
here today
 
01:38:43.109 --> 01:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
it is um
 
01:38:45.990 --> 01:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
sufficient facts in the record from
 
01:38:48.790 --> 01:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
which a reasonable fact finder
 
01:38:50.470 --> 01:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
could find
 
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
discrimination afoot
 
01:38:56.310 --> 01:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
so that's that's the test that the
 
01:38:58.390 --> 01:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
investigator is looking to see whether
 
01:39:01.270 --> 01:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
there's sufficient facts in the records
 
01:39:04.229 --> 01:39:04.239 align:start position:0%
for a reasonable commissioner
 
01:39:08.149 --> 01:39:08.159 align:start position:0%
to conclude that discrimination happened
 
01:39:13.030 --> 01:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
and i i'm i'm open to rebuttal if
 
01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:14.149 align:start position:0%
and i i'm i'm open to rebuttal if
i've

01:39:14.149 --> 01:39:14.159 align:start position:0%
i've
 
01:39:18.950 --> 01:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:26.390 --> 01:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:27.830 --> 01:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any additional
 
01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:29.189 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any additional
thoughts

01:39:29.189 --> 01:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
thoughts
 
01:39:30.790 --> 01:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
so like i said i
 
01:39:34.950 --> 01:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
i would like to see um a timeline just
 
01:39:37.430 --> 01:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
so it it kind of
 
01:39:38.950 --> 01:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
gives us a better
 
01:39:41.109 --> 01:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
a visual depiction of the process i
 
01:39:43.109 --> 01:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
think is going to be easier for us
 
01:39:45.030 --> 01:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
rather than trying to pull a whole bunch
 
01:39:46.870 --> 01:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
of pieces together this person said this
 
01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
this person said that and
 
01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
and understanding you know
 
01:39:54.709 --> 01:39:54.719 align:start position:0%
relatively speaking where are those big
 
01:39:56.709 --> 01:39:56.719 align:start position:0%
buckets in the process
 
01:39:58.470 --> 01:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
included in that
 
01:40:01.109 --> 01:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
director malachi it would be nice if if
 
01:40:03.910 --> 01:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
we could look and maybe
 
01:40:06.390 --> 01:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
if you can identify any legislative
 
01:40:07.910 --> 01:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
opportunities which really is going to
 
01:40:10.470 --> 01:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
be within the purview of this community
 
01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:11.510 align:start position:0%
be within the purview of this community
committee

01:40:11.510 --> 01:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:40:13.109 --> 01:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
if there are
 
01:40:16.229 --> 01:40:16.239 align:start position:0%
unnecessary legislative roadblocks that
 
01:40:18.550 --> 01:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
can be identified
 
01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
then we can certainly help with that so
 
01:40:22.550 --> 01:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
i think it's an opportunity
 
01:40:24.229 --> 01:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
to have some discussions you know
 
01:40:26.870 --> 01:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
amongst your team uh with the ag and if
 
01:40:29.109 --> 01:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
you can come back and speak to that that
 
01:40:31.590 --> 01:40:31.600 align:start position:0%
would be very helpful of us also
 
01:40:34.070 --> 01:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
you kind of stepped out a little bit
 
01:40:35.350 --> 01:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
following up a little bit on
 
01:40:37.510 --> 01:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
representative wolper just kind of a
 
01:40:40.629 --> 01:40:40.639 align:start position:0%
summary of resolution times really it
 
01:40:42.950 --> 01:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
would be interesting to get a feel for
 
01:40:45.590 --> 01:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
what is the picture when things come in
 
01:40:47.830 --> 01:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
for the the normal person what are they
 
01:40:49.430 --> 01:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
seeing and we talked about some of the
 
01:40:51.750 --> 01:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
outliers so it would be nice to
 
01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
understand okay these are outliers and
 
01:40:57.189 --> 01:40:57.199 align:start position:0%
what are some of the drivers behind
 
01:40:59.910 --> 01:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
those outliers is it because as you said
 
01:41:02.229 --> 01:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
um we're getting amendment after
 
01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
amendment after amendment are there
 
01:41:06.310 --> 01:41:06.320 align:start position:0%
other things more process related
 
01:41:08.310 --> 01:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
driving those outliers just so that we
 
01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
can have a better understanding of that
 
01:41:12.310 --> 01:41:12.320 align:start position:0%
those are some of the things i would
 
01:41:14.470 --> 01:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
like to see representative smith
 
01:41:16.470 --> 01:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair i i think
 
01:41:19.910 --> 01:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
that you made some very good points
 
01:41:22.870 --> 01:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
when you suggested to the director that
 
01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
she speak with her staff and with the
 
01:41:29.990 --> 01:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
ag's office in order to identify
 
01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:30.830 align:start position:0%
ag's office in order to identify
uh

01:41:30.830 --> 01:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:32.390 align:start position:0%
uh
possible

01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:41:35.669 --> 01:41:35.679 align:start position:0%
ways that the legislature could remove
 
01:41:38.310 --> 01:41:38.320 align:start position:0%
um unnecessary roadblocks
 
01:41:41.189 --> 01:41:41.199 align:start position:0%
i would ask that she might consider
 
01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
broadening that
 
01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
to um
 
01:41:48.870 --> 01:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
to solicit responses from attorneys who
 
01:41:51.030 --> 01:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
have represented both employers and
 
01:41:53.510 --> 01:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
employees in the past
 
01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:55.189 align:start position:0%
employees in the past
um

01:41:55.189 --> 01:41:55.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:55.199 --> 01:41:55.910 align:start position:0%
um
or

01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:41:55.920 --> 01:41:57.189 align:start position:0%
or
represented

01:41:57.189 --> 01:41:57.199 align:start position:0%
represented
 
01:41:58.629 --> 01:41:58.639 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily employers and
 
01:42:01.030 --> 01:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
employees represented people on
 
01:42:03.510 --> 01:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
on both sides of the issue as it's
 
01:42:05.510 --> 01:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
presented to them to see if they can
 
01:42:07.189 --> 01:42:07.199 align:start position:0%
identify ways
 
01:42:09.910 --> 01:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
that there seem to be some unnecessary
 
01:42:12.709 --> 01:42:12.719 align:start position:0%
roadblocks because if that informal
 
01:42:14.950 --> 01:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
communication can take place
 
01:42:18.629 --> 01:42:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:22.149 --> 01:42:22.159 align:start position:0%
the impending doom of the legislature
 
01:42:25.990 --> 01:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
it might be very helpful
 
01:42:27.910 --> 01:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
because it's always good to avoid
 
01:42:34.390 --> 01:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:37.030 --> 01:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo thank you mr cure
 
01:42:39.109 --> 01:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that i think
 
01:42:42.310 --> 01:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
should be explored is
 
01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
the three-year statute of limitations
 
01:42:47.910 --> 01:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if there's a way
 
01:42:49.669 --> 01:42:49.679 align:start position:0%
that three years
 
01:42:51.910 --> 01:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
can be frozen
 
01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
at the time a person files with superior
 
01:42:55.440 --> 01:43:00.790 align:start position:0%
at the time a person files with superior
court

01:43:00.790 --> 01:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:02.470 --> 01:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
i think that's a question that we could
 
01:43:26.470 --> 01:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:28.149 --> 01:43:28.159 align:start position:0%
does anybody else
 
01:43:28.159 --> 01:43:29.750 align:start position:0%
does anybody else
have

01:43:29.750 --> 01:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:43:32.470 --> 01:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
any thoughts any information that they
 
01:43:33.990 --> 01:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
might want to have gathered over the
 
01:43:37.590 --> 01:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
summer to help inform the discussion
 
01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:41.510 align:start position:0%
summer to help inform the discussion
yes

01:43:41.510 --> 01:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:44.950 --> 01:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
i could go all day but but i won't um
 
01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:45.830 align:start position:0%
i could go all day but but i won't um
my

01:43:45.830 --> 01:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:46.790 align:start position:0%
my
my

01:43:46.790 --> 01:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
my head is spinning a little bit because
 
01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:50.629 align:start position:0%
my head is spinning a little bit because
um

01:43:50.629 --> 01:43:50.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:56.310 --> 01:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
you know sb 2 296 was intended i thought
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
to be a way to ensure that all claimants
 
01:44:01.830 --> 01:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
had access to
 
01:44:04.229 --> 01:44:04.239 align:start position:0%
an administrative relief
 
01:44:07.270 --> 01:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
or to relief period and that that
 
01:44:09.990 --> 01:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
um you know specifically small claimants
 
01:44:12.149 --> 01:44:12.159 align:start position:0%
needed to have the ability to stay in
 
01:44:13.910 --> 01:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
the administrative forum if they were
 
01:44:16.070 --> 01:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
going to get justice at all
 
01:44:19.189 --> 01:44:19.199 align:start position:0%
and it seems that somehow now the focus
 
01:44:21.270 --> 01:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
has shifted to
 
01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:22.629 align:start position:0%
has shifted to
well

01:44:22.629 --> 01:44:22.639 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:44:25.750 --> 01:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
okay but are we providing due process to
 
01:44:28.870 --> 01:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
the defendant employers which is fair
 
01:44:31.510 --> 01:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
but also
 
01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:32.310 align:start position:0%
but also
are

01:44:32.310 --> 01:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:44:34.310 --> 01:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
is everybody involved in the
 
01:44:37.270 --> 01:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
administrative law process
 
01:44:40.310 --> 01:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
being treated fairly in in terms of how
 
01:44:42.629 --> 01:44:42.639 align:start position:0%
long the process is taking
 
01:44:42.639 --> 01:44:44.149 align:start position:0%
long the process is taking
um

01:44:44.149 --> 01:44:44.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:44.159 --> 01:44:44.950 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:44:44.950 --> 01:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:44:46.470 --> 01:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
the attention they're getting in that
 
01:44:48.870 --> 01:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
process right so those are those are all
 
01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
of the things that i'm
 
01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
i'm hearing um are being considered
 
01:44:55.510 --> 01:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
right now and that's and that's fine i
 
01:44:57.910 --> 01:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that this that we
 
01:44:57.920 --> 01:44:58.709 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that this that we
all

01:44:58.709 --> 01:44:58.719 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
hopefully remember that this started
 
01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:02.790 align:start position:0%
hopefully remember that this started
as

01:45:02.790 --> 01:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:45:04.790 --> 01:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
an effort to make sure
 
01:45:09.270 --> 01:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
that employees with ongoing harassment
 
01:45:10.950 --> 01:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
and potentially
 
01:45:13.750 --> 01:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
you know small dollar valor value
 
01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:15.669 align:start position:0%
you know small dollar valor value
claims

01:45:15.669 --> 01:45:15.679 align:start position:0%
claims
 
01:45:19.750 --> 01:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
have a way to get a remedy because
 
01:45:21.030 --> 01:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:45:23.109 --> 01:45:23.119 align:start position:0%
again the defendant can
 
01:45:24.310 --> 01:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
play the
 
01:45:25.590 --> 01:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:45:27.109 --> 01:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
you've gone through this process and
 
01:45:29.189 --> 01:45:29.199 align:start position:0%
you've gotten close card
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna i'm gonna make you
 
01:45:33.669 --> 01:45:33.679 align:start position:0%
play a whole other game at a whole other
 
01:45:36.870 --> 01:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
level which i know i suspect you can't
 
01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
you can't compete in
 
01:45:42.950 --> 01:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:44.950 --> 01:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
segway into
 
01:45:46.870 --> 01:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh the discussion of the the small
 
01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
number of hearings at the commission
 
01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:51.430 align:start position:0%
number of hearings at the commission
um

01:45:51.430 --> 01:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:55.030 --> 01:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
over the last 10 years there's
 
01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
there's been i i mean i looked on the
 
01:45:59.590 --> 01:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
commission's website before i
 
01:46:02.629 --> 01:46:02.639 align:start position:0%
came today there's only six
 
01:46:05.109 --> 01:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
published decisions
 
01:46:07.030 --> 01:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
coming out of the commission
 
01:46:08.629 --> 01:46:08.639 align:start position:0%
in 10 years
 
01:46:08.639 --> 01:46:09.430 align:start position:0%
in 10 years
so

01:46:09.430 --> 01:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:46:11.109 --> 01:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
that means that only
 
01:46:13.189 --> 01:46:13.199 align:start position:0%
six cases have been
 
01:46:15.270 --> 01:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
heard fully i think
 
01:46:17.430 --> 01:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
and i mean we heard today from director
 
01:46:20.310 --> 01:46:20.320 align:start position:0%
malachi that many of these cases
 
01:46:22.790 --> 01:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
settle i think she
 
01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:23.910 align:start position:0%
settle i think she
submitted

01:46:23.910 --> 01:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
submitted
 
01:46:25.590 --> 01:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
information today showing that about
 
01:46:27.109 --> 01:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
half of them
 
01:46:29.669 --> 01:46:29.679 align:start position:0%
settle well nine settled i think in two
 
01:46:29.679 --> 01:46:30.709 align:start position:0%
settle well nine settled i think in two
withdrew

01:46:30.709 --> 01:46:30.719 align:start position:0%
withdrew
 
01:46:32.870 --> 01:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
i want i want
 
01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
you to think about
 
01:46:39.430 --> 01:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
the possibility that many of those cases
 
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
may have settled
 
01:46:43.990 --> 01:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
because it was communicated to employees
 
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
in those settlement discussions that
 
01:46:48.229 --> 01:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
unless you settle
 
01:46:51.109 --> 01:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
i'm going to yank you to superior court
 
01:46:53.030 --> 01:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
so the fact that
 
01:46:56.310 --> 01:46:56.320 align:start position:0%
this this shadow of removal
 
01:46:57.670 --> 01:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
really um
 
01:46:57.680 --> 01:46:59.030 align:start position:0%
really um
[Music]

01:46:59.030 --> 01:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:47:02.790 --> 01:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
both directly and indirectly
 
01:47:06.070 --> 01:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
affects employees access
 
01:47:09.109 --> 01:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
to relief from discrimination because it
 
01:47:11.510 --> 01:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
takes away a forum
 
01:47:14.070 --> 01:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
that employees i thought were supposed
 
01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:15.270 align:start position:0%
that employees i thought were supposed
to

01:47:15.270 --> 01:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:47:18.470 --> 01:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
smaller uh employees were supposed to
 
01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:19.990 align:start position:0%
smaller uh employees were supposed to
have

01:47:19.990 --> 01:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:47:23.350 --> 01:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
when 354a was enacted
 
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:28.709 --> 01:47:28.719 align:start position:0%
marissa asked me to talk briefly about
 
01:47:31.270 --> 01:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
the due process concerns i you know i
 
01:47:32.790 --> 01:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
think that if you look at the
 
01:47:34.870 --> 01:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
massachusetts cases
 
01:47:39.130 --> 01:47:39.140 align:start position:0%
that analyzed this issue
 
01:47:39.140 --> 01:47:40.470 align:start position:0%
that analyzed this issue
[Music]

01:47:40.470 --> 01:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:41.669 align:start position:0%
[Music]
after

01:47:41.669 --> 01:47:41.679 align:start position:0%
after
 
01:47:43.270 --> 01:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:44.229 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
gave

01:47:44.229 --> 01:47:44.239 align:start position:0%
gave
 
01:47:46.070 --> 01:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
defendants the right to remove to
 
01:47:47.750 --> 01:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
superior court
 
01:47:49.270 --> 01:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
you will see
 
01:47:53.109 --> 01:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
that there is no genuine due process
 
01:47:53.119 --> 01:47:54.149 align:start position:0%
that there is no genuine due process
um

01:47:54.149 --> 01:47:54.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:54.159 --> 01:47:55.590 align:start position:0%
um
concern

01:47:55.590 --> 01:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:47:58.310 --> 01:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
that there's actually a new hampshire
 
01:48:01.189 --> 01:48:01.199 align:start position:0%
a united states supreme court case
 
01:48:01.199 --> 01:48:02.390 align:start position:0%
a united states supreme court case
that

01:48:02.390 --> 01:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:06.229 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:48:06.229 --> 01:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:09.189 --> 01:48:09.199 align:start position:0%
emphasizes that the right to choose form
 
01:48:11.990 --> 01:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
for adjudication should rest
 
01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
with the one seeking redress
 
01:48:16.149 --> 01:48:16.159 align:start position:0%
and frankly the one that bears the
 
01:48:19.270 --> 01:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
burden of proof rather than the one from
 
01:48:21.669 --> 01:48:21.679 align:start position:0%
whom the redress is sought
 
01:48:24.790 --> 01:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
and the united states supreme court
 
01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:26.149 align:start position:0%
and the united states supreme court
also

01:48:26.149 --> 01:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:48:27.830 --> 01:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
notes that
 
01:48:30.550 --> 01:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
the possibility of defendants
 
01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:33.350 align:start position:0%
the possibility of defendants
um

01:48:33.350 --> 01:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:36.229 --> 01:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
making themselves judgment proof by
 
01:48:38.790 --> 01:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
forcing the plaintiff into a forum where
 
01:48:42.229 --> 01:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
he or she cannot afford to to contend
 
01:48:45.510 --> 01:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
um so i can i can i'll happily email you
 
01:48:48.709 --> 01:48:48.719 align:start position:0%
the massachusetts cases and my
 
01:48:51.510 --> 01:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
distillation of them
 
01:48:55.270 --> 01:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of the due process principles
 
01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:56.550 align:start position:0%
in terms of the due process principles
but

01:48:56.550 --> 01:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:48:59.510 --> 01:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
i'm here to tell you today that the case
 
01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:01.189 align:start position:0%
i'm here to tell you today that the case
the

01:49:01.189 --> 01:49:01.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:49:04.790 --> 01:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:06.870 --> 01:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
in in 2000
 
01:49:09.030 --> 01:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
house bill 297
 
01:49:11.750 --> 01:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
added the right the defendant's right to
 
01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:12.870 align:start position:0%
added the right the defendant's right to
remove

01:49:12.870 --> 01:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
remove
 
01:49:16.390 --> 01:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
to 354-a and that was because there was
 
01:49:18.149 --> 01:49:18.159 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
01:49:20.430 --> 01:49:20.440 align:start position:0%
in a massachusetts court surrounding the
 
01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:22.070 align:start position:0%
in a massachusetts court surrounding the
constitutionality

01:49:22.070 --> 01:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
constitutionality
 
01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:24.229 align:start position:0%
constitutionality
of

01:49:24.229 --> 01:49:24.239 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:49:26.149 --> 01:49:26.159 align:start position:0%
defendants not having the right to a
 
01:49:26.159 --> 01:49:27.350 align:start position:0%
defendants not having the right to a
superior

01:49:27.350 --> 01:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
superior
 
01:49:31.589 --> 01:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
court trial a jury trial and being stuck
 
01:49:34.629 --> 01:49:34.639 align:start position:0%
with an administrative agency hearing
 
01:49:34.639 --> 01:49:35.750 align:start position:0%
with an administrative agency hearing
and

01:49:35.750 --> 01:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:49:38.149 --> 01:49:38.159 align:start position:0%
after we enacted that law
 
01:49:41.270 --> 01:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
the massachusetts supreme court analyzed
 
01:49:43.669 --> 01:49:43.679 align:start position:0%
the issue and said no no no
 
01:49:45.830 --> 01:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
there is no problem
 
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
with a let with
 
01:49:50.390 --> 01:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
asking a defendant to see the
 
01:49:52.390 --> 01:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
administrative process
 
01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
through from beginning to end through
 
01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:55.510 align:start position:0%
through from beginning to end through
hearing

01:49:55.510 --> 01:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:49:57.669 --> 01:49:57.679 align:start position:0%
and then giving the defendant the right
 
01:49:59.510 --> 01:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
to a full appeal
 
01:50:01.990 --> 01:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
in superior court if necessary there's
 
01:50:03.990 --> 01:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
no due process issue
 
01:50:07.030 --> 01:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
with that structure
 
01:50:09.510 --> 01:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
so i i will um
 
01:50:11.510 --> 01:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
i will send those cases to you if
 
01:50:14.709 --> 01:50:14.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:16.550 --> 01:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
so we would absolutely love to have
 
01:50:20.070 --> 01:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
those cases um and your other comments
 
01:50:23.589 --> 01:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
are not lost on on this committee uh
 
01:50:23.599 --> 01:50:24.390 align:start position:0%
are not lost on on this committee uh
when

01:50:24.390 --> 01:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:25.350 align:start position:0%
when
we

01:50:25.350 --> 01:50:25.360 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:50:27.510 --> 01:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
heard testimony originally i think
 
01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:28.629 align:start position:0%
heard testimony originally i think
everybody

01:50:28.629 --> 01:50:28.639 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
01:50:28.639 --> 01:50:29.430 align:start position:0%
everybody
was

01:50:29.430 --> 01:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:50:34.070 --> 01:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
of agreement that the bill itself sb 296
 
01:50:36.790 --> 01:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
was on solid legal footing
 
01:50:39.430 --> 01:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
and so we were comfortable with that but
 
01:50:41.350 --> 01:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh the chairman of the whole committee
 
01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
representative gordon and it was a valid
 
01:50:46.229 --> 01:50:46.239 align:start position:0%
point which attorney burns you
 
01:50:48.550 --> 01:50:48.560 align:start position:0%
kind of reinforced where you're saying
 
01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:49.669 align:start position:0%
kind of reinforced where you're saying
justice

01:50:49.669 --> 01:50:49.679 align:start position:0%
justice
 
01:50:51.910 --> 01:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
delayed is justice denied and you're
 
01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:52.950 align:start position:0%
delayed is justice denied and you're
actually

01:50:52.950 --> 01:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:50:55.990 --> 01:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
removing your own clients because of the
 
01:50:58.470 --> 01:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
time in this issue and so
 
01:51:00.709 --> 01:51:00.719 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns that we had as a
 
01:51:02.229 --> 01:51:02.239 align:start position:0%
committee as a whole
 
01:51:02.239 --> 01:51:03.990 align:start position:0%
committee as a whole
was

01:51:03.990 --> 01:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
what what what
 
01:51:08.470 --> 01:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
is this going to actually provide an
 
01:51:10.790 --> 01:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
added burden on to the commission
 
01:51:14.310 --> 01:51:14.320 align:start position:0%
so while we felt that sb 296 was on firm
 
01:51:16.470 --> 01:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
legal standing
 
01:51:19.750 --> 01:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
in practical effect we did not know what
 
01:51:21.910 --> 01:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
its passage was going to bring and
 
01:51:24.070 --> 01:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
that's why we have this interim study
 
01:51:26.310 --> 01:51:26.320 align:start position:0%
committee so i think that's where we are
 
01:51:29.189 --> 01:51:29.199 align:start position:0%
and we we want to
 
01:51:31.589 --> 01:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
see that we get there but that the
 
01:51:33.109 --> 01:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
practical effect is that we have
 
01:51:35.109 --> 01:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
something that is working and i think
 
01:51:37.189 --> 01:51:37.199 align:start position:0%
that's the goal that everybody in this
 
01:51:42.629 --> 01:51:42.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:44.310 --> 01:51:44.320 align:start position:0%
if i just might just follow up a little
 
01:51:45.990 --> 01:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
bit on on what attorney douglas was
 
01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:47.030 align:start position:0%
bit on on what attorney douglas was
saying

01:51:47.030 --> 01:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
saying
 
01:51:48.790 --> 01:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
because i do think it is important and i
 
01:51:50.550 --> 01:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
know you gave an example of the fact
 
01:51:52.470 --> 01:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
that that i for example i'm having to
 
01:51:54.070 --> 01:51:54.080 align:start position:0%
remove some of my cases to the
 
01:51:55.669 --> 01:51:55.679 align:start position:0%
commission so that i can get them to
 
01:51:55.679 --> 01:51:57.350 align:start position:0%
commission so that i can get them to
court

01:51:57.350 --> 01:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:51:59.990 --> 01:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a smaller subset of
 
01:52:03.270 --> 01:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
cases that i can handle for employees
 
01:52:05.910 --> 01:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
but there's a big section of employees
 
01:52:08.629 --> 01:52:08.639 align:start position:0%
who can't necessarily find attorneys to
 
01:52:10.870 --> 01:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
take their cases when our firm takes
 
01:52:12.790 --> 01:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
employment cases we take them on a
 
01:52:15.109 --> 01:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
contingent fee basis almost all of the
 
01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
time because our clients have been
 
01:52:19.030 --> 01:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
terminated from their jobs and they
 
01:52:21.510 --> 01:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
don't have the resources to pay our firm
 
01:52:24.629 --> 01:52:24.639 align:start position:0%
by the hour to engage in expensive
 
01:52:27.430 --> 01:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
litigation and court litigation has been
 
01:52:30.229 --> 01:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
become very very expensive now because
 
01:52:33.430 --> 01:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
of the issue of what we call esi which
 
01:52:35.430 --> 01:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
is electronically stored information
 
01:52:37.510 --> 01:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
which is as we all know everything we
 
01:52:39.430 --> 01:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
think and everything we say we put it in
 
01:52:42.390 --> 01:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
an email so we get thousands hundreds of
 
01:52:45.030 --> 01:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
thousands of emails and cases it has
 
01:52:49.030 --> 01:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
made the litigation process so so costly
 
01:52:52.310 --> 01:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
there is a subset of employees sometimes
 
01:52:52.320 --> 01:52:53.430 align:start position:0%
there is a subset of employees sometimes
lower

01:52:53.430 --> 01:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
lower
 
01:52:55.669 --> 01:52:55.679 align:start position:0%
lower level earners
 
01:52:57.510 --> 01:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
who who can't get an attorney to
 
01:53:00.070 --> 01:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
represent them in a case and so the only
 
01:53:02.229 --> 01:53:02.239 align:start position:0%
recourse they have is to go through the
 
01:53:04.390 --> 01:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
administrative process of being at the
 
01:53:07.030 --> 01:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
human rights commission and if they wait
 
01:53:08.870 --> 01:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
in the commission to the point where
 
01:53:10.950 --> 01:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
they finally get a probable cause
 
01:53:13.270 --> 01:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
finding and they think that they can get
 
01:53:14.950 --> 01:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
a hearing where they'll be able to
 
01:53:17.589 --> 01:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
represent themselves at the commission
 
01:53:19.669 --> 01:53:19.679 align:start position:0%
to then have the rug pulled out from
 
01:53:21.910 --> 01:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
under them and have them move to the
 
01:53:24.790 --> 01:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
superior court system where then i can
 
01:53:27.189 --> 01:53:27.199 align:start position:0%
tell you we get calls we get calls from
 
01:53:29.589 --> 01:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
potential clients regularly who have
 
01:53:31.990 --> 01:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
said i got a probable cause finding from
 
01:53:33.669 --> 01:53:33.679 align:start position:0%
the human rights commission
 
01:53:36.070 --> 01:53:36.080 align:start position:0%
and a large law firm
 
01:53:37.750 --> 01:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
one of the national law firms with
 
01:53:39.669 --> 01:53:39.679 align:start position:0%
regional offices here in new hampshire
 
01:53:43.030 --> 01:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
has just removed my case to court and
 
01:53:45.430 --> 01:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
now i find myself either in the superior
 
01:53:47.910 --> 01:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
court or even the federal district court
 
01:53:50.070 --> 01:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
how can i possibly do this myself and
 
01:53:52.950 --> 01:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
the answer is they really can't they
 
01:53:55.669 --> 01:53:55.679 align:start position:0%
can't and so right when they're on the
 
01:53:59.350 --> 01:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
precipice of winning and getting
 
01:54:02.310 --> 01:54:02.320 align:start position:0%
a justice for their unjust and unlawful
 
01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:03.589 align:start position:0%
a justice for their unjust and unlawful
termination

01:54:03.589 --> 01:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
termination
 
01:54:05.430 --> 01:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
they end up going into a system where
 
01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
they cannot compete unless they can have
 
01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
legal counsel and for a lot of those
 
01:54:12.310 --> 01:54:12.320 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs they are not going to be able
 
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
to secure legal counsel and so if the
 
01:54:17.910 --> 01:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
employer time after time can remove
 
01:54:19.990 --> 01:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
their case to court as soon as there's a
 
01:54:22.629 --> 01:54:22.639 align:start position:0%
probable cause finding it will deny
 
01:54:24.950 --> 01:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
justice for so many of those employees
 
01:54:27.030 --> 01:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
and we have seen it and that is why
 
01:54:29.109 --> 01:54:29.119 align:start position:0%
attorney douglas and i are here today to
 
01:54:30.950 --> 01:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
talk to you about this issue because
 
01:54:33.109 --> 01:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
from our perspective it is so important
 
01:54:34.790 --> 01:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
for all employees in the state of new
 
01:54:36.870 --> 01:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire who want to have a state free
 
01:54:38.629 --> 01:54:38.639 align:start position:0%
from discrimination
 
01:54:45.669 --> 01:54:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:47.669 --> 01:54:47.679 align:start position:0%
so i think we have a pretty full bucket
 
01:54:48.950 --> 01:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
for the summer
 
01:54:51.589 --> 01:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
and so uh with that i just
 
01:54:54.070 --> 01:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
if nobody else has anything else to add
 
01:55:08.709 --> 01:55:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:11.510 --> 01:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
just very quickly a small note
 
01:55:13.109 --> 01:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
there's a folder and i'll make sure you
 
01:55:15.830 --> 01:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
get one representative smith you go okay
 
01:55:18.149 --> 01:55:18.159 align:start position:0%
so inside just just because i know we're
 
01:55:19.589 --> 01:55:19.599 align:start position:0%
leaving in just a moment inside the
 
01:55:22.310 --> 01:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
folder on the left hand side
 
01:55:23.510 --> 01:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
has the
 
01:55:25.990 --> 01:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
previous white paper behind that
 
01:55:28.390 --> 01:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
is what i would call an introductory
 
01:55:31.030 --> 01:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
training and it just talks through
 
01:55:33.510 --> 01:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
what we do and how in our and our
 
01:55:35.830 --> 01:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
process just a high level version of
 
01:55:38.709 --> 01:55:38.719 align:start position:0%
that on the right hand side uh all of
 
01:55:41.189 --> 01:55:41.199 align:start position:0%
those forms paperclip together
 
01:55:44.629 --> 01:55:44.639 align:start position:0%
that is um those are the questionnaire
 
01:55:46.550 --> 01:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
so one the one we chose was the
 
01:55:48.390 --> 01:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
employment questionnaire so that's
 
01:55:50.790 --> 01:55:50.800 align:start position:0%
something that a potential
 
01:55:53.109 --> 01:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
claimant would complete and it's
 
01:55:55.830 --> 01:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
confidential and they can fill out what
 
01:55:57.350 --> 01:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
has happened to them
 
01:55:59.830 --> 01:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
and then that starts the intake process
 
01:56:03.270 --> 01:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
i believe right behind that
 
01:56:05.830 --> 01:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
i think it i think it might be the form
 
01:56:08.629 --> 01:56:08.639 align:start position:0%
five which is the eeoc's form
 
01:56:10.790 --> 01:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
where that is what we use in terms of
 
01:56:12.709 --> 01:56:12.719 align:start position:0%
employment for a formalized charge of
 
01:56:15.270 --> 01:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
discrimination and then that goes to
 
01:56:18.470 --> 01:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
both parties behind that
 
01:56:21.510 --> 01:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
is an intake tool kit so what we're
 
01:56:24.550 --> 01:56:24.560 align:start position:0%
working towards is having complainants
 
01:56:26.790 --> 01:56:26.800 align:start position:0%
complete their own charges putting all
 
01:56:29.990 --> 01:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
their information together and that
 
01:56:33.030 --> 01:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
document will walk the complainant
 
01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:34.229 align:start position:0%
document will walk the complainant
through

01:56:34.229 --> 01:56:34.239 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:56:36.790 --> 01:56:36.800 align:start position:0%
all of the elements and how to complete
 
01:56:39.510 --> 01:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
that charge and then the last document
 
01:56:41.510 --> 01:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
should be i think it's two pages it's a
 
01:56:44.790 --> 01:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
damages worksheet to help the person who
 
01:56:46.550 --> 01:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
and these are for people well anyone
 
01:56:48.629 --> 01:56:48.639 align:start position:0%
would have access to it but specifically
 
01:56:50.790 --> 01:56:50.800 align:start position:0%
for people who are not represented
 
01:56:52.950 --> 01:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
and the damages worksheet helps them to
 
01:56:52.960 --> 01:56:54.149 align:start position:0%
and the damages worksheet helps them to
understand

01:56:54.149 --> 01:56:54.159 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:56:56.390 --> 01:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
what their the monetary relief that
 
01:56:59.830 --> 01:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
they're asking for how to compute how to
 
01:57:03.189 --> 01:57:03.199 align:start position:0%
computate that and and what uh giving
 
01:57:05.750 --> 01:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
examples and and how to figure out what
 
01:57:08.310 --> 01:57:08.320 align:start position:0%
they would want to ask for in damages
 
01:57:10.229 --> 01:57:10.239 align:start position:0%
since we don't represent either party
 
01:57:12.149 --> 01:57:12.159 align:start position:0%
and we cannot give legal advice
 
01:57:14.229 --> 01:57:14.239 align:start position:0%
especially for the person who is pro se
 
01:57:16.950 --> 01:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
or not represented this is our way of
 
01:57:19.669 --> 01:57:19.679 align:start position:0%
being able to assist but not provide
 
01:57:21.589 --> 01:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
legal advice so i just wanted to put
 
01:57:24.390 --> 01:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
that out there you have those and
 
01:57:26.229 --> 01:57:26.239 align:start position:0%
obviously my business card is in there
 
01:57:28.149 --> 01:57:28.159 align:start position:0%
that's my direct dial i think most of
 
01:57:29.750 --> 01:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
you have my cell phone number so please
 
01:59:07.109 --> 01:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:09.030 --> 01:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
all right so then this meeting is
 
02:00:24.149 --> 02:00:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:59.830 --> 02:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:59.840 --> 02:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
you
