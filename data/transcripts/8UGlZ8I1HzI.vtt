William the bill I bring in front of you
 
00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:46.599 align:start position:0%
this after or this morning um I would
 
00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:48.439 align:start position:0%
ask that you would give me a little bit
 
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 align:start position:0%
of a professional courtesy here this is
 
00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
not my wheelhouse and I wrote this for a
 
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 align:start position:0%
constituent I I talked with many people
 
00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
and I know it's a little bit
 
00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.910 align:start position:0%
and I know it's a little bit
controversial

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
controversial
 
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
um and when I agreed to bring this bill
 
00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 align:start position:0%
forward I was very very clear with my
 
00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 align:start position:0%
constituent that I'm in the criminal
 
00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 align:start position:0%
justice committee and I know absolutely
 
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 align:start position:0%
nothing about medical care of any sort I
 
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 align:start position:0%
don't even do lose teeth and when I let
 
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
him know that I would expect him to show
 
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
up and testify with me and help me you
 
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 align:start position:0%
know with the the questioning of the
 
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
bill and exactly how this is going to to
 
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
be implemented I was given his word that
 
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
here he knows it's 9:30 a.m. not 9:30
 
00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:42.759 align:start position:0%
p.m. right right so when I let him know
 
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 align:start position:0%
that you know we were up on Wednesday
 
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
morning I got the text back that said oh
 
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
my gosh I'm so sorry I have a feeling I
 
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
might be too um that his work schedule
 
00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 align:start position:0%
has changed and unfortunately he will
 
00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 align:start position:0%
not be able to come help me with the
 
00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 align:start position:0%
bill so with that being said I I'm
 
00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
fortunate enough to have uh our
 
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
colleague representative PR as a
 
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor who is a professional
 
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 align:start position:0%
paramedic and he has helped me with the
 
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 align:start position:0%
bill and he is also not able to be here
 
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 align:start position:0%
um just yet but he is coming so I would
 
00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
ask when he does arrive um if you do
 
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
need to recess if you're finished when
 
00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:25.759 align:start position:0%
he arrives if you could uh kindly maybe
 
00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 align:start position:0%
reopen the hearing to let him really dig
 
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
in on on how this bill would be
 
00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:33.759 align:start position:0%
implemented I would just ask that sure
 
00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:35.230 align:start position:0%
implemented I would just ask that sure
okay

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 align:start position:0%
so the fire chief in my town came to me
 
00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:40.199 align:start position:0%
and this was a this was a situation that
 
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 align:start position:0%
he's brought to my attention many many
 
00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:46.039 align:start position:0%
times and he kept on telling me how
 
00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
during covid there were was basically an
 
00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:53.319 align:start position:0%
emergency order that allowed a paramedic
 
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
to still go to a home and have one
 
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
person be the medical provider and one
 
00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:01.039 align:start position:0%
person be the dver driver my
 
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
understanding is as it as a law is that
 
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 align:start position:0%
both people in the the rig if you will
 
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
have to be certified EMT so during covid
 
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
um they had this emergency order and it
 
00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 align:start position:0%
was just a little bit easier for people
 
00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:19.639 align:start position:0%
to be able to get the calls you're
 
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
allowed to have one person Drive you're
 
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
allowed to have one person care for the
 
00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
patient and then that went away the
 
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
problem is the Staffing is still an
 
00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:32.840 align:start position:0%
issue that that issue has not gone away
 
00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
but the emergency order that was
 
00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:37.759 align:start position:0%
allowing departments to be able to go
 
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
and still give care if needed that went
 
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
away so what I did is I I reached out to
 
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
several people that I know that are in
 
00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:48.759 align:start position:0%
the house that you know are firefighters
 
00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:53.800 align:start position:0%
and EMTs a couple of them one of them
 
00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:56.840 align:start position:0%
um is works over in a larger City and he
 
00:06:59.670 --> 00:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
said to me roads that never happened
 
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
that never that never took place there's
 
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
always two sets of eyes on the patient
 
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
always always always said well I I
 
00:07:07.309 --> 00:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
respectfully disagree because I've
 
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
talked to maybe 15 people and they're
 
00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
all telling me that they absolutely took
 
00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
advantage of that emergency order and it
 
00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:16.919 align:start position:0%
was very very helpful so what that tells
 
00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
me is in the big city or larger City if
 
00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
you will that's not a problem and that's
 
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
great for you but this is addressing the
 
00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
smaller towns that have volunteer
 
00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
people that are working they don't have
 
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
the Staffing requirements a lot of them
 
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
work full-time jobs some of them are
 
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
only allow are able to volunteer in the
 
00:07:39.869 --> 00:07:39.879 align:start position:0%
morning afternoon evening whatever have
 
00:07:43.869 --> 00:07:43.879 align:start position:0%
you if if the situation was allowed to
 
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
be permanent what was during covid that
 
00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
would take a tremendous strain off of
 
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.080 align:start position:0%
some of these small towns and still
 
00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
allow them to be able to give the care
 
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
that they were able to give during covid
 
00:07:58.869 --> 00:07:58.879 align:start position:0%
so um some of the questions and the
 
00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
concerns I had was well things can turn
 
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:05.240 align:start position:0%
very quickly and go from an okay
 
00:08:07.749 --> 00:08:07.759 align:start position:0%
situation to a bad situation well I I
 
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
would certainly agree with that that is
 
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
where my colleague representative PR
 
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
would be better to answer this my
 
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
understanding is calls come in and their
 
00:08:19.149 --> 00:08:19.159 align:start position:0%
a I believe it's like a through e as far
 
00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
as the you know the level of of the call
 
00:08:24.749 --> 00:08:24.759 align:start position:0%
obviously if you get a call that is on
 
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:27.720 align:start position:0%
more of an very very emergent side this
 
00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:28.879 align:start position:0%
is not going to be able to this is not
 
00:08:30.029 --> 00:08:30.039 align:start position:0%
going to be able to happen you're going
 
00:08:32.829 --> 00:08:32.839 align:start position:0%
to need more people however if
 
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
it's a call that I've you know had to
 
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:38.360 align:start position:0%
make with kidney stone that I can assure
 
00:08:39.709 --> 00:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
you that there was only ever one person
 
00:08:42.029 --> 00:08:42.039 align:start position:0%
that was helping me and one person that
 
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
was driving so after the bill was
 
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
written it was kind of brought up
 
00:08:50.509 --> 00:08:50.519 align:start position:0%
that maybe maybe everybody in the
 
00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:52.360 align:start position:0%
vehicle doesn't have to be certified but
 
00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
perhaps the person that's driving is at
 
00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
least is at least a member of either the
 
00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
fire department or you know part part of
 
00:09:04.269 --> 00:09:04.279 align:start position:0%
that that department if you will so with
 
00:09:06.269 --> 00:09:06.279 align:start position:0%
all that being said there's my
 
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
man um with all that being said what I
 
00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
would ask is when when somebody comes
 
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:15.720 align:start position:0%
into criminal justice and they say to us
 
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
well this is your wheelhouse and you
 
00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
know you guys do whatever you want to do
 
00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
I that that's kind of irksome and I'm
 
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:22.240 align:start position:0%
not going to do that to you I'm not
 
00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
going to say hey this is your bill do
 
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to do what I would ask
 
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
is if you do think that there's Merit
 
00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:29.240 align:start position:0%
here but it's just not workable exactly
 
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
as it is give me the opportunity to fix
 
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
it I'm not asking you to do the work for
 
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
me I'm just asking you to give me the
 
00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do what would need to be
 
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
done to make this be able to be a
 
00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
passable Bill and with that I would ask
 
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
that my uh my colleague representative
 
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
kru can explain the differences between
 
00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
levels of emergency
 
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
calls I thought good morning
 
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:51.240 align:start position:0%
representative Po and I'll also need a
 
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
pink card from you after you get
 
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
situated in after your testimony
 
00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:57.320 align:start position:0%
please luckily for
 
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
me anyway so representative Mark PR uh
 
00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:06.959 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 15 which is Manchester w 8
 
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh I'm a firefighter EMT deputy chief in
 
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:13.480 align:start position:0%
the town of eping worked in the city of
 
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
Nashville for 30 years retired as
 
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant would do you need me to tell
 
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
them I thank you I would I would I would
 
00:10:21.949 --> 00:10:21.959 align:start position:0%
like you to explain the difference
 
00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
levels of calls so where this would
 
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
actually be able to be helpful so
 
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:32.680 align:start position:0%
I'll start my little story is that
 
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
getting people to come into the fire and
 
00:10:36.509 --> 00:10:36.519 align:start position:0%
EMS service right
 
00:10:40.069 --> 00:10:40.079 align:start position:0%
now is worse than pulling teeth nobody
 
00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:42.680 align:start position:0%
wants to come to these jobs so from time
 
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
to time we find ourselves very short
 
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
especially of uh EMT or higher
 
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
levels uh and we were able to use during
 
00:10:58.269 --> 00:10:58.279 align:start position:0%
covid a firefighter as a driver of our
 
00:10:58.279 --> 00:10:59.949 align:start position:0%
covid a firefighter as a driver of our
ambulance

00:10:59.949 --> 00:10:59.959 align:start position:0%
ambulance
 
00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:01.720 align:start position:0%
which helped us
 
00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
greatly and when that
 
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
stopped we have trouble Manning uh two
 
00:11:12.509 --> 00:11:12.519 align:start position:0%
people two EMS people in the truck from
 
00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
time to time doesn't happen all the time
 
00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:18.200 align:start position:0%
uh sometimes we have two calls back to
 
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
back because we try to have at least one
 
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.629 align:start position:0%
back because we try to have at least one
full

00:11:22.629 --> 00:11:22.639 align:start position:0%
full
 
00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:25.839 align:start position:0%
crew uh and we can usually have a a
 
00:11:25.839 --> 00:11:26.870 align:start position:0%
crew uh and we can usually have a a
third

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
third
 
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
one but that fourth person is tough if
 
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:32.200 align:start position:0%
you're pushing out a second ambulance
 
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
it's tough to get two EMS people but we
 
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
may have a firefighter that can drive
 
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
for us and that's all that we're looking
 
00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:42.959 align:start position:0%
for is that ability it's not the
 
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
something that we're going to strive to
 
00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
use we don't want to put one EMS and one
 
00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.350 align:start position:0%
use we don't want to put one EMS and one
firefighter

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:50.360 align:start position:0%
firefighter
 
00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
driver unless it's absolutely
 
00:11:56.829 --> 00:11:56.839 align:start position:0%
necessary but we want that option so we
 
00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
can continue that care we can get that
 
00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:01.720 align:start position:0%
person to the hospital in timely fashion
 
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:03.560 align:start position:0%
so they can get that higher level of
 
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
care right and uh the level of calls go
 
00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
from oh I stub my toe in the
 
00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
dark to Cardiac
 
00:12:20.189 --> 00:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
Arrest right usually with Cardiac Arrest
 
00:12:23.189 --> 00:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
we have ALS coming um which is an
 
00:12:25.949 --> 00:12:25.959 align:start position:0%
intercept truck in my area a lot of
 
00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:29.320 align:start position:0%
people don't have that extra piece right
 
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
so if I have two EMS people I want both
 
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
of them in the back and maybe that
 
00:12:37.189 --> 00:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
firefighter can drive the two EMTs to
 
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
the hospital while they're working the
 
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
code so we're just looking for some
 
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:46.720 align:start position:0%
flexibility to be able to to keep things
 
00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.870 align:start position:0%
flexibility to be able to to keep things
moving

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
moving
 
00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:50.600 align:start position:0%
forward um because if we don't get that
 
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
person we are now calling a mutual Aid
 
00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
ambulance hopefully they're not tied up
 
00:13:00.069 --> 00:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
because I'm going to tell you
 
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
they' been in the fire service for a
 
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
very long time we used to have a lot of
 
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
fires we don't have a lot of fires we
 
00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:11.839 align:start position:0%
have a lot of medical calls more and
 
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
more and more as this population gets
 
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
older uh sometimes they seem to be
 
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.550 align:start position:0%
older uh sometimes they seem to be
getting

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
sicker and I don't like to call it abuse
 
00:13:27.189 --> 00:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
but we get called a lot of times when
 
00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
somebody probably could have drove thems
 
00:13:29.949 --> 00:13:29.959 align:start position:0%
to the hospital hospital or had somebody
 
00:13:32.189 --> 00:13:32.199 align:start position:0%
driving themselves so that's tying up
 
00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
that primary ambulance and and I'm
 
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:38.680 align:start position:0%
usually the third guy as the deputy
 
00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
chief and I just sit there and Shake
 
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
because I know the really bad Call's
 
00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:46.600 align:start position:0%
coming it always happens as a second
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
call not always but so if we can get out
 
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
the door with two people we can keep
 
00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:55.839 align:start position:0%
moving right we can load that patient we
 
00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
can get him in the ambulance start
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
treatment and if we're lucky alss can
 
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
meet us and I get an extra set of hands
 
00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:05.480 align:start position:0%
in the back um but if not we're at least
 
00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:07.399 align:start position:0%
moving the patient to the hospital in a
 
00:14:07.399 --> 00:14:08.870 align:start position:0%
moving the patient to the hospital in a
timely

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
timely
 
00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:10.959 align:start position:0%
fashion and with that I'll take
 
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
questions if you have them right any
 
00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.269 align:start position:0%
questions if you have them right any
representative

00:14:14.269 --> 00:14:14.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:14:16.509 --> 00:14:16.519 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you very much and thank you
 
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:20.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um my questions
 
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:21.560 align:start position:0%
have to do with the choices in the
 
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
Bill's drafting because I don't know
 
00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:26.680 align:start position:0%
about the underlying ruem but I notice
 
00:14:29.949 --> 00:14:29.959 align:start position:0%
that the choice was made to put this in
 
00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
the rulle making section of the statute
 
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
so what it's doing is putting a limit on
 
00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
the rule making authority of the
 
00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:45.519 align:start position:0%
department so that um they can't require
 
00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
more than one emergency person and so I
 
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
was wondering if you guys could direct
 
00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:56.440 align:start position:0%
me to or perhaps email me links to the
 
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
underlying rules so we could take a look
 
00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
at that
 
00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
secondarily would you want to specify
 
00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:08.959 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't specify here and I
 
00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:11.240 align:start position:0%
don't know what's in the rules that the
 
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
driver must at a minimum be have
 
00:15:17.069 --> 00:15:17.079 align:start position:0%
firefighter training rather than uh just
 
00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
whoever they pulled in off the street
 
00:15:20.949 --> 00:15:20.959 align:start position:0%
that morning so I can assure you if they
 
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
don't belong to a department they're not
 
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
driving an ambulance they're not driving
 
00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:28.120 align:start position:0%
anything okay so insurance and stuff
 
00:15:30.309 --> 00:15:30.319 align:start position:0%
like that takes care of all that oh yeah
 
00:15:33.069 --> 00:15:33.079 align:start position:0%
and and our rules our guidelines our
 
00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:35.240 align:start position:0%
Sops if you're not a member of the
 
00:15:39.629 --> 00:15:39.639 align:start position:0%
department or a department that we know
 
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
you don't get behind the wheel of my
 
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
truck okay thank you that's a
 
00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
reassurance Mr chairman if I may just
 
00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:47.560 align:start position:0%
add sure something to representative
 
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you for the question when I
 
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
when this was drafted as I mentioned
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
when I was you know trying to introduce
 
00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.269 align:start position:0%
when I was you know trying to introduce
the

00:15:55.269 --> 00:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:15:58.189 --> 00:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
bill when when the fire chief kept
 
00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
explaining this to me I was able to find
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
out through all the questions I was
 
00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
saying that I was asking that it indeed
 
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
was a rule that was temporarily
 
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
suspended and that is why I am trying to
 
00:16:11.189 --> 00:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
change that rule to make that permanent
 
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
so that's one thing um
 
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
additionally that's um also when I had
 
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned that after that it was drafted
 
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
is when the terminology about somebody
 
00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
that's at least within the department be
 
00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
the driver and I would very I would
 
00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
happily add that in here to to make that
 
00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:31.480 align:start position:0%
be permanent but that's where I was
 
00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
asking about giving me the opportunity
 
00:16:34.309 --> 00:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
to change that if it's even something
 
00:16:35.749 --> 00:16:35.759 align:start position:0%
that you're willing to have a discussion
 
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
about that that wouldn't be a problem
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
having the assurance that and I I'm sure
 
00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
that the practice is probably Universal
 
00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
because of all of those things that I
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
hadn't thought of when I asked the
 
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
question but thank you thank you
 
00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.069 align:start position:0%
question but thank you thank you
representative

00:16:50.069 --> 00:16:50.079 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:16:52.509 --> 00:16:52.519 align:start position:0%
lontine thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and maybe I'm not
 
00:16:57.509 --> 00:16:57.519 align:start position:0%
really understanding this well but it
 
00:16:59.670 --> 00:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
seems to me
 
00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
that your this language is saying um you
 
00:17:05.909 --> 00:17:05.919 align:start position:0%
must have only one person not more than
 
00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:08.799 align:start position:0%
that when it seems like you're as what
 
00:17:12.669 --> 00:17:12.679 align:start position:0%
you really want is to say the rules you
 
00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:15.880 align:start position:0%
may only have one person in the back
 
00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
like it it seems like it's really
 
00:17:21.909 --> 00:17:21.919 align:start position:0%
limiting uh it to say only one person
 
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
you I not no I don't I don't I can
 
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
assure you if we need more than one
 
00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
person we're putting more than one
 
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
person in the back well it says provided
 
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
that not more than one emergency medical
 
00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:37.160 align:start position:0%
care provider shall be required so
 
00:17:38.909 --> 00:17:38.919 align:start position:0%
that's should be required right so we
 
00:17:41.909 --> 00:17:41.919 align:start position:0%
can run with only one medical person and
 
00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:44.440 align:start position:0%
that firefighter driver yeah that's what
 
00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
that's telling
 
00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
me that you only need one medical person
 
00:17:52.909 --> 00:17:52.919 align:start position:0%
the other person can be that and it's
 
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
going to be the firefighter driver okay
 
00:17:58.669 --> 00:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
um can I just have one other follow up
 
00:17:58.679 --> 00:17:59.430 align:start position:0%
um can I just have one other follow up
yeah

00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
and um this may be not quite relevant
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
but you brought up the calls where you
 
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
feel like many of them are
 
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and and maybe
 
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
unnecessary um in my
 
00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
observations with ambulances I often see
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
a a call that over something um that
 
00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
does not seem critically urgent like
 
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
someone spraining their ankle while
 
00:18:29.149 --> 00:18:29.159 align:start position:0%
they're running or um and then but the
 
00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:31.640 align:start position:0%
fire Tru is shows up
 
00:18:33.789 --> 00:18:33.799 align:start position:0%
automatically um which seems like a
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
waste of resources and is there a way
 
00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
that that can be addressed in rule
 
00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
making so they come from
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
Manpower because we trying to avoid
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
injuries that person on the ground might
 
00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
be 300 plus pounds so two people trying
 
00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:55.880 align:start position:0%
to lift that especially if they're in an
 
00:18:59.350 --> 00:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
awkward position or something uh we want
 
00:19:02.909 --> 00:19:02.919 align:start position:0%
the manpower to do it safely not only
 
00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
for us but for the patient right so like
 
00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
in my in my town we use what we call the
 
00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:13.240 align:start position:0%
utility it's the pickup truck so the
 
00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:16.520 align:start position:0%
third person comes in the pickup truck
 
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
so that way because if we put all three
 
00:19:20.669 --> 00:19:20.679 align:start position:0%
people in the in the ambulance at that
 
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
time if there's a second call all three
 
00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:26.799 align:start position:0%
people are at the hospital so uh one
 
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
person's out and we like during the day
 
00:19:33.149 --> 00:19:33.159 align:start position:0%
for my department our administrative
 
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
assistant is a EMT as well so she'll
 
00:19:38.549 --> 00:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
jump in the ambulance with me and we can
 
00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:43.559 align:start position:0%
go but on that call I'm there to assist
 
00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
with lifting and if we need more we'll
 
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
obviously call more help but that's and
 
00:19:51.149 --> 00:19:51.159 align:start position:0%
if it's a a serious medical cuz I'm
 
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
going to tell
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
you what you get dispatched as what the
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
call supposed to be
 
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
I'm going to tell you 70% of the time
 
00:20:05.789 --> 00:20:05.799 align:start position:0%
it's either worse or less right it's
 
00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:08.200 align:start position:0%
never what it is because you're talking
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
to civilians who are kind of panicked
 
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
and and they're like oh my God there's
 
00:20:15.789 --> 00:20:15.799 align:start position:0%
blood everywhere and you get there and
 
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
there's a little cut and maybe a little
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
bit of blood but to them right that's a
 
00:20:21.909 --> 00:20:21.919 align:start position:0%
lot of blood because they don't see
 
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
blood often so and like when I say
 
00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:27.880 align:start position:0%
unnecessary yeah they could have gone by
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
ambulance uh um by car but to them it's
 
00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919 align:start position:0%
it's a big deal I I I understand that
 
00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
and so we take them no matter
 
00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
what presentive
 
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
sir for taking my question so um in in
 
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
terms of assessing risk and just before
 
00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
you got here representative Road said
 
00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes situations can get out of hand
 
00:20:57.029 --> 00:20:57.039 align:start position:0%
and so I think that's kind of why the
 
00:20:58.870 --> 00:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
original rules were there but you you
 
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned that in a situation where
 
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:04.280 align:start position:0%
there isn't a vehicle available because
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
of Staffing or whatever you have to fall
 
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
back onto what you called a mutual Aid
 
00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:11.320 align:start position:0%
vehicle so I was just wondering if you
 
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
could for the committee kind of go
 
00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:15.640 align:start position:0%
through what is that difference between
 
00:21:17.269 --> 00:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
you know the the emergency service
 
00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:19.480 align:start position:0%
vehicle the mutual Aid vehicle and what
 
00:21:21.549 --> 00:21:21.559 align:start position:0%
is the relative risk in both those
 
00:21:21.559 --> 00:21:23.110 align:start position:0%
is the relative risk in both those
situations

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
situations
 
00:21:26.269 --> 00:21:26.279 align:start position:0%
so the mutual Aid vehicle is coming from
 
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
another town oh right
 
00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
so all our resources are tied up we
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
reach out started out in the fire
 
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
service right because some fires get so
 
00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
big that you can't control it with what
 
00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
you have so we have a mutual Aid System
 
00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.110 align:start position:0%
you have so we have a mutual Aid System
right

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:46.120 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
and it's designed that if we need
 
00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
something we'll go to the next town if
 
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
that Town's out we're going to reach to
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
the next one out right so that's a
 
00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:01.039 align:start position:0%
longer time for that ambulance to
 
00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:05.919 align:start position:0%
come right if it's one the town next it
 
00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:07.960 align:start position:0%
may not be too long but if we're
 
00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
reaching Two Towns
 
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
away you could be 15 plus
 
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
minutes and when
 
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
you and if we had that extra person in
 
00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
15 minutes I can be to the
 
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
hospital right
 
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
so somebody and cardiac arrest 15
 
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
minutes on the ground that's a long time
 
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
right if they're severe internal
 
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
bleeding we can't fix that in the street
 
00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
that's a operating room all day long so
 
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
my goal is to get them there as quick as
 
00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
we can to that higher level of care
 
00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:52.799 align:start position:0%
because that gives you the best
 
00:22:55.789 --> 00:22:55.799 align:start position:0%
results thank you representative Weber
 
00:22:58.830 --> 00:22:58.840 align:start position:0%
you had your hand up earlier or I'll
 
00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.390 align:start position:0%
you had your hand up earlier or I'll
representative

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
damus thank you Mr chairman thanks for
 
00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question um just out of
 
00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
curiosity the verbage that was used in
 
00:23:14.029 --> 00:23:14.039 align:start position:0%
the uh rules during covid is the
 
00:23:17.669 --> 00:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
verbiage that you've reintroduced or to
 
00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
reinstate that rule is that the same
 
00:23:23.549 --> 00:23:23.559 align:start position:0%
verbiage thank you for taking the
 
00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
question my I'm sorry thank you for your
 
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:30.440 align:start position:0%
question yes I I was given the exact
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
verbage for the emergency order during
 
00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
covid and I copied and pasted it right
 
00:23:37.679 --> 00:23:39.070 align:start position:0%
covid and I copied and pasted it right
to

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:41.480 align:start position:0%
here follow
 
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
up thank you so in other words it was it
 
00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
worked well and it was
 
00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:52.360 align:start position:0%
adequate if if I may address that uh my
 
00:23:55.549 --> 00:23:55.559 align:start position:0%
understanding is yes and one of the
 
00:23:56.789 --> 00:23:56.799 align:start position:0%
things I was going to say whenever
 
00:23:59.669 --> 00:23:59.679 align:start position:0%
representative PR came in is
 
00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:01.240 align:start position:0%
that during the conversations I was
 
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
having with various professionals that
 
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
do this one of the things that I heard
 
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
was you we can't do that people are
 
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
going to die people are going to die you
 
00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
have to have two sets of eyes on the
 
00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
patient all times okay um I heard that
 
00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
from somebody in my county that told me
 
00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
that and I said well now we have a
 
00:24:18.029 --> 00:24:18.039 align:start position:0%
problem don't we because one when a
 
00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
person's driving their eyes aren't on a
 
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
patient they're driving so that that's
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
not going to fly um
 
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
however something's wrong because if
 
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
this was okay during Co
 
00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
and it's not okay now does that mean
 
00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
that people's lives are worth more or
 
00:24:34.149 --> 00:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
less during Co or they're worth more or
 
00:24:36.669 --> 00:24:36.679 align:start position:0%
less now I mean at the end of the day
 
00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
this this worked during covid and there
 
00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
are departments that would benefit
 
00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
greatly to still be able to have this so
 
00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
I maybe it maybe it was okay then just
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
because it was an emergency I don't know
 
00:24:51.669 --> 00:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
but some towns are still in that
 
00:24:51.679 --> 00:24:53.549 align:start position:0%
but some towns are still in that
emergency

00:24:53.549 --> 00:24:53.559 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
situation representative Lucas I
 
00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
actually have two questions if I could
 
00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
um so uh in a situation where you would
 
00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
have uh a person in the back attending
 
00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
the patient and a driver if things
 
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
really went South you would pull over
 
00:25:14.389 --> 00:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
basically and the driver would go around
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
to the back if uh the patient required
 
00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:19.480 align:start position:0%
resuscitation all of a sudden in the
 
00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
middle of the transport correct so the
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
driver would need to be at least CPR
 
00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
trained most firefighters are at least
 
00:25:28.909 --> 00:25:28.919 align:start position:0%
first aid in C
 
00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:31.880 align:start position:0%
right and then my other question is um
 
00:25:34.269 --> 00:25:34.279 align:start position:0%
since the goal here is flexibility would
 
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
it be better to take the language of
 
00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
limitation out and Define the
 
00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:41.720 align:start position:0%
flexibility of the Staffing that's
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:48.440 align:start position:0%
question thank you for your question I
 
00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:50.799 align:start position:0%
my answer to that would be when I asked
 
00:25:52.269 --> 00:25:52.279 align:start position:0%
to please give me the opportunity to
 
00:25:53.909 --> 00:25:53.919 align:start position:0%
work with the committee and I I will do
 
00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:55.919 align:start position:0%
the work if if that's what it's going to
 
00:25:58.669 --> 00:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
be then if you could I I would do that
 
00:26:01.029 --> 00:26:01.039 align:start position:0%
if that's what needed I don't I don't
 
00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:02.440 align:start position:0%
know how this language needs to look
 
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
exactly that's why I copied exactly what
 
00:26:06.669 --> 00:26:06.679 align:start position:0%
the emergency order was but I I would do
 
00:26:08.269 --> 00:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
what you would need to do if this was
 
00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:09.640 align:start position:0%
going to be able to be passed I would
 
00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:11.720 align:start position:0%
say that it's this will work because it
 
00:26:13.549 --> 00:26:13.559 align:start position:0%
worked during covid it gave us that
 
00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
flexibility of putting a firefighter in
 
00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
the front seat driving um again like I
 
00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
said most of our firefighters are
 
00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
CPR um first aid trained minimum of CPR
 
00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
thank you both yep representative McKay
 
00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:31.960 align:start position:0%
and then representative
 
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr
 
00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:38.840 align:start position:0%
chairman U if I recall correctly I have
 
00:26:41.029 --> 00:26:41.039 align:start position:0%
have been very impressed with your work
 
00:26:41.039 --> 00:26:42.350 align:start position:0%
have been very impressed with your work
with

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:26:46.269 --> 00:26:46.279 align:start position:0%
traumatized uh providers and I think
 
00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
people don't know about that and it's
 
00:26:53.149 --> 00:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
extremely important but the confusion I
 
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
have uh I've had several trips in an
 
00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.470 align:start position:0%
have uh I've had several trips in an
ambulance

00:26:59.470 --> 00:26:59.480 align:start position:0%
ambulance
 
00:27:02.789 --> 00:27:02.799 align:start position:0%
uh and everyone was different from the
 
00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
one before but conquer does a great job
 
00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
the what concerns me is that if a
 
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
emergency medical care provider is not
 
00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:19.880 align:start position:0%
available will the ambulance not go that
 
00:27:23.389 --> 00:27:23.399 align:start position:0%
is correct if there's no certified EMS
 
00:27:26.789 --> 00:27:26.799 align:start position:0%
person the ambulance does not go okay
 
00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.389 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

00:27:30.389 --> 00:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
Weber so I'm just trying to clarify and
 
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:37.240 align:start position:0%
with with an eye to the language uh
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
right now under the rule that we don't
 
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
have in front of us am I correct in
 
00:27:45.149 --> 00:27:45.159 align:start position:0%
thinking that you don't roll unless you
 
00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
have two
 
00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
certified EMS is that right understand
 
00:27:53.789 --> 00:27:53.799 align:start position:0%
yes and no okay
 
00:27:58.149 --> 00:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
so if I'm the third person nobody else
 
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
and second call comes in I'm going to
 
00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
take the ambulance to the scene uhhuh
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
but I'm calling a mutual Aid ambulance
 
00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:08.120 align:start position:0%
at the same time okay got it because I'm
 
00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
bringing my toolbox with me gotcha right
 
00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:14.240 align:start position:0%
so I have all my tools I have my monitor
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
whatever I need so when I get there I
 
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
can I can start treatment and the mutual
 
00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
Aid will then transport so so now I have
 
00:28:25.149 --> 00:28:25.159 align:start position:0%
several more follow-ups so so what you
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
just said says to me that you can go you
 
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
can get there you can treat but until
 
00:28:33.509 --> 00:28:33.519 align:start position:0%
you have a second person you can't put
 
00:28:35.549 --> 00:28:35.559 align:start position:0%
them in the ambulance and take them
 
00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
anywhere is that correct okay so that's
 
00:28:42.789 --> 00:28:42.799 align:start position:0%
that's item number one um item number
 
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
two is if we were to pass this language
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
exactly as it is and as it was under
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
covid my understanding would be that um
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
um it
 
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
says not more than one shall be
 
00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.430 align:start position:0%
says not more than one shall be
required

00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:08.440 align:start position:0%
required
 
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
so the ru making the board with
 
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
rulemaking authority actually has the
 
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
authority to say you don't even have to
 
00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
have one but they're unlikely to do that
 
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
because they're a professional board and
 
00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
Common Sense dictates even to those of
 
00:29:25.669 --> 00:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
us who are not trained that you would
 
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
have to have at least one but they are
 
00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
forbidden to require
 
00:29:37.149 --> 00:29:37.159 align:start position:0%
to is that what this is saying to you
 
00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
yeah correct that's just saying it in in
 
00:29:42.269 --> 00:29:42.279 align:start position:0%
in positive language rather than
 
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
negative language so we could write it
 
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
that only a minimum of one EMS
 
00:29:50.909 --> 00:29:50.919 align:start position:0%
professional is required right and I I'm
 
00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:53.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not looking to actually mess with
 
00:29:56.789 --> 00:29:56.799 align:start position:0%
this it's just little to confusing use
 
00:29:59.430 --> 00:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
their language that was in place for
 
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
covid because we all understood how that
 
00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
worked and it worked really well so we
 
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
figured why I fix it if it's not broken
 
00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
but if you want it changed we are happy
 
00:30:12.029 --> 00:30:12.039 align:start position:0%
to do that okay yep thank you very much
 
00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:14.200 align:start position:0%
that's helpful to me okay representative
 
00:30:15.789 --> 00:30:15.799 align:start position:0%
woods and then representative kessle
 
00:30:17.909 --> 00:30:17.919 align:start position:0%
ring well thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um sometimes
 
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
uh these rules are uh used in places
 
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
that are unintended and so um maybe
 
00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
being a little bit nitpicky um
 
00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
vehicles um does that include
 
00:30:40.269 --> 00:30:40.279 align:start position:0%
helicopters um U um watercraft that are
 
00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:44.440 align:start position:0%
ambulances as well um Regular transport
 
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
planes helicopter versus a plane do that
 
00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
would that then apply as a vehicle or in
 
00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
this setting is it meant that this is
 
00:30:56.909 --> 00:30:56.919 align:start position:0%
basically you know rubber on the road
 
00:30:58.950 --> 00:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
type of vehicle so I'm going to tell you
 
00:31:00.389 --> 00:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
probably rubber on the road because I
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
know aeromedical has their own set of
 
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
rules that are separate from ground
 
00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.909 align:start position:0%
rules that are separate from ground
ambulance

00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
ambulance
 
00:31:11.549 --> 00:31:11.559 align:start position:0%
so there yeah there's no risk of overlap
 
00:31:13.789 --> 00:31:13.799 align:start position:0%
that someone running a want wanting to
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
come into New Hampshire run a helicopter
 
00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:18.200 align:start position:0%
Service uh say well I only can do ah now
 
00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
I can only I'm only required to have one
 
00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
this says driver not pil it yeah so so
 
00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
I'm going to tell they have their own
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
set of rules that are totally different
 
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
from ground ambulance okay right that
 
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
that's a whole and I I don't know what
 
00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
they are but I know they're pretty
 
00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
stringent and uh it's usually a medic
 
00:31:42.389 --> 00:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
and a flight nurse or PA one um under u
 
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
a medical care provider um is there a is
 
00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:50.360 align:start position:0%
that a definition with licensing yes is
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
that u i mean so there's a there's a
 
00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
definition someplace in RSA yep that
 
00:31:58.389 --> 00:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
tells me exactly what that is yep so
 
00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
there's uh different levels of medical
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
care provider but under medical care
 
00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
provider you're either
 
00:32:11.669 --> 00:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
uh EMR EMT Advanced EMT or paramedic and
 
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
those are outlined in RSA thank you yes
 
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
representative kessle ring thank you Mr
 
00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
so looking at this it does specify a lot
 
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
of things about the vehicle specifically
 
00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
so my question for you is is there a
 
00:32:27.549 --> 00:32:27.559 align:start position:0%
specific training that has to be done
 
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
inorder to be able to drive that vehicle
 
00:32:32.269 --> 00:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
that would have to be changed or is that
 
00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:35.080 align:start position:0%
the same okay same right because they're
 
00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:38.120 align:start position:0%
usually driving a big bigger vehicle
 
00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
that's a lot heavier and and is kind of
 
00:32:45.549 --> 00:32:45.559 align:start position:0%
wildly to handle so an ambulance is much
 
00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
easier okay follow up follow up the only
 
00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
reason I ask is because of how the
 
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
statute outlines the different
 
00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
maintenance communication medical
 
00:32:55.149 --> 00:32:55.159 align:start position:0%
equipment safety you know there's a lot
 
00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
of detail to that so there's no
 
00:32:59.110 --> 00:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
difference in the training for that
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
vehicle versus a fir truck nope okay the
 
00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
driving piece is the same thank you any
 
00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.750 align:start position:0%
driving piece is the same thank you any
other

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
questions okay seeing done thank you
 
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr thank you again if you
 
00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:14.200 align:start position:0%
could give us those pink cars that' be
 
00:33:24.549 --> 00:33:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Claudius
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%

Commissioner no that's fine I I
 
00:33:51.909 --> 00:33:51.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:54.509 --> 00:33:54.519 align:start position:0%
need um good morning and thank you for
 
00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:56.440 align:start position:0%
giving me the opportunity to speak with
 
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
you my my name is Claudia Stewart I am a
 
00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
chesher county commissioner a former
 
00:34:06.269 --> 00:34:06.279 align:start position:0%
EMT and the primary caregiver for my
 
00:34:08.109 --> 00:34:08.119 align:start position:0%
mother-in-law while she was dying from
 
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
heart failure I'm here to speak in
 
00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
opposition of House Bill
 
00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:15.919 align:start position:0%
559 I don't know if any of you have been
 
00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
in the back of an ambulance either for
 
00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:22.280 align:start position:0%
yourself or a loved one I have and in
 
00:34:23.869 --> 00:34:23.879 align:start position:0%
that moment of Crisis you want the
 
00:34:25.589 --> 00:34:25.599 align:start position:0%
highest quality of
 
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
care a modern-day ambulance is basically
 
00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
a rolling ER the qualified trained staff
 
00:34:36.149 --> 00:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
perform life-saving tasks and provide
 
00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
critical prehospital care and I'm going
 
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
to say again prehosp care an ambulance
 
00:34:46.109 --> 00:34:46.119 align:start position:0%
is more than a
 
00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:48.440 align:start position:0%
taxi it's not just about getting
 
00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
somebody to the hospital quickly but
 
00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
doing what is necessary to keep them
 
00:34:56.390 --> 00:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
alive while you're transporting
 
00:34:59.310 --> 00:34:59.320 align:start position:0%
them if during a transport additional
 
00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
help is needed and the driver is also an
 
00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
EMT they can pull over get in the back
 
00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
and assist with life-saving
 
00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:11.240 align:start position:0%
care I understand that some Fire EMS
 
00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
departments are struggling with trying
 
00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:18.280 align:start position:0%
to hire trained EMT and might opt to put
 
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
a driver with no medical training in an
 
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
ambulance with an
 
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
EMT but a medically trained EMT is the
 
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:31.320 align:start position:0%
driver is the person when all hands on
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
deck are
 
00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:36.200 align:start position:0%
required can save that
 
00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
life some might suggest that an EMR with
 
00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:42.200 align:start position:0%
a very narrow scope practice is an
 
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
adequate substitute for fully trained
 
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
EMT I would beg to
 
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
differ what would you tell the patient
 
00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:52.280 align:start position:0%
or their family that is put their trust
 
00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:55.400 align:start position:0%
in you to provide quality care and save
 
00:35:57.829 --> 00:35:57.839 align:start position:0%
them or their loved one but you didn't
 
00:35:59.710 --> 00:35:59.720 align:start position:0%
have the appropriate staff person on
 
00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:01.640 align:start position:0%
board to do
 
00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:04.040 align:start position:0%
so our communities are putting their
 
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
faith in us and not hiring qualified
 
00:36:11.589 --> 00:36:11.599 align:start position:0%
train staff is not what they expect from
 
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
us I do not believe that any potential
 
00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:17.800 align:start position:0%
patient would support this bill knowing
 
00:36:19.349 --> 00:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
that it will be themselves or their
 
00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
loved ones at
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
risk I ask that you oppose House Bill
 
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
559 and honor the trust and faith that
 
00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:29.640 align:start position:0%
our people have put in us this bill's
 
00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
intention does not support best
 
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
practices and goes against State and
 
00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:36.589 align:start position:0%
practices and goes against State and
National

00:36:36.589 --> 00:36:36.599 align:start position:0%
National
 
00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
standards okay thank you representative
 
00:36:42.309 --> 00:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
Maser and then representative Weber
 
00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:43.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for my
 
00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:47.960 align:start position:0%
question we heard that um during Co that
 
00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:49.880 align:start position:0%
this was implemented so why would why
 
00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:52.280 align:start position:0%
was it okay during Co and then not now I
 
00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
think there were a lot of things that in
 
00:36:58.670 --> 00:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
an auster situation and in an emergency
 
00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:01.400 align:start position:0%
we permissible I don't necessarily agree
 
00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:03.640 align:start position:0%
with that I think also he was speaking
 
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:07.480 align:start position:0%
from a more urban experience and I am
 
00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
from a very rural area where distances
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
to hospitals is a lot longer and I think
 
00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:16.520 align:start position:0%
having the quality care for that long
 
00:37:18.109 --> 00:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
ride is
 
00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
critical representative
 
00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you and welcome to chesher
 
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
County day at
 
00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:27.560 align:start position:0%
the at the health and human services in
 
00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
elderly Affairs committee um I'm I'm now
 
00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
in the uncomfortable position of having
 
00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
to reconcile two of my uh respected
 
00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
colleagues with opposite views
 
00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
but we heard earlier well and and my
 
00:37:46.349 --> 00:37:46.359 align:start position:0%
problem is I agree with everything that
 
00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:49.640 align:start position:0%
each of you said so
 
00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:58.950 --> 00:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
that the choice is not necessary
 
00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:01.069 align:start position:0%
that the choice is not necessary
between

00:38:01.069 --> 00:38:01.079 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
um one one qualified person or two
 
00:38:06.069 --> 00:38:06.079 align:start position:0%
qualified people
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
but not getting there at
 
00:38:12.589 --> 00:38:12.599 align:start position:0%
all and coming also from chesher County
 
00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
and one of the more rural parts of
 
00:38:16.829 --> 00:38:16.839 align:start position:0%
chesher County
 
00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
um how do you balance the issue of
 
00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:24.040 align:start position:0%
wanting the two people
 
00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely but maybe there two calls
 
00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
that have come in at the same time or
 
00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:29.960 align:start position:0%
three calls that have come in at the
 
00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
same time how do you balance the issue
 
00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:38.440 align:start position:0%
of not being able to render the service
 
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
and having to wait longer to render the
 
00:38:44.829 --> 00:38:44.839 align:start position:0%
service so I live in bring we have an
 
00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:47.560 align:start position:0%
ambulance service that is only staffed
 
00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. if you have
 
00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
a problem outside of that and they can't
 
00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
get some volunteer to come get the
 
00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:00.440 align:start position:0%
ambulance get a an EMT and get to you
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
there's a problem and that's what Mutual
 
00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
Aid is for we call Peterboro we call
 
00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
Fitz Williams we even reach down into
 
00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:12.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that's what a mutual Aid
 
00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:14.720 align:start position:0%
agreement is for there is always an
 
00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get help it may not be
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
directly from our ambulance service but
 
00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
it is there and it's qualified Personnel
 
00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
in the bus that's what we're that is
 
00:39:30.109 --> 00:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative Castle ring
 
00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:33.640 align:start position:0%
and then representative Palazo thank you
 
00:39:34.829 --> 00:39:34.839 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
question so question specifically to the
 
00:39:40.349 --> 00:39:40.359 align:start position:0%
timing that she just uh kind of said
 
00:39:42.589 --> 00:39:42.599 align:start position:0%
with that are would where you live are
 
00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
you comfortable with it taking longer
 
00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:47.800 align:start position:0%
because of the time frame okay so I live
 
00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
personally on a class six road that is
 
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
not Town maintained I own a tractor to
 
00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
plow myself out I live 7 miles from our
 
00:40:00.069 --> 00:40:00.079 align:start position:0%
an in our fire department that's a
 
00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:03.800 align:start position:0%
reality we all live with speed is not
 
00:40:05.349 --> 00:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily what's going to save
 
00:40:08.829 --> 00:40:08.839 align:start position:0%
somebody's life Quality Care is what
 
00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:11.960 align:start position:0%
saves life you can drive a taxi with an
 
00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
injured person quickly but you may be
 
00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
arriving with them dead because you
 
00:40:20.309 --> 00:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
didn't have the skill set necessary to
 
00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
unfolding representative
 
00:40:28.829 --> 00:40:28.839 align:start position:0%
palazov thank you Mr chair uh thank you
 
00:40:32.349 --> 00:40:32.359 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh how often
 
00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
those situations happen when uh the
 
00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
driver uh has to jump back and help is
 
00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
it like one per thousand rights or is it
 
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
one in a million okay if it's you what
 
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
would you
 
00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
like just just asking a question because
 
00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
we're asking our family and our
 
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
constituents to bank on the fact that if
 
00:40:59.069 --> 00:40:59.079 align:start position:0%
they are the person in that ambulance
 
00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
nothing is going to change with their
 
00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:03.349 align:start position:0%
nothing is going to change with their
critical

00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
critical
 
00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:06.280 align:start position:0%
condition on the way to the hospital so
 
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
that 1% could be you your wife your
 
00:41:10.589 --> 00:41:10.599 align:start position:0%
children your
 
00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:13.400 align:start position:0%
mother that's what we're asking people
 
00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
to do is take that
 
00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
chance now my husband was in a serious
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
motorcycle accident and nearly lost his
 
00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
leg I want the most qualified person in
 
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:35.720 align:start position:0%
you anyone
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
else seeing no one else oh sorry
 
00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
representative mlan yeah thank you Mr
 
00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
question so um so you mentioned um
 
00:41:48.829 --> 00:41:48.839 align:start position:0%
because as representative Weber said
 
00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
it's you're you're trying to assess the
 
00:41:56.349 --> 00:41:56.359 align:start position:0%
different levels of risk um so do you
 
00:41:58.950 --> 00:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
find where you have the the situation
 
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
that you have where you only have um an
 
00:42:05.069 --> 00:42:05.079 align:start position:0%
ambulance service that staffs from 6: in
 
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
the morning to 6 at night um do you do
 
00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:11.800 align:start position:0%
you find I just if I understood your
 
00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
testimony correctly so I see your face
 
00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
so maybe I didn't understand quite
 
00:42:17.069 --> 00:42:17.079 align:start position:0%
correctly but anyways your the ambulance
 
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
service that you have available is not
 
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
24 hours correct was my understanding
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
correct and so um if you had this
 
00:42:30.589 --> 00:42:30.599 align:start position:0%
available to you um would would that
 
00:42:33.829 --> 00:42:33.839 align:start position:0%
allow you to be able to have a 24-hour
 
00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:36.440 align:start position:0%
service um because you have more
 
00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
flexibility um or are there other
 
00:42:42.109 --> 00:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
constraints around that um or do you see
 
00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:43.880 align:start position:0%
with the way you are right now in a
 
00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
rural area that being able to even have
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
that service could potentially be in
 
00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:52.720 align:start position:0%
Jeopardy because of the recruiting
 
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
problems that the sponsor talked about
 
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
especially in rural areas so where where
 
00:42:59.710 --> 00:42:59.720 align:start position:0%
do you see those challenges in relation
 
00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
bill that's why we have mutual
 
00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:07.160 align:start position:0%
Aid there is a town next door that'll
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
come if they're not available there's a
 
00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
town next door that'll come I don't see
 
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
it as a problem to get an ambulance to
 
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
me what I see as the problem is having
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
the qualified people on the ambulance
 
00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:22.520 align:start position:0%
when it
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
arrives follow
 
00:43:28.589 --> 00:43:28.599 align:start position:0%
up so um so and just just to follow up
 
00:43:31.309 --> 00:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
on that because you are so reliant on
 
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
Mutual Aid um in in the area that you're
 
00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
in um as we get away from Co covid and
 
00:43:40.589 --> 00:43:40.599 align:start position:0%
the recruiting gets higher and higher do
 
00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
you see in your area some towns dropping
 
00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
Ambulance Service all together to flip
 
00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
to Mutual Aid because of Staffing
 
00:43:51.069 --> 00:43:51.079 align:start position:0%
constraints or that has that not been
 
00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
your experience so in our area we do
 
00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
have chesher medical
 
00:43:59.710 --> 00:43:59.720 align:start position:0%
we also have the Cheshire uh
 
00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
EMS which we have contracts with 19
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
towns to either provide direct ambulance
 
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
support or Mutual Aid backup to them yes
 
00:44:11.069 --> 00:44:11.079 align:start position:0%
there are towns that don't have their
 
00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
own ambulance service or it's not
 
00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
full-time they either use the Cheshire
 
00:44:17.349 --> 00:44:17.359 align:start position:0%
ambulance to
 
00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
supplement or they have a mutual Aid I
 
00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
think most towns rural towns rely on
 
00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
Mutual Aid I don't think there are very
 
00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
many rural towns that can
 
00:44:31.589 --> 00:44:31.599 align:start position:0%
24hour a day 7 days a week fully staff
 
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
more than one or two ambulances and at
 
00:44:35.309 --> 00:44:35.319 align:start position:0%
some point if there's a critical
 
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:37.480 align:start position:0%
situation those two ambulances are going
 
00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
to be out and you still will need to
 
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
call on Mutual Aid and I know it's
 
00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:44.200 align:start position:0%
different for more urban environments
 
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
but rural environments do rely more on
 
00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:54.829 --> 00:44:54.839 align:start position:0%
life representative Weber and then
 
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
representative Woods is is it fair to
 
00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:00.280 align:start position:0%
say that in chesher County we have the
 
00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
full range from a professional
 
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
um uh professional firefighters staffed
 
00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:12.680 align:start position:0%
uh Keen fire department that's
 
00:45:16.109 --> 00:45:16.119 align:start position:0%
247 running all the way to any number of
 
00:45:18.589 --> 00:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
towns that don't run an ambulance at all
 
00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
no King doesn't go out that far that's
 
00:45:24.309 --> 00:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
what the chesher um right I'm I'm just
 
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
talking about the different ranges of
 
00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
stuff you have keen which serves itself
 
00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:31.720 align:start position:0%
in the surrounding communities um and
 
00:45:34.069 --> 00:45:34.079 align:start position:0%
then you have chesher EMS and then you
 
00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:35.720 align:start position:0%
have a lot of towns that may have one
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
ambulance or you have towns that have no
 
00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
ambulance and rely on their
 
00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
neighbor yeah representative Woods uh
 
00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:45.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
my question um I'm I'm in complete
 
00:45:50.829 --> 00:45:50.839 align:start position:0%
agreement that we have to have the best
 
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
available upon arrival at any given
 
00:45:58.190 --> 00:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
scene um but at some point would
 
00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
you sort of admit that um someplace
 
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
along the way there may be a severity
 
00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:06.440 align:start position:0%
that regardless of the training of the
 
00:46:07.829 --> 00:46:07.839 align:start position:0%
ambulance but they're not going to be
 
00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
able to provide that life-saving care
 
00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:13.240 align:start position:0%
there there is a limit or I would
 
00:46:18.549 --> 00:46:18.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:20.349 --> 00:46:20.359 align:start position:0%
well is
 
00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
it a driver and an ambulance both
 
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
EMTs I'll give you I'll give give you an
 
00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:31.240 align:start position:0%
example um I'm I'm a I'm a physician and
 
00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:32.680 align:start position:0%
I put in a lot of chest
 
00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:35.720 align:start position:0%
tubes um say you said your husband was
 
00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
in a motorcycle accident if he'd hit a
 
00:46:42.109 --> 00:46:42.119 align:start position:0%
tree and collapsed his chest wall um he
 
00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't survive very long if he unless
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
he had a chest
 
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
tube but I I wouldn't think that any of
 
00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:50.270 align:start position:0%
tube but I I wouldn't think that any of
the

00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
EMTs they're not qualified to do so in
 
00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
other words there is a limit to which we
 
00:46:59.630 --> 00:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
could expect care to be given and I
 
00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
guess my question is where is that limit
 
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
well in that situation whether you had
 
00:47:07.549 --> 00:47:07.559 align:start position:0%
one or two EMTs on that car you would
 
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
still need to have Advanced Medical Care
 
00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
you'd still need the paramedics to come
 
00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
and you'd probably need life support and
 
00:47:17.309 --> 00:47:17.319 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't change whether or not you
 
00:47:19.829 --> 00:47:19.839 align:start position:0%
had one or two people on there that's an
 
00:47:22.549 --> 00:47:22.559 align:start position:0%
extenuating circumstance that of course
 
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
would require um a paramedic or hire
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
but I don't think that
 
00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
speed is always the answer I think
 
00:47:36.589 --> 00:47:36.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
answer anyone
 
00:47:46.589 --> 00:47:46.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
you no one else else has signed up to
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
testify in this bill does anyone else
 
00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
wish to
 
00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:55.000 align:start position:0%
testify seeing no one I'm going to close
 
00:47:58.349 --> 00:47:58.359 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on HB 550 9 our next
 
00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:06.200 align:start position:0%
357 um and would it be appropriate
 
00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:07.720 align:start position:0%
perhaps to go into an executive session

00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:45.520 align:start position:0%

palaza uh yeah yes please uh uh uh yes
 
00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
uh I I'm very
 
00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
uh sympathetic uh uh to the idea of
 
00:50:37.349 --> 00:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
trying uh um low lowering prices or uh
 
00:50:39.549 --> 00:50:39.559 align:start position:0%
in increase uh
 
00:50:44.349 --> 00:50:44.359 align:start position:0%
competition uh but um the were question
 
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
if resolution is a right vehicle for
 
00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:53.720 align:start position:0%
this especially like taking uh some uh
 
00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
um judicial uh decision
 
00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
that was made uh relatively long time
 
00:51:06.109 --> 00:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
ago and was not used in this regard or
 
00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
by any other states and uh general idea
 
00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:12.510 align:start position:0%
by any other states and uh general idea
that

00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
often in this legislature and another
 
00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
bodies we
 
00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
actually um create and protect some
 
00:51:26.109 --> 00:51:26.119 align:start position:0%
medical institutions that are basically
 
00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh have of enormous power and could be
 
00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:30.230 align:start position:0%
uh have of enormous power and could be
considered

00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
considered
 
00:51:35.549 --> 00:51:35.559 align:start position:0%
monopolies so uh uh first creating and
 
00:51:37.710 --> 00:51:37.720 align:start position:0%
supporting them and then asking attorney
 
00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
general to go and find them or otherwise
 
00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
I don't think is a appropriate way of
 
00:51:49.789 --> 00:51:49.799 align:start position:0%
action um those are General concern
 
00:51:53.589 --> 00:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
personally me uh I have some additional
 
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
concerns uh uh with uh how antitrust
 
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
laws uh would be applied uh to current
 
00:52:04.829 --> 00:52:04.839 align:start position:0%
medicine uh so for this reason uh I
 
00:52:07.789 --> 00:52:07.799 align:start position:0%
think that this resolution is not ready
 
00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:52:10.789 --> 00:52:10.799 align:start position:0%
adopted thank you representative Weber
 
00:52:12.549 --> 00:52:12.559 align:start position:0%
did you wish to speak to you a second
 
00:52:15.349 --> 00:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
just that I would I would I would Echo
 
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
that I think probably everybody who sits
 
00:52:19.789 --> 00:52:19.799 align:start position:0%
on this committee is very concerned
 
00:52:22.109 --> 00:52:22.119 align:start position:0%
about the price of and and availability
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
of healthcare and that's given for all
 
00:52:26.349 --> 00:52:26.359 align:start position:0%
of us we may have different ideas of
 
00:52:29.549 --> 00:52:29.559 align:start position:0%
what to do about that but um I agree
 
00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
that this bill is not one of them and it
 
00:52:36.109 --> 00:52:36.119 align:start position:0%
antitrust litigation is very complicated
 
00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
very and uses an enormous amount of
 
00:52:44.069 --> 00:52:44.079 align:start position:0%
resources um and so unless you are in it
 
00:52:46.589 --> 00:52:46.599 align:start position:0%
for the long run and are willing and
 
00:52:48.990 --> 00:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
able to devote enormous amount of
 
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
recesses resources it's it's not going
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
to be worth anything and I agree also
 
00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:00.520 align:start position:0%
this is a resolution it doesn't have any
 
00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
force and antitrust litigation in this
 
00:53:09.150 --> 00:53:09.160 align:start position:0%
area is best done on a federal level
 
00:53:11.829 --> 00:53:11.839 align:start position:0%
rather than a state level so for all of
 
00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
those reasons I absolutely
 
00:53:16.789 --> 00:53:16.799 align:start position:0%
concur thank you representative Woods
 
00:53:19.109 --> 00:53:19.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I would agree with
 
00:53:22.510 --> 00:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
everything has said so I'll be brief but
 
00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
um I think and I'm being critical here
 
00:53:28.390 --> 00:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
but um I think to resolve it very poorly
 
00:53:31.349 --> 00:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
worded for the problem that we're facing
 
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
it's not couched in the correct terms
 
00:53:35.829 --> 00:53:35.839 align:start position:0%
and it's not couched in a way that acts
 
00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
to direct it uh for a solution um
 
00:53:41.549 --> 00:53:41.559 align:start position:0%
admittedly there is a tremendous amount
 
00:53:42.910 --> 00:53:42.920 align:start position:0%
of work that it needs to be done with
 
00:53:47.109 --> 00:53:47.119 align:start position:0%
the corporatization of medicine um
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
what's outlined here this is not
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
properly directed and I I'm I I just I I
 
00:53:56.589 --> 00:53:56.599 align:start position:0%
can't support it okay thank you thank
 
00:54:00.349 --> 00:54:00.359 align:start position:0%

Hillsboro County District 32

representing the towns of Wilton Temple
 
01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
and new IP
 
01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
switch uh so house 357 will look
 
01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
familiar to some of you who have served
 
01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
on this committee uh in the last bium uh
 
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
this legislation makes a simple but very
 
01:03:29.029 --> 01:03:29.039 align:start position:0%
important ch change to RSA 141
 
01:03:32.109 --> 01:03:32.119 align:start position:0%
c20a that uh that statute mandates that
 
01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
children in New Hampshire be immunized
 
01:03:36.789 --> 01:03:36.799 align:start position:0%
against specific diseases and those
 
01:03:39.789 --> 01:03:39.799 align:start position:0%
include diptheria MPS pusis polio
 
01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
rubella rubiola and
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
tetanus this bill would not change that
 
01:03:48.589 --> 01:03:48.599 align:start position:0%
uh what it would do is change rulemaking
 
01:03:50.829 --> 01:03:50.839 align:start position:0%
Authority because the same RSA
 
01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
authorizes the Commissioner of Health
 
01:03:54.150 --> 01:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
and Human Services to add other
 
01:03:57.150 --> 01:03:57.160 align:start position:0%
immunizations to the list of mandated
 
01:04:01.109 --> 01:04:01.119 align:start position:0%
vaccines under that provision DHHS has
 
01:04:04.109 --> 01:04:04.119 align:start position:0%
added three more vaccines um and and
 
01:04:05.710 --> 01:04:05.720 align:start position:0%
this was quite some time ago so they
 
01:04:08.309 --> 01:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
have not added any recently
 
01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
um but they've added three more uh
 
01:04:15.309 --> 01:04:15.319 align:start position:0%
vericella Hepatitis B and
 
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
Hib if this bill were to pass it would
 
01:04:20.269 --> 01:04:20.279 align:start position:0%
Sunset those three mandates it would
 
01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
leave them in place until their exp
 
01:04:25.349 --> 01:04:25.359 align:start position:0%
until the expiration date of those rules
 
01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh because because those rules expire
 
01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:29.640 align:start position:0%
after 10 years um their expiration date
 
01:04:32.230 --> 01:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
currently is uh June of
 
01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
2026 um it would also revoke the
 
01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:36.799 align:start position:0%
commissioner's authority to add any new
 
01:04:41.269 --> 01:04:41.279 align:start position:0%
vaccines uh by rule so uh the idea would
 
01:04:45.390 --> 01:04:45.400 align:start position:0%
be that if um if if the legislature
 
01:04:48.829 --> 01:04:48.839 align:start position:0%
chooses to add additional mandates or to
 
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
mandate the three that are currently in
 
01:04:53.269 --> 01:04:53.279 align:start position:0%
rule that would be done by a vote of the
 
01:04:56.470 --> 01:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
people's elected representatives
 
01:04:59.630 --> 01:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
um why is this important um it's
 
01:05:01.710 --> 01:05:01.720 align:start position:0%
important in my view
 
01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
because when we mandate any kind of
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
medical intervention that is an
 
01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily serious ma matter I
 
01:05:12.789 --> 01:05:12.799 align:start position:0%
believe that those kinds of mandates
 
01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
should only only be implemented by The
 
01:05:17.630 --> 01:05:17.640 align:start position:0%
People's elected
 
01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
representatives um we saw a number of
 
01:05:22.029 --> 01:05:22.039 align:start position:0%
attempts to mandate the covid vaccine
 
01:05:25.150 --> 01:05:25.160 align:start position:0%
for example and although we rep
 
01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:27.400 align:start position:0%
repeatedly heard the Mantra safe and
 
01:05:29.549 --> 01:05:29.559 align:start position:0%
effective we now have considerable
 
01:05:31.870 --> 01:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
evidence suggesting that the co shots
 
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
were neither safe nor effective uh that
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
continues to be debated and I am
 
01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
guessing that it will continue be to be
 
01:05:41.829 --> 01:05:41.839 align:start position:0%
debated for some
 
01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:45.839 align:start position:0%
time generally speaking our state is uh
 
01:05:49.269 --> 01:05:49.279 align:start position:0%
is pretty light on vaccine mandates um
 
01:05:51.150 --> 01:05:51.160 align:start position:0%
so the the Commissioner of Health and
 
01:05:52.829 --> 01:05:52.839 align:start position:0%
Human Services has been very very
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
restrained and has not added a lot of
 
01:05:59.349 --> 01:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
vaccines to that list by rule um that is
 
01:06:00.750 --> 01:06:00.760 align:start position:0%
not the case in other states where they
 
01:06:04.230 --> 01:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
have quite a long list um having said
 
01:06:07.269 --> 01:06:07.279 align:start position:0%
that I am still skeptical about some of
 
01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
the vaccines um that are on the list so
 
01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:13.400 align:start position:0%
Hepatitis B for example is an adult
 
01:06:16.630 --> 01:06:16.640 align:start position:0%
lifestyle disease um the argument in
 
01:06:19.789 --> 01:06:19.799 align:start position:0%
favor of vaccinating infants is that the
 
01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
consequences of contracting hepatitis B
 
01:06:26.670 --> 01:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
as a newborn um are quite profound
 
01:06:29.789 --> 01:06:29.799 align:start position:0%
um nevertheless it seems to me that this
 
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
ought to be um the choice of um of
 
01:06:36.589 --> 01:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
parents with the advice and and
 
01:06:39.150 --> 01:06:39.160 align:start position:0%
recommendation of their of their doctor
 
01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
to make that
 
01:06:44.069 --> 01:06:44.079 align:start position:0%
decision um Senator ran Paul uh in a
 
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
heated debate over uh confirmation
 
01:06:49.829 --> 01:06:49.839 align:start position:0%
hearings uh recently in the Senate um
 
01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
questioned this this specific issue
 
01:06:55.789 --> 01:06:55.799 align:start position:0%
questioned the the the timing of the Hep
 
01:06:55.799 --> 01:06:56.670 align:start position:0%
questioned the the the timing of the Hep
B

01:06:56.670 --> 01:06:56.680 align:start position:0%
B
 
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
vaccine um and so so I'm actually going
 
01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
to read his his quote it's a it's a it
 
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
it was sort of spoken so it's a little
 
01:07:09.789 --> 01:07:09.799 align:start position:0%
bit um you know it it's a little bit uh
 
01:07:11.349 --> 01:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
not as fluid as I as I would like it to
 
01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
be but what he said was why do I have to
 
01:07:16.549 --> 01:07:16.559 align:start position:0%
do it as a newborn could I come back in
 
01:07:18.789 --> 01:07:18.799 align:start position:0%
three months or six months so really
 
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's about
 
01:07:21.789 --> 01:07:21.799 align:start position:0%
Choice it's about getting rid of
 
01:07:23.589 --> 01:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
mandates it's about letting people
 
01:07:25.549 --> 01:07:25.559 align:start position:0%
participate but it's also about the
 
01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
government being honest what are the
 
01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
risks and what are the benefits and they
 
01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
haven't been honest about covid because
 
01:07:33.710 --> 01:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
healthy children do not die from covid
 
01:07:35.789 --> 01:07:35.799 align:start position:0%
do not get seriously sick and there's no
 
01:07:37.549 --> 01:07:37.559 align:start position:0%
proof that the vaccine has any medical
 
01:07:40.710 --> 01:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
benefit for healthy children so you know
 
01:07:42.510 --> 01:07:42.520 align:start position:0%
it's notable that Senator ran Paul is
 
01:07:44.430 --> 01:07:44.440 align:start position:0%
also a medical doctor his father was a
 
01:07:47.870 --> 01:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
medical doctor um so he knows uh whereof
 
01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:49.870 align:start position:0%
medical doctor um so he knows uh whereof
he

01:07:49.870 --> 01:07:49.880 align:start position:0%
he
 
01:07:53.230 --> 01:07:53.240 align:start position:0%
speaks his position and my position is
 
01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
that this is a choice that should be
 
01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
made by
 
01:07:59.750 --> 01:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
parents um and that it is not something
 
01:08:04.029 --> 01:08:04.039 align:start position:0%
that should be mandated under rule if we
 
01:08:06.349 --> 01:08:06.359 align:start position:0%
do mandate it that should be done by the
 
01:08:08.349 --> 01:08:08.359 align:start position:0%
people's representative so for me this
 
01:08:11.029 --> 01:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
is a a uh very powerful example of a
 
01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
matter of principle um that when we make
 
01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
a very grave decision like a mandating a
 
01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
medical intervention that that is
 
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
something that the people should have a
 
01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
direct voice in through their
 
01:08:25.709 --> 01:08:25.719 align:start position:0%
representatives so that ends my
 
01:08:27.669 --> 01:08:27.679 align:start position:0%
testimony and I will be happy to take
 
01:08:29.789 --> 01:08:29.799 align:start position:0%
any questions any questions for
 
01:08:33.550 --> 01:08:33.560 align:start position:0%
representative kofo representative
 
01:08:38.309 --> 01:08:38.319 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you uh Mr chair so um so as
 
01:08:39.870 --> 01:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
as you mentioned in your testimony it
 
01:08:43.030 --> 01:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
has been a very long time since we have
 
01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
introduced a new vaccine through rules
 
01:08:48.149 --> 01:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
and you know I I I understand your
 
01:08:50.430 --> 01:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
reservations about the hepatitis B
 
01:08:53.470 --> 01:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine but I do believe it's a safe
 
01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine so um
 
01:08:59.229 --> 01:08:59.239 align:start position:0%
would you be open to a compromise which
 
01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
would say because right now we are in a
 
01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
it's the vaccine debate is very
 
01:09:07.749 --> 01:09:07.759 align:start position:0%
political and there's a lot of it's kind
 
01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
of come to this place for a lot of
 
01:09:11.829 --> 01:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
different reasons but would you be open
 
01:09:15.149 --> 01:09:15.159 align:start position:0%
to basically eliminating the rul making
 
01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
Authority but rolling these existing
 
01:09:20.669 --> 01:09:20.679 align:start position:0%
ones into statute and amending the bill
 
01:09:22.669 --> 01:09:22.679 align:start position:0%
in that way um is that something you
 
01:09:24.990 --> 01:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
would consider I I would not support
 
01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:25.990 align:start position:0%
would consider I I would not support
that

01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:09:27.709 --> 01:09:27.719 align:start position:0%
um I I will tell you honestly I think
 
01:09:29.669 --> 01:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
that vaccine mandates should be a thing
 
01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
of the past and I think many people will
 
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
hear that and will be a bit shocked at
 
01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
hearing that um but but here's why
 
01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
voluntary vaccination rates are
 
01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:42.990 align:start position:0%
voluntary vaccination rates are
extraordinarily

01:09:42.990 --> 01:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily
 
01:09:46.990 --> 01:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
High um I I think that there you know
 
01:09:50.030 --> 01:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
there there are compelling reasons to uh
 
01:09:51.870 --> 01:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
to put this decision into the hands of
 
01:09:54.990 --> 01:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
parents with the advice of their doctors
 
01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:55.950 align:start position:0%
parents with the advice of their doctors
um

01:09:55.950 --> 01:09:55.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:57.790 --> 01:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
this bill does not attempt to roll back
 
01:09:59.870 --> 01:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
any of the ones that are already in
 
01:10:02.669 --> 01:10:02.679 align:start position:0%
statute um I just would would like us to
 
01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
not see not see us add any additional
 
01:10:08.110 --> 01:10:08.120 align:start position:0%
ones to statute given the very very high
 
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
rate of voluntary
 
01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
vaccination I I I just don't see a
 
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
purpose for for adding those into into
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
statute other questions representative
 
01:10:24.149 --> 01:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
lamon thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:28.840 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering about the scenario
 
01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
where uh suddenly we do have an outbreak
 
01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
of something that's potentially very
 
01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:36.910 align:start position:0%
of something that's potentially very
dangerous

01:10:36.910 --> 01:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
MH and now in
 
01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
order for DHHS to address it if the only
 
01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
way that we could
 
01:10:51.310 --> 01:10:51.320 align:start position:0%
Implement um a vaccine mandate to
 
01:10:54.510 --> 01:10:54.520 align:start position:0%
address the problem is by going through
 
01:10:56.550 --> 01:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh the state legislature that's going to
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
add a significant delay to that do you
 
01:11:04.990 --> 01:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
have any any concern about that so thank
 
01:11:07.390 --> 01:11:07.400 align:start position:0%
you for the question I would first say
 
01:11:09.870 --> 01:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
that the rulemaking process itself is
 
01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
not a rapid process so so that takes
 
01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
time um the legislature by all means can
 
01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
meet um can you know the speaker can
 
01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
call the legislature into session at any
 
01:11:26.669 --> 01:11:26.679 align:start position:0%
time if there is truly a pressing need I
 
01:11:27.870 --> 01:11:27.880 align:start position:0%
would also say that there are other
 
01:11:30.149 --> 01:11:30.159 align:start position:0%
tools at the disposal of the
 
01:11:31.149 --> 01:11:31.159 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Health and Human
 
01:11:31.159 --> 01:11:32.669 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Health and Human
Services

01:11:32.669 --> 01:11:32.679 align:start position:0%
Services
 
01:11:38.110 --> 01:11:38.120 align:start position:0%
um for example um if there is if if if
 
01:11:39.310 --> 01:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
there were an
 
01:11:45.070 --> 01:11:45.080 align:start position:0%
outbreak um State Statute does permit
 
01:11:48.590 --> 01:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
um the the commissioner to declare that
 
01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
that students and children and child
 
01:11:55.390 --> 01:11:55.400 align:start position:0%
care be excluded from attending their
 
01:11:57.910 --> 01:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
school or Child Care Facility if they
 
01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
are not vaccinated so that's in State
 
01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
Statute that would be a tool that's
 
01:12:06.430 --> 01:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
available to them um so I I think that
 
01:12:11.790 --> 01:12:11.800 align:start position:0%
the um the assertion that uh we need to
 
01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
make this decision for people um is is
 
01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:18.350 align:start position:0%
make this decision for people um is is
simply

01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
simply
 
01:12:23.350 --> 01:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
misplaced other questions representative
 
01:12:25.870 --> 01:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
McGrath thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:28.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:12:32.830 --> 01:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
um are you aware of any children that
 
01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
have died after getting
 
01:12:38.669 --> 01:12:38.679 align:start position:0%
multiple injections all at
 
01:12:42.510 --> 01:12:42.520 align:start position:0%
once thank you for the question um I
 
01:12:44.229 --> 01:12:44.239 align:start position:0%
don't have direct knowledge of that I I
 
01:12:47.550 --> 01:12:47.560 align:start position:0%
hear stories but I it's anecdotal so I'm
 
01:12:50.229 --> 01:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
I'm reluctant to
 
01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm reluctant to raise secondhand
 
01:12:57.149 --> 01:12:57.159 align:start position:0%
or third hand an doal information as as
 
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
part of this but but I I have I've heard
 
01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
people say that I don't have hard
 
01:13:06.070 --> 01:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
evidence of it other
 
01:13:08.590 --> 01:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative elberger is
 
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
it thank you Mr chair I'm trying to
 
01:13:12.990 --> 01:13:13.000 align:start position:0%
formulate this question so please
 
01:13:15.669 --> 01:13:15.679 align:start position:0%
forgive me if I sort of stumble as I get
 
01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
there one of your comments was with
 
01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
regard to covid that healthy children
 
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
didn't get covid if I if I and please
 
01:13:28.830 --> 01:13:28.840 align:start position:0%
tell me if I misinterpret that you did
 
01:13:30.510 --> 01:13:30.520 align:start position:0%
misinterpret it I was quoting Senator
 
01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
ran Paul if if you would like I can
 
01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
reread the quote so we have it exactly
 
01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:37.149 align:start position:0%
reread the quote so we have it exactly
please

01:13:37.149 --> 01:13:37.159 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
um he
 
01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
said healthy children do not die from
 
01:13:44.910 --> 01:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
covid do not get seriously sick and
 
01:13:46.510 --> 01:13:46.520 align:start position:0%
there's no proof that the vaccine has
 
01:13:49.030 --> 01:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
any medical benefit for healthy children
 
01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
okay I'm concerned now because in
 
01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
general people are healthy until they
 
01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
there's a serious outbreak of measles in
 
01:14:03.709 --> 01:14:03.719 align:start position:0%
West Texas at this point we've had a
 
01:14:05.470 --> 01:14:05.480 align:start position:0%
couple at least one death I think maybe
 
01:14:07.870 --> 01:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
two at this point those children were
 
01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
not vaccinated and presumably until they
 
01:14:14.709 --> 01:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
got measles they were healthy
 
01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
children I'm trying to
 
01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:20.950 align:start position:0%
children I'm trying to
understand

01:14:20.950 --> 01:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
what the responsibility of us as
 
01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
individual people
 
01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
is to the people who surround us M if I
 
01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
choose to not vaccinate my child and my
 
01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
child gets sick and infects other
 
01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
children is do I have any ownership of
 
01:14:47.629 --> 01:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
that or is it simply well it just
 
01:14:49.790 --> 01:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
happened I I'm really trying to
 
01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
understand your take on this thank you
 
01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
for the question so it's I'm actually
 
01:14:56.030 --> 01:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
glad you brought brought up the the the
 
01:14:58.149 --> 01:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
measles outbreak because I think there's
 
01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
been a good deal of information that has
 
01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
is um at best
 
01:15:07.110 --> 01:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
misleading um it's worth pointing out
 
01:15:11.149 --> 01:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
that um measles deaths declined 98%
 
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
between 1900 and
 
01:15:18.189 --> 01:15:18.199 align:start position:0%
1963 before there was a vaccine
 
01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
so you know simple steps like improved
 
01:15:25.550 --> 01:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
nutrition improved hygiene brought us a
 
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
98% reduction it's also worth noting
 
01:15:31.229 --> 01:15:31.239 align:start position:0%
that you know in 2025 um in the United
 
01:15:36.189 --> 01:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
States we have 93 cases and of measles
 
01:15:40.189 --> 01:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
and of those 93 cases the CDC lists that
 
01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:42.080 align:start position:0%
95% of them were
 
01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated or unknown vaccination
 
01:15:48.430 --> 01:15:48.440 align:start position:0%
status so when I read something like
 
01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
that it it it it gives me pause why is
 
01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
the CDC putting out statistics that say
 
01:15:57.709 --> 01:15:57.719 align:start position:0%
well 95 % were unvaccinated or unknown
 
01:16:01.629 --> 01:16:01.639 align:start position:0%
status I I would appreciate if
 
01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
institutions like the CDC would offer us
 
01:16:06.590 --> 01:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
information that is
 
01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:08.550 align:start position:0%
information that is
more

01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:16:11.709 --> 01:16:11.719 align:start position:0%
um more more helpful and informative you
 
01:16:13.189 --> 01:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
I think they could just as well have
 
01:16:15.510 --> 01:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
said the percentage that were vaccinated
 
01:16:17.110 --> 01:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
the percentage that were unvaccinated
 
01:16:19.310 --> 01:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
and the percentage that were unknown and
 
01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
yet for some reason they saw it fit to
 
01:16:24.149 --> 01:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
group two of those categories together
 
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
so it's these kinds of of things as as
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
um senator Paul
 
01:16:33.070 --> 01:16:33.080 align:start position:0%
um indicated there there is a there's a
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
sort of skepticism that has developed
 
01:16:37.350 --> 01:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
out there and I think that if we were to
 
01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
put the information out there and let
 
01:16:42.030 --> 01:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
people make decisions for themselves the
 
01:16:44.910 --> 01:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
vast majority of people will continue to
 
01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
have their children vaccinated according
 
01:16:49.270 --> 01:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
to doctor's recommendations that is the
 
01:16:51.149 --> 01:16:51.159 align:start position:0%
case right now and I think that there
 
01:16:52.990 --> 01:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
are probably some people coming after me
 
01:16:54.870 --> 01:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
who can site some of those numbers the
 
01:16:57.430 --> 01:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
numbers I've heard range from um
 
01:16:59.870 --> 01:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the mid '70s to the mid 90s
 
01:17:03.070 --> 01:17:03.080 align:start position:0%
um depending on the vaccine and um the
 
01:17:07.070 --> 01:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
the location under in question um but
 
01:17:08.629 --> 01:17:08.639 align:start position:0%
voluntary vaccination rates are very
 
01:17:11.550 --> 01:17:11.560 align:start position:0%
high um so the the the notion that we
 
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
need to mandate these things I think is
 
01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:15.030 align:start position:0%
need to mandate these things I think is
is

01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:17:17.189 --> 01:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
misplaced uh representative Lucas and
 
01:17:19.030 --> 01:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
then representative mlan thank you Mr
 
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
chair and thanks for taking my question
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
um and I'm uh a retired physician I
 
01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
OBGYN specialist so I will not speak to
 
01:17:32.790 --> 01:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
the data on this because that's not part
 
01:17:36.590 --> 01:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
of my background but uh I was wondering
 
01:17:40.030 --> 01:17:40.040 align:start position:0%
uh be there's a quite a range between 70
 
01:17:43.229 --> 01:17:43.239 align:start position:0%
and 95% vaccination rate voluntary
 
01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
vaccination rate what is the level in
 
01:17:50.590 --> 01:17:50.600 align:start position:0%
which um the population at large is
 
01:17:54.510 --> 01:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
protected when uh a certain level of
 
01:17:57.550 --> 01:17:57.560 align:start position:0%
immune Community is established or maybe
 
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
someone after you can answer that
 
01:18:02.550 --> 01:18:02.560 align:start position:0%
question better um someone after me can
 
01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
probably answer that question better um
 
01:18:09.709 --> 01:18:09.719 align:start position:0%
however I will say that um you know
 
01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:12.440 align:start position:0%
there are studies showing that uh with
 
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
the measles vaccine for example that her
 
01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
immunity is is actually not achievable
 
01:18:20.110 --> 01:18:20.120 align:start position:0%
because of the rate of vaccination
 
01:18:22.870 --> 01:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
failure uh with with the measles vaccine
 
01:18:25.110 --> 01:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
in other words the measles vaccine is
 
01:18:28.110 --> 01:18:28.120 align:start position:0%
not 100% effective in preventing the
 
01:18:31.229 --> 01:18:31.239 align:start position:0%
spread of the disease and I've even seen
 
01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh information indicating that uh people
 
01:18:35.629 --> 01:18:35.639 align:start position:0%
who have had the measles vaccine Can Can
 
01:18:39.910 --> 01:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
Shed the virus for um up to 25 days or
 
01:18:43.990 --> 01:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
or 30 days after receiving the vaccine a
 
01:18:46.470 --> 01:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
followup um and then I was also
 
01:18:48.350 --> 01:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
wondering about the rate of
 
01:18:51.390 --> 01:18:51.400 align:start position:0%
hospitalization for non-fatal cases and
 
01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
how that affects uh Public Health
 
01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:54.990 align:start position:0%
how that affects uh Public Health
expenditure

01:18:54.990 --> 01:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
expenditure
 
01:18:58.870 --> 01:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
um from what I've read um as high as 10%
 
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
of children require hospitalization for
 
01:19:04.590 --> 01:19:04.600 align:start position:0%
measles complications including
 
01:19:07.350 --> 01:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
incilius um is that a
 
01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
concern um I I can't speak to the
 
01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
statistics I don't I don't know what
 
01:19:14.830 --> 01:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
those statistics are but someone coming
 
01:19:16.830 --> 01:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
after me may may have that information
 
01:19:20.229 --> 01:19:20.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:19:25.390 --> 01:19:25.400 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so um
 
01:19:28.110 --> 01:19:28.120 align:start position:0%
we heard in your testimony that um you
 
01:19:30.350 --> 01:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
know the voluntary uh vaccination rates
 
01:19:32.270 --> 01:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
are very high you know it's my
 
01:19:33.550 --> 01:19:33.560 align:start position:0%
understanding though from listening to
 
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
news stories and other sources that that
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
voluntary rate is being eroded a little
 
01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
bit you know due to skepticism uh lack
 
01:19:47.550 --> 01:19:47.560 align:start position:0%
of trust other things so um with this
 
01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
bill um how do you see this bill playing
 
01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
out you know in establishing
 
01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
do you think it moves that trust
 
01:19:59.149 --> 01:19:59.159 align:start position:0%
relationship in any way at all and do
 
01:20:02.950 --> 01:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
you have any data that would maybe show
 
01:20:06.350 --> 01:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
um in in states that basically mandate
 
01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
through Ru making versus states that
 
01:20:10.709 --> 01:20:10.719 align:start position:0%
mandate through statute is there a
 
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
difference in voluntary vaccination
 
01:20:16.229 --> 01:20:16.239 align:start position:0%
rates um or you may not have that data
 
01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
but i'' be interested to know if you did
 
01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
have it just to kind of understand what
 
01:20:22.229 --> 01:20:22.239 align:start position:0%
impact it has on trust and those
 
01:20:24.990 --> 01:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
vaccination rates
 
01:20:27.669 --> 01:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so to the to
 
01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
the second question I don't have
 
01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.270 align:start position:0%
the second question I don't have
state-by-state

01:20:30.270 --> 01:20:30.280 align:start position:0%
state-by-state
 
01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
data as as someone previously noted
 
01:20:34.910 --> 01:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
that's a wide range and it's a wide
 
01:20:37.390 --> 01:20:37.400 align:start position:0%
range because among other things it's
 
01:20:39.750 --> 01:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
describing a multitude of different
 
01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:41.629 align:start position:0%
describing a multitude of different
vaccines

01:20:41.629 --> 01:20:41.639 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
01:20:44.870 --> 01:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
um having said that I I
 
01:20:48.030 --> 01:20:48.040 align:start position:0%
think we are moving toward a healthy
 
01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:49.510 align:start position:0%
think we are moving toward a healthy
debate

01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
debate
 
01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
about vaccination and its proper role in
 
01:20:56.110 --> 01:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
healthcare its proper role in society
 
01:20:58.350 --> 01:20:58.360 align:start position:0%
and the degree to which people um should
 
01:21:00.510 --> 01:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
be afforded the the freedom to make
 
01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:02.030 align:start position:0%
be afforded the the freedom to make
these

01:21:02.030 --> 01:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
decisions with in in the context of an
 
01:21:08.709 --> 01:21:08.719 align:start position:0%
informed discussion with their doctor um
 
01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
so I I guess I see this as you know one
 
01:21:14.590 --> 01:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
one of many measures that is sort of
 
01:21:18.350 --> 01:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
moving us towards a a a Freer and more
 
01:21:21.310 --> 01:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
open debate on the
 
01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
topic other questions
 
01:21:31.310 --> 01:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:34.270 --> 01:21:34.280 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak are Colleen
 
01:21:36.310 --> 01:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
Smith and Dr Benjamin Chan from the
 
01:21:41.149 --> 01:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:43.510 --> 01:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
Services you've asked for Combined total
 
01:22:02.669 --> 01:22:02.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:04.709 --> 01:22:04.719 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Colleen Smith I
 
01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
am the bureau chief for the Bureau of
 
01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
Infectious Disease Control within the
 
01:22:09.189 --> 01:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
division of Public Health services
 
01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
within the Department of Health and
 
01:22:13.110 --> 01:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
Human Services and today I'm joined by
 
01:22:14.830 --> 01:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
Dr Benjamin Chan our state
 
01:22:16.830 --> 01:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
epidemiologist and also an infectious
 
01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
disease physician we are here today to
 
01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
speak in opposition to House Bill 357
 
01:22:25.550 --> 01:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
relative to taking um removing the
 
01:22:27.390 --> 01:22:27.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner's rule making Authority
 
01:22:29.910 --> 01:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
when it comes to child care and school
 
01:22:32.350 --> 01:22:32.360 align:start position:0%
immunization requirements the department
 
01:22:33.870 --> 01:22:33.880 align:start position:0%
believes that the current statute
 
01:22:36.070 --> 01:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
provides a rigorous and conservative
 
01:22:38.510 --> 01:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
approach that PRI prioritizes public
 
01:22:41.189 --> 01:22:41.199 align:start position:0%
input protects parental choice and
 
01:22:43.390 --> 01:22:43.400 align:start position:0%
carefully allows for expediency in times
 
01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
of an emergent threat as was mentioned
 
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
before the commissioner's rulle making
 
01:22:51.350 --> 01:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
Authority allows the commission allows
 
01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
the department to be nimble in the event
 
01:22:56.629 --> 01:22:56.639 align:start position:0%
of a public health response because if a
 
01:22:58.669 --> 01:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
statute change was required to change
 
01:23:00.669 --> 01:23:00.679 align:start position:0%
immunization requirements this could add
 
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
months to a process um the rule making
 
01:23:06.390 --> 01:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
of process does allow public input and
 
01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
as noted the commissioner has taken a
 
01:23:12.709 --> 01:23:12.719 align:start position:0%
very deliberative approach historically
 
01:23:15.229 --> 01:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
the last time a childhood vaccine was
 
01:23:18.189 --> 01:23:18.199 align:start position:0%
added to the childhood and School
 
01:23:22.470 --> 01:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
requirements was 2003 which was
 
01:23:26.669 --> 01:23:26.679 align:start position:0%
vericella also there there is a lot of
 
01:23:28.990 --> 01:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
background in decision-making that the
 
01:23:31.870 --> 01:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
department is immersed in Daily with the
 
01:23:34.149 --> 01:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
expertise required to make
 
01:23:36.629 --> 01:23:36.639 align:start position:0%
recommendations when to add or remove
 
01:23:39.430 --> 01:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
immunization from that schedule um
 
01:23:41.390 --> 01:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
considerations are vaccine safety
 
01:23:43.510 --> 01:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine Effectiveness the severity of
 
01:23:45.070 --> 01:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
the disease and the likelihood of
 
01:23:47.229 --> 01:23:47.239 align:start position:0%
transmission within the child care or
 
01:23:47.239 --> 01:23:48.310 align:start position:0%
transmission within the child care or
School

01:23:48.310 --> 01:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
School
 
01:23:51.189 --> 01:23:51.199 align:start position:0%
setting um also should note that there
 
01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
are processes for exemptions either for
 
01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
for a medical exemption or religious
 
01:23:59.110 --> 01:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:02.030 --> 01:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
allowed and the final point we would
 
01:24:04.750 --> 01:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
like to bring up is that we also have
 
01:24:07.149 --> 01:24:07.159 align:start position:0%
concerns about the removal of vericella
 
01:24:09.790 --> 01:24:09.800 align:start position:0%
hepatitis B and the Hib vaccines from
 
01:24:12.629 --> 01:24:12.639 align:start position:0%
the requirements for child care and
 
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
school um
 
01:24:17.790 --> 01:24:17.800 align:start position:0%
admittance if this bill were to be
 
01:24:19.550 --> 01:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
adopted New Hampshire would be the only
 
01:24:21.229 --> 01:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
state in the nation that does not have a
 
01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
requirement for Vell or Hib for School
 
01:24:25.870 --> 01:24:25.880 align:start position:0%
attendance in only one of three states
 
01:24:29.870 --> 01:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
to require Hepatitis B for for child
 
01:24:31.629 --> 01:24:31.639 align:start position:0%
care or School
 
01:24:34.229 --> 01:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
entry the department for this reason is
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%
opposed to that um we also like to note
 
01:24:39.910 --> 01:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
that we have seen a decrease in the rate
 
01:24:43.430 --> 01:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
of immunization in over the last few
 
01:24:46.270 --> 01:24:46.280 align:start position:0%
over the last few years and this is
 
01:24:47.790 --> 01:24:47.800 align:start position:0%
especially concerning because there are
 
01:24:49.510 --> 01:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
many people that cannot receive
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
vaccinations because they're either too
 
01:24:54.430 --> 01:24:54.440 align:start position:0%
young or they're imuno compromised and
 
01:24:56.709 --> 01:24:56.719 align:start position:0%
and having those around them being
 
01:24:58.950 --> 01:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
immunized allows protection of all of
 
01:25:00.870 --> 01:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
our children families and
 
01:25:03.350 --> 01:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
Community um as was pointed out this
 
01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
bill has been brought forward in 2022
 
01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:07.790 align:start position:0%
bill has been brought forward in 2022
and

01:25:07.790 --> 01:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
2023 and because um and it was
 
01:25:15.229 --> 01:25:15.239 align:start position:0%
deliberated at that time but you know it
 
01:25:17.310 --> 01:25:17.320 align:start position:0%
it was determined that there is a a
 
01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
deliberative approach um again want to
 
01:25:21.550 --> 01:25:21.560 align:start position:0%
emphasize that it it's not something
 
01:25:23.430 --> 01:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
that's commonly done adding or removing
 
01:25:25.550 --> 01:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
vaccines to the schedle schedule and it
 
01:25:28.229 --> 01:25:28.239 align:start position:0%
is important for us to be have that
 
01:25:31.550 --> 01:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
nimbleness not only to include the
 
01:25:34.830 --> 01:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
vaccine themselves as being um required
 
01:25:37.790 --> 01:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
but also to determine dosages which is
 
01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
done through the rule making process so
 
01:25:44.629 --> 01:25:44.639 align:start position:0%
um in in closing we would like to hope
 
01:25:48.270 --> 01:25:48.280 align:start position:0%
that you would find House Bill 357 in
 
01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate and we're happy
 
01:25:51.390 --> 01:25:51.400 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions that you may
 
01:25:54.270 --> 01:25:54.280 align:start position:0%
have thank you any questions
 
01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:55.910 align:start position:0%
have thank you any questions
representative

01:25:55.910 --> 01:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:25:58.990 --> 01:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
Weber I was wondering if you know off
 
01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:00.719 align:start position:0%
your top the top of your head or if you
 
01:26:02.950 --> 01:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
could send them to us if you don't
 
01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
because I certainly don't carry
 
01:26:08.669 --> 01:26:08.679 align:start position:0%
statistics around my head um the uh
 
01:26:12.270 --> 01:26:12.280 align:start position:0%
number of children if any who died of
 
01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
covid uh and the number rate of
 
01:26:18.550 --> 01:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
hospitalization of minors and when I say
 
01:26:21.310 --> 01:26:21.320 align:start position:0%
children I mean persons under the age of
 
01:26:24.109 --> 01:26:24.119 align:start position:0%
18 uh representative Weber State thank
 
01:26:26.030 --> 01:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
you for that question I I don't know
 
01:26:27.870 --> 01:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
that number off the top of my head it's
 
01:26:29.709 --> 01:26:29.719 align:start position:0%
a relatively low number but we can
 
01:26:32.510 --> 01:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
certainly get that to you
 
01:26:36.390 --> 01:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
um I I will say I know that uh covid-19
 
01:26:38.709 --> 01:26:38.719 align:start position:0%
keeps coming up uh the covid-19 vaccine
 
01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
continues to continues to be uh
 
01:26:42.270 --> 01:26:42.280 align:start position:0%
controversial and as we've said in the
 
01:26:45.510 --> 01:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
past uh we have no plans of making the
 
01:26:47.709 --> 01:26:47.719 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccine or the influenza
 
01:26:49.990 --> 01:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine a required vaccine for entry
 
01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
into school or child care agencies uh
 
01:26:54.910 --> 01:26:54.920 align:start position:0%
you know we have never at the department
 
01:26:58.629 --> 01:26:58.639 align:start position:0%
level made the covid-19 vaccine required
 
01:27:01.590 --> 01:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh and we have no plans to do so um but
 
01:27:03.109 --> 01:27:03.119 align:start position:0%
we can certainly get that information to
 
01:27:05.189 --> 01:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
you I will just quickly add that
 
01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
relative to um a prior statement um
 
01:27:11.870 --> 01:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
about the severity of covid-19 in
 
01:27:14.830 --> 01:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
children I I will say that uh you know
 
01:27:18.669 --> 01:27:18.679 align:start position:0%
well uncommon covid-19 has contributed
 
01:27:22.149 --> 01:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh to Pediatric deaths in New Hampshire
 
01:27:24.750 --> 01:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
regionally nationally uh and it does
 
01:27:27.229 --> 01:27:27.239 align:start position:0%
cause severe disease uh people may
 
01:27:30.430 --> 01:27:30.440 align:start position:0%
remember uh multi-stem inflammatory
 
01:27:33.390 --> 01:27:33.400 align:start position:0%
syndrome in children misc which was
 
01:27:35.390 --> 01:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
newly described during the covid-19
 
01:27:38.030 --> 01:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic um and actually the the age
 
01:27:39.709 --> 01:27:39.719 align:start position:0%
group that was affected the most with
 
01:27:41.830 --> 01:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
that syndrome with children 5 to 11
 
01:27:45.189 --> 01:27:45.199 align:start position:0%
years of age um and many of them did not
 
01:27:47.430 --> 01:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
have underlying medical conditions I
 
01:27:48.950 --> 01:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
think the number if I can remember
 
01:27:50.910 --> 01:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
correctly is 50% or more of children
 
01:27:53.310 --> 01:27:53.320 align:start position:0%
with misc do not have um underlying
 
01:27:55.510 --> 01:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
medical conditions so presumably we're
 
01:27:58.629 --> 01:27:58.639 align:start position:0%
healthy children um so with all that
 
01:28:01.270 --> 01:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
said though again we have no plans to
 
01:28:04.910 --> 01:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
make the co9 vaccine a required vaccine
 
01:28:06.669 --> 01:28:06.679 align:start position:0%
um for entry into school or Child Care
 
01:28:10.030 --> 01:28:10.040 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up sure thank you thank
 
01:28:11.950 --> 01:28:11.960 align:start position:0%
you so thank you so much and thank you
 
01:28:15.270 --> 01:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
for taking my followup um do you know
 
01:28:16.750 --> 01:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
off the top of your head what's the
 
01:28:19.590 --> 01:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
number of kids uh
 
01:28:22.669 --> 01:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
currently um suffering from measles in
 
01:28:25.229 --> 01:28:25.239 align:start position:0%
the US
 
01:28:27.950 --> 01:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
um those numbers are uh we could
 
01:28:30.750 --> 01:28:30.760 align:start position:0%
probably quickly pull up on cdc's
 
01:28:33.189 --> 01:28:33.199 align:start position:0%
website um there continue to be
 
01:28:35.350 --> 01:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
outbreaks of measles at a at a national
 
01:28:37.270 --> 01:28:37.280 align:start position:0%
level uh I will say relative to the
 
01:28:39.350 --> 01:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
Texas outbreak I think the last um
 
01:28:40.830 --> 01:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
update was a couple of days ago and
 
01:28:43.870 --> 01:28:43.880 align:start position:0%
there were 159 children with uh
 
01:28:46.430 --> 01:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with measles uh in the Texas
 
01:28:49.790 --> 01:28:49.800 align:start position:0%
outbreak um and about I want to say 13%
 
01:28:52.030 --> 01:28:52.040 align:start position:0%
of those uh had been hospitalized I
 
01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
think this gets to another question that
 
01:28:54.910 --> 01:28:54.920 align:start position:0%
was asked earlier
 
01:28:57.390 --> 01:28:57.400 align:start position:0%
um including uh one one child that died
 
01:29:01.430 --> 01:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
so these vaccine preventable diseases um
 
01:29:03.709 --> 01:29:03.719 align:start position:0%
do cause significant disease and
 
01:29:06.070 --> 01:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
morbidity and sometimes even death in in
 
01:29:08.229 --> 01:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
children and that's the the purpose of
 
01:29:11.149 --> 01:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
vaccines and vaccine requirements um I I
 
01:29:13.030 --> 01:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
will also add that you know we
 
01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:14.639 align:start position:0%
appreciate having you know a healthy
 
01:29:17.590 --> 01:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
debate around um vaccine requirements
 
01:29:19.790 --> 01:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
because there is this tension between
 
01:29:22.350 --> 01:29:22.360 align:start position:0%
protecting the Public's Health which is
 
01:29:24.870 --> 01:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
you know the Department's responsibility
 
01:29:27.109 --> 01:29:27.119 align:start position:0%
uh not just protecting the health of the
 
01:29:29.910 --> 01:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
individual but protecting the health of
 
01:29:32.189 --> 01:29:32.199 align:start position:0%
people in congregate settings like
 
01:29:34.149 --> 01:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
school and childcare agencies and that
 
01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
includes protecting you know children
 
01:29:38.030 --> 01:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
and staff that maybe are imuno
 
01:29:40.189 --> 01:29:40.199 align:start position:0%
compromised or can't get vaccinated for
 
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
some reason and so that's that's part of
 
01:29:45.030 --> 01:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
the the main reason why we have these
 
01:29:47.430 --> 01:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
vaccine requirements is to protect the
 
01:29:49.390 --> 01:29:49.400 align:start position:0%
health of the population in these
 
01:29:50.750 --> 01:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
different settings where we know
 
01:29:52.550 --> 01:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
infectious diseases can spread very very
 
01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:54.510 align:start position:0%
infectious diseases can spread very very
easily

01:29:54.510 --> 01:29:54.520 align:start position:0%
easily
 
01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:56.629 align:start position:0%
easily
representative

01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:29:58.950 --> 01:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
delus thank you Mr
 
01:30:00.910 --> 01:30:00.920 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:02.709 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
question

01:30:02.709 --> 01:30:02.719 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:30:05.629 --> 01:30:05.639 align:start position:0%
um actually I have two but I'll start
 
01:30:09.910 --> 01:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
with this one so you mentioned uh
 
01:30:12.550 --> 01:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
nimbleness and of course that's
 
01:30:15.390 --> 01:30:15.400 align:start position:0%
important but if there's an emergency
 
01:30:17.510 --> 01:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm just using CO as an example
 
01:30:19.790 --> 01:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
because that you know came up and
 
01:30:22.229 --> 01:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
everybody needed to get there whatever
 
01:30:24.990 --> 01:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
they thought they needed um
 
01:30:28.350 --> 01:30:28.360 align:start position:0%
if there's an emergency need for
 
01:30:31.950 --> 01:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
vaccines how can you so I don't know how
 
01:30:34.109 --> 01:30:34.119 align:start position:0%
to put this question to you how can you
 
01:30:36.270 --> 01:30:36.280 align:start position:0%
say whether they're safe or not without
 
01:30:39.109 --> 01:30:39.119 align:start position:0%
like trials and stuff so when as the
 
01:30:41.550 --> 01:30:41.560 align:start position:0%
example our that we all went through
 
01:30:43.470 --> 01:30:43.480 align:start position:0%
when covid came out and the and then the
 
01:30:46.870 --> 01:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
vaccines were fast-tracked in and they
 
01:30:51.510 --> 01:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
became available to to us
 
01:30:55.390 --> 01:30:55.400 align:start position:0%
um you still couldn't say that for sure
 
01:30:57.470 --> 01:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
whether they really were safe and and
 
01:31:01.790 --> 01:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
effective so I I the nimbleness thing is
 
01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
a is a kind of a problem for me on on
 
01:31:07.350 --> 01:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
that and I I'd like an explanation of
 
01:31:08.709 --> 01:31:08.719 align:start position:0%
that and then I have another question
 
01:31:11.709 --> 01:31:11.719 align:start position:0%
but I'll wait for one question at a time
 
01:31:14.109 --> 01:31:14.119 align:start position:0%
um uh thank you again for that question
 
01:31:16.149 --> 01:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
representative it's it's a it's a really
 
01:31:17.510 --> 01:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
um it's a good question and really
 
01:31:19.750 --> 01:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
pertinent to this discussion and I think
 
01:31:22.350 --> 01:31:22.360 align:start position:0%
there's a couple different um points to
 
01:31:24.430 --> 01:31:24.440 align:start position:0%
make um
 
01:31:29.430 --> 01:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
one is that uh no vaccine gets approved
 
01:31:32.189 --> 01:31:32.199 align:start position:0%
or recommended without there being some
 
01:31:33.990 --> 01:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
evidence and science about its safety
 
01:31:36.550 --> 01:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
and efficacy that that includes the
 
01:31:39.870 --> 01:31:39.880 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccine that came out in a very
 
01:31:42.550 --> 01:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
short time frame there were um phase
 
01:31:45.189 --> 01:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
three randomized controlled clinical
 
01:31:49.229 --> 01:31:49.239 align:start position:0%
trials um backing up the um use of those
 
01:31:50.990 --> 01:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
vaccines in the early days of the
 
01:31:53.310 --> 01:31:53.320 align:start position:0%
pandemic both safety data and efficacy
 
01:31:54.430 --> 01:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
data now
 
01:31:56.550 --> 01:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
we can debate uh appropriately debate
 
01:31:58.910 --> 01:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
whether that was sufficient data um but
 
01:32:02.470 --> 01:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
there was Data there um that was showing
 
01:32:04.189 --> 01:32:04.199 align:start position:0%
in the beginning that the vaccines for
 
01:32:08.229 --> 01:32:08.239 align:start position:0%
most people were safe and effective um
 
01:32:11.590 --> 01:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
the the issue became that um as more and
 
01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
more science emerged uh some of uh some
 
01:32:17.550 --> 01:32:17.560 align:start position:0%
of that data changed the efficacy data
 
01:32:19.189 --> 01:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
changed we saw the vaccine efficacy
 
01:32:22.510 --> 01:32:22.520 align:start position:0%
decrease over time um once the vaccine
 
01:32:25.950 --> 01:32:25.960 align:start position:0%
was in use with millions of people very
 
01:32:28.550 --> 01:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
rare complications and side effects uh
 
01:32:30.590 --> 01:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
became more apparent that that you
 
01:32:32.189 --> 01:32:32.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't get from doing any sort of
 
01:32:33.750 --> 01:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
clinical trial you know it takes
 
01:32:35.149 --> 01:32:35.159 align:start position:0%
millions and millions of people being
 
01:32:37.550 --> 01:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
vaccinated to identify um some of these
 
01:32:39.910 --> 01:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
very rare events rare side effects that
 
01:32:42.350 --> 01:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
occasionally happen um but there was
 
01:32:44.350 --> 01:32:44.360 align:start position:0%
Data there in the beginning and as the
 
01:32:46.709 --> 01:32:46.719 align:start position:0%
data emerged over time you know some of
 
01:32:48.950 --> 01:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
the the messaging around vaccines um
 
01:32:51.149 --> 01:32:51.159 align:start position:0%
changed but but this is exactly the
 
01:32:53.070 --> 01:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
reason why you know the department did
 
01:32:55.669 --> 01:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
not jump on on you know requiring a new
 
01:32:57.550 --> 01:32:57.560 align:start position:0%
vaccine when there was still you know
 
01:33:00.310 --> 01:33:00.320 align:start position:0%
limited data um but it's a it's a fair
 
01:33:02.550 --> 01:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
point and a fair question that um you
 
01:33:04.310 --> 01:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
know sometimes with with new vaccines or
 
01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:04.990 align:start position:0%
know sometimes with with new vaccines or
new

01:33:04.990 --> 01:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
new
 
01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
immunizations uh the the the data and
 
01:33:10.629 --> 01:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
the science does occasionally um change
 
01:33:12.189 --> 01:33:12.199 align:start position:0%
over time and I think that that in
 
01:33:15.709 --> 01:33:15.719 align:start position:0%
particular um has caused a decrease in
 
01:33:17.790 --> 01:33:17.800 align:start position:0%
in confidence around vaccines so I I
 
01:33:19.750 --> 01:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question but I do want to
 
01:33:22.350 --> 01:33:22.360 align:start position:0%
um just say that there there is for any
 
01:33:24.550 --> 01:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
vaccine that is is used
 
01:33:26.270 --> 01:33:26.280 align:start position:0%
whether it's approved or under emergency
 
01:33:28.590 --> 01:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
use authorization there is data looking
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
at safety and efficacy but sometimes as
 
01:33:33.870 --> 01:33:33.880 align:start position:0%
the vaccine gets out to millions and
 
01:33:36.350 --> 01:33:36.360 align:start position:0%
millions of people that more data
 
01:33:40.030 --> 01:33:40.040 align:start position:0%
emerges you had another question or yeah
 
01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:42.560 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you Mr chairman
 
01:33:46.590 --> 01:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
um I know that uh representative kofalt
 
01:33:49.109 --> 01:33:49.119 align:start position:0%
also mentioned the fact that that the
 
01:33:51.310 --> 01:33:51.320 align:start position:0%
legislature actually can be nimble as
 
01:33:55.470 --> 01:33:55.480 align:start position:0%
well and um you are you aware that the
 
01:34:00.350 --> 01:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
speaker can call the body back in for a
 
01:34:03.950 --> 01:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
session if necessary and that actually
 
01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
does represent the the people the
 
01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
population of the
 
01:34:12.790 --> 01:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
State uh yes and I would also point out
 
01:34:14.990 --> 01:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
that there is also an emergency Ru
 
01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
making process uh which also speeds up
 
01:34:21.709 --> 01:34:21.719 align:start position:0%
the um the typical delays in um
 
01:34:23.790 --> 01:34:23.800 align:start position:0%
administrative rules and so there is
 
01:34:25.830 --> 01:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
that mechanism as well and so you know I
 
01:34:29.390 --> 01:34:29.400 align:start position:0%
think our our um stance on this is that
 
01:34:32.270 --> 01:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
the the rul making process still is a
 
01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
quicker Pro more rapid process than you
 
01:34:37.669 --> 01:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
know having to call back an entire
 
01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
session of of the legislature I don't
 
01:34:42.430 --> 01:34:42.440 align:start position:0%
know you want to add anything to that I
 
01:34:44.189 --> 01:34:44.199 align:start position:0%
would just add that in the ru making
 
01:34:46.030 --> 01:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
process you could add more detail
 
01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
regarding doses as well it that wouldn't
 
01:34:52.629 --> 01:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
have to be done through a statute change
 
01:34:53.910 --> 01:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
and actually thank thank you for
 
01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
reminding me of that I'm sorry to I
 
01:34:58.109 --> 01:34:58.119 align:start position:0%
don't mean to um go on too long about
 
01:34:59.390 --> 01:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
this point but you know the
 
01:35:01.189 --> 01:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
administrative rules also serve that
 
01:35:03.629 --> 01:35:03.639 align:start position:0%
important purpose that um vaccines
 
01:35:05.669 --> 01:35:05.679 align:start position:0%
differ by the age that you give them the
 
01:35:08.350 --> 01:35:08.360 align:start position:0%
number of doses none of that is captured
 
01:35:11.790 --> 01:35:11.800 align:start position:0%
in the actual legislation RSA 141c the
 
01:35:15.310 --> 01:35:15.320 align:start position:0%
details um to implement the law and the
 
01:35:16.870 --> 01:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
requirements is found in the
 
01:35:19.709 --> 01:35:19.719 align:start position:0%
administrative rules and so I think if
 
01:35:21.310 --> 01:35:21.320 align:start position:0%
you did away with the administrative
 
01:35:23.149 --> 01:35:23.159 align:start position:0%
rules that's going to potentially create
 
01:35:25.510 --> 01:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
some conf confusion about you know so so
 
01:35:27.189 --> 01:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
the measles vaccine is still required
 
01:35:28.629 --> 01:35:28.639 align:start position:0%
what does that mean how many doses of
 
01:35:30.350 --> 01:35:30.360 align:start position:0%
the measles vaccine at what age is it
 
01:35:32.390 --> 01:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
required all those details are found in
 
01:35:37.109 --> 01:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
the administrative rules not RSA
 
01:35:39.229 --> 01:35:39.239 align:start position:0%
141c representative Maser and then
 
01:35:40.590 --> 01:35:40.600 align:start position:0%
representative L
 
01:35:43.030 --> 01:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
montin yes thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:35:44.790 --> 01:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
for taking my question would you believe
 
01:35:47.229 --> 01:35:47.239 align:start position:0%
that this bill pertains to rul making
 
01:35:52.030 --> 01:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:56.430 --> 01:35:56.440 align:start position:0%
vaccines um I I I I think our um take on
 
01:35:58.709 --> 01:35:58.719 align:start position:0%
this legislation is that it pertains to
 
01:36:02.550 --> 01:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
both uh our one of our primary concerns
 
01:36:05.229 --> 01:36:05.239 align:start position:0%
is the rulemaking authority um but the
 
01:36:07.950 --> 01:36:07.960 align:start position:0%
secondary concern is that it it does uh
 
01:36:12.990 --> 01:36:13.000 align:start position:0%
remove uh um vericella Hepatitis B and
 
01:36:15.629 --> 01:36:15.639 align:start position:0%
hemophilus influenza type B or Hib when
 
01:36:19.030 --> 01:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
the rules expire in 2026 so I think it
 
01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
does both but I'm open to correction if
 
01:36:24.229 --> 01:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
that's not the case thanks
 
01:36:25.629 --> 01:36:25.639 align:start position:0%
representative lonan and then
 
01:36:28.669 --> 01:36:28.679 align:start position:0%
representative Palazo thank you Mr chair
 
01:36:32.030 --> 01:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
01:36:35.109 --> 01:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
we have talked about measles quite a bit
 
01:36:36.870 --> 01:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
and if I
 
01:36:39.510 --> 01:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
understand this bill it
 
01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
would not allow measles to be added to
 
01:36:45.270 --> 01:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
the list
 
01:36:49.830 --> 01:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
required um well it's not listed
 
01:36:53.830 --> 01:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
in am I misreading it again is I don't
 
01:36:58.510 --> 01:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
see I see D gyia months Ms huh oh
 
01:37:02.229 --> 01:37:02.239 align:start position:0%
rubella correct okay thank you um but
 
01:37:04.189 --> 01:37:04.199 align:start position:0%
while you're here could you elaborate a
 
01:37:07.750 --> 01:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
little more on what are some of other
 
01:37:09.669 --> 01:37:09.679 align:start position:0%
than death which is tragic but what are
 
01:37:14.070 --> 01:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
some of the other uh serious
 
01:37:16.590 --> 01:37:16.600 align:start position:0%
consequences to
 
01:37:19.550 --> 01:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
um um a measles infection not just for
 
01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
the individual but for an unborn child
 
01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:24.510 align:start position:0%
the individual but for an unborn child
and

01:37:24.510 --> 01:37:24.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
during pregnancy yeah so so I think that
 
01:37:29.229 --> 01:37:29.239 align:start position:0%
with with any number of these um you
 
01:37:31.229 --> 01:37:31.239 align:start position:0%
know diseases there's potentially a
 
01:37:34.149 --> 01:37:34.159 align:start position:0%
range of different uh complications that
 
01:37:37.870 --> 01:37:37.880 align:start position:0%
can happen you know many will have a
 
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
more mild infection and go on to recover
 
01:37:43.350 --> 01:37:43.360 align:start position:0%
but um both healthy and you know
 
01:37:44.990 --> 01:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
children that might have chronic medical
 
01:37:47.550 --> 01:37:47.560 align:start position:0%
conditions are at risk for more serious
 
01:37:50.669 --> 01:37:50.679 align:start position:0%
disease um you know measles uh in
 
01:37:53.669 --> 01:37:53.679 align:start position:0%
particular can cause um issues with
 
01:37:56.950 --> 01:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
infections pneumonias I I I think that
 
01:37:58.629 --> 01:37:58.639 align:start position:0%
that is leading to a number of the
 
01:38:00.510 --> 01:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations for example down in the
 
01:38:02.750 --> 01:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
Texas outbreak um you know respiratory
 
01:38:05.669 --> 01:38:05.679 align:start position:0%
or um lung infections um measles and
 
01:38:07.589 --> 01:38:07.599 align:start position:0%
actually many of these viruses and
 
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
bacteria on the um on the list um can
 
01:38:14.109 --> 01:38:14.119 align:start position:0%
cause central nervous system infections
 
01:38:16.830 --> 01:38:16.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes you know menitis or en sephtis
 
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
those are medical terms for you know
 
01:38:20.629 --> 01:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
infection and inflammation in the brain
 
01:38:24.030 --> 01:38:24.040 align:start position:0%
and spinal cord um you know of these can
 
01:38:26.629 --> 01:38:26.639 align:start position:0%
cause you know congenital abnormalities
 
01:38:30.470 --> 01:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
when a pregnant um mother is infected um
 
01:38:32.390 --> 01:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
so you know it's not just measles but
 
01:38:36.149 --> 01:38:36.159 align:start position:0%
this is the case across um all of these
 
01:38:38.070 --> 01:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
diseases which have required
 
01:38:40.030 --> 01:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
immunizations and is that is that they
 
01:38:43.149 --> 01:38:43.159 align:start position:0%
can cause more serious disease um and we
 
01:38:45.510 --> 01:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
have vaccines that are um highly
 
01:38:48.189 --> 01:38:48.199 align:start position:0%
effective at preventing disease or
 
01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
serious disease and that's that's part
 
01:38:51.470 --> 01:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
of the reason why they're on the
 
01:38:54.350 --> 01:38:54.360 align:start position:0%
required list
 
01:38:57.229 --> 01:38:57.239 align:start position:0%
representative plaz uh thank you Mr
 
01:38:59.350 --> 01:38:59.360 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:39:03.149 --> 01:39:03.159 align:start position:0%
question so from our previous
 
01:39:06.550 --> 01:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
conversations my impression is that uh
 
01:39:10.790 --> 01:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
Department uh uh when it uh relates to
 
01:39:13.109 --> 01:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
treatment protocols or to vaccin
 
01:39:16.669 --> 01:39:16.679 align:start position:0%
specifically is often relies on various
 
01:39:21.470 --> 01:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
uh National medical boards or uh other
 
01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
General Federal guidance so can you
 
01:39:28.990 --> 01:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
describe your staff tasked with vaccine
 
01:39:32.990 --> 01:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
safety and uh side effects and uh to
 
01:39:35.790 --> 01:39:35.800 align:start position:0%
what extent your research of vaccine
 
01:39:39.109 --> 01:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
safety is unique to New Hampshire uh and
 
01:39:42.910 --> 01:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire data uh or is it more like
 
01:39:48.350 --> 01:39:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:51.510 --> 01:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
available um thanks for that question I
 
01:39:53.109 --> 01:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
if I understood correctly it's about
 
01:39:56.030 --> 01:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
that data around vaccine safety for New
 
01:39:58.470 --> 01:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is that
 
01:40:01.430 --> 01:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
correct yeah yeah colen Smith
 
01:40:05.870 --> 01:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
specifically mentioned vaccine safety so
 
01:40:08.350 --> 01:40:08.360 align:start position:0%
I assume that it means that somebody in
 
01:40:11.629 --> 01:40:11.639 align:start position:0%
your department is looking into it but
 
01:40:15.229 --> 01:40:15.239 align:start position:0%
um uh like comparing like how much you
 
01:40:18.589 --> 01:40:18.599 align:start position:0%
rely on federal guidance and what actual
 
01:40:21.629 --> 01:40:21.639 align:start position:0%
research you do in your department in
 
01:40:24.629 --> 01:40:24.639 align:start position:0%
regards to vaccin safety and side
 
01:40:27.430 --> 01:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
effects thank you for clarifying um so
 
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
so I think there's there's two there's
 
01:40:33.030 --> 01:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
two aspects of of data um one are the
 
01:40:36.390 --> 01:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
clinical trials that are done to study
 
01:40:39.270 --> 01:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
vaccine safety and vaccine efficacy
 
01:40:41.070 --> 01:40:41.080 align:start position:0%
those are not studies that are are done
 
01:40:42.870 --> 01:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
for example in in New Hampshire or so
 
01:40:45.030 --> 01:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
you know only in New Hampshire those are
 
01:40:48.870 --> 01:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
those are large Global oftentimes Global
 
01:40:52.270 --> 01:40:52.280 align:start position:0%
um studies that are conducted um and
 
01:40:54.870 --> 01:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
that that is data that we certainly have
 
01:40:56.990 --> 01:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
access to and review and so I think when
 
01:40:58.629 --> 01:40:58.639 align:start position:0%
um Colleen was talking about you know
 
01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
reviewing vaccine safety that that was
 
01:41:02.030 --> 01:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
part of it you know we have access to
 
01:41:04.510 --> 01:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
that data the data that gets published
 
01:41:06.709 --> 01:41:06.719 align:start position:0%
the data that gets um presented before
 
01:41:10.990 --> 01:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
some of these uh National um regulatory
 
01:41:13.589 --> 01:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
groups like the FDA or the advisory
 
01:41:15.270 --> 01:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
committee on immunization practices like
 
01:41:17.830 --> 01:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
that's all public data um sometimes it's
 
01:41:19.350 --> 01:41:19.360 align:start position:0%
presented earlier before some of these
 
01:41:21.629 --> 01:41:21.639 align:start position:0%
groups than we have access to it um and
 
01:41:23.709 --> 01:41:23.719 align:start position:0%
so sometimes we tune into these you know
 
01:41:25.149 --> 01:41:25.159 align:start position:0%
National meetings where some of this
 
01:41:26.750 --> 01:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
data is presented but that's that's
 
01:41:29.390 --> 01:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
National and global data um that is
 
01:41:31.189 --> 01:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
developed through through the scientific
 
01:41:33.870 --> 01:41:33.880 align:start position:0%
process um the other side of this though
 
01:41:37.870 --> 01:41:37.880 align:start position:0%
I think is um monitoring vaccine use um
 
01:41:40.990 --> 01:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
and this gets to the issue of um systems
 
01:41:44.030 --> 01:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
that are set up like Vees uh which I
 
01:41:46.270 --> 01:41:46.280 align:start position:0%
think many of you may be familiar with
 
01:41:49.390 --> 01:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
um the vaccine adverse event Reporting
 
01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
System uh which is a federal system that
 
01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:54.070 align:start position:0%
System uh which is a federal system that
um

01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:56.149 --> 01:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
any any person that gets a vaccine and
 
01:41:58.750 --> 01:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
then has an adverse event um whatever
 
01:42:01.350 --> 01:42:01.360 align:start position:0%
the reason for that um whether or not
 
01:42:03.189 --> 01:42:03.199 align:start position:0%
it's related to the vaccine that was
 
01:42:05.070 --> 01:42:05.080 align:start position:0%
administered can be and does get
 
01:42:08.229 --> 01:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
reported into the ver system um and so
 
01:42:09.910 --> 01:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's where New Hampshire can
 
01:42:12.390 --> 01:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
contribute some of that data um at a
 
01:42:16.430 --> 01:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
state level up into sort of the national
 
01:42:19.350 --> 01:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
um surveillance system for adverse event
 
01:42:22.910 --> 01:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
monitoring um and every state does this
 
01:42:24.950 --> 01:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh and it's actually a requirement of
 
01:42:27.149 --> 01:42:27.159 align:start position:0%
Physicians to report or clinicians not
 
01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
just Physicians but healthcare providers
 
01:42:30.270 --> 01:42:30.280 align:start position:0%
who administer vaccines to report into
 
01:42:33.310 --> 01:42:33.320 align:start position:0%
the system um certain um Adverse Events
 
01:42:35.149 --> 01:42:35.159 align:start position:0%
that happen and and when you get that
 
01:42:38.030 --> 01:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
data at a national level you have more
 
01:42:40.390 --> 01:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
statistical power to be able to assess
 
01:42:42.109 --> 01:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
whether you know rare events May Be
 
01:42:44.109 --> 01:42:44.119 align:start position:0%
occurring and this happened for example
 
01:42:47.790 --> 01:42:47.800 align:start position:0%
during the covid-19 pandemic um when we
 
01:42:49.550 --> 01:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
uh at a national level were able to
 
01:42:52.589 --> 01:42:52.599 align:start position:0%
identify um cases of myocarditis for
 
01:42:55.229 --> 01:42:55.239 align:start position:0%
example that uh were associated with the
 
01:42:58.149 --> 01:42:58.159 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccine um so so these kind of
 
01:43:00.950 --> 01:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
monitoring systems become important uh
 
01:43:03.550 --> 01:43:03.560 align:start position:0%
when vaccines are in use and there's
 
01:43:06.270 --> 01:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
ongoing monitoring of uh vaccine safety
 
01:43:08.310 --> 01:43:08.320 align:start position:0%
through these mechanisms so we don't
 
01:43:10.390 --> 01:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
just rely on the you know pharmaceutical
 
01:43:12.109 --> 01:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
clinical trials that are done we also
 
01:43:13.709 --> 01:43:13.719 align:start position:0%
rely on these National surveillance
 
01:43:16.189 --> 01:43:16.199 align:start position:0%
safety monitoring
 
01:43:19.070 --> 01:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
systems representative Kastle ring thank
 
01:43:21.990 --> 01:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um question for you when it
 
01:43:24.109 --> 01:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
comes to the because I've heard a lot
 
01:43:26.270 --> 01:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
about rule making time frames could you
 
01:43:29.430 --> 01:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
clarify how a new let's say thing would
 
01:43:31.189 --> 01:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
get added to the list or what the
 
01:43:34.390 --> 01:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
processes to get there maybe the time
 
01:43:38.310 --> 01:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
frame so generally rule making can be uh
 
01:43:40.830 --> 01:43:40.840 align:start position:0%
can be about a three to six month
 
01:43:42.950 --> 01:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
process as Dr Chan mentioned earlier
 
01:43:44.709 --> 01:43:44.719 align:start position:0%
there is an emergency rule making
 
01:43:48.149 --> 01:43:48.159 align:start position:0%
process but that there so in those in
 
01:43:50.990 --> 01:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
that month's time frame there is public
 
01:43:53.629 --> 01:43:53.639 align:start position:0%
publishing of the Draft rules there's
 
01:43:56.390 --> 01:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
allow there's allowances for written and
 
01:43:59.790 --> 01:43:59.800 align:start position:0%
a public hearing to take public comment
 
01:44:02.109 --> 01:44:02.119 align:start position:0%
and then ultimately the final proposal
 
01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
is then presented to to Joel car to be
 
01:44:08.990 --> 01:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
voted on and express any concerns or
 
01:44:11.149 --> 01:44:11.159 align:start position:0%
objections at that
 
01:44:15.030 --> 01:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
time follow so then in reference to the
 
01:44:16.270 --> 01:44:16.280 align:start position:0%
the things that are taken out of here
 
01:44:18.350 --> 01:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
that would be sunsetted um I guess the
 
01:44:20.229 --> 01:44:20.239 align:start position:0%
question would be based on that um is
 
01:44:22.350 --> 01:44:22.360 align:start position:0%
there any other states that do not have
 
01:44:24.430 --> 01:44:24.440 align:start position:0%
these listed in their vaccine
 
01:44:26.790 --> 01:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
requirements in the other
 
01:44:29.830 --> 01:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
states so we can get you that data
 
01:44:32.310 --> 01:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
specifically I can as as I mentioned
 
01:44:35.510 --> 01:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
before New Hampshire if if uh vericella
 
01:44:38.470 --> 01:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
was vericella or Hib were taken out of
 
01:44:40.430 --> 01:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
the requirements New Hampshire would be
 
01:44:43.109 --> 01:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
the only state that wouldn't require
 
01:44:46.229 --> 01:44:46.239 align:start position:0%
those representative merer yes thank you
 
01:44:49.390 --> 01:44:49.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um just quick question so I
 
01:44:50.910 --> 01:44:50.920 align:start position:0%
keep hearing about
 
01:44:53.229 --> 01:44:53.239 align:start position:0%
measles correct me if I'm wrong aren't
 
01:44:56.830 --> 01:44:56.840 align:start position:0%
measles and German Measles in
 
01:45:00.189 --> 01:45:00.199 align:start position:0%
statute correct okay thank
 
01:45:00.199 --> 01:45:01.870 align:start position:0%
statute correct okay thank
youor

01:45:01.870 --> 01:45:01.880 align:start position:0%
youor
 
01:45:03.870 --> 01:45:03.880 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:45:06.990 --> 01:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so um you know
 
01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not an antivaxer and obviously I'm
 
01:45:12.189 --> 01:45:12.199 align:start position:0%
very concerned about the fact as you
 
01:45:14.910 --> 01:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned that uh the rate of voluntary
 
01:45:17.629 --> 01:45:17.639 align:start position:0%
vaccination is going down so one of the
 
01:45:21.310 --> 01:45:21.320 align:start position:0%
things that I like about this bill um is
 
01:45:23.790 --> 01:45:23.800 align:start position:0%
that it's very trans arent I think the
 
01:45:26.589 --> 01:45:26.599 align:start position:0%
house is very transparent and so I see
 
01:45:30.430 --> 01:45:30.440 align:start position:0%
it as an opportunity to to build trust
 
01:45:33.229 --> 01:45:33.239 align:start position:0%
and I think that the legislature can be
 
01:45:36.030 --> 01:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
very Nimble and I'm thinking back to
 
01:45:38.109 --> 01:45:38.119 align:start position:0%
Granite Hammer 10 years ago in the
 
01:45:39.950 --> 01:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
middle of the opioid crisis where we
 
01:45:42.950 --> 01:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
called a special session very quickly
 
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
and also it's my understanding that
 
01:45:47.310 --> 01:45:47.320 align:start position:0%
prior to the ru making
 
01:45:49.870 --> 01:45:49.880 align:start position:0%
Authority um everything had to be done
 
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
kind of through the statute because
 
01:45:53.790 --> 01:45:53.800 align:start position:0%
that's what it was before so I guess I
 
01:45:56.390 --> 01:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
just have two questions the first
 
01:45:59.350 --> 01:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
question would be if we were 30 years
 
01:46:03.669 --> 01:46:03.679 align:start position:0%
ago prior to this Ru making and we were
 
01:46:05.629 --> 01:46:05.639 align:start position:0%
on the old mode which I think this is
 
01:46:09.589 --> 01:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
basically what it takes us back to um
 
01:46:12.229 --> 01:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
how would you envision you know a
 
01:46:14.870 --> 01:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
granite Hammer type situation playing
 
01:46:18.109 --> 01:46:18.119 align:start position:0%
out where we we had to move quickly uh
 
01:46:22.589 --> 01:46:22.599 align:start position:0%
on getting something done um and where
 
01:46:25.270 --> 01:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
would you see its adequacies and
 
01:46:28.270 --> 01:46:28.280 align:start position:0%
inadequacies and um the second thing
 
01:46:32.270 --> 01:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
would be um absent this
 
01:46:36.430 --> 01:46:36.440 align:start position:0%
bill what do you see the department
 
01:46:39.589 --> 01:46:39.599 align:start position:0%
being able to do to build that trust
 
01:46:41.310 --> 01:46:41.320 align:start position:0%
because as you mentioned the trajectory
 
01:46:43.310 --> 01:46:43.320 align:start position:0%
is down and I don't see the trajectory
 
01:46:45.669 --> 01:46:45.679 align:start position:0%
going up so I'm just wondering what is
 
01:46:47.830 --> 01:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
the department doing absent something
 
01:46:50.950 --> 01:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
like this to to turn around to get that
 
01:46:53.189 --> 01:46:53.199 align:start position:0%
voluntary vaccination rate up because
 
01:46:55.750 --> 01:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
I'm very concerned about that so I guess
 
01:47:01.070 --> 01:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
thanks so I I I can address I can try to
 
01:47:07.750 --> 01:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
address the F the first part so I I def
 
01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
I I believe that there are Pathways
 
01:47:13.189 --> 01:47:13.199 align:start position:0%
certainly to cause to call an emergency
 
01:47:16.070 --> 01:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
session if um an emergent situation were
 
01:47:18.750 --> 01:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
to develop that required additional vac
 
01:47:20.629 --> 01:47:20.639 align:start position:0%
vaccines or immunizations to be added to
 
01:47:23.390 --> 01:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
the schedule I I think it's possible
 
01:47:27.470 --> 01:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
um to debate I to debate the the the
 
01:47:31.030 --> 01:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
logistics of it versus a rul making
 
01:47:34.669 --> 01:47:34.679 align:start position:0%
process um I I I can't I'm not an expert
 
01:47:36.589 --> 01:47:36.599 align:start position:0%
on on what that would entail um
 
01:47:38.310 --> 01:47:38.320 align:start position:0%
certainly I would I would think it it
 
01:47:41.270 --> 01:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
would be a lot more um it would take a
 
01:47:44.470 --> 01:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
lot more resources to pull together a
 
01:47:46.870 --> 01:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
larger body than than a than a smaller
 
01:47:48.790 --> 01:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
body but to still to have that public
 
01:47:51.669 --> 01:47:51.679 align:start position:0%
input deliberative process that and I I
 
01:47:54.470 --> 01:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
do want to ALS also reflect back that it
 
01:47:56.470 --> 01:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
this doesn't happen very often it has
 
01:47:59.790 --> 01:47:59.800 align:start position:0%
been 20 thou it's been since 2003 since
 
01:48:01.790 --> 01:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
uh an immunization was added to the
 
01:48:04.910 --> 01:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
schedule the department takes that role
 
01:48:07.310 --> 01:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
very seriously when making those
 
01:48:09.629 --> 01:48:09.639 align:start position:0%
considerations so this would be an
 
01:48:13.270 --> 01:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
emergent situation likely where uh a
 
01:48:15.910 --> 01:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
situation to call together an eer either
 
01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
emergency rule making or an eem
 
01:48:23.350 --> 01:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
emergency session of of the legislature
 
01:48:25.189 --> 01:48:25.199 align:start position:0%
yeah and maybe I can take on the the
 
01:48:26.750 --> 01:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
second the second part of that thank you
 
01:48:28.830 --> 01:48:28.840 align:start position:0%
for I you know I don't think either of
 
01:48:31.709 --> 01:48:31.719 align:start position:0%
us feel that we're expert enough on the
 
01:48:33.350 --> 01:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
convening of the legislature in an
 
01:48:36.750 --> 01:48:36.760 align:start position:0%
emergency session to be able to really
 
01:48:40.109 --> 01:48:40.119 align:start position:0%
um provide knowledgeable input on what
 
01:48:42.830 --> 01:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
that might might look like um but
 
01:48:46.030 --> 01:48:46.040 align:start position:0%
regarding the the second question you
 
01:48:49.149 --> 01:48:49.159 align:start position:0%
know Public Health likes to operate um
 
01:48:51.750 --> 01:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
on you know by getting voluntary input
 
01:48:53.550 --> 01:48:53.560 align:start position:0%
whenever we can right I mean that that
 
01:48:55.390 --> 01:48:55.400 align:start position:0%
is the preferred way whether you know
 
01:48:57.430 --> 01:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
somebody has measles for example and has
 
01:49:00.550 --> 01:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
to isolate at home we like to work with
 
01:49:02.910 --> 01:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
a person with an infectious disease to
 
01:49:05.629 --> 01:49:05.639 align:start position:0%
get voluntary compliance with isolation
 
01:49:09.149 --> 01:49:09.159 align:start position:0%
for example um but at the end of the day
 
01:49:12.149 --> 01:49:12.159 align:start position:0%
um we have seen vaccination rates
 
01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
declining over the last several years um
 
01:49:19.270 --> 01:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
exemptions increasing which will be
 
01:49:20.870 --> 01:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
relevant for the the next Bills
 
01:49:25.470 --> 01:49:25.480 align:start position:0%
discussion um and and the and our goal
 
01:49:29.629 --> 01:49:29.639 align:start position:0%
and our job as the department um is to
 
01:49:33.669 --> 01:49:33.679 align:start position:0%
protect the health of all people um in
 
01:49:36.430 --> 01:49:36.440 align:start position:0%
public in the population and that there
 
01:49:39.189 --> 01:49:39.199 align:start position:0%
is a role We Believe for having
 
01:49:40.950 --> 01:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
immunization requirements for that
 
01:49:42.390 --> 01:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
purpose and going back to what I said
 
01:49:44.550 --> 01:49:44.560 align:start position:0%
earlier um not just protecting the
 
01:49:46.990 --> 01:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
individual but protecting vulnerable
 
01:49:51.750 --> 01:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
people who need to um be in these
 
01:49:54.830 --> 01:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
communal spaces Child Care schools um so
 
01:49:57.830 --> 01:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
that they can Thrive and be healthy and
 
01:50:01.270 --> 01:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
get a get an education um it's important
 
01:50:04.510 --> 01:50:04.520 align:start position:0%
to have a safe and healthy environment
 
01:50:06.189 --> 01:50:06.199 align:start position:0%
and part of that is making sure that we
 
01:50:08.510 --> 01:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
have the highest vaccination rates we
 
01:50:10.550 --> 01:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
can for all people for the protection of
 
01:50:13.270 --> 01:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
all people um and with declining
 
01:50:15.229 --> 01:50:15.239 align:start position:0%
vaccination rates it sort of puts a
 
01:50:16.950 --> 01:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
spotlight on the fact that one of the
 
01:50:18.750 --> 01:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
ways to get the highest rates possible
 
01:50:21.310 --> 01:50:21.320 align:start position:0%
is with these sort of selective vaccine
 
01:50:23.470 --> 01:50:23.480 align:start position:0%
requirements for those diseases that are
 
01:50:27.709 --> 01:50:27.719 align:start position:0%
most impactful and have the um and have
 
01:50:31.030 --> 01:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
the the greatest efficacy from you know
 
01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:33.229 align:start position:0%
the the greatest efficacy from you know
vaccination

01:50:33.229 --> 01:50:33.239 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
01:50:36.229 --> 01:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
well and so again I mean and and I
 
01:50:38.750 --> 01:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
understand you know the requirements and
 
01:50:41.149 --> 01:50:41.159 align:start position:0%
and how they can get vaccination rates
 
01:50:43.149 --> 01:50:43.159 align:start position:0%
but my question specifically was
 
01:50:45.310 --> 01:50:45.320 align:start position:0%
relative to the the voluntary
 
01:50:48.830 --> 01:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
vaccination rates um and is there is
 
01:50:52.350 --> 01:50:52.360 align:start position:0%
there any active work being done by the
 
01:50:55.069 --> 01:50:55.079 align:start position:0%
department Department aside from the
 
01:50:58.189 --> 01:50:58.199 align:start position:0%
requirements to because as you said you
 
01:51:01.149 --> 01:51:01.159 align:start position:0%
want to push the voluntary side as much
 
01:51:03.870 --> 01:51:03.880 align:start position:0%
as you can so you know absent this bill
 
01:51:05.790 --> 01:51:05.800 align:start position:0%
are there any active initiatives within
 
01:51:09.149 --> 01:51:09.159 align:start position:0%
the department to tackle that maybe I'll
 
01:51:10.750 --> 01:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
start and see if Colleen wants to add
 
01:51:12.350 --> 01:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
but you know I think this is the this is
 
01:51:14.669 --> 01:51:14.679 align:start position:0%
one of those areas where you know we we
 
01:51:17.790 --> 01:51:17.800 align:start position:0%
keep going back to and need to rely on
 
01:51:19.990 --> 01:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh a person's healthcare provider right
 
01:51:21.510 --> 01:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
I mean at the end of the day there are
 
01:51:24.390 --> 01:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
some people that don't trust government
 
01:51:28.430 --> 01:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
or don't trust the department um and so
 
01:51:31.030 --> 01:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
this is this is where um you know people
 
01:51:32.629 --> 01:51:32.639 align:start position:0%
that have questions people that have
 
01:51:34.350 --> 01:51:34.360 align:start position:0%
doubts about vaccines should discuss
 
01:51:35.870 --> 01:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
those questions or doubts with a
 
01:51:39.470 --> 01:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
healthcare provider um and you know if
 
01:51:41.750 --> 01:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
people choose not to be vaccinated
 
01:51:43.669 --> 01:51:43.679 align:start position:0%
against for example the covid vaccine
 
01:51:46.149 --> 01:51:46.159 align:start position:0%
the flu vaccine which are not required
 
01:51:47.990 --> 01:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
um then then that's their choice and
 
01:51:50.629 --> 01:51:50.639 align:start position:0%
that's okay um but we continue to point
 
01:51:52.629 --> 01:51:52.639 align:start position:0%
people back to their trusted Healthcare
 
01:51:54.870 --> 01:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
provider as um a source of um
 
01:51:56.350 --> 01:51:56.360 align:start position:0%
information to discuss you know
 
01:51:57.629 --> 01:51:57.639 align:start position:0%
questions and concerns that they may
 
01:52:01.950 --> 01:52:01.960 align:start position:0%
have um to you know increase voluntary
 
01:52:05.910 --> 01:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:07.950 --> 01:52:07.960 align:start position:0%
vaccines anyone
 
01:52:11.069 --> 01:52:11.079 align:start position:0%
else representative
 
01:52:13.270 --> 01:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
McGrath thank you Mr chair and thanks
 
01:52:15.910 --> 01:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my
 
01:52:18.470 --> 01:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
question you stated
 
01:52:23.950 --> 01:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
that when these vaccines are
 
01:52:26.350 --> 01:52:26.360 align:start position:0%
started there's trials and there's
 
01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:27.830 align:start position:0%
started there's trials and there's
safety

01:52:27.830 --> 01:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
safety
 
01:52:31.270 --> 01:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
data and then you also
 
01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:33.390 align:start position:0%
data and then you also
stated

01:52:33.390 --> 01:52:33.400 align:start position:0%
stated
 
01:52:36.950 --> 01:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
that we still need to see millions of
 
01:52:40.270 --> 01:52:40.280 align:start position:0%
people get vaccinated to really uh
 
01:52:43.189 --> 01:52:43.199 align:start position:0%
monitor what's
 
01:52:46.990 --> 01:52:47.000 align:start position:0%
happening my question for you is are you
 
01:52:50.629 --> 01:52:50.639 align:start position:0%
aware of the thousands of pages of fizer
 
01:52:53.550 --> 01:52:53.560 align:start position:0%
documents that they tried to keep hidden
 
01:52:57.189 --> 01:52:57.199 align:start position:0%
for 70 years but we're ordered to
 
01:53:00.750 --> 01:53:00.760 align:start position:0%
release that listed before the VAC covid
 
01:53:03.950 --> 01:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
vaccine was released that listed the
 
01:53:06.189 --> 01:53:06.199 align:start position:0%
myocarditis that we're just finding out
 
01:53:11.390 --> 01:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:14.669 --> 01:53:14.679 align:start position:0%
effects um so I have not seen those
 
01:53:18.790 --> 01:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
documents um I I will I will say just to
 
01:53:21.510 --> 01:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
clarify my earlier statement that there
 
01:53:25.830 --> 01:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
are the sort of required formal studies
 
01:53:28.109 --> 01:53:28.119 align:start position:0%
that are done before a vaccine is
 
01:53:29.669 --> 01:53:29.679 align:start position:0%
approved these are like the the phase
 
01:53:32.189 --> 01:53:32.199 align:start position:0%
one two three clinical trials and then
 
01:53:33.950 --> 01:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
there are the
 
01:53:36.750 --> 01:53:36.760 align:start position:0%
realworld studies that come out after
 
01:53:39.629 --> 01:53:39.639 align:start position:0%
the fact um as vaccines are used they
 
01:53:42.350 --> 01:53:42.360 align:start position:0%
continue to be studied uh there continue
 
01:53:44.470 --> 01:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
to be these surveillance systems to make
 
01:53:46.790 --> 01:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
sure that um the findings in the
 
01:53:49.550 --> 01:53:49.560 align:start position:0%
clinical trials um bear out in real
 
01:53:52.430 --> 01:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
world use and sometimes not always but
 
01:53:55.109 --> 01:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
but sometimes that real world use leads
 
01:53:57.950 --> 01:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
to additional findings that couldn't be
 
01:54:01.109 --> 01:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
identified in the formal clinical trials
 
01:54:03.790 --> 01:54:03.800 align:start position:0%
because those clinical trials are just
 
01:54:07.629 --> 01:54:07.639 align:start position:0%
too small um so so it's not that um it's
 
01:54:09.750 --> 01:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
not so I think there there's two
 
01:54:11.550 --> 01:54:11.560 align:start position:0%
different sort of sets of data and
 
01:54:16.229 --> 01:54:16.239 align:start position:0%
processes that happen um and the formal
 
01:54:18.589 --> 01:54:18.599 align:start position:0%
clinical trials are what's used to get
 
01:54:21.030 --> 01:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
approval and then recommendations and
 
01:54:22.790 --> 01:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
then there's the real world monitor that
 
01:54:24.910 --> 01:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
happens and this also points I think to
 
01:54:26.589 --> 01:54:26.599 align:start position:0%
the importance of groups like The
 
01:54:28.109 --> 01:54:28.119 align:start position:0%
advisory committee on immunization
 
01:54:30.470 --> 01:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
practices or acip is that they routinely
 
01:54:34.069 --> 01:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
meet meet to re to review and re-review
 
01:54:36.189 --> 01:54:36.199 align:start position:0%
new data that's emerging to update
 
01:54:37.709 --> 01:54:37.719 align:start position:0%
vaccine recommendations so vaccine
 
01:54:39.709 --> 01:54:39.719 align:start position:0%
recommendations are not static you know
 
01:54:42.109 --> 01:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
at one point in time um they continue to
 
01:54:44.229 --> 01:54:44.239 align:start position:0%
get reviewed and updated and and
 
01:54:46.350 --> 01:54:46.360 align:start position:0%
recommendations can change based on new
 
01:54:48.550 --> 01:54:48.560 align:start position:0%
emerging science and data um and that
 
01:54:50.870 --> 01:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
has happened with numerous vaccines um
 
01:54:53.270 --> 01:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
over time and so if there's new data new
 
01:54:55.310 --> 01:54:55.320 align:start position:0%
information that comes to light that is
 
01:54:58.350 --> 01:54:58.360 align:start position:0%
incorporated into um the the review
 
01:55:00.589 --> 01:55:00.599 align:start position:0%
process that happens uh and
 
01:55:02.350 --> 01:55:02.360 align:start position:0%
recommendations can and in fact do
 
01:55:04.990 --> 01:55:05.000 align:start position:0%
change um over time as new data emerges
 
01:55:06.550 --> 01:55:06.560 align:start position:0%
but relative to your question about you
 
01:55:08.510 --> 01:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
know the specific situation with fiser
 
01:55:12.030 --> 01:55:12.040 align:start position:0%
and um data I haven't seen the
 
01:55:14.950 --> 01:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
information that uh you're referring
 
01:55:17.790 --> 01:55:17.800 align:start position:0%
to thank you anyone else before we move
 
01:55:28.990 --> 01:55:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:30.669 --> 01:55:30.679 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Melissa
 
01:55:34.350 --> 01:55:34.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:36.510 --> 01:55:36.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire oh
 
01:55:40.470 --> 01:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
okay also signed up to speak
 
01:55:43.470 --> 01:55:43.480 align:start position:0%
is Pam denapoli from The New Hampshire
 
01:55:55.550 --> 01:55:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:55.560 --> 01:56:00.109 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

01:56:00.109 --> 01:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:03.350 --> 01:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
15 thank you uh my name is pamon Appy
 
01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
I'm a registered nurse from Manchester
 
01:56:07.589 --> 01:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
and I'm a member of the New Hampshire
 
01:56:09.390 --> 01:56:09.400 align:start position:0%
Nurses Association and New Hampshire
 
01:56:12.310 --> 01:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
school Nurses Association and I
 
01:56:14.910 --> 01:56:14.920 align:start position:0%
submitted my online testimony uh on
 
01:56:17.189 --> 01:56:17.199 align:start position:0%
behalf of those members in strong
 
01:56:20.430 --> 01:56:20.440 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill so I didn't want
 
01:56:22.470 --> 01:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
to reread that testimony so I just
 
01:56:24.310 --> 01:56:24.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to say some of my personal
 
01:56:27.470 --> 01:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
concerns so as a registered nurse I'm
 
01:56:29.270 --> 01:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
licensed to protect the health of the
 
01:56:33.030 --> 01:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
public HB 357 makes me question if I'll
 
01:56:35.030 --> 01:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
be able to practice to the Fidelity of
 
01:56:38.510 --> 01:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
this license because of the Clause that
 
01:56:40.069 --> 01:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
says that the authority of the
 
01:56:42.229 --> 01:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner to adopt rules would be
 
01:56:45.189 --> 01:56:45.199 align:start position:0%
removed and it goes on to say that the
 
01:56:47.790 --> 01:56:47.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner is the individual who may
 
01:56:50.510 --> 01:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
best instruct healthc care providers and
 
01:56:52.589 --> 01:56:52.599 align:start position:0%
the public in methods of pre prevention
 
01:56:54.870 --> 01:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
and control of communicable diseases
 
01:56:57.629 --> 01:56:57.639 align:start position:0%
including proper treatment and methods
 
01:57:00.109 --> 01:57:00.119 align:start position:0%
so if I don't have that expert advising
 
01:57:02.550 --> 01:57:02.560 align:start position:0%
my practice I'm concerned about my
 
01:57:06.830 --> 01:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
ability to protect the public and given
 
01:57:09.350 --> 01:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
the argument that the legislature could
 
01:57:12.430 --> 01:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
be nimble and could respond um in the
 
01:57:15.229 --> 01:57:15.239 align:start position:0%
absence of that rulle making it concerns
 
01:57:17.589 --> 01:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
me that the second part of this bill
 
01:57:20.510 --> 01:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
would eliminate vaccines that have
 
01:57:23.990 --> 01:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
protected the public for many many years
 
01:57:28.149 --> 01:57:28.159 align:start position:0%
including um Hep be vericella and Hib it
 
01:57:30.750 --> 01:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
was referenced that Hep be is a
 
01:57:34.589 --> 01:57:34.599 align:start position:0%
lifestyle um necessary for a lifestyle
 
01:57:37.790 --> 01:57:37.800 align:start position:0%
but hepe since 19 prior to 1982 when
 
01:57:40.790 --> 01:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
 was required nurses every day were
 
01:57:43.270 --> 01:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
faced with the risk of hepb from needle
 
01:57:46.750 --> 01:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
sticks so what the hepb vaccine has done
 
01:57:48.990 --> 01:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
is almost eradicated in infants and
 
01:57:51.589 --> 01:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
children protecting those of us who are
 
01:57:54.229 --> 01:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
in public public health and practice at
 
01:57:56.550 --> 01:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
the risks that we take every day to
 
01:57:59.629 --> 01:57:59.639 align:start position:0%
these vaccines a second concern I have
 
01:58:01.870 --> 01:58:01.880 align:start position:0%
is a relative to veracel you had
 
01:58:04.390 --> 01:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned Public Health expenditures to
 
01:58:06.229 --> 01:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
hospitalization but we have to think
 
01:58:08.189 --> 01:58:08.199 align:start position:0%
about when children used to get chicken
 
01:58:10.350 --> 01:58:10.360 align:start position:0%
pox the number of days they missed from
 
01:58:13.510 --> 01:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
school and the number of days that it uh
 
01:58:16.669 --> 01:58:16.679 align:start position:0%
kept parents away from their jobs so it
 
01:58:19.390 --> 01:58:19.400 align:start position:0%
was a it was both an economic and a
 
01:58:22.430 --> 01:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
public health um problem when children
 
01:58:24.669 --> 01:58:24.679 align:start position:0%
used to get Chicken
 
01:58:29.910 --> 01:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
Box um so the the the idea that the
 
01:58:32.950 --> 01:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
legislature will now make decisions on
 
01:58:35.229 --> 01:58:35.239 align:start position:0%
what vaccines when the decision that
 
01:58:37.669 --> 01:58:37.679 align:start position:0%
they're presenting is to eliminate these
 
01:58:39.870 --> 01:58:39.880 align:start position:0%
vaccines that have been proven and safe
 
01:58:43.790 --> 01:58:43.800 align:start position:0%
since 1982 so that's really a concern um
 
01:58:46.629 --> 01:58:46.639 align:start position:0%
the portion of the this statute really
 
01:58:48.390 --> 01:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
dismantles what public health
 
01:58:50.189 --> 01:58:50.199 align:start position:0%
professionals have done for very many
 
01:58:53.790 --> 01:58:53.800 align:start position:0%
years so the rule making of Authority um
 
01:58:57.109 --> 01:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
really needs to stay with the experts in
 
01:58:59.310 --> 01:58:59.320 align:start position:0%
the field and the process that currently
 
01:59:03.229 --> 01:59:03.239 align:start position:0%
works so in my practice I need
 
01:59:06.790 --> 01:59:06.800 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable good mandates that will
 
01:59:09.030 --> 01:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
help keep my public save you could start
 
01:59:11.550 --> 01:59:11.560 align:start position:0%
wrapping up ma'am that's it so that's
 
01:59:14.669 --> 01:59:14.679 align:start position:0%
what I have to say okay thank you any
 
01:59:17.030 --> 01:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:59:19.589 --> 01:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
paza thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:59:23.950 --> 01:59:23.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh did I hear you
 
01:59:28.790 --> 01:59:28.800 align:start position:0%
correctly that uh one of the reasons why
 
01:59:33.390 --> 01:59:33.400 align:start position:0%
uh parents are encouraged to vaccinate
 
01:59:37.189 --> 01:59:37.199 align:start position:0%
their newborns from hepatitis BS to
 
01:59:37.199 --> 01:59:39.030 align:start position:0%
their newborns from hepatitis BS to
protect

01:59:39.030 --> 01:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
protect
 
01:59:41.550 --> 01:59:41.560 align:start position:0%
nurses that that's been an off that's
 
01:59:44.750 --> 01:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
been a positive from when was
 
01:59:48.069 --> 01:59:48.079 align:start position:0%
started to be um mandated since
 
01:59:51.270 --> 01:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
1982 as now as nurses were protected as
 
01:59:53.069 --> 01:59:53.079 align:start position:0%
the those individual idual have grown
 
01:59:54.870 --> 01:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
and have been
 
01:59:59.830 --> 01:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:05.589 --> 02:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:08.669 --> 02:00:08.679 align:start position:0%
Weber would it be helpful to you or
 
02:00:11.350 --> 02:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
reassuring to you to know that
 
02:00:14.149 --> 02:00:14.159 align:start position:0%
the because I had the same concerns you
 
02:00:17.750 --> 02:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
just expressed that with respect to rule
 
02:00:20.669 --> 02:00:20.679 align:start position:0%
making Authority the only section on
 
02:00:23.270 --> 02:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
rule making Authority that's being
 
02:00:23.280 --> 02:00:25.310 align:start position:0%
rule making Authority that's being
removed

02:00:25.310 --> 02:00:25.320 align:start position:0%
removed
 
02:00:25.320 --> 02:00:29.870 align:start position:0%
removed
is

02:00:29.870 --> 02:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:34.310 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:00:34.310 --> 02:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:38.589 --> 02:00:38.599 align:start position:0%
c613 which so the only thing that the
 
02:00:40.669 --> 02:00:40.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner is not being allowed to do
 
02:00:43.709 --> 02:00:43.719 align:start position:0%
that they do now is uh add other
 
02:00:45.709 --> 02:00:45.719 align:start position:0%
communicable diseases but that all the
 
02:00:47.550 --> 02:00:47.560 align:start position:0%
other rule making Authority in the
 
02:00:49.750 --> 02:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner stays in
 
02:00:52.229 --> 02:00:52.239 align:start position:0%
intact I mean that it's helpful but
 
02:00:54.589 --> 02:00:54.599 align:start position:0%
still I think that it has to be done by
 
02:00:56.470 --> 02:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
the person with the best evidence and I
 
02:00:58.229 --> 02:00:58.239 align:start position:0%
think that that's that's what you heard
 
02:01:00.629 --> 02:01:00.639 align:start position:0%
prior is that is the Bureau has that
 
02:01:02.550 --> 02:01:02.560 align:start position:0%
ability to make those good
 
02:01:05.189 --> 02:01:05.199 align:start position:0%
recommendations for us
 
02:01:08.750 --> 02:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
providers anyone else representative
 
02:01:10.790 --> 02:01:10.800 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
02:01:12.910 --> 02:01:12.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question so you know a big
 
02:01:15.669 --> 02:01:15.679 align:start position:0%
concern I have obviously is is trust
 
02:01:17.629 --> 02:01:17.639 align:start position:0%
with the public so that we can kind of
 
02:01:21.589 --> 02:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
get over this uh skepticism that we have
 
02:01:23.709 --> 02:01:23.719 align:start position:0%
because I think that vaccination is a
 
02:01:26.589 --> 02:01:26.599 align:start position:0%
very important public health tool um and
 
02:01:28.589 --> 02:01:28.599 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to think of ways to reverse
 
02:01:31.030 --> 02:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
the trajectory and I think of this
 
02:01:33.709 --> 02:01:33.719 align:start position:0%
because it's very transparent would
 
02:01:36.270 --> 02:01:36.280 align:start position:0%
would give us some of that opportunity
 
02:01:39.510 --> 02:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
so um and because I I'm not as familiar
 
02:01:41.390 --> 02:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
with the rulle making Authority as maybe
 
02:01:44.350 --> 02:01:44.360 align:start position:0%
you are could you maybe speak to us a
 
02:01:46.910 --> 02:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
little bit about the relative
 
02:01:50.229 --> 02:01:50.239 align:start position:0%
transparency of the rul making process
 
02:01:52.350 --> 02:01:52.360 align:start position:0%
and the legislative process
 
02:01:54.510 --> 02:01:54.520 align:start position:0%
and you know because I know that we're
 
02:01:58.550 --> 02:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
accountable to to the voters and I'm
 
02:02:00.189 --> 02:02:00.199 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand you know the
 
02:02:02.270 --> 02:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
relative transparency and the relative
 
02:02:05.910 --> 02:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
power that the public has Ru making
 
02:02:08.470 --> 02:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
versus the legislature so I hope I
 
02:02:09.830 --> 02:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
there's a question in there somewhere
 
02:02:12.030 --> 02:02:12.040 align:start position:0%
right well I I think that the public has
 
02:02:15.229 --> 02:02:15.239 align:start position:0%
the power to refuse vaccinations if they
 
02:02:17.629 --> 02:02:17.639 align:start position:0%
want to that's not helpful to us as
 
02:02:20.430 --> 02:02:20.440 align:start position:0%
providers but the the legislature to
 
02:02:23.030 --> 02:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
take away the power that protects the
 
02:02:26.510 --> 02:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
public for the individual who is
 
02:02:29.189 --> 02:02:29.199 align:start position:0%
skeptical is not a good Power Balance is
 
02:02:30.990 --> 02:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
what I would say so do you want to give
 
02:02:34.629 --> 02:02:34.639 align:start position:0%
the Power Balance to the individuals who
 
02:02:36.790 --> 02:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
are putting the public at risk or do you
 
02:02:38.990 --> 02:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
want to give the Power Balance to the
 
02:02:41.629 --> 02:02:41.639 align:start position:0%
providers who are protecting the public
 
02:02:45.589 --> 02:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah thinkk I think that the
 
02:02:47.669 --> 02:02:47.679 align:start position:0%
the Power Balance with the legislature
 
02:02:50.750 --> 02:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
isn't so much with the individuals
 
02:02:52.229 --> 02:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
because it's it's the whole whole of the
 
02:02:54.990 --> 02:02:55.000 align:start position:0%
legislature so they are reflecting they
 
02:02:57.229 --> 02:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
are reflective of the will of the public
 
02:03:01.390 --> 02:03:01.400 align:start position:0%
maybe not just one skeptic um at least I
 
02:03:02.910 --> 02:03:02.920 align:start position:0%
I think that's kind of how we operate as
 
02:03:05.629 --> 02:03:05.639 align:start position:0%
a legislature and but again I'm not as
 
02:03:07.910 --> 02:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
familiar with the rul making Authority
 
02:03:12.709 --> 02:03:12.719 align:start position:0%
so I'm just wondering how the the the
 
02:03:14.790 --> 02:03:14.800 align:start position:0%
the the the will of the people not just
 
02:03:17.189 --> 02:03:17.199 align:start position:0%
the individuals is reflected in the
 
02:03:19.109 --> 02:03:19.119 align:start position:0%
rulemaking authority versus A
 
02:03:20.750 --> 02:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
legislature because that's not the part
 
02:03:23.270 --> 02:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
as I'm as much I'm familiar with but I
 
02:03:26.270 --> 02:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
do think that the legislature is not
 
02:03:28.109 --> 02:03:28.119 align:start position:0%
accountable to one skeptic but the will
 
02:03:31.069 --> 02:03:31.079 align:start position:0%
of the public as a whole so I think
 
02:03:34.270 --> 02:03:34.280 align:start position:0%
that's what we would we would hope but I
 
02:03:35.430 --> 02:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
mean I think that there's going to be
 
02:03:38.709 --> 02:03:38.719 align:start position:0%
Skeptics on both sides of whether or not
 
02:03:40.669 --> 02:03:40.679 align:start position:0%
the the body is really reflective of the
 
02:03:43.750 --> 02:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
people or is it reflective of some
 
02:03:45.870 --> 02:03:45.880 align:start position:0%
misinformation and rhetoric that we may
 
02:03:48.189 --> 02:03:48.199 align:start position:0%
hear and I think the other thing is that
 
02:03:49.870 --> 02:03:49.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of the skepticism and even the
 
02:03:52.390 --> 02:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
argument here today was around Co
 
02:03:54.229 --> 02:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
and we have to think about that these
 
02:03:56.669 --> 02:03:56.679 align:start position:0%
other vaccines have been safe and
 
02:03:58.709 --> 02:03:58.719 align:start position:0%
reliable and and would change the
 
02:04:01.229 --> 02:04:01.239 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandates based on one EP
 
02:04:04.470 --> 02:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
pandemic that we recently ex experienced
 
02:04:08.189 --> 02:04:08.199 align:start position:0%
so I think that to to be transparent we
 
02:04:11.589 --> 02:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
had vaccines prior to covid that we
 
02:04:14.549 --> 02:04:14.559 align:start position:0%
didn't we didn't care about I mean we we
 
02:04:16.750 --> 02:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
got them voluntarily as the word has
 
02:04:19.109 --> 02:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
been said and now all of a sudden it's
 
02:04:21.510 --> 02:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
that these these vaccines somehow are
 
02:04:23.310 --> 02:04:23.320 align:start position:0%
against against the will of the people
 
02:04:24.830 --> 02:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
so I think I think we move the
 
02:04:27.669 --> 02:04:27.679 align:start position:0%
conversation away from covid and move it
 
02:04:30.470 --> 02:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
back to Childhood Imus that have been
 
02:04:33.030 --> 02:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
safe for many years and are protecting
 
02:04:35.950 --> 02:04:35.960 align:start position:0%
the whole age Spectrum now because you
 
02:04:39.109 --> 02:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
know what I got them when I was a child
 
02:04:41.030 --> 02:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
and and it's protected me and now it's
 
02:04:42.990 --> 02:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
protecting my child so you know I think
 
02:04:45.109 --> 02:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
that we have to think about it that way
 
02:04:47.270 --> 02:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Weber could I
 
02:04:49.510 --> 02:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
ask a procedural question of you Mr
 
02:04:52.350 --> 02:04:52.360 align:start position:0%
chairman would it be helpful do you
 
02:04:54.830 --> 02:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
think for members of the committee who
 
02:04:57.350 --> 02:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
are not particularly familiar with the
 
02:04:59.950 --> 02:04:59.960 align:start position:0%
rul making process to get our researcher
 
02:05:03.189 --> 02:05:03.199 align:start position:0%
to give us a memo on what the ru making
 
02:05:06.510 --> 02:05:06.520 align:start position:0%
process is and how it operates so that
 
02:05:10.990 --> 02:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
they could decide uh from somebody who
 
02:05:13.790 --> 02:05:13.800 align:start position:0%
um has actual knowledge of it what the
 
02:05:17.669 --> 02:05:17.679 align:start position:0%
process is and how how it works and can
 
02:05:19.430 --> 02:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
judge for themselves how they feel about
 
02:05:22.149 --> 02:05:22.159 align:start position:0%
it after that that makes sense I'll I'll
 
02:05:24.229 --> 02:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
make that
 
02:05:28.390 --> 02:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
request anyone else representative
 
02:05:30.950 --> 02:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
damus thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:05:34.430 --> 02:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
02:05:39.229 --> 02:05:39.239 align:start position:0%
um when you when you immunize your child
 
02:05:40.390 --> 02:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
as an
 
02:05:43.510 --> 02:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
RN I don't know who exactly speaks to
 
02:05:45.910 --> 02:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
the parents about what these these
 
02:05:49.149 --> 02:05:49.159 align:start position:0%
immunizations do um when they're
 
02:05:51.750 --> 02:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
required in the whole nine yards but I
 
02:05:55.229 --> 02:05:55.239 align:start position:0%
would assume that that the parents are
 
02:05:59.750 --> 02:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
informed by an RN or by uh the doctors
 
02:06:02.629 --> 02:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
who are experts I acknowledge certainly
 
02:06:06.870 --> 02:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
an RN is certainly an expert um the the
 
02:06:10.709 --> 02:06:10.719 align:start position:0%
vaccines that are being proposed to
 
02:06:14.430 --> 02:06:14.440 align:start position:0%
being um removed from the list would
 
02:06:18.629 --> 02:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
they not be spoken of at any rate by the
 
02:06:21.270 --> 02:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
nurses and the doctors so that the
 
02:06:22.549 --> 02:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
parent parents would have a full
 
02:06:25.549 --> 02:06:25.559 align:start position:0%
spectrum of the immunizations available
 
02:06:28.830 --> 02:06:28.840 align:start position:0%
for their children yes I mean that that
 
02:06:31.030 --> 02:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
would be that's our role is to explain
 
02:06:33.950 --> 02:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
that the vaccinations right so but right
 
02:06:36.270 --> 02:06:36.280 align:start position:0%
now we sort of have the ability to say
 
02:06:38.310 --> 02:06:38.320 align:start position:0%
this is what this is our best evidence
 
02:06:39.990 --> 02:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
and these are the recommendations that
 
02:06:43.430 --> 02:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
we make with our best evidence at this
 
02:06:46.109 --> 02:06:46.119 align:start position:0%
point I would guess that a parent is
 
02:06:48.109 --> 02:06:48.119 align:start position:0%
going to make the best decision also for
 
02:06:50.669 --> 02:06:50.679 align:start position:0%
their child so if I say to them this is
 
02:06:53.149 --> 02:06:53.159 align:start position:0%
what the CDC is recommending and this is
 
02:06:55.149 --> 02:06:55.159 align:start position:0%
what New Hampshire is recommending this
 
02:06:56.790 --> 02:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
is what you need prior to your child
 
02:07:00.390 --> 02:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
going to school um and do these are your
 
02:07:04.669 --> 02:07:04.679 align:start position:0%
options I'm I'm would give a parent the
 
02:07:06.109 --> 02:07:06.119 align:start position:0%
credit that they would make the best
 
02:07:08.950 --> 02:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
decision and I have to I think my point
 
02:07:12.790 --> 02:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
around um my practice is if if if that's
 
02:07:14.589 --> 02:07:14.599 align:start position:0%
not the best evidence that I'm getting
 
02:07:16.870 --> 02:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
because I'm waiting for the legislature
 
02:07:20.069 --> 02:07:20.079 align:start position:0%
you know would I would I be able to to
 
02:07:23.310 --> 02:07:23.320 align:start position:0%
have that same Authority to recommend a
 
02:07:26.350 --> 02:07:26.360 align:start position:0%
a vaccine does that make sense no it
 
02:07:29.270 --> 02:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't look like it anyone
 
02:07:35.950 --> 02:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:40.750 --> 02:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:47.109 --> 02:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:49.229 --> 02:07:49.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you Mr chair members of
 
02:07:51.189 --> 02:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
the committee uh thanks for you letting
 
02:07:53.950 --> 02:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
me come back um I'm here today to speak
 
02:07:56.709 --> 02:07:56.719 align:start position:0%
in support of HB 357 which seeks to
 
02:07:58.750 --> 02:07:58.760 align:start position:0%
ensure that decisions about vaccine
 
02:08:00.430 --> 02:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
mandates for schools and daycares are
 
02:08:02.950 --> 02:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
made by elected representatives not
 
02:08:04.950 --> 02:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
unelected bureaucrats this is not just a
 
02:08:07.030 --> 02:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
matter of public health policy it's
 
02:08:08.750 --> 02:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
about restoring accountability
 
02:08:10.910 --> 02:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
transparency and most importantly
 
02:08:12.669 --> 02:08:12.679 align:start position:0%
putting power back into the hands of the
 
02:08:14.830 --> 02:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
people we all know that the legislative
 
02:08:16.189 --> 02:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
process allows elected officials to
 
02:08:17.750 --> 02:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
debate amend and vote on laws however
 
02:08:19.870 --> 02:08:19.880 align:start position:0%
the rul making process is far more
 
02:08:21.510 --> 02:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
opaque and more importantly done by
 
02:08:23.790 --> 02:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
people who are not accountable to voters
 
02:08:27.229 --> 02:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
this is where hb5 357 comes in it's a
 
02:08:29.910 --> 02:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
simple but crucial reform it requires a
 
02:08:31.589 --> 02:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
new vaccine mandate to be approved by
 
02:08:33.390 --> 02:08:33.400 align:start position:0%
the state legislature not decided by
 
02:08:35.589 --> 02:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
unelected officials this ensures that
 
02:08:37.270 --> 02:08:37.280 align:start position:0%
decisions with profound impacts on our
 
02:08:38.950 --> 02:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
children families and communities are
 
02:08:41.990 --> 02:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
made in an open and accountable process
 
02:08:43.350 --> 02:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
some critics May argue that the
 
02:08:45.189 --> 02:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
lawmakers aren't experts in public
 
02:08:46.470 --> 02:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
health and shouldn't be making these
 
02:08:48.750 --> 02:08:48.760 align:start position:0%
decisions but this critique overlooks an
 
02:08:50.109 --> 02:08:50.119 align:start position:0%
important part of the legislative
 
02:08:52.109 --> 02:08:52.119 align:start position:0%
process elected official offals consult
 
02:08:53.830 --> 02:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
experts in this case scientists health
 
02:08:55.030 --> 02:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
professionals and the public before
 
02:08:56.990 --> 02:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
making decisions public debates and
 
02:08:58.270 --> 02:08:58.280 align:start position:0%
hearings ensure that multiple
 
02:09:00.229 --> 02:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
perspectives are heard and considered
 
02:09:01.629 --> 02:09:01.639 align:start position:0%
bureaucrats on the other hand make
 
02:09:03.629 --> 02:09:03.639 align:start position:0%
decisions in secrecy without much debate
 
02:09:03.639 --> 02:09:04.350 align:start position:0%
decisions in secrecy without much debate
or

02:09:04.350 --> 02:09:04.360 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:09:07.950 --> 02:09:07.960 align:start position:0%
scrutiny HB 357 is not about vaccine
 
02:09:09.910 --> 02:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
policy despite all the questions that
 
02:09:11.950 --> 02:09:11.960 align:start position:0%
I've heard today it's about restoring
 
02:09:13.430 --> 02:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
the principle that elected officials who
 
02:09:14.830 --> 02:09:14.840 align:start position:0%
are directly accountable to the people
 
02:09:16.189 --> 02:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
should have the final say in the matters
 
02:09:18.270 --> 02:09:18.280 align:start position:0%
that affect our freedoms and rights this
 
02:09:20.229 --> 02:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
bill guarantees transparency public
 
02:09:22.470 --> 02:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
input and accountability in decisions
 
02:09:24.030 --> 02:09:24.040 align:start position:0%
that impact the health and wellbeing of
 
02:09:25.830 --> 02:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
our families now those are my prepared
 
02:09:28.390 --> 02:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
remarks but based off of the questions I
 
02:09:29.709 --> 02:09:29.719 align:start position:0%
didn't want to make this about mandates
 
02:09:31.069 --> 02:09:31.079 align:start position:0%
because this bill doesn't remove any
 
02:09:35.629 --> 02:09:35.639 align:start position:0%
mandates but mandates breed skepticism
 
02:09:37.830 --> 02:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
good ideas don't require
 
02:09:40.950 --> 02:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
Force that's it I'll take any questions
 
02:09:42.990 --> 02:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
thank you any
 
02:09:45.830 --> 02:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
questions representative palazov uh
 
02:09:48.189 --> 02:09:48.199 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr chair thank you for
 
02:09:51.470 --> 02:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh do you know
 
02:09:55.149 --> 02:09:55.159 align:start position:0%
legally speaking are there other uh
 
02:09:59.790 --> 02:09:59.800 align:start position:0%
Fields uh where department has uh rule
 
02:10:02.950 --> 02:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
making authority to mandate certain
 
02:10:05.549 --> 02:10:05.559 align:start position:0%
medication to the
 
02:10:07.709 --> 02:10:07.719 align:start position:0%
population thank you for the question I
 
02:10:09.510 --> 02:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
I do not believe so I think that this is
 
02:10:11.870 --> 02:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
the only um type of medication that can
 
02:10:15.189 --> 02:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
be mandated by through R
 
02:10:17.709 --> 02:10:17.719 align:start position:0%
making anyone
 
02:10:28.790 --> 02:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:34.030 --> 02:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:36.109 --> 02:10:36.119 align:start position:0%
Friedman you've asked for four minutes
 
02:10:37.629 --> 02:10:37.639 align:start position:0%
if you could keep it closer to three I'd
 
02:10:37.639 --> 02:10:40.549 align:start position:0%
if you could keep it closer to three I'd
appreciate

02:10:40.549 --> 02:10:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:43.549 --> 02:10:43.559 align:start position:0%
it uh Mr chair uh committee members
 
02:10:45.629 --> 02:10:45.639 align:start position:0%
Aubrey Fred fredman I live in
 
02:10:47.709 --> 02:10:47.719 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater I speak in support of this
 
02:10:51.510 --> 02:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
bill so I was glad to hear that New
 
02:10:54.589 --> 02:10:54.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is kind of conservative on uh
 
02:10:57.229 --> 02:10:57.239 align:start position:0%
putting new vaccines on the school
 
02:11:01.149 --> 02:11:01.159 align:start position:0%
vaccine schedule which is good but um
 
02:11:03.430 --> 02:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm glad to hear that but I came
 
02:11:03.440 --> 02:11:04.430 align:start position:0%
and I'm glad to hear that but I came
from

02:11:04.430 --> 02:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:11:07.950 --> 02:11:07.960 align:start position:0%
California and as we know this whole
 
02:11:10.709 --> 02:11:10.719 align:start position:0%
it's a very political issue it shouldn't
 
02:11:12.910 --> 02:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
be but it is and I'm telling you and I
 
02:11:16.069 --> 02:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
can't this is before the whole Co thing
 
02:11:19.510 --> 02:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
they were making it actually uh on their
 
02:11:22.750 --> 02:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
uh for all schools not just government
 
02:11:26.510 --> 02:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
schools private schools too everywhere
 
02:11:28.629 --> 02:11:28.639 align:start position:0%
and the only people who were safe for
 
02:11:30.870 --> 02:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers and that's not practical
 
02:11:34.030 --> 02:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
for every family uh to be homeschooling
 
02:11:36.310 --> 02:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
and so what choice do you have so it
 
02:11:39.069 --> 02:11:39.079 align:start position:0%
really when it gets on the school
 
02:11:41.669 --> 02:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
vaccine schedule it becomes like a
 
02:11:44.589 --> 02:11:44.599 align:start position:0%
mandate for a lot of people it's not
 
02:11:46.510 --> 02:11:46.520 align:start position:0%
it's really not uh if it were a
 
02:11:49.229 --> 02:11:49.239 align:start position:0%
recommendation that'd be have a totally
 
02:11:52.950 --> 02:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
different opinion on it uh but it's
 
02:11:55.189 --> 02:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
pretty it's a it's a mandate basically
 
02:11:58.390 --> 02:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
for most people and so it is a big issue
 
02:12:01.870 --> 02:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
and it should always be between the
 
02:12:04.589 --> 02:12:04.599 align:start position:0%
parents and the pediatricians to make
 
02:12:07.270 --> 02:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
the decisions to vaccine or not and by
 
02:12:11.669 --> 02:12:11.679 align:start position:0%
the way not just uh vac vaccinate or not
 
02:12:14.549 --> 02:12:14.559 align:start position:0%
because uh the parents might not be an
 
02:12:17.750 --> 02:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
antivaxer and they might uh feel well
 
02:12:21.310 --> 02:12:21.320 align:start position:0%
okay yeah you know certain vaccines with
 
02:12:23.149 --> 02:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
be good and maybe certain ones they
 
02:12:25.189 --> 02:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
don't want to you know pick and choose
 
02:12:26.750 --> 02:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
type of thing where you don't get that
 
02:12:29.830 --> 02:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
once it goes on the schedule you know
 
02:12:31.430 --> 02:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
the rule making they put it on the
 
02:12:34.030 --> 02:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
schedule and it's uh you don't really
 
02:12:36.069 --> 02:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
get much choice in it I mean I know they
 
02:12:37.870 --> 02:12:37.880 align:start position:0%
have the exemptions but again in
 
02:12:42.629 --> 02:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
California they were uh making it that
 
02:12:45.790 --> 02:12:45.800 align:start position:0%
actually they went after the doctors to
 
02:12:48.109 --> 02:12:48.119 align:start position:0%
uh if they gave out too many medical
 
02:12:49.910 --> 02:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
exemptions they would go after their
 
02:12:51.830 --> 02:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
license and threaten them
 
02:12:54.189 --> 02:12:54.199 align:start position:0%
so and the and they were turning down
 
02:12:56.910 --> 02:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
religious exemptions so again it's very
 
02:13:01.830 --> 02:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
political and if you just got back to uh
 
02:13:05.030 --> 02:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
having it be voluntary and then uh
 
02:13:07.510 --> 02:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
people would recommendations I guess
 
02:13:10.149 --> 02:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
that's the key key to it but they're not
 
02:13:11.549 --> 02:13:11.559 align:start position:0%
recommendations they're basically
 
02:13:14.990 --> 02:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
mandates and I was going to uh I'll pass
 
02:13:17.950 --> 02:13:17.960 align:start position:0%
out my backup but this thing I'm sure
 
02:13:21.430 --> 02:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
you remember during the co thing uh uh
 
02:13:23.669 --> 02:13:23.679 align:start position:0%
that Dr Eric Rubin you know when they
 
02:13:26.549 --> 02:13:26.559 align:start position:0%
were deciding about the 5 to 11 year
 
02:13:29.149 --> 02:13:29.159 align:start position:0%
olds if it should be authorized and his
 
02:13:31.589 --> 02:13:31.599 align:start position:0%
comments and so I put a little blurb in
 
02:13:34.030 --> 02:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
here people said that was all taken out
 
02:13:37.709 --> 02:13:37.719 align:start position:0%
of context but basically he said that
 
02:13:39.629 --> 02:13:39.639 align:start position:0%
you know I don't and this was a
 
02:13:41.430 --> 02:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
thoughtful person it's a doctor he's one
 
02:13:45.310 --> 02:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
of the FDA committee members I I don't
 
02:13:48.549 --> 02:13:48.559 align:start position:0%
really know wrapping up okay sure and
 
02:13:50.549 --> 02:13:50.559 align:start position:0%
anyway he he went ahead even though he
 
02:13:54.229 --> 02:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
had his out he went ahead and uh and
 
02:13:56.109 --> 02:13:56.119 align:start position:0%
recommended any with all the other
 
02:13:58.390 --> 02:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
people so the experts they don't really
 
02:14:00.910 --> 02:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
know it should be between parents and
 
02:14:02.790 --> 02:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
and the pediatricians and that's it
 
02:14:06.709 --> 02:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you are there any
 
02:14:09.589 --> 02:14:09.599 align:start position:0%
questions seeing n thank you thank you
 
02:14:10.870 --> 02:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative R did you have
 
02:14:13.709 --> 02:14:13.719 align:start position:0%
a question or no I was I was wanting his
 
02:14:13.719 --> 02:14:17.109 align:start position:0%
a question or no I was I was wanting his
WR

from

02:14:39.430 --> 02:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:14:43.390 --> 02:14:43.400 align:start position:0%
Danville I'm testifying on behalf of
 
02:14:45.950 --> 02:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
myself and as a parent who's been
 
02:14:47.629 --> 02:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
through that process of trying to get a
 
02:14:51.109 --> 02:14:51.119 align:start position:0%
child into a school where there were
 
02:14:53.990 --> 02:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
rules requiring vaccinations and I
 
02:14:56.430 --> 02:14:56.440 align:start position:0%
brought as a reference today a book by
 
02:14:59.950 --> 02:14:59.960 align:start position:0%
Robert F Kennedy Jr called vax versus
 
02:15:04.189 --> 02:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
unvaxxed with um as you know he's been
 
02:15:06.390 --> 02:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
recently appointed as
 
02:15:09.069 --> 02:15:09.079 align:start position:0%
the United States
 
02:15:12.390 --> 02:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
um head of Health and Human Services I
 
02:15:14.709 --> 02:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
just want to read a little expert ex
 
02:15:18.510 --> 02:15:18.520 align:start position:0%
sorry excert if I may from the
 
02:15:22.390 --> 02:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
book uh it says since the enactment of
 
02:15:25.510 --> 02:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
the 1986 National childhood vaccine
 
02:15:28.390 --> 02:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
injury act which provides a liability
 
02:15:31.229 --> 02:15:31.239 align:start position:0%
shield for vaccine
 
02:15:33.189 --> 02:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
manufacturers I want to read that again
 
02:15:35.950 --> 02:15:35.960 align:start position:0%
which provides a liability shield for
 
02:15:35.960 --> 02:15:37.629 align:start position:0%
which provides a liability shield for
vaccine

02:15:37.629 --> 02:15:37.639 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
02:15:39.830 --> 02:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
manufactors vaccination schedule has
 
02:15:42.709 --> 02:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
multiplied considerably today children
 
02:15:44.510 --> 02:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
following the CDC recommended
 
02:15:47.149 --> 02:15:47.159 align:start position:0%
vaccination schedule receive a minimum
 
02:15:50.750 --> 02:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
of 73 shots for 17 different diseases
 
02:15:53.870 --> 02:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
with the whopping 28 injections by their
 
02:15:53.880 --> 02:15:57.629 align:start position:0%
with the whopping 28 injections by their
first

02:15:57.629 --> 02:15:57.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:00.950 --> 02:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
birthday at a two month well baby visit
 
02:16:03.510 --> 02:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
an infant may receive as many as six
 
02:16:07.589 --> 02:16:07.599 align:start position:0%
vaccines for eight different
 
02:16:10.109 --> 02:16:10.119 align:start position:0%
diseases um and he goes on there's a lot
 
02:16:13.270 --> 02:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
of charts and interesting information in
 
02:16:17.549 --> 02:16:17.559 align:start position:0%
here and he charts out all the um
 
02:16:19.950 --> 02:16:19.960 align:start position:0%
statistics of vaccinated versus
 
02:16:19.960 --> 02:16:21.669 align:start position:0%
statistics of vaccinated versus
unvaccinated

02:16:21.669 --> 02:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated
 
02:16:25.709 --> 02:16:25.719 align:start position:0%
and overwhelmingly the children that are
 
02:16:29.589 --> 02:16:29.599 align:start position:0%
vaccinated per the CDC schedule are much
 
02:16:32.070 --> 02:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
more unhealthy than the children that
 
02:16:33.469 --> 02:16:33.479 align:start position:0%
are not
 
02:16:33.479 --> 02:16:35.870 align:start position:0%
are not
vaccinated

02:16:35.870 --> 02:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
02:16:38.709 --> 02:16:38.719 align:start position:0%
so as a parent I don't think it's
 
02:16:41.790 --> 02:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
unreasonable for me to be skeptical of
 
02:16:41.800 --> 02:16:43.309 align:start position:0%
unreasonable for me to be skeptical of
these

02:16:43.309 --> 02:16:43.319 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:16:45.750 --> 02:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
vaccines um they're a profit center for
 
02:16:48.150 --> 02:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
the big pharmaceutical industry and they
 
02:16:50.270 --> 02:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
have no liability and I think you're
 
02:16:51.990 --> 02:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
probably make a prediction that there's
 
02:16:54.349 --> 02:16:54.359 align:start position:0%
going to be a lot of litigation in the
 
02:16:57.190 --> 02:16:57.200 align:start position:0%
near future particularly with RFK Jr in
 
02:16:58.910 --> 02:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
charge of Health and Human
 
02:17:01.790 --> 02:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
Services bringing to light as
 
02:17:03.270 --> 02:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
representative McGrath pointed out
 
02:17:04.870 --> 02:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of information they're not
 
02:17:08.309 --> 02:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
giving us so I would feel a lot better
 
02:17:11.790 --> 02:17:11.800 align:start position:0%
as a parent possibly a
 
02:17:11.800 --> 02:17:13.349 align:start position:0%
as a parent possibly a
grandparent

02:17:13.349 --> 02:17:13.359 align:start position:0%
grandparent
 
02:17:16.429 --> 02:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
um that in the future we not subject to
 
02:17:19.190 --> 02:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
these rules because as a parent as I
 
02:17:21.270 --> 02:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
said having nav tried to navigate this
 
02:17:23.349 --> 02:17:23.359 align:start position:0%
you're very
 
02:17:27.509 --> 02:17:27.519 align:start position:0%
powerless against the bureaucracy to
 
02:17:29.309 --> 02:17:29.319 align:start position:0%
deal with these rules that basically
 
02:17:33.509 --> 02:17:33.519 align:start position:0%
would took us months to find out that
 
02:17:35.790 --> 02:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
the requirements uh our daughter school
 
02:17:37.950 --> 02:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
was trying to make were just arbitrary
 
02:17:40.309 --> 02:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
rules and not requirements that's it
 
02:17:42.230 --> 02:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you are there any
 
02:17:45.150 --> 02:17:45.160 align:start position:0%
representative palazov uh thank you Mr
 
02:17:48.910 --> 02:17:48.920 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
02:17:51.270 --> 02:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
so when you were receiving giv
 
02:17:53.950 --> 02:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
communication uh from your child school
 
02:17:55.309 --> 02:17:55.319 align:start position:0%
or from
 
02:17:57.910 --> 02:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
pediatrician uh did they
 
02:18:02.429 --> 02:18:02.439 align:start position:0%
mention any of those scientific data
 
02:18:07.629 --> 02:18:07.639 align:start position:0%
that is me mentioned in this book about
 
02:18:12.509 --> 02:18:12.519 align:start position:0%
uh High rates of uh immune disease in
 
02:18:16.070 --> 02:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
vaccinated kids or did they want you
 
02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
about side effects uh for nervous system
 
02:18:21.990 --> 02:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
or any anything else
 
02:18:24.629 --> 02:18:24.639 align:start position:0%
well we were dealing with the school and
 
02:18:26.669 --> 02:18:26.679 align:start position:0%
not directly at the time was in
 
02:18:28.309 --> 02:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts not directly with the
 
02:18:30.150 --> 02:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
health department of Massachusetts so
 
02:18:32.750 --> 02:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
the rules came down from Health
 
02:18:35.589 --> 02:18:35.599 align:start position:0%
Department to the school and the school
 
02:18:37.110 --> 02:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
is saying well it's a
 
02:18:41.190 --> 02:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
rule so as a parent there's a whole
 
02:18:45.230 --> 02:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy above you which is powerful
 
02:18:47.669 --> 02:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
and it's as a individual it's very
 
02:18:49.309 --> 02:18:49.319 align:start position:0%
difficult to deal with
 
02:18:52.469 --> 02:18:52.479 align:start position:0%
that yes my represenative elberger thank
 
02:18:53.589 --> 02:18:53.599 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
02:18:57.349 --> 02:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
chair you referenced uh some comments
 
02:19:01.230 --> 02:19:01.240 align:start position:0%
from uh Mr Kennedy about uh
 
02:19:03.910 --> 02:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
liability and that pharmaceutical
 
02:19:06.270 --> 02:19:06.280 align:start position:0%
companies are held harmless from
 
02:19:09.629 --> 02:19:09.639 align:start position:0%
liability is that correct
 
02:19:13.389 --> 02:19:13.399 align:start position:0%
correct if we say that pharmaceutical
 
02:19:17.910 --> 02:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
companies should be um not it should be
 
02:19:17.920 --> 02:19:19.110 align:start position:0%
companies should be um not it should be
held

02:19:19.110 --> 02:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
held
 
02:19:22.070 --> 02:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
liable for
 
02:19:25.870 --> 02:19:25.880 align:start position:0%
issues relating to problems with their
 
02:19:29.910 --> 02:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
products would you also then say that
 
02:19:31.910 --> 02:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
families who choose to have their
 
02:19:33.509 --> 02:19:33.519 align:start position:0%
children not
 
02:19:36.150 --> 02:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and whose children then
 
02:19:39.589 --> 02:19:39.599 align:start position:0%
infect other people causing them serious
 
02:19:42.669 --> 02:19:42.679 align:start position:0%
harm should those families be held
 
02:19:46.110 --> 02:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
liable for the harm to those children
 
02:19:50.910 --> 02:19:50.920 align:start position:0%
whom they or their children hurt
 
02:19:52.389 --> 02:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
uh that's a good question I don't know
 
02:19:53.710 --> 02:19:53.720 align:start position:0%
how to answer that I'd have to give it
 
02:19:56.070 --> 02:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
some thought but
 
02:20:00.150 --> 02:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
um it's a parental decision based on
 
02:20:00.160 --> 02:20:01.950 align:start position:0%
um it's a parental decision based on
risk

02:20:01.950 --> 02:20:01.960 align:start position:0%
risk
 
02:20:01.960 --> 02:20:03.550 align:start position:0%
risk
assessment

02:20:03.550 --> 02:20:03.560 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
02:20:06.590 --> 02:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
um these vaccines are not without zero
 
02:20:09.110 --> 02:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
risk and just from my own experience
 
02:20:11.349 --> 02:20:11.359 align:start position:0%
growing up having received several
 
02:20:13.270 --> 02:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
vaccines I think I got three when I was
 
02:20:16.110 --> 02:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
in school and then noticing the Next
 
02:20:18.550 --> 02:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
Generation that came along they're
 
02:20:21.389 --> 02:20:21.399 align:start position:0%
significantly less healthy I mean when I
 
02:20:24.270 --> 02:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
was growing up we never heard about um
 
02:20:27.030 --> 02:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
autism it's that's a new word wasn't in
 
02:20:27.040 --> 02:20:27.990 align:start position:0%
autism it's that's a new word wasn't in
the

02:20:27.990 --> 02:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:20:31.710 --> 02:20:31.720 align:start position:0%
vocabulary and I was shocked to see the
 
02:20:35.389 --> 02:20:35.399 align:start position:0%
children um through the 80s and 90s and
 
02:20:38.110 --> 02:20:38.120 align:start position:0%
into the 2000s that had asthma and
 
02:20:39.950 --> 02:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
allergies I mean allergies for things
 
02:20:41.830 --> 02:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
which when I was growing up nobody had
 
02:20:41.840 --> 02:20:44.190 align:start position:0%
which when I was growing up nobody had
these

02:20:44.190 --> 02:20:44.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:47.830 --> 02:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
allergies follow up follow up thank you
 
02:20:50.790 --> 02:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
I it's also worth noting that our our
 
02:20:53.070 --> 02:20:53.080 align:start position:0%
lifestyles have changed there have been
 
02:20:56.230 --> 02:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
significantly increased rates of obesity
 
02:21:00.550 --> 02:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
both as adults and as children uh that
 
02:21:02.710 --> 02:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
we're putting many more additives into
 
02:21:06.630 --> 02:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
our Foods than when I was growing up you
 
02:21:08.150 --> 02:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
have a question representative and I'm
 
02:21:11.630 --> 02:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
wondering whether you see that those are
 
02:21:15.830 --> 02:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:19.270 --> 02:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
vaccines there is evidence in the book
 
02:21:21.389 --> 02:21:21.399 align:start position:0%
um it is coincidence
 
02:21:24.349 --> 02:21:24.359 align:start position:0%
that with this vaccination schedule um I
 
02:21:26.230 --> 02:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
would quote hypocrates who said it's the
 
02:21:28.910 --> 02:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
dose that makes the poison I
 
02:21:31.429 --> 02:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
think as I said we were vaccinated for
 
02:21:34.070 --> 02:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
several different diseases polio
 
02:21:36.469 --> 02:21:36.479 align:start position:0%
probably tetanus I don't remember them
 
02:21:40.750 --> 02:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
all but there's a too little and there's
 
02:21:41.950 --> 02:21:41.960 align:start position:0%
the right amount and then there's too
 
02:21:44.870 --> 02:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
much and I'm pointing out the fact that
 
02:21:47.469 --> 02:21:47.479 align:start position:0%
right now it's too much and I really
 
02:21:49.630 --> 02:21:49.640 align:start position:0%
would like not to see it get to be
 
02:21:49.640 --> 02:21:51.070 align:start position:0%
would like not to see it get to be
anymore

02:21:51.070 --> 02:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
02:21:53.389 --> 02:21:53.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair representative
 
02:21:55.950 --> 02:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:21:58.990 --> 02:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so this bill does
 
02:22:02.309 --> 02:22:02.319 align:start position:0%
not eliminate vaccine mandates okay so
 
02:22:05.830 --> 02:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
the vaccine mandates stay the only thing
 
02:22:08.110 --> 02:22:08.120 align:start position:0%
that this bill does is it's going to
 
02:22:11.790 --> 02:22:11.800 align:start position:0%
pick which lane you go down in order to
 
02:22:13.910 --> 02:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
arrive at are we going to have a vaccine
 
02:22:18.349 --> 02:22:18.359 align:start position:0%
mandate or not so with that in mind some
 
02:22:20.590 --> 02:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
of the the drugs that we have were
 
02:22:22.469 --> 02:22:22.479 align:start position:0%
approved the old way some of them are
 
02:22:24.230 --> 02:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
approved with the rul
 
02:22:28.630 --> 02:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
making if we were to go to a
 
02:22:31.590 --> 02:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
situation where this bill was to
 
02:22:36.190 --> 02:22:36.200 align:start position:0%
pass and now we're approving vaccines
 
02:22:39.389 --> 02:22:39.399 align:start position:0%
the same way we approved them 30 years
 
02:22:42.790 --> 02:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
ago would you be more inclined to
 
02:22:46.590 --> 02:22:46.600 align:start position:0%
vaccinate your children or would you
 
02:22:51.110 --> 02:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:53.710 --> 02:22:53.720 align:start position:0%
I would ask if a doctor recommended a
 
02:22:56.150 --> 02:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
vaccination a particular vaccination
 
02:22:57.750 --> 02:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
rather than I mean right now there's
 
02:22:58.870 --> 02:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
02:23:01.150 --> 02:23:01.160 align:start position:0%
blanket recommendations and I think a
 
02:23:03.030 --> 02:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
lot of people just go along with it
 
02:23:04.830 --> 02:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
particularly because they don't have to
 
02:23:09.389 --> 02:23:09.399 align:start position:0%
pay for it I would wager that 90% of the
 
02:23:11.510 --> 02:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
people that got the multiple covid
 
02:23:13.750 --> 02:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
vaccines if they had to pay for it
 
02:23:16.269 --> 02:23:16.279 align:start position:0%
themselves would say no I'm not paying
 
02:23:19.309 --> 02:23:19.319 align:start position:0%
for this so just quick follow up so just
 
02:23:21.469 --> 02:23:21.479 align:start position:0%
to clarify y because I'm trying to
 
02:23:24.950 --> 02:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
understand and getting at this idea of
 
02:23:29.750 --> 02:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
voluntary compliance if you knew that
 
02:23:32.550 --> 02:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
the path was not one of Ru making but
 
02:23:35.349 --> 02:23:35.359 align:start position:0%
the path was one that the legislature
 
02:23:37.550 --> 02:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
debated would you be a person that would
 
02:23:40.590 --> 02:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
say okay these are the mandated drugs
 
02:23:43.670 --> 02:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
for my children to get into school and
 
02:23:45.230 --> 02:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
I'm comfortable I'm more comfortable
 
02:23:46.950 --> 02:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
with this passing the other one so I'm
 
02:23:51.110 --> 02:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
going to comply so would it would it
 
02:23:53.830 --> 02:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
make you Mr chairman I'm going to point
 
02:23:56.630 --> 02:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
of order okay point of order this bill
 
02:24:00.150 --> 02:24:00.160 align:start position:0%
is not about voluntary compliance the
 
02:24:02.309 --> 02:24:02.319 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
02:24:08.830 --> 02:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
about how we make rules and it seems to
 
02:24:11.870 --> 02:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
me like we're getting fairly far away
 
02:24:15.230 --> 02:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
from the actual substance of the bill
 
02:24:17.910 --> 02:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
and we still have a number of people to
 
02:24:21.790 --> 02:24:21.800 align:start position:0%
be heard and we're already 20 minutes
 
02:24:25.349 --> 02:24:25.359 align:start position:0%
over time and I wonder
 
02:24:28.510 --> 02:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
if this is actually relevant to this
 
02:24:30.030 --> 02:24:30.040 align:start position:0%
bill or
 
02:24:32.349 --> 02:24:32.359 align:start position:0%
not I I'll give you a quick answer the
 
02:24:34.230 --> 02:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
answer is yes I would feel better if it
 
02:24:35.990 --> 02:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
was legislated rather than it came down
 
02:24:38.630 --> 02:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
as a rule from the CDC of the Department
 
02:24:41.550 --> 02:24:41.560 align:start position:0%
of Health thank you and and thank you
 
02:24:44.429 --> 02:24:44.439 align:start position:0%
and and and I I I respect uh the members
 
02:24:46.070 --> 02:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
point of order the reason that I was
 
02:24:48.110 --> 02:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
asking the question is because uh the
 
02:24:49.790 --> 02:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
gentleman had mentioned that he had
 
02:24:49.800 --> 02:24:50.870 align:start position:0%
gentleman had mentioned that he had
tried

02:24:50.870 --> 02:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
tried
 
02:24:53.429 --> 02:24:53.439 align:start position:0%
to kind of work his way around because
 
02:24:54.950 --> 02:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
it was a mandate and he was trying to
 
02:24:56.950 --> 02:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
work his way around it and so I was just
 
02:25:00.429 --> 02:25:00.439 align:start position:0%
wondering um representative Weber if if
 
02:25:02.590 --> 02:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
this was established would he try to
 
02:25:04.349 --> 02:25:04.359 align:start position:0%
work his way around or would he just
 
02:25:06.110 --> 02:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
comply and I was just trying understand
 
02:25:08.110 --> 02:25:08.120 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't change my point of order
 
02:25:10.910 --> 02:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
thank you hey anyone else before we move
 
02:25:15.790 --> 02:25:15.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:18.910 --> 02:25:18.920 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Christine
 
02:25:21.830 --> 02:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
arau from the the pediatrician
 
02:25:23.389 --> 02:25:23.399 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire American
 
02:25:25.990 --> 02:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:28.670 --> 02:25:28.680 align:start position:0%
Pediatrics you've asked for up to five
 
02:25:30.349 --> 02:25:30.359 align:start position:0%
minutes if you could keep it to three i'
 
02:25:32.710 --> 02:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate it absolutely um I submitted
 
02:25:34.269 --> 02:25:34.279 align:start position:0%
some online testimony so I'm going to
 
02:25:36.670 --> 02:25:36.680 align:start position:0%
try to be brief thank you for hearing my
 
02:25:39.510 --> 02:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
testimony today my name is Dr Christine
 
02:25:41.990 --> 02:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
Arno I'm a primary care pediatrician
 
02:25:44.030 --> 02:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
here in conquer I'm the vice president
 
02:25:46.429 --> 02:25:46.439 align:start position:0%
of the American Academy of Pediatrics
 
02:25:48.790 --> 02:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire chapter and um I'm
 
02:25:50.990 --> 02:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of myself and the
 
02:25:54.150 --> 02:25:54.160 align:start position:0%
chapter we strongly oppose House Bill
 
02:25:56.590 --> 02:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
357 um and I do want to start by saying
 
02:25:59.309 --> 02:25:59.319 align:start position:0%
that this bill is so alarming to
 
02:26:03.590 --> 02:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
pediatricians across the country that um
 
02:26:06.429 --> 02:26:06.439 align:start position:0%
the AAP National actually reached out to
 
02:26:08.269 --> 02:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
us we our state chapter had already
 
02:26:10.030 --> 02:26:10.040 align:start position:0%
flagged this bill as something we wanted
 
02:26:11.990 --> 02:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we opposed but the
 
02:26:13.670 --> 02:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
national headquarters reached out to us
 
02:26:15.150 --> 02:26:15.160 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that we were aware of
 
02:26:17.429 --> 02:26:17.439 align:start position:0%
it they represent 70,000 pediatricians
 
02:26:19.349 --> 02:26:19.359 align:start position:0%
in all 50 states and this Rose to their
 
02:26:19.359 --> 02:26:21.950 align:start position:0%
in all 50 states and this Rose to their
attention

02:26:21.950 --> 02:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
attention
 
02:26:25.230 --> 02:26:25.240 align:start position:0%
um many of the reasons why are similar
 
02:26:26.830 --> 02:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
to the what the Department of Health
 
02:26:28.710 --> 02:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
said removing the flexibility to add new
 
02:26:30.349 --> 02:26:30.359 align:start position:0%
vaccines based on emerging Health
 
02:26:32.070 --> 02:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
threats or scientific
 
02:26:34.910 --> 02:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
advances um we're all aware of the
 
02:26:37.190 --> 02:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
measel outbreak and that infectious
 
02:26:39.950 --> 02:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
diseases outbreaks are still out there I
 
02:26:42.670 --> 02:26:42.680 align:start position:0%
understand that measles is a vaccine
 
02:26:44.389 --> 02:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
that would still be recommended um but
 
02:26:45.830 --> 02:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
I'm just using that as an example of
 
02:26:47.670 --> 02:26:47.680 align:start position:0%
something that people didn't worry about
 
02:26:50.550 --> 02:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
10 years ago um and now have to um we
 
02:26:52.230 --> 02:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
are getting a lot of calls at our office
 
02:26:55.030 --> 02:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
here in town worried parents
 
02:26:58.990 --> 02:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
about that measles outbreak um again I
 
02:27:00.710 --> 02:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
submitted written testimony so I am
 
02:27:02.590 --> 02:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
going to try to just speak to some of
 
02:27:05.510 --> 02:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
the um things I've heard here today one
 
02:27:08.150 --> 02:27:08.160 align:start position:0%
thing that keeps coming up um that I
 
02:27:11.469 --> 02:27:11.479 align:start position:0%
keep hearing is um that many vaccine
 
02:27:14.269 --> 02:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
preventable illnesses um are not as
 
02:27:16.590 --> 02:27:16.600 align:start position:0%
impactful for otherwise healthy
 
02:27:19.710 --> 02:27:19.720 align:start position:0%
kids and I think that um what I want to
 
02:27:22.070 --> 02:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
say about that is that sometimes they
 
02:27:24.590 --> 02:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
are sometimes otherwise healthy kids do
 
02:27:26.630 --> 02:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
suffer severe consequences from these
 
02:27:29.590 --> 02:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine preventable illnesses and also
 
02:27:31.830 --> 02:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
that not all kids are otherwise healthy
 
02:27:34.870 --> 02:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
kids so our job at you know your job as
 
02:27:37.950 --> 02:27:37.960 align:start position:0%
legislators is to protect all kids right
 
02:27:39.630 --> 02:27:39.640 align:start position:0%
my job as a pediatrician is to protect
 
02:27:43.670 --> 02:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
all kids um and there are some children
 
02:27:45.790 --> 02:27:45.800 align:start position:0%
who are extremely vulnerable either
 
02:27:47.230 --> 02:27:47.240 align:start position:0%
because they are too young to be
 
02:27:48.910 --> 02:27:48.920 align:start position:0%
vaccinated or because they have
 
02:27:50.510 --> 02:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
underlying health conditions that
 
02:27:53.429 --> 02:27:53.439 align:start position:0%
prevent them from being vaccinated if we
 
02:27:57.550 --> 02:27:57.560 align:start position:0%
do not require these vaccines in the
 
02:28:02.230 --> 02:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
schools children may attend school bring
 
02:28:04.150 --> 02:28:04.160 align:start position:0%
an illness to the school and then
 
02:28:06.510 --> 02:28:06.520 align:start position:0%
another child can bring that illness
 
02:28:08.550 --> 02:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
home and affect a sibling who is
 
02:28:10.790 --> 02:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
vulnerable and not able to be vaccinated
 
02:28:12.590 --> 02:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
so we have to work together to protect
 
02:28:14.830 --> 02:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
all children another thing to keep in
 
02:28:17.910 --> 02:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
mind is that um nationally 90% of
 
02:28:20.830 --> 02:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
parents vaccinate their children on
 
02:28:23.550 --> 02:28:23.560 align:start position:0%
the regular recommended schedule so that
 
02:28:26.429 --> 02:28:26.439 align:start position:0%
is really the majority and I think
 
02:28:28.269 --> 02:28:28.279 align:start position:0%
sometimes we can forget about that and
 
02:28:30.830 --> 02:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
feel that we're not representing the
 
02:28:32.830 --> 02:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
majority if we recommend these
 
02:28:35.870 --> 02:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
immunization immunization schedules okay
 
02:28:38.790 --> 02:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
so um the other thing I just wanted to
 
02:28:42.110 --> 02:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
say is um Hib hemophilus influenza one
 
02:28:44.230 --> 02:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
of the vaccines that is recommended to
 
02:28:46.590 --> 02:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
be taken off um this vaccine was
 
02:28:48.309 --> 02:28:48.319 align:start position:0%
introduced 34 years ago so I'm just
 
02:28:50.269 --> 02:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
going to briefly share a colleague story
 
02:28:51.670 --> 02:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
because I don't actually I've never seen
 
02:28:54.150 --> 02:28:54.160 align:start position:0%
a kid with severe disease from Hib my
 
02:28:55.870 --> 02:28:55.880 align:start position:0%
colleague Dr Patricia Edwards did her
 
02:28:58.110 --> 02:28:58.120 align:start position:0%
residency in the 1980s and shared with
 
02:29:00.550 --> 02:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
me a story of um a young boy who
 
02:29:02.990 --> 02:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately died went so rapidly from
 
02:29:05.269 --> 02:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
being a healthy child to passing away
 
02:29:08.150 --> 02:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
that his father was in disbelief and was
 
02:29:10.550 --> 02:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
um asking the medical team where the
 
02:29:12.110 --> 02:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
child was was sure that he must be
 
02:29:14.870 --> 02:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
hiding somewhere because his um descent
 
02:29:17.230 --> 02:29:17.240 align:start position:0%
from healthy to unfortunately dead was
 
02:29:20.790 --> 02:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
so rapid um Hib is a very dangerous
 
02:29:24.070 --> 02:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
disease it's a bacterial illness um it's
 
02:29:27.110 --> 02:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
not the flu Hib is hop influenza
 
02:29:30.269 --> 02:29:30.279 align:start position:0%
bacteria it can also cause epiglottitis
 
02:29:32.630 --> 02:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
which can lead to Suffocation of a child
 
02:29:34.389 --> 02:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
if not treated rapidly with a breathing
 
02:29:36.070 --> 02:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
tube and IV antibiotics thank you for
 
02:29:38.790 --> 02:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
listening to my testimony please oppose
 
02:29:40.590 --> 02:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
vote inexpedient to legislate for House
 
02:29:42.790 --> 02:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
Bill 357 which threatens the safety of
 
02:29:45.349 --> 02:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
newer children thank you I'll take any
 
02:29:46.790 --> 02:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
questions yeah representative Lucas
 
02:29:48.670 --> 02:29:48.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr
 
02:29:50.670 --> 02:29:50.680 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for for taking my
 
02:29:54.550 --> 02:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
question um I earlier on I had a
 
02:29:56.630 --> 02:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
question that wasn't answered um and I
 
02:29:58.190 --> 02:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
was wondering if you might be able to
 
02:30:00.710 --> 02:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
provide the statistics on the rate of
 
02:30:02.950 --> 02:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
hospitalization of children who are
 
02:30:05.590 --> 02:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
infected with measles the rate of
 
02:30:07.990 --> 02:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
hospitalization for measles I believe it
 
02:30:10.190 --> 02:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
was um in the current Texas outbreak
 
02:30:11.790 --> 02:30:11.800 align:start position:0%
it's about
 
02:30:15.150 --> 02:30:15.160 align:start position:0%
133% thank you yes and one point about
 
02:30:17.389 --> 02:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
that that I just wanted to some people
 
02:30:19.110 --> 02:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
so we actually try to avoid
 
02:30:20.750 --> 02:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
hospitalizing children with measles if
 
02:30:22.990 --> 02:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
at all possible because it is so very
 
02:30:25.670 --> 02:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
contagious so really children are only
 
02:30:27.590 --> 02:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
Hospital hospitalized with measles if
 
02:30:30.870 --> 02:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
they are very very sick um so those
 
02:30:34.190 --> 02:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
rates may actually seem lower than you
 
02:30:36.070 --> 02:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
would expect because of that follow
 
02:30:39.630 --> 02:30:39.640 align:start position:0%
follow uh could you define very very
 
02:30:43.830 --> 02:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
sick um requiring IV fluids requiring IV
 
02:30:45.670 --> 02:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
antibiotics for a secondary infection
 
02:30:48.830 --> 02:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
such as a secondary pneumonia um those
 
02:30:50.710 --> 02:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
would be my require ing breathing
 
02:30:52.389 --> 02:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
support such as a breathing tube for a
 
02:30:54.630 --> 02:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
secondary pneumonia those would be my
 
02:30:57.309 --> 02:30:57.319 align:start position:0%
examples yeah thank you anyone else
 
02:30:59.670 --> 02:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
representative CLE R thank you Mr chair
 
02:31:02.510 --> 02:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
so quick uh looking at the your your
 
02:31:05.269 --> 02:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
argument here the rules that would
 
02:31:08.309 --> 02:31:08.319 align:start position:0%
remove these items specifically or these
 
02:31:10.830 --> 02:31:10.840 align:start position:0%
uh conditions let's say um is the
 
02:31:12.670 --> 02:31:12.680 align:start position:0%
argument that you are concerned about
 
02:31:15.030 --> 02:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
but the other argument is who has the
 
02:31:17.269 --> 02:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
authority to make these rules what is
 
02:31:19.070 --> 02:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
your stance on that specifically in the
 
02:31:20.429 --> 02:31:20.439 align:start position:0%
medical field
 
02:31:23.710 --> 02:31:23.720 align:start position:0%
um I believe that the public health
 
02:31:26.750 --> 02:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
experts who have trained in the arena
 
02:31:29.309 --> 02:31:29.319 align:start position:0%
you know have degrees in public health
 
02:31:33.349 --> 02:31:33.359 align:start position:0%
have gone to school for this field are
 
02:31:36.950 --> 02:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
more appropriate to be making decisions
 
02:31:40.030 --> 02:31:40.040 align:start position:0%
about public health matters for you know
 
02:31:42.230 --> 02:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
I think it would be somewhat silly to
 
02:31:44.349 --> 02:31:44.359 align:start position:0%
ask Dr Chan to make a decision about the
 
02:31:47.590 --> 02:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
roads in conquered you know but in in
 
02:31:51.070 --> 02:31:51.080 align:start position:0%
his expertise or in the expertise of the
 
02:31:53.070 --> 02:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
Department Public Health is what they
 
02:31:54.349 --> 02:31:54.359 align:start position:0%
have studied for their whole lives and
 
02:31:55.630 --> 02:31:55.640 align:start position:0%
so I think it is most appropriate for
 
02:31:58.030 --> 02:31:58.040 align:start position:0%
them to be making those decisions thank
 
02:32:00.230 --> 02:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:32:02.670 --> 02:32:02.680 align:start position:0%
McGrath thank you Mr chair and thanks
 
02:32:05.950 --> 02:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my question one thing I never
 
02:32:07.670 --> 02:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
could understand
 
02:32:11.670 --> 02:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
is we give babies one food at a time how
 
02:32:13.429 --> 02:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
is it that we give them six
 
02:32:15.710 --> 02:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
immunizations at the same
 
02:32:20.429 --> 02:32:20.439 align:start position:0%
time so I think you know one thing that
 
02:32:21.790 --> 02:32:21.800 align:start position:0%
has been really helpful for me as a
 
02:32:23.950 --> 02:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
pediatrician I also have three children
 
02:32:27.030 --> 02:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
and that experience really shaped so
 
02:32:30.070 --> 02:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
much of my understanding of parents
 
02:32:33.790 --> 02:32:33.800 align:start position:0%
um fears and you know I understand that
 
02:32:37.630 --> 02:32:37.640 align:start position:0%
it can seem overwhelming to um take an
 
02:32:40.269 --> 02:32:40.279 align:start position:0%
action to give a vaccine rather than
 
02:32:42.830 --> 02:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
sort of sitting back and really hoping
 
02:32:44.950 --> 02:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
that your kid doesn't get sick that
 
02:32:47.870 --> 02:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
feels like an inaction and and can
 
02:32:49.950 --> 02:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes be easier to swallow but but
 
02:32:51.590 --> 02:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
the truth is the reason we give those
 
02:32:54.670 --> 02:32:54.680 align:start position:0%
vaccines to young babies is because that
 
02:32:58.150 --> 02:32:58.160 align:start position:0%
is when they're the most vulnerable
 
02:33:02.269 --> 02:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
um babies die from from these illnesses
 
02:33:06.750 --> 02:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
whereas you know 12 15 year olds maybe
 
02:33:08.389 --> 02:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
have they're a bit hardier they're a bit
 
02:33:13.110 --> 02:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
stronger um they're not as vulnerable
 
02:33:15.950 --> 02:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
but little babies are really vulnerable
 
02:33:17.710 --> 02:33:17.720 align:start position:0%
to these diseases and that's why we have
 
02:33:21.990 --> 02:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
to protect them early um and so I can
 
02:33:25.269 --> 02:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
understand why parents feel worried
 
02:33:27.590 --> 02:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
about that process but if you look at
 
02:33:30.150 --> 02:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
the data and you really consider what
 
02:33:32.830 --> 02:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
the risk is of not immunizing those
 
02:33:37.630 --> 02:33:37.640 align:start position:0%
children the the it it is very clear to
 
02:33:40.870 --> 02:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
me that immunization is the safer Choice
 
02:33:43.469 --> 02:33:43.479 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else one quick question
 
02:33:45.309 --> 02:33:45.319 align:start position:0%
one rep representative elberger thank
 
02:33:48.469 --> 02:33:48.479 align:start position:0%
you um do you know of any drugs that
 
02:33:50.870 --> 02:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
have no side effects no negative side
 
02:33:53.190 --> 02:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
effects no thank
 
02:33:57.349 --> 02:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:12.429 --> 02:34:12.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:14.950 --> 02:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
Condon thank you um my name is Laura
 
02:34:17.790 --> 02:34:17.800 align:start position:0%
Condon I'm from Bedford I'm a volunteer
 
02:34:19.429 --> 02:34:19.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire director of advocacy with
 
02:34:21.790 --> 02:34:21.800 align:start position:0%
the National vaccine information center
 
02:34:23.630 --> 02:34:23.640 align:start position:0%
and we work to educate and inform and
 
02:34:25.510 --> 02:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
assist the public with information about
 
02:34:27.910 --> 02:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
vaccines vaccine requirements and their
 
02:34:29.910 --> 02:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
rights under the law we assist those
 
02:34:32.429 --> 02:34:32.439 align:start position:0%
who've been injured by vaccines and I've
 
02:34:34.190 --> 02:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
also served as five years as public
 
02:34:35.710 --> 02:34:35.720 align:start position:0%
member on the board of directors of the
 
02:34:38.389 --> 02:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
vaccine Association and I have and maybe
 
02:34:39.790 --> 02:34:39.800 align:start position:0%
I'm the only person in the room who's
 
02:34:42.150 --> 02:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
been through the rules process when it
 
02:34:44.230 --> 02:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
comes to vaccination and now I'm going
 
02:34:46.429 --> 02:34:46.439 align:start position:0%
to go off my script here because I think
 
02:34:48.510 --> 02:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
there's important points here made that
 
02:34:49.990 --> 02:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
need to be corrected you need need some
 
02:34:53.510 --> 02:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
more information um number one this bill
 
02:34:56.230 --> 02:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
is not about vaccine mandates whether
 
02:34:58.030 --> 02:34:58.040 align:start position:0%
you should mandate or not this bill is
 
02:34:59.950 --> 02:34:59.960 align:start position:0%
not about the merits of particular
 
02:35:02.670 --> 02:35:02.680 align:start position:0%
vaccines this bill does not remove any
 
02:35:04.750 --> 02:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine requirements in including the
 
02:35:08.469 --> 02:35:08.479 align:start position:0%
three in rules this bill is simply about
 
02:35:09.790 --> 02:35:09.800 align:start position:0%
who should
 
02:35:12.349 --> 02:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
decide what vaccine mandates there
 
02:35:14.950 --> 02:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
should be should it be the legislature
 
02:35:17.309 --> 02:35:17.319 align:start position:0%
with all you people and all us people a
 
02:35:20.550 --> 02:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
very public very thorough very open
 
02:35:24.389 --> 02:35:24.399 align:start position:0%
process or should be be the very closed
 
02:35:27.349 --> 02:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
exclusionary process of rulle making
 
02:35:30.309 --> 02:35:30.319 align:start position:0%
without public input and I can tell you
 
02:35:32.750 --> 02:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
you do not have public input there so
 
02:35:34.830 --> 02:35:34.840 align:start position:0%
that's who should decide and I think
 
02:35:37.309 --> 02:35:37.319 align:start position:0%
that speaks to representative mlan
 
02:35:39.190 --> 02:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
you've asked the question over and over
 
02:35:42.950 --> 02:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
again how can we build the public trust
 
02:35:45.870 --> 02:35:45.880 align:start position:0%
and confidence in what our Public Health
 
02:35:48.710 --> 02:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
authorities are recommending requiring
 
02:35:51.110 --> 02:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
and when you shut shut out the public
 
02:35:53.830 --> 02:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
when you shut out parents concerns when
 
02:35:57.670 --> 02:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
you censor them you you undermine public
 
02:36:01.469 --> 02:36:01.479 align:start position:0%
TRS 100% this really needs to be a
 
02:36:03.790 --> 02:36:03.800 align:start position:0%
legislative process and let me remind
 
02:36:07.070 --> 02:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
you that the V seven vaccines listed in
 
02:36:09.750 --> 02:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
statute they were put there by the
 
02:36:12.830 --> 02:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
Legislative process by people like you
 
02:36:14.510 --> 02:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
by people like all of us who've
 
02:36:17.110 --> 02:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
testified today they put seven vaccines
 
02:36:20.030 --> 02:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
in statute they did that they could had
 
02:36:24.110 --> 02:36:24.120 align:start position:0%
more um so I will tell you um yes
 
02:36:28.750 --> 02:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
voluntary use is very high um someone
 
02:36:30.590 --> 02:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
asked if they were aware of any children
 
02:36:32.710 --> 02:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
who've died from vaccines I'm going to
 
02:36:36.190 --> 02:36:36.200 align:start position:0%
give you a name his name is Ryan Johnson
 
02:36:39.190 --> 02:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
he was 15 months old perfectly healthy
 
02:36:41.389 --> 02:36:41.399 align:start position:0%
child from nashille New Hampshire I know
 
02:36:44.389 --> 02:36:44.399 align:start position:0%
his parents um very well and I feel
 
02:36:45.950 --> 02:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
comfortable using his name they've
 
02:36:48.510 --> 02:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
testified here before he was only 15
 
02:36:49.910 --> 02:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
months old given rud routine
 
02:36:51.910 --> 02:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
vaccinations given a clean bill of
 
02:36:55.269 --> 02:36:55.279 align:start position:0%
health and he was dead just days later
 
02:36:57.190 --> 02:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
after receiving five routine
 
02:36:59.870 --> 02:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
vaccinations yes there are real children
 
02:37:02.510 --> 02:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire who die following
 
02:37:07.590 --> 02:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
vaccination um measles um are are are
 
02:37:10.590 --> 02:37:10.600 align:start position:0%
not killing um healthy children we see
 
02:37:12.150 --> 02:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
with this measles outbreak those
 
02:37:14.630 --> 02:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
children that are being hospitalized and
 
02:37:16.389 --> 02:37:16.399 align:start position:0%
large please startop wrapping up there
 
02:37:18.469 --> 02:37:18.479 align:start position:0%
are children with underlying health
 
02:37:20.469 --> 02:37:20.479 align:start position:0%
conditions and for for quarantine
 
02:37:23.790 --> 02:37:23.800 align:start position:0%
reasons the rules process is please ask
 
02:37:25.349 --> 02:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
me questions about that if you're not
 
02:37:28.190 --> 02:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
familiar with it it is a closed process
 
02:37:30.510 --> 02:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
jel car has taken the position over and
 
02:37:33.349 --> 02:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
over and over again that the public has
 
02:37:37.349 --> 02:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
no right to speak about for or against
 
02:37:39.389 --> 02:37:39.399 align:start position:0%
any of the rules that are proposed by
 
02:37:41.550 --> 02:37:41.560 align:start position:0%
government bureaucrats thank you ma'am
 
02:37:43.870 --> 02:37:43.880 align:start position:0%
and in fact government bureaucrats did
 
02:37:47.110 --> 02:37:47.120 align:start position:0%
impose covid shot ma vaccine mandates on
 
02:37:48.870 --> 02:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
children and Foster families and this
 
02:37:48.880 --> 02:37:50.070 align:start position:0%
children and Foster families and this
legisl

02:37:50.070 --> 02:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
legisl
 
02:37:52.590 --> 02:37:52.600 align:start position:0%
had to pass statute to protect those
 
02:37:54.550 --> 02:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
families from covid vaccine mandates so
 
02:37:56.590 --> 02:37:56.600 align:start position:0%
somebody thinks covid vaccine mandates
 
02:37:58.269 --> 02:37:58.279 align:start position:0%
weren't imposed they were and they were
 
02:38:00.429 --> 02:38:00.439 align:start position:0%
done through rule making thank you ma'am
 
02:38:02.110 --> 02:38:02.120 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any of your questions
 
02:38:05.110 --> 02:38:05.120 align:start position:0%
any questions representative
 
02:38:08.429 --> 02:38:08.439 align:start position:0%
Palazo thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:38:11.190 --> 02:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so you you
 
02:38:14.790 --> 02:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned the importance of public uh
 
02:38:19.710 --> 02:38:19.720 align:start position:0%
input but um uh opion of this bill also
 
02:38:24.309 --> 02:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
sometimes uh talk about um uh being able
 
02:38:28.230 --> 02:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
to make some uh uh impartial decision uh
 
02:38:31.550 --> 02:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
not being affected by self-interest so
 
02:38:34.389 --> 02:38:34.399 align:start position:0%
comparing uh Department of Health and
 
02:38:36.309 --> 02:38:36.319 align:start position:0%
Human Services and
 
02:38:39.550 --> 02:38:39.560 align:start position:0%
legislature uh so Department is supposed
 
02:38:42.670 --> 02:38:42.680 align:start position:0%
to be nonp partial believing in science
 
02:38:45.469 --> 02:38:45.479 align:start position:0%
believing in vaccines but uh in
 
02:38:48.230 --> 02:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
legislature people can have different
 
02:38:50.590 --> 02:38:50.600 align:start position:0%
beliefs somebody can believe in natural
 
02:38:53.870 --> 02:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
immunity somebody may be having a
 
02:38:56.670 --> 02:38:56.680 align:start position:0%
business selling some vitamins so
 
02:38:59.070 --> 02:38:59.080 align:start position:0%
there's a concern that legislature is
 
02:39:03.469 --> 02:39:03.479 align:start position:0%
more self-interest or less less
 
02:39:07.070 --> 02:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
impartial could you comment on that yes
 
02:39:09.269 --> 02:39:09.279 align:start position:0%
I think the impartiality is an important
 
02:39:11.309 --> 02:39:11.319 align:start position:0%
point there and let me share with you
 
02:39:12.990 --> 02:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
something that that has changed over the
 
02:39:15.750 --> 02:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
years when those seven vaccines were put
 
02:39:19.830 --> 02:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
into statute by folks like you um DH HS
 
02:39:22.630 --> 02:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
was not in the business of purchasing
 
02:39:24.389 --> 02:39:24.399 align:start position:0%
all the child vaccines in the state
 
02:39:26.469 --> 02:39:26.479 align:start position:0%
doctors can no longer purchase their own
 
02:39:29.830 --> 02:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
inventory and 2002 the commissioner of
 
02:39:32.710 --> 02:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
DHHS DHHS went into the vaccine business
 
02:39:34.349 --> 02:39:34.359 align:start position:0%
in partnership with the vaccine
 
02:39:37.790 --> 02:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
Association so and they receive hundreds
 
02:39:39.790 --> 02:39:39.800 align:start position:0%
of do hundreds of millions of dollars
 
02:39:42.590 --> 02:39:42.600 align:start position:0%
every year from the CDC as an incentive
 
02:39:44.950 --> 02:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
for high vaccination rates the amount of
 
02:39:47.269 --> 02:39:47.279 align:start position:0%
vaccines they purchase they are not no
 
02:39:51.510 --> 02:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
longer in impartial body for determining
 
02:39:53.070 --> 02:39:53.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine requirements because they have a
 
02:39:55.750 --> 02:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
financial incentive in the number of
 
02:39:57.990 --> 02:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
vaccines that are that are turned
 
02:40:00.590 --> 02:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
through um the state here New Hampshire
 
02:40:03.389 --> 02:40:03.399 align:start position:0%
and that what changed in 2002 so I think
 
02:40:05.070 --> 02:40:05.080 align:start position:0%
it's important that we now look at that
 
02:40:08.110 --> 02:40:08.120 align:start position:0%
change and say isn't it appropriate for
 
02:40:10.230 --> 02:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
us to go back to what the legislature
 
02:40:12.670 --> 02:40:12.680 align:start position:0%
did perfectly fine when they put into
 
02:40:15.150 --> 02:40:15.160 align:start position:0%
law the seven vaccine requirements there
 
02:40:17.469 --> 02:40:17.479 align:start position:0%
that are in statute any other
 
02:40:20.110 --> 02:40:20.120 align:start position:0%
questions representative Woods
 
02:40:21.750 --> 02:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:40:22.910 --> 02:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
my question you mentioned the
 
02:40:26.349 --> 02:40:26.359 align:start position:0%
15-month-old to had the number and uh
 
02:40:29.710 --> 02:40:29.720 align:start position:0%
you quoted that he subsequently died yes
 
02:40:32.790 --> 02:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
um he subsequently died uh is there an
 
02:40:35.750 --> 02:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
autopsy report published stating that in
 
02:40:36.750 --> 02:40:36.760 align:start position:0%
fact it
 
02:40:39.790 --> 02:40:39.800 align:start position:0%
was because of uh because uh there's
 
02:40:42.510 --> 02:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
been a fair amount of data from that
 
02:40:45.469 --> 02:40:45.479 align:start position:0%
same agency uh that there's been some
 
02:40:48.230 --> 02:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
separation between following and
 
02:40:48.240 --> 02:40:50.469 align:start position:0%
separation between following and
causation

02:40:50.469 --> 02:40:50.479 align:start position:0%
causation
 
02:40:54.150 --> 02:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
uh well Mary right um thank you for that
 
02:40:57.269 --> 02:40:57.279 align:start position:0%
question Dr Woods um I I've gotten to
 
02:40:58.950 --> 02:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
know this family very well I've read
 
02:41:01.590 --> 02:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
their medical file on their son i' I've
 
02:41:04.190 --> 02:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
read the autopsy report on and
 
02:41:06.870 --> 02:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunately they they miss the the
 
02:41:09.110 --> 02:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
statutory cut off for claim in the
 
02:41:11.150 --> 02:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
vaccine injury Compensation Program for
 
02:41:13.230 --> 02:41:13.240 align:start position:0%
the death of their child so they could
 
02:41:15.269 --> 02:41:15.279 align:start position:0%
not get it proven through that Federal
 
02:41:17.469 --> 02:41:17.479 align:start position:0%
program and the cut off was is they were
 
02:41:19.830 --> 02:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
looking for genetic testing from a heart
 
02:41:22.030 --> 02:41:22.040 align:start position:0%
specialist that was the one last thing
 
02:41:24.150 --> 02:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
they need to rule out of what might have
 
02:41:26.950 --> 02:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
caused other than vaccines their their
 
02:41:29.190 --> 02:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
son's sudden death a perfectly healthy
 
02:41:31.550 --> 02:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
child um and that eventually was ruled
 
02:41:33.750 --> 02:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
out we missed the statute of limitations
 
02:41:35.670 --> 02:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
for it to get you know to be proven in
 
02:41:38.389 --> 02:41:38.399 align:start position:0%
the vaccine injury Compensation Program
 
02:41:41.429 --> 02:41:41.439 align:start position:0%
um but his medical record is very clear
 
02:41:43.630 --> 02:41:43.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative kessle ring
 
02:41:44.990 --> 02:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I want to be quick
 
02:41:46.990 --> 02:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
with this question so you mentioned I
 
02:41:48.710 --> 02:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
heard before from the Department that
 
02:41:51.469 --> 02:41:51.479 align:start position:0%
the heing is required under rulem you
 
02:41:53.590 --> 02:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
said you had experience in ruem can you
 
02:41:55.269 --> 02:41:55.279 align:start position:0%
elaborate more on what you just said
 
02:41:57.269 --> 02:41:57.279 align:start position:0%
about it not being part of the process
 
02:41:58.670 --> 02:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
versus what they said thank you
 
02:42:00.830 --> 02:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
certainly I've had many experiences in
 
02:42:02.590 --> 02:42:02.600 align:start position:0%
the rule making process when it comes to
 
02:42:05.269 --> 02:42:05.279 align:start position:0%
to vaccines not just one the department
 
02:42:07.870 --> 02:42:07.880 align:start position:0%
will hold a public hearing where you can
 
02:42:09.710 --> 02:42:09.720 align:start position:0%
go in and you could testify on their
 
02:42:11.630 --> 02:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
proposed rules and provide them with
 
02:42:15.710 --> 02:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
input and they will consider your
 
02:42:17.910 --> 02:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
input I'll be candidly that that's a
 
02:42:20.349 --> 02:42:20.359 align:start position:0%
joke um you know they might modify a
 
02:42:22.510 --> 02:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
word here or there really and I've seen
 
02:42:25.030 --> 02:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
the the public fill their Auditorium and
 
02:42:26.950 --> 02:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
really there's no material changes made
 
02:42:29.110 --> 02:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
to their rules but that is you know what
 
02:42:30.830 --> 02:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
they consider the public hearing that is
 
02:42:33.469 --> 02:42:33.479 align:start position:0%
not jail car then when you go before a
 
02:42:35.510 --> 02:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
jail car which is a committee of state
 
02:42:38.150 --> 02:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
senators and state reps to listen to the
 
02:42:41.670 --> 02:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
rules I am told repeatedly that I I'm
 
02:42:43.710 --> 02:42:43.720 align:start position:0%
only speaking on their good graces I
 
02:42:46.950 --> 02:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
have no statutory right to speak to the
 
02:42:49.510 --> 02:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
jail car committee and most most of the
 
02:42:51.429 --> 02:42:51.439 align:start position:0%
public is shut out I I've been allowed
 
02:42:53.309 --> 02:42:53.319 align:start position:0%
to speak but I've seen the public
 
02:42:56.550 --> 02:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
otherwise totally shut out on this um
 
02:43:00.030 --> 02:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
and that um if the commissioner under
 
02:43:01.790 --> 02:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law has authority to
 
02:43:04.349 --> 02:43:04.359 align:start position:0%
mandate vaccines that Jael car has taken
 
02:43:06.550 --> 02:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
the position they have no authority to
 
02:43:09.389 --> 02:43:09.399 align:start position:0%
tell him no he can mandate whatever
 
02:43:11.750 --> 02:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
vaccines he wants including Co shots
 
02:43:14.469 --> 02:43:14.479 align:start position:0%
anything other mRNA vaccines that
 
02:43:16.110 --> 02:43:16.120 align:start position:0%
they're now bringing to Market to
 
02:43:18.150 --> 02:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
replace traditional vaccines they have
 
02:43:20.550 --> 02:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
no authority to tell him no because the
 
02:43:22.670 --> 02:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
statute gives him the authority that's
 
02:43:24.550 --> 02:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
what we're seeking to change is to
 
02:43:27.110 --> 02:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
remove that Authority so that the
 
02:43:29.030 --> 02:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
decision making on vaccine mandates goes
 
02:43:31.950 --> 02:43:31.960 align:start position:0%
back to all of you all of us including
 
02:43:34.269 --> 02:43:34.279 align:start position:0%
the doctors and nurses that testify here
 
02:43:36.429 --> 02:43:36.439 align:start position:0%
including Dr Chan and his colleagues
 
02:43:40.110 --> 02:43:40.120 align:start position:0%
there at dhh who testify here no one is
 
02:43:42.309 --> 02:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
cut out of the legislative process like
 
02:43:44.750 --> 02:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
they are through R making thank you
 
02:43:46.590 --> 02:43:46.600 align:start position:0%
anyone else final question
 
02:43:49.349 --> 02:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas thank you Mr chair
 
02:43:51.510 --> 02:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
i' I'd like to Circle back to something
 
02:43:54.590 --> 02:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
you said about the vaccine Association
 
02:43:56.670 --> 02:43:56.680 align:start position:0%
and the financial incentives that are
 
02:44:01.070 --> 02:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
coming down from CDC I think you said um
 
02:44:02.790 --> 02:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
it was my understanding and please
 
02:44:05.469 --> 02:44:05.479 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong that the vacine
 
02:44:07.670 --> 02:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
association is a clearing house and they
 
02:44:10.309 --> 02:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
use the money to buy the vaccines in
 
02:44:13.349 --> 02:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
bulk in order to save patients and
 
02:44:16.230 --> 02:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
practitioners the cost of buying them
 
02:44:19.469 --> 02:44:19.479 align:start position:0%
independently um I guess I don't
 
02:44:20.990 --> 02:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
understand what the incentive is if the
 
02:44:22.830 --> 02:44:22.840 align:start position:0%
if the money is passing through and
 
02:44:24.830 --> 02:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
they're not retaining
 
02:44:27.110 --> 02:44:27.120 align:start position:0%
it thank you for the opportunity to
 
02:44:28.590 --> 02:44:28.600 align:start position:0%
clarify those
 
02:44:30.830 --> 02:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings um and I I served on
 
02:44:32.550 --> 02:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
the board of the vaccine Association for
 
02:44:33.790 --> 02:44:33.800 align:start position:0%
five years I've been attending their
 
02:44:35.870 --> 02:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
meetings for probably 15 years so I know
 
02:44:38.510 --> 02:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
them pretty well they are in partnership
 
02:44:41.389 --> 02:44:41.399 align:start position:0%
with DHHS the way that that program
 
02:44:45.190 --> 02:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
works is that DHHS comes to the vaccine
 
02:44:47.750 --> 02:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
Association and says we're going to you
 
02:44:50.389 --> 02:44:50.399 align:start position:0%
know purchase for $40 million worth of
 
02:44:51.710 --> 02:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
vaccines this year that's about what
 
02:44:54.830 --> 02:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
it's up to now and your share to cover
 
02:44:56.630 --> 02:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
the cost of insured children is say
 
02:44:59.190 --> 02:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
going to be 25 million I'm just picking
 
02:45:02.469 --> 02:45:02.479 align:start position:0%
some round numbers here for you and so
 
02:45:03.790 --> 02:45:03.800 align:start position:0%
During the period of the year the
 
02:45:06.550 --> 02:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
vaccine Association assesses commercial
 
02:45:08.990 --> 02:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
insurers to raise that money so in the
 
02:45:10.550 --> 02:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
following June they have the money in
 
02:45:14.030 --> 02:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
the account to write a check to DHS for
 
02:45:16.750 --> 02:45:16.760 align:start position:0%
those vaccines that DHHS has already
 
02:45:20.269 --> 02:45:20.279 align:start position:0%
purchased all year long DHHS is the one
 
02:45:21.670 --> 02:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
that purchased the vaccines not the
 
02:45:24.469 --> 02:45:24.479 align:start position:0%
vaccine Association DHHS purchase their
 
02:45:26.150 --> 02:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
vaccines from the
 
02:45:29.150 --> 02:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
CDC using the federal vaccines for
 
02:45:30.870 --> 02:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
children contract and that's where they
 
02:45:33.309 --> 02:45:33.319 align:start position:0%
get that discount as a compared to you
 
02:45:35.150 --> 02:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
know a providers who get a much better
 
02:45:37.190 --> 02:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
discount through their if it was done
 
02:45:38.910 --> 02:45:38.920 align:start position:0%
privately but that's how they get theirs
 
02:45:41.190 --> 02:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
and because they're buying from the CDC
 
02:45:45.309 --> 02:45:45.319 align:start position:0%
they have to um you know take um pass
 
02:45:47.469 --> 02:45:47.479 align:start position:0%
down to them all the CDC rules and
 
02:45:50.230 --> 02:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
requirements and the C DC also gives
 
02:45:52.710 --> 02:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
them millions of dollars in Merit based
 
02:45:55.269 --> 02:45:55.279 align:start position:0%
grants based on their volume of vaccine
 
02:45:58.870 --> 02:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
purchases to run their vaccine program
 
02:46:00.550 --> 02:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
and I knew this to be true because when
 
02:46:02.910 --> 02:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
I served on the board it was Marcel
 
02:46:04.230 --> 02:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
babinsky at that time who was
 
02:46:05.349 --> 02:46:05.359 align:start position:0%
represented from the Department of
 
02:46:06.950 --> 02:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and she
 
02:46:08.389 --> 02:46:08.399 align:start position:0%
bragged that that immunization
 
02:46:09.950 --> 02:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
Department wasn't costing anything I
 
02:46:12.190 --> 02:46:12.200 align:start position:0%
said how do you pay your employees and
 
02:46:15.230 --> 02:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
she said well we get money from the CDC
 
02:46:17.750 --> 02:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
the federal government and thank you so
 
02:46:19.790 --> 02:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
I I went and looked up that that grant
 
02:46:21.429 --> 02:46:21.439 align:start position:0%
funding thank you for your testimony
 
02:46:27.830 --> 02:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:30.950 --> 02:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
set uh we will not be taking a FAL lunch
 
02:46:33.070 --> 02:46:33.080 align:start position:0%
uh in order to try to stay as close on
 
02:46:35.429 --> 02:46:35.439 align:start position:0%
schedule as possible obviously we are
 
02:46:37.150 --> 02:46:37.160 align:start position:0%
overtime on this bill and we still have
 
02:46:39.590 --> 02:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
a couple of folks left and we want to
 
02:46:41.790 --> 02:46:41.800 align:start position:0%
try to again stay as close to the time
 
02:46:44.990 --> 02:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
time frame a lot it as possible so next
 
02:46:47.389 --> 02:46:47.399 align:start position:0%

02:46:57.870 --> 02:46:57.880 align:start position:0%
Futures thank you sorry thought you
 
02:47:00.150 --> 02:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
forgot about me before lunch my name is
 
02:47:01.750 --> 02:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
Kate fryan the vice president of
 
02:47:04.230 --> 02:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
advocacy at new Futures new Futures is a
 
02:47:07.990 --> 02:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
nonprofit nonpartisan organization that
 
02:47:09.830 --> 02:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
um works on health and wellness
 
02:47:11.110 --> 02:47:11.120 align:start position:0%
throughout the state of New Hampshire
 
02:47:13.230 --> 02:47:13.240 align:start position:0%
through policy change through this role
 
02:47:15.150 --> 02:47:15.160 align:start position:0%
we work with policy makers Healthcare
 
02:47:18.110 --> 02:47:18.120 align:start position:0%
Providers and communities to make um the
 
02:47:21.070 --> 02:47:21.080 align:start position:0%
grand state as healthy as possible um
 
02:47:23.309 --> 02:47:23.319 align:start position:0%
I'll just be very brief I have written
 
02:47:25.510 --> 02:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
testimony just again saying when
 
02:47:27.190 --> 02:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
children receive all recommended
 
02:47:28.950 --> 02:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
immunizations on time our whole
 
02:47:31.750 --> 02:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
Community benefits higher vaccination
 
02:47:34.670 --> 02:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
rates help create Community immunity and
 
02:47:37.349 --> 02:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
also policies and regulations help
 
02:47:39.110 --> 02:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
communities ensure that all children get
 
02:47:40.710 --> 02:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to grow up healthy and
 
02:47:42.870 --> 02:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
safe and families can participate in
 
02:47:45.550 --> 02:47:45.560 align:start position:0%
life activities and parents Miss less
 
02:47:47.309 --> 02:47:47.319 align:start position:0%
time away from work so it's good for our
 
02:47:49.309 --> 02:47:49.319 align:start position:0%
economy too but to get to the the point
 
02:47:51.309 --> 02:47:51.319 align:start position:0%
of the bill that's come up a few times
 
02:47:54.469 --> 02:47:54.479 align:start position:0%
is on Ru making in my previous life I
 
02:47:56.790 --> 02:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
did write rules for the division of
 
02:47:58.910 --> 02:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
Public Health Services and another
 
02:48:01.910 --> 02:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
agency and so I think the recommendation
 
02:48:05.790 --> 02:48:05.800 align:start position:0%
of having a very detailed um Memo from
 
02:48:08.309 --> 02:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
the office of legislative services that
 
02:48:10.870 --> 02:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
oversees the rule making process for the
 
02:48:13.110 --> 02:48:13.120 align:start position:0%
state is an excellent idea and I just
 
02:48:15.389 --> 02:48:15.399 align:start position:0%
want to clear up a few things when I was
 
02:48:17.469 --> 02:48:17.479 align:start position:0%
trained on rul making I was told what
 
02:48:19.870 --> 02:48:19.880 align:start position:0%
the law does the think of it as in terms
 
02:48:23.469 --> 02:48:23.479 align:start position:0%
of maps almost it's the satellite
 
02:48:26.030 --> 02:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
version of where you want to go the very
 
02:48:28.389 --> 02:48:28.399 align:start position:0%
high level version and then the rules
 
02:48:30.710 --> 02:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
are almost like the detailed GPS turn
 
02:48:33.230 --> 02:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
right turn left turn right turn left and
 
02:48:35.429 --> 02:48:35.439 align:start position:0%
so traditionally and you will find this
 
02:48:39.030 --> 02:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
across all agencies is that rules are
 
02:48:41.910 --> 02:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
very specific especially with something
 
02:48:43.429 --> 02:48:43.439 align:start position:0%
like this rule when you talk about the
 
02:48:45.030 --> 02:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
number of doses when you talk about the
 
02:48:47.830 --> 02:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
number of timing you need that detail
 
02:48:51.150 --> 02:48:51.160 align:start position:0%
specifity in rules it doesn't fit as
 
02:48:53.550 --> 02:48:53.560 align:start position:0%
well in law the other thing I want to
 
02:48:56.389 --> 02:48:56.399 align:start position:0%
say is there is legislative input for
 
02:48:58.269 --> 02:48:58.279 align:start position:0%
The Joint Committee legislative
 
02:49:00.150 --> 02:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
administrative rules that's the name
 
02:49:02.830 --> 02:49:02.840 align:start position:0%
there are legislators on that committee
 
02:49:05.269 --> 02:49:05.279 align:start position:0%
um and so as you heard there are 3 to
 
02:49:08.110 --> 02:49:08.120 align:start position:0%
six months to have the rules um go
 
02:49:10.670 --> 02:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
through sometimes longer um depending
 
02:49:13.750 --> 02:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
how the public comment period um the
 
02:49:15.389 --> 02:49:15.399 align:start position:0%
amount of revisions the department has
 
02:49:16.990 --> 02:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
to make they are all reviewed by the
 
02:49:18.870 --> 02:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
lawyers of office of legislative
 
02:49:22.030 --> 02:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
services and then the legislators on The
 
02:49:25.030 --> 02:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
Joint Committee of administrative rules
 
02:49:28.190 --> 02:49:28.200 align:start position:0%
then hears those rules one of the
 
02:49:31.070 --> 02:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
conditions for Ru making for a rule not
 
02:49:33.830 --> 02:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
going through is um if there's a
 
02:49:35.590 --> 02:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of public comment
 
02:49:37.670 --> 02:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
against the rule it's been a while since
 
02:49:39.110 --> 02:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
I've written rules but that was the
 
02:49:41.510 --> 02:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
process that um I remember when in my
 
02:49:44.429 --> 02:49:44.439 align:start position:0%
rle making days but again I do think um
 
02:49:45.910 --> 02:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
a memo or something from Office
 
02:49:48.269 --> 02:49:48.279 align:start position:0%
legislative Services would be helpful in
 
02:49:49.670 --> 02:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
understanding that road
 
02:49:52.950 --> 02:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
map and that's all thank you very much
 
02:49:52.960 --> 02:49:53.950 align:start position:0%
map and that's all thank you very much
any

02:49:53.950 --> 02:49:53.960 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:49:56.110 --> 02:49:56.120 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:49:58.070 --> 02:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
mlan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:50:00.229 --> 02:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so just just from
 
02:50:03.190 --> 02:50:03.200 align:start position:0%
your rulemaking experience if this bill
 
02:50:07.750 --> 02:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
was to become law um am I correct in
 
02:50:10.670 --> 02:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
understanding that the ru making would
 
02:50:13.550 --> 02:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
still exist the GPS portion would still
 
02:50:16.590 --> 02:50:16.600 align:start position:0%
exist except now the satellite portion
 
02:50:19.870 --> 02:50:19.880 align:start position:0%
instead of coming from 8 HS a satellite
 
02:50:21.950 --> 02:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
portion that would be the part that goes
 
02:50:23.389 --> 02:50:23.399 align:start position:0%
back to the
 
02:50:25.510 --> 02:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
legislature uh that could be the case
 
02:50:27.510 --> 02:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
but I think what what is really tricky
 
02:50:29.349 --> 02:50:29.359 align:start position:0%
with this rule is it with this
 
02:50:32.429 --> 02:50:32.439 align:start position:0%
particular issue is that there's there's
 
02:50:35.590 --> 02:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
very specific regulations of Doses and
 
02:50:37.950 --> 02:50:37.960 align:start position:0%
timing and things like that and so you
 
02:50:40.550 --> 02:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
would need that road map I think and it
 
02:50:42.349 --> 02:50:42.359 align:start position:0%
would be very different from other
 
02:50:44.550 --> 02:50:44.560 align:start position:0%
agencies who have similar rules like
 
02:50:46.750 --> 02:50:46.760 align:start position:0%
this it'd be a very different
 
02:50:49.229 --> 02:50:49.239 align:start position:0%
process follow up so I again though but
 
02:50:52.429 --> 02:50:52.439 align:start position:0%
just to clarify if this bill passes that
 
02:50:53.790 --> 02:50:53.800 align:start position:0%
would still that would be that part
 
02:50:55.750 --> 02:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
would be unchanged the only thing that
 
02:51:00.150 --> 02:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
would change is just which drugs to have
 
02:51:03.790 --> 02:51:03.800 align:start position:0%
but the dosage and the the frequency and
 
02:51:06.150 --> 02:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
you know the delivery modalities all
 
02:51:08.429 --> 02:51:08.439 align:start position:0%
that stuff even if this passes would
 
02:51:11.190 --> 02:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
still be in Ru making corre I think you
 
02:51:12.790 --> 02:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
I don't read it that way I think that
 
02:51:14.150 --> 02:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
would all have to be in the law I'll
 
02:51:15.670 --> 02:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
look at it again but I don't read it
 
02:51:18.229 --> 02:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
that way you're welcome any other
 
02:51:19.950 --> 02:51:19.960 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:51:22.990 --> 02:51:23.000 align:start position:0%
delus thank you Mr
 
02:51:26.990 --> 02:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
chairman so we do have the RSA right now
 
02:51:30.710 --> 02:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
that at this point does require the
 
02:51:32.750 --> 02:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
diptheria and the Ms and all of these
 
02:51:32.760 --> 02:51:35.030 align:start position:0%
diptheria and the Ms and all of these
different

02:51:35.030 --> 02:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:51:35.040 --> 02:51:37.670 align:start position:0%
different
vaccines

02:51:37.670 --> 02:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
02:51:40.269 --> 02:51:40.279 align:start position:0%
so that was done by the
 
02:51:42.710 --> 02:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
legislature so if the legislature has
 
02:51:46.590 --> 02:51:46.600 align:start position:0%
the power to do that why is it not able
 
02:51:49.309 --> 02:51:49.319 align:start position:0%
now to decide whether whether or not
 
02:51:53.750 --> 02:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
these other uh vaccines that are being
 
02:51:56.070 --> 02:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
removed from the
 
02:51:58.750 --> 02:51:58.760 align:start position:0%
list have control over that I mean it
 
02:52:02.469 --> 02:52:02.479 align:start position:0%
would be it it just makes no sense what
 
02:52:06.670 --> 02:52:06.680 align:start position:0%
you're saying because we the the
 
02:52:09.229 --> 02:52:09.239 align:start position:0%
the aren't the vaccines that are
 
02:52:10.550 --> 02:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
required right
 
02:52:13.229 --> 02:52:13.239 align:start position:0%
now don't they have a little road map
 
02:52:15.150 --> 02:52:15.160 align:start position:0%
how much you give how much you do in
 
02:52:17.830 --> 02:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
rule they do in rule in rule they do
 
02:52:19.670 --> 02:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
okay follow up
 
02:52:25.190 --> 02:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
so if the legislature is going to take
 
02:52:29.429 --> 02:52:29.439 align:start position:0%
back the power and have the people
 
02:52:33.030 --> 02:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
involved in in in figuring out what's
 
02:52:34.830 --> 02:52:34.840 align:start position:0%
best as far as
 
02:52:34.840 --> 02:52:36.590 align:start position:0%
best as far as
the

02:52:36.590 --> 02:52:36.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:52:38.990 --> 02:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
immunizations that would be
 
02:52:42.110 --> 02:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
prescribed where they go if they don't
 
02:52:44.110 --> 02:52:44.120 align:start position:0%
they don't have to
 
02:52:46.550 --> 02:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
be mandated
 
02:52:49.309 --> 02:52:49.319 align:start position:0%
basically and certainly the doctors that
 
02:52:51.309 --> 02:52:51.319 align:start position:0%
take care of the the parents and the
 
02:52:54.150 --> 02:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
children could decide you know if the
 
02:52:55.870 --> 02:52:55.880 align:start position:0%
and recommend to the parents what their
 
02:52:57.950 --> 02:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
children should get doesn't it make
 
02:53:01.349 --> 02:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
sense that we would continue that as the
 
02:53:05.150 --> 02:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
legislature being able to uh determine
 
02:53:08.389 --> 02:53:08.399 align:start position:0%
what would go into the statute that
 
02:53:12.150 --> 02:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
already exists I think what I understand
 
02:53:14.110 --> 02:53:14.120 align:start position:0%
your point thank you for the question I
 
02:53:16.070 --> 02:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
do think though what you have to keep in
 
02:53:19.030 --> 02:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
mind is the detail of the doses and the
 
02:53:23.670 --> 02:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
ages and that would have to be in law
 
02:53:27.190 --> 02:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
too all right any final questions being
 
02:53:30.269 --> 02:53:30.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:42.710 --> 02:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:45.309 --> 02:53:45.319 align:start position:0%
York thank you Mr chair and members of
 
02:53:45.319 --> 02:53:46.070 align:start position:0%
York thank you Mr chair and members of
the

02:53:46.070 --> 02:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:53:49.309 --> 02:53:49.319 align:start position:0%
committee uh I didn't do my homework and
 
02:53:52.510 --> 02:53:52.520 align:start position:0%
I did not look at uh the rules of the
 
02:53:54.349 --> 02:53:54.359 align:start position:0%
rule baking committee and who's on the
 
02:53:56.590 --> 02:53:56.600 align:start position:0%
committee and what sort of background do
 
02:53:59.429 --> 02:53:59.439 align:start position:0%
they have but I think representative
 
02:54:02.550 --> 02:54:02.560 align:start position:0%
Weber made a very good suggestion that
 
02:54:04.229 --> 02:54:04.239 align:start position:0%
all the members that are gathered around
 
02:54:07.070 --> 02:54:07.080 align:start position:0%
this horseshoe table really to ought to
 
02:54:10.630 --> 02:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
study that and really determine how that
 
02:54:13.349 --> 02:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
takes place on what's behind it all so
 
02:54:13.359 --> 02:54:14.630 align:start position:0%
takes place on what's behind it all so
thank

02:54:14.630 --> 02:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:54:18.630 --> 02:54:18.640 align:start position:0%
you uh my concern is that the current uh
 
02:54:21.790 --> 02:54:21.800 align:start position:0%
recommendations that come out of HHS
 
02:54:29.389 --> 02:54:29.399 align:start position:0%
are reflective of uh CDC um and I think
 
02:54:33.190 --> 02:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
the CDC in the last five years has taken
 
02:54:34.670 --> 02:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of Wrong
 
02:54:38.670 --> 02:54:38.680 align:start position:0%
Turns um I I I I they've really um in
 
02:54:41.349 --> 02:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
number of cases have given advice that
 
02:54:44.750 --> 02:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
was turn out to be
 
02:54:47.790 --> 02:54:47.800 align:start position:0%
wrongful uh they have on their list of
 
02:54:50.389 --> 02:54:50.399 align:start position:0%
recommended vaccines a number of ones
 
02:54:52.229 --> 02:54:52.239 align:start position:0%
that aren't required for school
 
02:54:55.070 --> 02:54:55.080 align:start position:0%
admission but uh the nonsensical
 
02:54:57.830 --> 02:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
inclusion of hepatitis B for a newborn
 
02:55:01.030 --> 02:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
baby uh I can't wrap my head around that
 
02:55:05.469 --> 02:55:05.479 align:start position:0%
as one they have a few others
 
02:55:08.510 --> 02:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
HPV uh which is a pretty dangerous
 
02:55:08.520 --> 02:55:09.750 align:start position:0%
HPV uh which is a pretty dangerous
vaccine

02:55:09.750 --> 02:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
02:55:12.950 --> 02:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
historically uh it's a recommended not
 
02:55:16.110 --> 02:55:16.120 align:start position:0%
required uh the covid shots for children
 
02:55:19.750 --> 02:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
and newborns uh absur I mean children
 
02:55:22.550 --> 02:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
should get covid and develop robust
 
02:55:25.550 --> 02:55:25.560 align:start position:0%
natural immunity be exposed to the whole
 
02:55:28.710 --> 02:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
virus not just the dangerous Spike
 
02:55:30.950 --> 02:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
Protein that's
 
02:55:33.670 --> 02:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
nonsensical so I worry that some of
 
02:55:36.190 --> 02:55:36.200 align:start position:0%
these other vaccines would get on the
 
02:55:39.950 --> 02:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
schedule for the required School uh
 
02:55:39.960 --> 02:55:41.670 align:start position:0%
schedule for the required School uh
School

02:55:41.670 --> 02:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
School
 
02:55:45.790 --> 02:55:45.800 align:start position:0%
admission um in closing I would just um
 
02:55:48.710 --> 02:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
add that our state epidemiology olist
 
02:55:51.190 --> 02:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
said that he has no plans to add covid
 
02:55:54.990 --> 02:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
to the required shots but the fact that
 
02:55:57.389 --> 02:55:57.399 align:start position:0%
uh they have the power to do it if they
 
02:56:01.389 --> 02:56:01.399 align:start position:0%
so decide worries me very much so leave
 
02:56:03.630 --> 02:56:03.640 align:start position:0%
those decisions to citizens of the New
 
02:56:05.830 --> 02:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who are able to come here and
 
02:56:08.030 --> 02:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
testify they're able to bring uh
 
02:56:10.229 --> 02:56:10.239 align:start position:0%
national International experts to the
 
02:56:14.030 --> 02:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
table to testify on occasion uh so
 
02:56:17.950 --> 02:56:17.960 align:start position:0%
please support uh HP 357 thank you thank
 
02:56:17.960 --> 02:56:19.150 align:start position:0%
please support uh HP 357 thank you thank
you

02:56:19.150 --> 02:56:19.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:56:20.710 --> 02:56:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh representative plaz off and then
 
02:56:23.550 --> 02:56:23.560 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas uh thank you Mr
 
02:56:26.870 --> 02:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking uh my
 
02:56:31.030 --> 02:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
question you mention uh hepatitis B
 
02:56:34.349 --> 02:56:34.359 align:start position:0%
vaccine for newborn children that maybe
 
02:56:37.870 --> 02:56:37.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense but we we heard
 
02:56:42.309 --> 02:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
testimonies that nurses are very afraid
 
02:56:46.070 --> 02:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh of persons who are not vaccinated
 
02:56:49.469 --> 02:56:49.479 align:start position:0%
from Hepatitis B uh could you comment I
 
02:56:51.389 --> 02:56:51.399 align:start position:0%
don't fully understand why they're
 
02:56:53.790 --> 02:56:53.800 align:start position:0%
concerned if they can be vaccinated
 
02:56:59.429 --> 02:56:59.439 align:start position:0%
themselves uh but uh what's your uh I
 
02:57:01.309 --> 02:57:01.319 align:start position:0%
agree with you 100% there's been other
 
02:57:03.590 --> 02:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
questions about what if my unvaccinated
 
02:57:06.389 --> 02:57:06.399 align:start position:0%
child has a measles and then exposes
 
02:57:08.910 --> 02:57:08.920 align:start position:0%
other people but if you believe that the
 
02:57:11.070 --> 02:57:11.080 align:start position:0%
vaccines are effective why are you
 
02:57:13.510 --> 02:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
afraid if you believe they work which
 
02:57:18.429 --> 02:57:18.439 align:start position:0%
they don't always work to 100% for sure
 
02:57:21.229 --> 02:57:21.239 align:start position:0%
so vaccination is an individual choice
 
02:57:25.309 --> 02:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
is to protect individuals not for a
 
02:57:31.389 --> 02:57:31.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:34.710 --> 02:57:34.720 align:start position:0%

at
 
02:59:17.309 --> 02:59:17.319 align:start position:0%
correcting an unanticipated problem that
 
02:59:19.389 --> 02:59:19.399 align:start position:0%
arose when we pass legislation several
 
02:59:22.469 --> 02:59:22.479 align:start position:0%
years ago uh through this committee
 
02:59:24.630 --> 02:59:24.640 align:start position:0%
actually um that was aimed at
 
02:59:26.229 --> 02:59:26.239 align:start position:0%
simplifying the religious exemption
 
02:59:27.790 --> 02:59:27.800 align:start position:0%
process for
 
02:59:32.389 --> 02:59:32.399 align:start position:0%
parents um in 2022 uh we the the house
 
02:59:34.830 --> 02:59:34.840 align:start position:0%
passed House Bill
 
02:59:37.349 --> 02:59:37.359 align:start position:0%
1035 that went on to the Senate was
 
02:59:38.990 --> 02:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
passed there and was signed into law by
 
02:59:41.110 --> 02:59:41.120 align:start position:0%
the governor Prime sponsor of that
 
02:59:43.550 --> 02:59:43.560 align:start position:0%
legislation was uh at the time
 
02:59:45.990 --> 02:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
representative Tim Lang who most of you
 
02:59:49.110 --> 02:59:49.120 align:start position:0%
know now as Senator Tim Lang
 
02:59:52.190 --> 02:59:52.200 align:start position:0%
the bill analysis that is the short uh
 
02:59:55.550 --> 02:59:55.560 align:start position:0%
blurb at the top of the uh of the draft
 
02:59:58.070 --> 02:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
legislation uh stated very simply this
 
03:00:00.510 --> 03:00:00.520 align:start position:0%
bill removes the requirement that a
 
03:00:02.670 --> 03:00:02.680 align:start position:0%
parent request for a religious exemption
 
03:00:04.510 --> 03:00:04.520 align:start position:0%
to immunizations required for School
 
03:00:06.750 --> 03:00:06.760 align:start position:0%
attendance be notorized
 
03:00:09.790 --> 03:00:09.800 align:start position:0%
that was the intent of the bill to
 
03:00:11.150 --> 03:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
remove the requirement that it be
 
03:00:13.229 --> 03:00:13.239 align:start position:0%
notorized so it was intended to simplify
 
03:00:14.710 --> 03:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
the process for
 
03:00:18.110 --> 03:00:18.120 align:start position:0%
parents um but unfortunately there was a
 
03:00:20.670 --> 03:00:20.680 align:start position:0%
single word in that bill that um created
 
03:00:23.510 --> 03:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
some controversy following its passage
 
03:00:25.870 --> 03:00:25.880 align:start position:0%
and that bill that word was
 
03:00:28.590 --> 03:00:28.600 align:start position:0%
form previously there was no standard
 
03:00:31.349 --> 03:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
form the passage of a bill with the word
 
03:00:34.870 --> 03:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
form in it uh prompted the Department of
 
03:00:37.510 --> 03:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services to create a
 
03:00:40.830 --> 03:00:40.840 align:start position:0%
form um this raised several issues and
 
03:00:44.110 --> 03:00:44.120 align:start position:0%
the the bill sponsor now Senator Lang uh
 
03:00:46.670 --> 03:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
raised some serious concerns uh about
 
03:00:48.309 --> 03:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
the the changes or the the
 
03:00:51.150 --> 03:00:51.160 align:start position:0%
implementation of a form and some of the
 
03:00:54.990 --> 03:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
questions uh that were on it so
 
03:00:57.990 --> 03:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
um first and foremost the new
 
03:01:01.070 --> 03:01:01.080 align:start position:0%
form asked and still asks parents to
 
03:01:03.990 --> 03:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
disclose which vaccines their children
 
03:01:05.790 --> 03:01:05.800 align:start position:0%
will not be receiving or haven't
 
03:01:08.469 --> 03:01:08.479 align:start position:0%
received um Senator Lang raised the
 
03:01:10.710 --> 03:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
concern that that information might be
 
03:01:15.429 --> 03:01:15.439 align:start position:0%
used um you know to to bring some
 
03:01:17.269 --> 03:01:17.279 align:start position:0%
accusations of neglect against parents
 
03:01:19.269 --> 03:01:19.279 align:start position:0%
who who had chosen to forgo a
 
03:01:22.630 --> 03:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
vaccination he also um asserted that you
 
03:01:25.510 --> 03:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
know he believes that it it could
 
03:01:27.030 --> 03:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
violate the right to live free from
 
03:01:29.070 --> 03:01:29.080 align:start position:0%
government intrusion in private personal
 
03:01:30.990 --> 03:01:31.000 align:start position:0%
information which is natural essential
 
03:01:33.630 --> 03:01:33.640 align:start position:0%
and inherent uh which is now part of our
 
03:01:36.190 --> 03:01:36.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:01:38.389 --> 03:01:38.399 align:start position:0%
Constitution so there was a an initial
 
03:01:39.830 --> 03:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
version of the form and then later the
 
03:01:41.429 --> 03:01:41.439 align:start position:0%
department changed it so the initial
 
03:01:45.030 --> 03:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
version actually had uh three places
 
03:01:48.269 --> 03:01:48.279 align:start position:0%
that they were asking parents to initial
 
03:01:50.389 --> 03:01:50.399 align:start position:0%
um to acknowledge certain risks the risk
 
03:01:52.309 --> 03:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
of Contracting a disease the risk of
 
03:01:54.550 --> 03:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
transmitting a disease and the risk of
 
03:01:56.070 --> 03:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
being excluded from the school or
 
03:01:58.590 --> 03:01:58.600 align:start position:0%
daycare center that they attend uh the
 
03:02:00.190 --> 03:02:00.200 align:start position:0%
form required parents or Guardians to
 
03:02:02.710 --> 03:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
initial each of those warnings
 
03:02:05.790 --> 03:02:05.800 align:start position:0%
individually um the department has since
 
03:02:07.950 --> 03:02:07.960 align:start position:0%
revised the form to remove those first
 
03:02:10.630 --> 03:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
two warnings and to remove the uh the
 
03:02:12.469 --> 03:02:12.479 align:start position:0%
three places where parents were to
 
03:02:14.830 --> 03:02:14.840 align:start position:0%
initial it um and simply have a
 
03:02:16.229 --> 03:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
signature at the bottom of the form they
 
03:02:18.389 --> 03:02:18.399 align:start position:0%
do still um
 
03:02:21.309 --> 03:02:21.319 align:start position:0%
disclose that parents or Guardians uh
 
03:02:22.870 --> 03:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
you know should be aware that their
 
03:02:24.830 --> 03:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
children may be in the event of an of an
 
03:02:26.990 --> 03:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
outbreak their children may be excluded
 
03:02:28.670 --> 03:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
from attending the school or daycare
 
03:02:31.269 --> 03:02:31.279 align:start position:0%
center uh that they normally attend if
 
03:02:35.830 --> 03:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
they are not vaccinated um so I I do
 
03:02:37.190 --> 03:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
believe that the changes that were made
 
03:02:38.550 --> 03:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
to the Forum were a step in the right
 
03:02:41.110 --> 03:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
direction um however since schools are
 
03:02:43.990 --> 03:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
now arguing that parents must use that
 
03:02:46.190 --> 03:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
specific form uh that was not the
 
03:02:48.870 --> 03:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
original intent uh um the purpose of
 
03:02:50.630 --> 03:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
this bill is quite
 
03:02:53.269 --> 03:02:53.279 align:start position:0%
simple which is to clarify
 
03:02:55.269 --> 03:02:55.279 align:start position:0%
unequivocally uh that the statute should
 
03:02:57.990 --> 03:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
reflect the original intent of that bill
 
03:03:00.469 --> 03:03:00.479 align:start position:0%
which was again to quote remove the
 
03:03:01.910 --> 03:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
requirement that a parent request for
 
03:03:03.590 --> 03:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
religious exemption to immunizations
 
03:03:05.510 --> 03:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
required for School attendance be
 
03:03:09.150 --> 03:03:09.160 align:start position:0%
notorized uh so uh that is the intent of
 
03:03:11.790 --> 03:03:11.800 align:start position:0%
the bill that ends my testimony and I'll
 
03:03:15.910 --> 03:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
be happy to take any questions any
 
03:03:18.710 --> 03:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
questions wow
 
03:03:18.720 --> 03:03:25.550 align:start position:0%
questions wow
thank

03:03:25.550 --> 03:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:27.830 --> 03:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is
 
03:03:32.429 --> 03:03:32.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:34.830 --> 03:03:34.840 align:start position:0%
Alon thank you Mr chairman and members
 
03:03:37.030 --> 03:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
of the committee um I was through the
 
03:03:39.229 --> 03:03:39.239 align:start position:0%
record my name is Erica Leon I represent
 
03:03:41.910 --> 03:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 13 which is the town of Derry
 
03:03:44.429 --> 03:03:44.439 align:start position:0%
I was a member of this committee um when
 
03:03:47.110 --> 03:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
the this bill uh the original bill was
 
03:03:49.630 --> 03:03:49.640 align:start position:0%
passed I was also a member of jel car
 
03:03:52.229 --> 03:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
when the form was adopted throughout the
 
03:03:54.229 --> 03:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
entire process there was never any
 
03:03:56.469 --> 03:03:56.479 align:start position:0%
expectation that this would be an exclus
 
03:03:58.150 --> 03:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
that that the form in current use would
 
03:04:00.870 --> 03:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
be an exclusive form when we approve the
 
03:04:02.710 --> 03:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
form offered by the health by the
 
03:04:04.190 --> 03:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
03:04:07.190 --> 03:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
in Jael car it was under the idea that
 
03:04:09.630 --> 03:04:09.640 align:start position:0%
it was one potential form that as a
 
03:04:11.750 --> 03:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
convenience a parent could sign but
 
03:04:13.670 --> 03:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
never under the expectation that it was
 
03:04:16.870 --> 03:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
the only way to um actually show that
 
03:04:19.670 --> 03:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
you were using a religious exemption the
 
03:04:21.710 --> 03:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
way that this entire process has been
 
03:04:23.670 --> 03:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
implemented has been very contrary to
 
03:04:26.630 --> 03:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
legislative intent um the intent is that
 
03:04:29.269 --> 03:04:29.279 align:start position:0%
a parent simply says we have a religious
 
03:04:31.469 --> 03:04:31.479 align:start position:0%
exemption we have a religious objection
 
03:04:35.070 --> 03:04:35.080 align:start position:0%
to vaccination and that that is accepted
 
03:04:37.110 --> 03:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
this bill and this language is required
 
03:04:38.830 --> 03:04:38.840 align:start position:0%
in order to follow through on that
 
03:04:41.389 --> 03:04:41.399 align:start position:0%
because having a religious test having
 
03:04:43.870 --> 03:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
something where you need to put out
 
03:04:46.590 --> 03:04:46.600 align:start position:0%
these specifics and these details um is
 
03:04:48.590 --> 03:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
not helpful and it just builds upon the
 
03:04:50.389 --> 03:04:50.399 align:start position:0%
skepticism because people feel that they
 
03:04:52.750 --> 03:04:52.760 align:start position:0%
are being singled out for their religion
 
03:04:55.670 --> 03:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
for their choices and as we all know the
 
03:04:57.710 --> 03:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
issue of vaccination has become far too
 
03:04:59.790 --> 03:04:59.800 align:start position:0%
contentious people should be looking at
 
03:05:01.630 --> 03:05:01.640 align:start position:0%
the underlying data and science but
 
03:05:03.510 --> 03:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
right now A lot of people are fueled by
 
03:05:05.630 --> 03:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
emotions the more that we can take that
 
03:05:08.030 --> 03:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
out of the equation and stop being
 
03:05:10.510 --> 03:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
overly intrusive into people's lives the
 
03:05:12.550 --> 03:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
better and I ask that you pass this
 
03:05:13.870 --> 03:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
because the form that we approved in
 
03:05:16.870 --> 03:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
Jael car was never intended to be used
 
03:05:19.030 --> 03:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
as a sole exclusive form in order to
 
03:05:21.510 --> 03:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
show give your religious exemption so I
 
03:05:22.990 --> 03:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
ask that you fix this fix this by
 
03:05:26.269 --> 03:05:26.279 align:start position:0%
passing this Bill thank you thank you
 
03:05:26.279 --> 03:05:28.269 align:start position:0%

and I'm a joined by Dr Benjamin Chan who

is our state epidemiologist and an
 
03:06:23.910 --> 03:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
infectious disease physician we are here
 
03:06:28.269 --> 03:06:28.279 align:start position:0%
to express concerns today on HB 358 that
 
03:06:31.950 --> 03:06:31.960 align:start position:0%
is relative to use of the a religious
 
03:06:35.030 --> 03:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
exemption form currently
 
03:06:38.750 --> 03:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
RSA 141 c20c allows for medical and
 
03:06:40.590 --> 03:06:40.600 align:start position:0%
religious exemptions to school and child
 
03:06:42.070 --> 03:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
care immunization
 
03:06:44.830 --> 03:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
requirements this change that this bill
 
03:06:47.070 --> 03:06:47.080 align:start position:0%
would allow would be in lie of a signed
 
03:06:50.429 --> 03:06:50.439 align:start position:0%
statement in lie of a form assigned
 
03:06:54.630 --> 03:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
statement which could be simply an email
 
03:06:57.150 --> 03:06:57.160 align:start position:0%
or handwritten note if this bill were to
 
03:07:01.710 --> 03:07:01.720 align:start position:0%
pass the department has concerns that um
 
03:07:04.910 --> 03:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
that this would take away a standardized
 
03:07:06.910 --> 03:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
way for schools to collect this schools
 
03:07:08.349 --> 03:07:08.359 align:start position:0%
and child carees to collect this
 
03:07:11.550 --> 03:07:11.560 align:start position:0%
information this this benefits them in
 
03:07:14.269 --> 03:07:14.279 align:start position:0%
having a defined process with clear
 
03:07:16.030 --> 03:07:16.040 align:start position:0%
information collected so they can
 
03:07:19.269 --> 03:07:19.279 align:start position:0%
clearly identify which which child is
 
03:07:22.030 --> 03:07:22.040 align:start position:0%
seeking this exemption and then also
 
03:07:24.349 --> 03:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
there is an optional section as was
 
03:07:27.389 --> 03:07:27.399 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the in previous testimony
 
03:07:29.790 --> 03:07:29.800 align:start position:0%
that to disclose which specific
 
03:07:33.150 --> 03:07:33.160 align:start position:0%
immunizations were um are being Exempted
 
03:07:35.990 --> 03:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
because not all parents exempt all from
 
03:07:38.550 --> 03:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
all not all parents choose to exempt
 
03:07:41.030 --> 03:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
their children from all immunizations
 
03:07:43.469 --> 03:07:43.479 align:start position:0%
they may choose certain ones so this is
 
03:07:46.110 --> 03:07:46.120 align:start position:0%
this is a way for a school or child care
 
03:07:48.710 --> 03:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
care to clearly ident Iden ify which
 
03:07:51.710 --> 03:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
child and which which immunizations
 
03:07:53.910 --> 03:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
exemption is being sought this becomes
 
03:07:57.630 --> 03:07:57.640 align:start position:0%
very important in the um event of a uh
 
03:08:00.030 --> 03:08:00.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine pres preventable outbreak in a
 
03:08:03.750 --> 03:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
school where children that do not have
 
03:08:06.389 --> 03:08:06.399 align:start position:0%
um proof of immunization would be ex
 
03:08:08.510 --> 03:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
required to be excluded to prevent
 
03:08:09.830 --> 03:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
spread of that
 
03:08:12.710 --> 03:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
illness um in recent years as was
 
03:08:14.349 --> 03:08:14.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned there have been
 
03:08:16.990 --> 03:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
barriers to parents um that have been
 
03:08:17.000 --> 03:08:18.150 align:start position:0%
barriers to parents um that have been
removed

03:08:18.150 --> 03:08:18.160 align:start position:0%
removed
 
03:08:20.590 --> 03:08:20.600 align:start position:0%
such as the
 
03:08:20.600 --> 03:08:22.269 align:start position:0%
such as the
notorized

03:08:22.269 --> 03:08:22.279 align:start position:0%
notorized
 
03:08:26.070 --> 03:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
that since this has been uh since since
 
03:08:28.670 --> 03:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
this time there has been an increase in
 
03:08:30.990 --> 03:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
religious exemptions current Department
 
03:08:34.469 --> 03:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
data from the 2024 2025 school year
 
03:08:39.150 --> 03:08:39.160 align:start position:0%
indicates that um 5781 students that's
 
03:08:41.830 --> 03:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
3.3% of all students have claimed
 
03:08:44.389 --> 03:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
exemptions religious exemptions from
 
03:08:46.469 --> 03:08:46.479 align:start position:0%
immunization and this when you compare
 
03:08:50.389 --> 03:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
this to the 20 21 2022 school year
 
03:08:53.190 --> 03:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
4216 students had claimed that religious
 
03:08:55.070 --> 03:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
exemption and that was 2% of all
 
03:08:57.950 --> 03:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
students so just in that in that short
 
03:09:01.870 --> 03:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
time um ease of ease of the requirement
 
03:09:04.070 --> 03:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
taking away that notarization may have
 
03:09:07.550 --> 03:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
had an impact in the increase in the
 
03:09:07.560 --> 03:09:08.830 align:start position:0%
had an impact in the increase in the
religious

03:09:08.830 --> 03:09:08.840 align:start position:0%
religious
 
03:09:12.229 --> 03:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
exemptions we feel that the form is as
 
03:09:13.309 --> 03:09:13.319 align:start position:0%
and there's copies that have been
 
03:09:15.670 --> 03:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
distributed to you is is a very simple
 
03:09:18.309 --> 03:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
form and it ALS it it serves the benefit
 
03:09:21.429 --> 03:09:21.439 align:start position:0%
of the school administration in having a
 
03:09:23.830 --> 03:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
standardized way of receiving that
 
03:09:28.229 --> 03:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
information so again we we would like to
 
03:09:31.510 --> 03:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
emphasize that we think keeping our
 
03:09:34.750 --> 03:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
children with high vaccination rates is
 
03:09:36.469 --> 03:09:36.479 align:start position:0%
important to the protection of not only
 
03:09:38.510 --> 03:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
students within that that school and
 
03:09:41.150 --> 03:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
child care but also our whole community
 
03:09:42.870 --> 03:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
and we would be happy to answer any
 
03:09:45.750 --> 03:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have thank you
 
03:09:48.389 --> 03:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas and representative
 
03:09:51.349 --> 03:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
palazov um in looking at the form and
 
03:09:52.910 --> 03:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thanks for
 
03:09:56.790 --> 03:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I read that uh
 
03:09:59.070 --> 03:09:59.080 align:start position:0%
please specify vaccines for which is
 
03:10:01.389 --> 03:10:01.399 align:start position:0%
exemption applies
 
03:10:03.910 --> 03:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
optional the information is voluntary
 
03:10:05.469 --> 03:10:05.479 align:start position:0%
and if you choose not to provide the
 
03:10:08.030 --> 03:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
requested information it will not impact
 
03:10:11.070 --> 03:10:11.080 align:start position:0%
religious exemption is that current
 
03:10:13.550 --> 03:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
that's current yes thank you
 
03:10:13.560 --> 03:10:14.590 align:start position:0%
that's current yes thank you
representative

03:10:14.590 --> 03:10:14.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:10:17.830 --> 03:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
palazov uh thank you Mr chair thank you
 
03:10:20.309 --> 03:10:20.319 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so you you
 
03:10:24.469 --> 03:10:24.479 align:start position:0%
mentioned how this uh standardized form
 
03:10:29.110 --> 03:10:29.120 align:start position:0%
may help uh uh schools uh uh how it can
 
03:10:32.110 --> 03:10:32.120 align:start position:0%
help your department and are there any
 
03:10:35.790 --> 03:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
scenarios when Department have access uh
 
03:10:38.990 --> 03:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
to detailed information in this form I I
 
03:10:42.830 --> 03:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
see you provided uh overall numbers of
 
03:10:47.790 --> 03:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
uh uh uh students who took uh this
 
03:10:51.990 --> 03:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
exemptions so you uh you probably
 
03:10:55.229 --> 03:10:55.239 align:start position:0%
receive that statistics from school but
 
03:10:58.670 --> 03:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
uh does it matter for Department uh that
 
03:11:01.790 --> 03:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
form is in its current
 
03:11:06.389 --> 03:11:06.399 align:start position:0%
form so so the form doesn't this form it
 
03:11:08.630 --> 03:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
would only be the serve the benefit in
 
03:11:10.630 --> 03:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
the event of an outbreak because it
 
03:11:13.710 --> 03:11:13.720 align:start position:0%
facilitates the school administration
 
03:11:16.790 --> 03:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
from from helping them to document which
 
03:11:16.800 --> 03:11:17.750 align:start position:0%
from from helping them to document which
children

03:11:17.750 --> 03:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
children
 
03:11:19.429 --> 03:11:19.439 align:start position:0%
have claimed that religious exemption
 
03:11:21.429 --> 03:11:21.439 align:start position:0%
and may need to be excluded from school
 
03:11:23.469 --> 03:11:23.479 align:start position:0%
but the the department doesn't collect
 
03:11:25.750 --> 03:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
this form on a regular basis it's simply
 
03:11:28.630 --> 03:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
a tool to be used for schools and child
 
03:11:30.670 --> 03:11:30.680 align:start position:0%
carees to help them collect this
 
03:11:33.309 --> 03:11:33.319 align:start position:0%
information in a standardized
 
03:11:36.469 --> 03:11:36.479 align:start position:0%
way um chair if I can also quickly add
 
03:11:38.550 --> 03:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
that this this form is kept in by the
 
03:11:41.429 --> 03:11:41.439 align:start position:0%
school it's the purpose of this form is
 
03:11:43.830 --> 03:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
for the school to record and document
 
03:11:46.110 --> 03:11:46.120 align:start position:0%
which students might have a religious
 
03:11:48.269 --> 03:11:48.279 align:start position:0%
exemption this for form does not come to
 
03:11:50.110 --> 03:11:50.120 align:start position:0%
the department we do not have
 
03:11:52.190 --> 03:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
information to my knowledge at least at
 
03:11:53.670 --> 03:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
the department level on each and every
 
03:11:55.710 --> 03:11:55.720 align:start position:0%
child that has an exemption this this is
 
03:11:58.070 --> 03:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
collected and stored at the school level
 
03:12:00.870 --> 03:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
but we get aggregate reports um which I
 
03:12:02.469 --> 03:12:02.479 align:start position:0%
think is what Colleen was talking about
 
03:12:05.309 --> 03:12:05.319 align:start position:0%
in terms of the the exemption rates um
 
03:12:07.510 --> 03:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
and the forms can also become important
 
03:12:10.429 --> 03:12:10.439 align:start position:0%
if for example there's a you know a kid
 
03:12:12.349 --> 03:12:12.359 align:start position:0%
with measles at school for example where
 
03:12:13.950 --> 03:12:13.960 align:start position:0%
we have to go into the school and say
 
03:12:16.269 --> 03:12:16.279 align:start position:0%
all right which which kids in this
 
03:12:20.110 --> 03:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
classroom or which kids in this area um
 
03:12:23.990 --> 03:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
are who are exposed to measles aren't
 
03:12:25.710 --> 03:12:25.720 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and we try and connect them
 
03:12:27.309 --> 03:12:27.319 align:start position:0%
with appropriate care but you know at
 
03:12:29.309 --> 03:12:29.319 align:start position:0%
the end of the day you know a disease
 
03:12:31.870 --> 03:12:31.880 align:start position:0%
like measles is highly infectious and so
 
03:12:33.429 --> 03:12:33.439 align:start position:0%
there may need to be consideration for
 
03:12:35.990 --> 03:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
exclusion if kids are not immunized to
 
03:12:38.190 --> 03:12:38.200 align:start position:0%
stop an outbreak and that's where you
 
03:12:39.510 --> 03:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
know working with the school that has
 
03:12:42.910 --> 03:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
the form can come into play and be
 
03:12:45.510 --> 03:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
important thank you anyone else
 
03:12:48.070 --> 03:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
representative Weber thank you just two
 
03:12:52.389 --> 03:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
quick ones if I may Mr chairman um so in
 
03:12:53.830 --> 03:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
the event of an
 
03:12:58.389 --> 03:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
outbreak um would you be excluding not
 
03:13:00.830 --> 03:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
only the children who are unvaccinated
 
03:13:04.030 --> 03:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
for religious exemption but all children
 
03:13:09.070 --> 03:13:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:13.710 --> 03:13:13.720 align:start position:0%
file um so again going back to so I I
 
03:13:15.990 --> 03:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
think partly it's going to depend um so
 
03:13:17.429 --> 03:13:17.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question it's it's a
 
03:13:19.190 --> 03:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
it's a really good question and I think
 
03:13:20.670 --> 03:13:20.680 align:start position:0%
partly it's going to depend on the
 
03:13:23.030 --> 03:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
situation um but with something like
 
03:13:26.269 --> 03:13:26.279 align:start position:0%
measles for example um there is a
 
03:13:30.190 --> 03:13:30.200 align:start position:0%
requirement for documentation of
 
03:13:32.870 --> 03:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
immunization otherwise there's a
 
03:13:34.190 --> 03:13:34.200 align:start position:0%
consideration that that person be
 
03:13:35.469 --> 03:13:35.479 align:start position:0%
excluded until we can get that
 
03:13:37.630 --> 03:13:37.640 align:start position:0%
documentation so so the documentation
 
03:13:39.030 --> 03:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
aspect of this actually is really
 
03:13:41.550 --> 03:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
important because it impacts actions
 
03:13:43.670 --> 03:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
that are taken at the school and the
 
03:13:46.510 --> 03:13:46.520 align:start position:0%
family level so so if I may follow up on
 
03:13:49.550 --> 03:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
that one so my question wasn't really
 
03:13:53.389 --> 03:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
geared towards documentation it was all
 
03:13:56.229 --> 03:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
children in the event of an outbreak of
 
03:13:56.239 --> 03:13:57.229 align:start position:0%
children in the event of an outbreak of
say

03:13:57.229 --> 03:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
say
 
03:13:59.750 --> 03:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
measles all children who were
 
03:14:02.309 --> 03:14:02.319 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated would be excluded until the
 
03:14:04.070 --> 03:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
outbreak was over is that correct it
 
03:14:06.870 --> 03:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
would not be solely on the basis of
 
03:14:10.150 --> 03:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
somebody's religious beliefs or
 
03:14:13.870 --> 03:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
exemption that's correct thank you um
 
03:14:15.590 --> 03:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
and then I had another quick one but I
 
03:14:18.150 --> 03:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
can't remember what it is so Let It Go
 
03:14:20.110 --> 03:14:20.120 align:start position:0%
representative Woods uh thank you Mr
 
03:14:21.190 --> 03:14:21.200 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
03:14:23.469 --> 03:14:23.479 align:start position:0%
question uh just in terms of complexity
 
03:14:26.349 --> 03:14:26.359 align:start position:0%
of uh and inconvenience and you may not
 
03:14:29.030 --> 03:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
be able to answer this but uh say a
 
03:14:32.750 --> 03:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
child wants to go on a a a a day trip uh
 
03:14:35.990 --> 03:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
they have to have a permission slip
 
03:14:40.590 --> 03:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
uh does this compare to that or or can a
 
03:14:44.229 --> 03:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
parent just send a note like the the um
 
03:14:46.030 --> 03:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
Bill States just send in a piece of
 
03:14:49.030 --> 03:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
paper or do they have to have a form or
 
03:14:50.830 --> 03:14:50.840 align:start position:0%
do you know at this point I'm trying to
 
03:14:53.389 --> 03:14:53.399 align:start position:0%
get some level of what parents are used
 
03:14:56.790 --> 03:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
to So currently they they use the the
 
03:15:00.349 --> 03:15:00.359 align:start position:0%
form that I provided to you this form if
 
03:15:02.990 --> 03:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
this bill were enacted it would it would
 
03:15:04.550 --> 03:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
strip that requirement away and they
 
03:15:07.030 --> 03:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
could just write a handwritten note on a
 
03:15:09.469 --> 03:15:09.479 align:start position:0%
comparative basis if a child wants to do
 
03:15:11.429 --> 03:15:11.439 align:start position:0%
something else do they have to fill out
 
03:15:16.030 --> 03:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
a standard form for a trip or whatever
 
03:15:17.910 --> 03:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
or to the parent just and again you may
 
03:15:19.110 --> 03:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
not be able to answer I mean in my
 
03:15:21.030 --> 03:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
experience as a parent you know not not
 
03:15:22.950 --> 03:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
speaking um necessarily through the
 
03:15:24.950 --> 03:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
department there are forms that are you
 
03:15:26.630 --> 03:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
know typically required for you know
 
03:15:28.910 --> 03:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
trips and I think that that's that's the
 
03:15:31.030 --> 03:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
intent of this form is to have something
 
03:15:33.750 --> 03:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
that is standardized that schools can
 
03:15:36.309 --> 03:15:36.319 align:start position:0%
use um I I believe there's somebody
 
03:15:38.150 --> 03:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
speaking after us from the schools who's
 
03:15:39.710 --> 03:15:39.720 align:start position:0%
going to talk about you know use of
 
03:15:41.590 --> 03:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
these forms in the school system and so
 
03:15:42.990 --> 03:15:43.000 align:start position:0%
they may be more appropriate to answer
 
03:15:45.189 --> 03:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
your question but I think the the intent
 
03:15:46.750 --> 03:15:46.760 align:start position:0%
I mean if you look at the form the form
 
03:15:49.189 --> 03:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
will requires two things identifying who
 
03:15:52.830 --> 03:15:52.840 align:start position:0%
the child is and a signature um and so
 
03:15:55.229 --> 03:15:55.239 align:start position:0%
already this form is essentially
 
03:15:59.189 --> 03:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
assigned assigned uh you know a parent
 
03:16:00.910 --> 03:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
assigning that a child has a religious
 
03:16:02.910 --> 03:16:02.920 align:start position:0%
exemption for a vaccine the purpose of
 
03:16:04.429 --> 03:16:04.439 align:start position:0%
the form is to have a standardized way
 
03:16:06.790 --> 03:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
of recordkeeping that um my
 
03:16:08.070 --> 03:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
understanding is most schools across the
 
03:16:09.710 --> 03:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
state have chosen to adopt because it's
 
03:16:11.630 --> 03:16:11.640 align:start position:0%
useful and beneficial for their
 
03:16:13.469 --> 03:16:13.479 align:start position:0%
administrative internal
 
03:16:17.510 --> 03:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
processes representative Weber my mind
 
03:16:20.309 --> 03:16:20.319 align:start position:0%
taken its leave came back uh I just
 
03:16:23.229 --> 03:16:23.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to verify you spoke of the
 
03:16:24.950 --> 03:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
aggregate the forms being kept at the
 
03:16:27.510 --> 03:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
school level and only aggregated data
 
03:16:30.870 --> 03:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
sent to the Department of Health so um
 
03:16:32.630 --> 03:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
am I correct in assuming that the
 
03:16:36.950 --> 03:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
aggregated data has no um identifying
 
03:16:39.189 --> 03:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
information on specific children just
 
03:16:42.070 --> 03:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
the aggregate numbers from the
 
03:16:44.750 --> 03:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
school that is that is correct thank you
 
03:16:47.389 --> 03:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
schools submit um just their aggregate
 
03:16:49.750 --> 03:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
data to us thank
 
03:16:52.550 --> 03:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
you anyone
 
03:17:00.750 --> 03:17:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:03.389 --> 03:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Pam
 
03:17:05.070 --> 03:17:05.080 align:start position:0%
denapoli from The New Hampshire School
 
03:17:05.080 --> 03:17:19.110 align:start position:0%
denapoli from The New Hampshire School
nurses

03:17:19.110 --> 03:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:21.790 --> 03:17:21.800 align:start position:0%
thank you um Pam denapoli still
 
03:17:24.870 --> 03:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
registered nurse um I
 
03:17:27.150 --> 03:17:27.160 align:start position:0%
um I'm actually a school nurse in the
 
03:17:30.349 --> 03:17:30.359 align:start position:0%
Manchester School District so um we
 
03:17:33.349 --> 03:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
surveyed um our members on this bill and
 
03:17:35.189 --> 03:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
really feel it's unnecessary because we
 
03:17:38.389 --> 03:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
use the form we love the form because if
 
03:17:39.990 --> 03:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
you think about the role of the school
 
03:17:43.070 --> 03:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
nurse we have anywhere from 500 to 1,000
 
03:17:45.790 --> 03:17:45.800 align:start position:0%
children in our schools and we have to
 
03:17:48.389 --> 03:17:48.399 align:start position:0%
keep records on all those children so if
 
03:17:50.790 --> 03:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
we had no standardized way of keeping
 
03:17:54.189 --> 03:17:54.199 align:start position:0%
that records it makes our job very um
 
03:17:57.070 --> 03:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
difficult because it's inefficient often
 
03:17:59.550 --> 03:17:59.560 align:start position:0%
duplicative our kids especially in
 
03:18:02.309 --> 03:18:02.319 align:start position:0%
Manchester they may switch schools two
 
03:18:04.349 --> 03:18:04.359 align:start position:0%
or three times in a school year and to
 
03:18:06.670 --> 03:18:06.680 align:start position:0%
try to keep track if somebody's coming
 
03:18:09.550 --> 03:18:09.560 align:start position:0%
into our district what form did they use
 
03:18:10.790 --> 03:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
how do how do we know there's a
 
03:18:15.229 --> 03:18:15.239 align:start position:0%
religious exemption so um we really feel
 
03:18:17.870 --> 03:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
like this is this is non isue because we
 
03:18:20.670 --> 03:18:20.680 align:start position:0%
use the form the um most of the forms
 
03:18:22.429 --> 03:18:22.439 align:start position:0%
that I get back where it has the little
 
03:18:24.950 --> 03:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
check marks about what your um what
 
03:18:27.630 --> 03:18:27.640 align:start position:0%
you're uh exempting from isn't even
 
03:18:29.710 --> 03:18:29.720 align:start position:0%
filled out it's usually the child's name
 
03:18:32.229 --> 03:18:32.239 align:start position:0%
the parent signature and we C we just
 
03:18:34.670 --> 03:18:34.680 align:start position:0%
document in our computer system
 
03:18:37.510 --> 03:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
religious exemption so at the point
 
03:18:39.830 --> 03:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
where there may be a need to exclude
 
03:18:41.750 --> 03:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
children we would go back to those forms
 
03:18:43.830 --> 03:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
so we would contact the parents and say
 
03:18:46.790 --> 03:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
exactly is your child IMU immunized
 
03:18:49.189 --> 03:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
against measles so we like it when it's
 
03:18:50.750 --> 03:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
filled out but it's not necessarily
 
03:18:53.469 --> 03:18:53.479 align:start position:0%
filled out because it's optional um
 
03:18:55.189 --> 03:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
parents are used to forms what we
 
03:18:57.189 --> 03:18:57.199 align:start position:0%
usually do is that the beginning of the
 
03:18:59.790 --> 03:18:59.800 align:start position:0%
year they get a packet of forms so they
 
03:19:02.150 --> 03:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
get the religious exemption form they
 
03:19:03.910 --> 03:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
get a form if their child's going to get
 
03:19:06.030 --> 03:19:06.040 align:start position:0%
medication in school they get a form if
 
03:19:07.550 --> 03:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
their child's going to go on a on a
 
03:19:09.750 --> 03:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
field trip if they need any special
 
03:19:12.189 --> 03:19:12.199 align:start position:0%
accommodations so they get a packet of
 
03:19:14.830 --> 03:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
forms they sign them they come back to
 
03:19:17.389 --> 03:19:17.399 align:start position:0%
the administration and they go go to the
 
03:19:19.189 --> 03:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
nurse if it's a nurse form they go to
 
03:19:21.870 --> 03:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
the guidance if it's a guidance form so
 
03:19:24.790 --> 03:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
um we're really used to forms and um
 
03:19:27.070 --> 03:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
it's a consistent process that we're
 
03:19:30.309 --> 03:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
used to if if children move across
 
03:19:32.750 --> 03:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
District we have the form we know what
 
03:19:34.229 --> 03:19:34.239 align:start position:0%
to look for we're not looking for a
 
03:19:36.269 --> 03:19:36.279 align:start position:0%
handwritten note somewhere in their
 
03:19:41.389 --> 03:19:41.399 align:start position:0%
file so um this we we just feel like we
 
03:19:43.830 --> 03:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
need we like the form we need the form
 
03:19:45.670 --> 03:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
if the school chooses not to use the
 
03:19:48.030 --> 03:19:48.040 align:start position:0%
form that's up to them it's not required
 
03:19:50.349 --> 03:19:50.359 align:start position:0%
but DHHS sends it to the to the
 
03:19:52.389 --> 03:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
administration they distribute it to us
 
03:19:54.070 --> 03:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
we distribute it to the parents we get
 
03:19:58.309 --> 03:19:58.319 align:start position:0%
it back and it's it's a it's a seamless
 
03:20:00.590 --> 03:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
process and I think in terms of the
 
03:20:02.750 --> 03:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
question about would you exclude a a
 
03:20:04.990 --> 03:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
student if they didn't have immunization
 
03:20:08.510 --> 03:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
on file right now you have 30 days you
 
03:20:11.229 --> 03:20:11.239 align:start position:0%
have 30 days to um if you're if you
 
03:20:12.870 --> 03:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
don't have an immunization record on
 
03:20:14.670 --> 03:20:14.680 align:start position:0%
file or a religious exemption you're
 
03:20:17.189 --> 03:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
automatically excluded from the school
 
03:20:19.910 --> 03:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
so we do a lot of tracing back to to
 
03:20:22.830 --> 03:20:22.840 align:start position:0%
children without the file thank you
 
03:20:24.750 --> 03:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
representative kessle ring thank you Mr
 
03:20:26.150 --> 03:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
chair just a quick question in your
 
03:20:28.670 --> 03:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
experience you said Manchester correct
 
03:20:31.030 --> 03:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
um does this form where does it go and
 
03:20:33.429 --> 03:20:33.439 align:start position:0%
who has access to it if it's turned in
 
03:20:35.429 --> 03:20:35.439 align:start position:0%
it goes to the school nurse and that's
 
03:20:36.950 --> 03:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
that's and then we have all their
 
03:20:38.670 --> 03:20:38.680 align:start position:0%
medical records are usually well they're
 
03:20:41.189 --> 03:20:41.199 align:start position:0%
in a computer system and that we have
 
03:20:42.710 --> 03:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
access to and then they're locked in a
 
03:20:45.349 --> 03:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
file in case this computer system goes
 
03:20:47.429 --> 03:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
down okay thank you
 
03:20:47.439 --> 03:20:48.950 align:start position:0%
down okay thank you
anyone

03:20:48.950 --> 03:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
03:20:54.349 --> 03:20:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:09.349 --> 03:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:12.229 --> 03:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
Condon please put your microphone
 
03:21:14.830 --> 03:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
on thank
 
03:21:17.189 --> 03:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
you thank you my name is Laura Condon
 
03:21:19.870 --> 03:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
I'm from Bedford New Hampshire and I'm
 
03:21:22.429 --> 03:21:22.439 align:start position:0%
here um to testify in support of this
 
03:21:24.750 --> 03:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
bill I think this is uh an important
 
03:21:26.510 --> 03:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
clarification for this I remember when
 
03:21:28.830 --> 03:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
the bill was changed the law was changed
 
03:21:31.710 --> 03:21:31.720 align:start position:0%
to remove the notary requirement and I
 
03:21:33.590 --> 03:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
did have parents come to me and I do
 
03:21:35.150 --> 03:21:35.160 align:start position:0%
have many people come to me across the
 
03:21:37.950 --> 03:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
state wanting to know um do they need a
 
03:21:39.630 --> 03:21:39.640 align:start position:0%
form not need a form and I said you know
 
03:21:41.590 --> 03:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
you really just need a statement you can
 
03:21:44.189 --> 03:21:44.199 align:start position:0%
create a form and I I actually created a
 
03:21:46.229 --> 03:21:46.239 align:start position:0%
form for them and I shared that with a
 
03:21:47.630 --> 03:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
lot of people I I thought it was a great
 
03:21:50.070 --> 03:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
form as all the information that um a
 
03:21:52.550 --> 03:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
school nurse or a daycare provider would
 
03:21:54.990 --> 03:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
would need whether the child has um a
 
03:21:57.750 --> 03:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
religious exemption or not and I think
 
03:21:59.070 --> 03:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
there are some important points that
 
03:22:01.469 --> 03:22:01.479 align:start position:0%
were mentioned here in this hearing one
 
03:22:04.790 --> 03:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
is that when that bill was changed DHHS
 
03:22:07.910 --> 03:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
came out and with a form and they
 
03:22:09.389 --> 03:22:09.399 align:start position:0%
changed had to change it three different
 
03:22:11.269 --> 03:22:11.279 align:start position:0%
times and they had to change it because
 
03:22:13.710 --> 03:22:13.720 align:start position:0%
it had very aggressive language in there
 
03:22:15.510 --> 03:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
it was aggressive language with
 
03:22:17.710 --> 03:22:17.720 align:start position:0%
unauthorized request ests requirements
 
03:22:19.189 --> 03:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
about putting in your vaccination
 
03:22:21.750 --> 03:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
history and I think sorry he's left the
 
03:22:23.229 --> 03:22:23.239 align:start position:0%
room but I think that speaks to
 
03:22:24.790 --> 03:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
representative McLean's concerned that
 
03:22:27.429 --> 03:22:27.439 align:start position:0%
he's raised time and time again um
 
03:22:31.110 --> 03:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
public trust and when DHHS becomes
 
03:22:33.630 --> 03:22:33.640 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily aggressive with requests
 
03:22:36.269 --> 03:22:36.279 align:start position:0%
for information that is neither required
 
03:22:38.469 --> 03:22:38.479 align:start position:0%
nor authorized in State Statute they
 
03:22:41.950 --> 03:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
undermine public trust so um I'm glad
 
03:22:43.510 --> 03:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
the form has improved and I hope we'll
 
03:22:45.429 --> 03:22:45.439 align:start position:0%
make further improvements and when
 
03:22:47.110 --> 03:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
parents the form that provided her
 
03:22:48.750 --> 03:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
parents had nothing on there about
 
03:22:50.550 --> 03:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
vaccinations but I have many parents
 
03:22:52.189 --> 03:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
come to me and said well you know my
 
03:22:54.110 --> 03:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
child got this vaccine That vaccine do I
 
03:22:56.590 --> 03:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
need to list them and I've always
 
03:22:59.189 --> 03:22:59.199 align:start position:0%
advised parents that it's up to them I
 
03:23:00.670 --> 03:23:00.680 align:start position:0%
said you can simply assert your
 
03:23:03.269 --> 03:23:03.279 align:start position:0%
religious um e exemption and leave it at
 
03:23:05.469 --> 03:23:05.479 align:start position:0%
that or if you're so inclined you can
 
03:23:07.309 --> 03:23:07.319 align:start position:0%
share with the school nurse what
 
03:23:09.110 --> 03:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
vaccines your child has already gotten
 
03:23:10.750 --> 03:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
that that's up to you so you can
 
03:23:12.790 --> 03:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
voluntarily share that information I
 
03:23:14.830 --> 03:23:14.840 align:start position:0%
never encourage somebody to withhold it
 
03:23:17.349 --> 03:23:17.359 align:start position:0%
but I have made them aware in the event
 
03:23:19.710 --> 03:23:19.720 align:start position:0%
of an outbreak if your child say has had
 
03:23:21.790 --> 03:23:21.800 align:start position:0%
the masel shot at that point so your
 
03:23:23.469 --> 03:23:23.479 align:start position:0%
child's not excluded you'd want to
 
03:23:25.670 --> 03:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
provide that record so your child would
 
03:23:28.830 --> 03:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
not be excluded at that point in time I
 
03:23:31.870 --> 03:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
do know that DHHS testify that the
 
03:23:34.110 --> 03:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
religious exemption rate is now up to
 
03:23:35.670 --> 03:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
you know very small
 
03:23:38.389 --> 03:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
3.3% but I also note that that has had
 
03:23:41.269 --> 03:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
no negative impact whatsoever that
 
03:23:43.349 --> 03:23:43.359 align:start position:0%
increase in religious
 
03:23:45.830 --> 03:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
exemption and I note that the the nurse
 
03:23:47.830 --> 03:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
who just test testified said that she
 
03:23:49.830 --> 03:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
she docu these forms come in in various
 
03:23:52.429 --> 03:23:52.439 align:start position:0%
forms these exemptions and she documents
 
03:23:55.349 --> 03:23:55.359 align:start position:0%
them in her computer system so there is
 
03:23:57.670 --> 03:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
a system that Aggregates this data that
 
03:23:59.910 --> 03:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
makes it all uniform at that point so at
 
03:24:01.750 --> 03:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
any point in time the school nurse does
 
03:24:06.030 --> 03:24:06.040 align:start position:0%
know who's has an exemption and and who
 
03:24:08.229 --> 03:24:08.239 align:start position:0%
who does not so that information is
 
03:24:10.670 --> 03:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
there but the question was asked who has
 
03:24:12.950 --> 03:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
access to that and she did testify that
 
03:24:14.309 --> 03:24:14.319 align:start position:0%
just stays with the school does stay
 
03:24:16.630 --> 03:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
with school but we also heard Dr and
 
03:24:19.590 --> 03:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
testify that in the event of an outbreak
 
03:24:21.349 --> 03:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
that they go into the school and they
 
03:24:23.950 --> 03:24:23.960 align:start position:0%
look at those records so those are not
 
03:24:26.910 --> 03:24:26.920 align:start position:0%
private from DHHS staff as we heard from
 
03:24:29.229 --> 03:24:29.239 align:start position:0%
Dr Chan's testimony happy to take any
 
03:24:31.990 --> 03:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
questions please pass this bill any
 
03:24:41.950 --> 03:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:44.550 --> 03:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Aubrey
 
03:24:44.560 --> 03:24:51.189 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Aubrey
Friedman

03:24:51.189 --> 03:24:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:53.150 --> 03:24:53.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman committee members Aubrey
 
03:24:56.469 --> 03:24:56.479 align:start position:0%
Friedman I speaking support of this bill
 
03:25:00.469 --> 03:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll make it brief um this to me is
 
03:25:06.189 --> 03:25:06.199 align:start position:0%
a data sharing issue and in our own so I
 
03:25:08.710 --> 03:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
originally thought that it was the dhss
 
03:25:10.990 --> 03:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
that was keeping the uh maybe keeping
 
03:25:13.150 --> 03:25:13.160 align:start position:0%
tabs on all this stuff they say it's at
 
03:25:16.990 --> 03:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
the school level well my school district
 
03:25:21.030 --> 03:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
is New Found and we had a big hacking
 
03:25:24.349 --> 03:25:24.359 align:start position:0%
late it was November of 2023 and they
 
03:25:27.710 --> 03:25:27.720 align:start position:0%
are still at this date still recovering
 
03:25:30.429 --> 03:25:30.439 align:start position:0%
so as was mentioned they enter it into
 
03:25:32.790 --> 03:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
the computer anytime you enter things in
 
03:25:34.910 --> 03:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
the computer you don't know what's going
 
03:25:37.030 --> 03:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
to happen with that information are they
 
03:25:39.830 --> 03:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
going to share it with other agencies or
 
03:25:43.429 --> 03:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
third parties or whatever there's been a
 
03:25:46.349 --> 03:25:46.359 align:start position:0%
lot of I think abuse on that in that
 
03:25:48.150 --> 03:25:48.160 align:start position:0%
area and even if they did everything
 
03:25:51.229 --> 03:25:51.239 align:start position:0%
perfectly okay they're still hacking and
 
03:25:53.750 --> 03:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
so why do they need all you need is the
 
03:25:55.710 --> 03:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
name of the child and the parents
 
03:25:58.550 --> 03:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
signing it that they they uh they want
 
03:26:00.950 --> 03:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of the religious
 
03:26:03.030 --> 03:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
exemption and that's it so they don't
 
03:26:05.429 --> 03:26:05.439 align:start position:0%
need any more information it's best to
 
03:26:08.189 --> 03:26:08.199 align:start position:0%
give less information these days for
 
03:26:11.950 --> 03:26:11.960 align:start position:0%
everybody especially your children so I
 
03:26:15.070 --> 03:26:15.080 align:start position:0%
don't think uh we need that form and a
 
03:26:17.030 --> 03:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
note from the parents should good enough
 
03:26:18.710 --> 03:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
and if there really is like a measles
 
03:26:21.269 --> 03:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
outbreak I would think the school would
 
03:26:23.990 --> 03:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
just be uh send out a grand announcement
 
03:26:26.189 --> 03:26:26.199 align:start position:0%
to all the families if your child has
 
03:26:29.030 --> 03:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
not been vaccinated for measles keep
 
03:26:31.590 --> 03:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
your kids at home so there's no need for
 
03:26:33.710 --> 03:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
any big surveillance or whatever you
 
03:26:36.030 --> 03:26:36.040 align:start position:0%

day which is HB 701 FN and to introduce
 
03:35:52.830 --> 03:35:52.840 align:start position:0%
this before the committee I will
 
03:35:55.830 --> 03:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Lisa merer from
 
03:35:59.070 --> 03:35:59.080 align:start position:0%
Grown yes hello everyone for the third
 
03:35:59.710 --> 03:35:59.720 align:start position:0%
time this
 
03:35:59.720 --> 03:36:01.269 align:start position:0%
time this
[Laughter]

03:36:01.269 --> 03:36:01.279 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:36:04.070 --> 03:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
week thank you Mr chair members of the
 
03:36:06.550 --> 03:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Lisa
 
03:36:09.309 --> 03:36:09.319 align:start position:0%
merer representing Hillsboro District 44
 
03:36:12.309 --> 03:36:12.319 align:start position:0%
the towns of gtown and where I am here
 
03:36:15.790 --> 03:36:15.800 align:start position:0%
today to introduce HB 701
 
03:36:18.429 --> 03:36:18.439 align:start position:0%
- FN Rel relative to a health care
 
03:36:21.229 --> 03:36:21.239 align:start position:0%
patient's right to try certain emergency
 
03:36:24.510 --> 03:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
Health Care treatment options simply put
 
03:36:26.550 --> 03:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
the goal of this bill is to make New
 
03:36:29.750 --> 03:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the best jurisdiction in the
 
03:36:33.150 --> 03:36:33.160 align:start position:0%
country for clinical trials and quote
 
03:36:35.030 --> 03:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
right to try for people with
 
03:36:35.040 --> 03:36:36.670 align:start position:0%
right to try for people with
lifethreatening

03:36:36.670 --> 03:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
lifethreatening
 
03:36:38.910 --> 03:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
illnesses with the Advent of gene
 
03:36:41.269 --> 03:36:41.279 align:start position:0%
therapy the world is witnessing a rise
 
03:36:42.670 --> 03:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
in Innovative treatments for
 
03:36:45.750 --> 03:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
life-threatening and rare diseases new
 
03:36:47.710 --> 03:36:47.720 align:start position:0%
sure has a unique opportunity in this
 
03:36:50.150 --> 03:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
area not only to help countless people
 
03:36:52.750 --> 03:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
in need but to pursue a rare Economic
 
03:36:55.950 --> 03:36:55.960 align:start position:0%
Opportunity Boston's biotech Hub where a
 
03:36:57.790 --> 03:36:57.800 align:start position:0%
large share of this Innovation is
 
03:36:59.710 --> 03:36:59.720 align:start position:0%
happening is 40 minutes from New
 
03:37:02.469 --> 03:37:02.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if we establish ourselves as
 
03:37:04.469 --> 03:37:04.479 align:start position:0%
the most friendly and pioneering
 
03:37:07.110 --> 03:37:07.120 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction in in America for
 
03:37:09.269 --> 03:37:09.279 align:start position:0%
experimental treatments for people with
 
03:37:12.189 --> 03:37:12.199 align:start position:0%
terminal illnesses we have a truly
 
03:37:14.389 --> 03:37:14.399 align:start position:0%
unique opportunity to easily draw
 
03:37:17.309 --> 03:37:17.319 align:start position:0%
Innovation and business into the state
 
03:37:19.229 --> 03:37:19.239 align:start position:0%
I'd like to highlight five areas where
 
03:37:21.030 --> 03:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
this bill is different from our current
 
03:37:23.950 --> 03:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
right to try law first is Cutting Edge
 
03:37:26.389 --> 03:37:26.399 align:start position:0%
limitation on civil liability our
 
03:37:31.030 --> 03:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
current right to try law RSA 126 DZ
 
03:37:33.309 --> 03:37:33.319 align:start position:0%
already limits regulatory enforcement
 
03:37:35.469 --> 03:37:35.479 align:start position:0%
actions against providers who give
 
03:37:37.950 --> 03:37:37.960 align:start position:0%
experimental treatments to consenting
 
03:37:40.790 --> 03:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
terminally ill patients
 
03:37:44.349 --> 03:37:44.359 align:start position:0%
hp71 will go further allowing terminally
 
03:37:46.510 --> 03:37:46.520 align:start position:0%
ill patients to consent to a strong
 
03:37:49.189 --> 03:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
limitation on civil liability that will
 
03:37:51.990 --> 03:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
help them access experimental treatments
 
03:37:53.790 --> 03:37:53.800 align:start position:0%
this will make New Hampshire competitive
 
03:37:56.150 --> 03:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
with Montana which is now the leading
 
03:37:58.590 --> 03:37:58.600 align:start position:0%
right to try jurisdiction in the country
 
03:38:00.790 --> 03:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
and is unique in its civil liability
 
03:38:03.269 --> 03:38:03.279 align:start position:0%
limitations the committee will receive
 
03:38:05.429 --> 03:38:05.439 align:start position:0%
extensive written testimony from people
 
03:38:07.910 --> 03:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
who sought who were PR who were prepared
 
03:38:10.670 --> 03:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
to pay for right to try treatments for
 
03:38:13.309 --> 03:38:13.319 align:start position:0%
their own dying loved ones the problem
 
03:38:15.790 --> 03:38:15.800 align:start position:0%
is that even in so-called right to
 
03:38:18.630 --> 03:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
States the threat of civil liability
 
03:38:21.110 --> 03:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
more than regulatory enforcement almost
 
03:38:23.670 --> 03:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
completely deters manufacturers and
 
03:38:25.910 --> 03:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
providers from actually selling or
 
03:38:27.750 --> 03:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
granting experimental treatments to
 
03:38:30.469 --> 03:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
dying patients second remote
 
03:38:33.630 --> 03:38:33.640 align:start position:0%
pre-screening for treatment HB 71 would
 
03:38:35.630 --> 03:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
make New Hampshire the first state to
 
03:38:37.710 --> 03:38:37.720 align:start position:0%
recognize a state law right for
 
03:38:39.990 --> 03:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
providers physically present in New
 
03:38:41.990 --> 03:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to conduct a remote
 
03:38:44.189 --> 03:38:44.199 align:start position:0%
pre-screening for experimental treatment
 
03:38:46.950 --> 03:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
when a patient is ding D in this would
 
03:38:49.229 --> 03:38:49.239 align:start position:0%
mitigate one of the largest logistical
 
03:38:51.349 --> 03:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
obstacles that Dy in patients around the
 
03:38:53.830 --> 03:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
country face in trying to access
 
03:38:56.269 --> 03:38:56.279 align:start position:0%
treatments and could thereby attract
 
03:38:58.070 --> 03:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
significant business to New Hampshire
 
03:39:00.670 --> 03:39:00.680 align:start position:0%
from Boston and elsewhere although the
 
03:39:03.150 --> 03:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
bill says quote tella Health
 
03:39:05.110 --> 03:39:05.120 align:start position:0%
pre-screening it's important to
 
03:39:07.670 --> 03:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
emphasize that a pre-screening interview
 
03:39:10.269 --> 03:39:10.279 align:start position:0%
is not the kind of quote Healthcare we
 
03:39:11.990 --> 03:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
usually think of when we hear the word
 
03:39:15.550 --> 03:39:15.560 align:start position:0%
telea Health a pre-screening is simply
 
03:39:18.710 --> 03:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
an initial meeting to determine whether
 
03:39:21.469 --> 03:39:21.479 align:start position:0%
a patient can apply to receive treatment
 
03:39:24.189 --> 03:39:24.199 align:start position:0%
many dying patients who want to access
 
03:39:26.110 --> 03:39:26.120 align:start position:0%
experimental treatment spend the last
 
03:39:28.630 --> 03:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
months of their lives physically flying
 
03:39:31.229 --> 03:39:31.239 align:start position:0%
around the country primarily just to be
 
03:39:33.349 --> 03:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
rejected in various in-person
 
03:39:35.910 --> 03:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
pre-screening appointments we should do
 
03:39:37.750 --> 03:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
everything possible under state law to
 
03:39:39.469 --> 03:39:39.479 align:start position:0%
make sure that at least these initial
 
03:39:41.790 --> 03:39:41.800 align:start position:0%
pre-screening appointments can happen in
 
03:39:44.630 --> 03:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
person third remote signing of consent
 
03:39:47.189 --> 03:39:47.199 align:start position:0%
forms this change is similar to the one
 
03:39:49.510 --> 03:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
just described but in this case the
 
03:39:51.349 --> 03:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
problem is that there are many cases of
 
03:39:54.070 --> 03:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
dying patients flying from one state to
 
03:39:56.710 --> 03:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
another simply to sign a consent form in
 
03:39:58.469 --> 03:39:58.479 align:start position:0%
the physical presence of a health care
 
03:40:00.630 --> 03:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
provider even when they are not going to
 
03:40:03.710 --> 03:40:03.720 align:start position:0%
receive treatment on that trip fourth a
 
03:40:06.229 --> 03:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
construction provision to help reassure
 
03:40:07.670 --> 03:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
providers and patients that may
 
03:40:09.830 --> 03:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
encounter additional unforeseen
 
03:40:12.670 --> 03:40:12.680 align:start position:0%
regulatory illegal situations we'll also
 
03:40:15.309 --> 03:40:15.319 align:start position:0%
add a broad construction provision state
 
03:40:17.150 --> 03:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
stating that our purpose in passing this
 
03:40:19.469 --> 03:40:19.479 align:start position:0%
law is to incentivize providers and
 
03:40:21.630 --> 03:40:21.640 align:start position:0%
manufacturers to treat dying patients
 
03:40:24.710 --> 03:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
who want treatment as well as to quote
 
03:40:27.269 --> 03:40:27.279 align:start position:0%
make New Hampshire a jurisdiction that
 
03:40:29.990 --> 03:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
attracts and fosters clinical trials and
 
03:40:32.990 --> 03:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
the development of drugs biologics and
 
03:40:34.950 --> 03:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
devices intended to treat
 
03:40:37.349 --> 03:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
life-threatening conditions the law
 
03:40:38.990 --> 03:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
should be always be interpreted
 
03:40:41.870 --> 03:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
consistently with this purpose Fifth and
 
03:40:44.510 --> 03:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
last a right to injunction to an
 
03:40:46.950 --> 03:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
injunction finally the most important
 
03:40:48.550 --> 03:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
part of this bill and the piece that
 
03:40:50.870 --> 03:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
holds it all together is the right of a
 
03:40:53.269 --> 03:40:53.279 align:start position:0%
provider or patient to seek injunctive
 
03:40:56.189 --> 03:40:56.199 align:start position:0%
relief against a state regulatory or law
 
03:40:57.670 --> 03:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement Authority that is
 
03:41:00.030 --> 03:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
obstructing their treatment under our
 
03:41:02.990 --> 03:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
current law providers need to sit by
 
03:41:05.030 --> 03:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
wait to see if a State Licensing
 
03:41:07.510 --> 03:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
Authority or agency will come after them
 
03:41:11.030 --> 03:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
and then invoke our current law 106 DZ
 
03:41:13.229 --> 03:41:13.239 align:start position:0%
as an affirmative defense but the
 
03:41:15.389 --> 03:41:15.399 align:start position:0%
reality is this does not provide any
 
03:41:17.150 --> 03:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
cautious healthc care provider with the
 
03:41:20.070 --> 03:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
incentive they need to provide treatment
 
03:41:21.710 --> 03:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
instead New Hampshire can offer
 
03:41:23.750 --> 03:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
providers from Boston who come up and
 
03:41:25.710 --> 03:41:25.720 align:start position:0%
set up shop in New Hampshire a unique
 
03:41:28.550 --> 03:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
degree of predictability and stability
 
03:41:30.349 --> 03:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
by Leading the country in this area New
 
03:41:33.309 --> 03:41:33.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can both save numerous lives
 
03:41:36.030 --> 03:41:36.040 align:start position:0%
lives like Lucas Toro a famous young
 
03:41:37.790 --> 03:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
muscular distrophy patient who is
 
03:41:40.229 --> 03:41:40.239 align:start position:0%
undergoing successful gene therapy in
 
03:41:42.469 --> 03:41:42.479 align:start position:0%
Boston and attract business and
 
03:41:45.429 --> 03:41:45.439 align:start position:0%
Innovation to New Hampshire on a last
 
03:41:47.670 --> 03:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
and personal
 
03:41:51.670 --> 03:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
note after walking with um with my dad
 
03:41:54.469 --> 03:41:54.479 align:start position:0%
uh through his terminal diagnosis
 
03:41:57.189 --> 03:41:57.199 align:start position:0%
sorry with no potential life-saving
 
03:42:00.229 --> 03:42:00.239 align:start position:0%
options presented to or available to him
 
03:42:02.149 --> 03:42:02.159 align:start position:0%
I strongly support protecting the rights
 
03:42:04.830 --> 03:42:04.840 align:start position:0%
of patients with terminal
 
03:42:07.229 --> 03:42:07.239 align:start position:0%
diagnosis to access potential
 
03:42:10.269 --> 03:42:10.279 align:start position:0%
life-saving or life extending
 
03:42:12.309 --> 03:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
treatments I urge this committee to
 
03:42:13.429 --> 03:42:13.439 align:start position:0%
stand with
 
03:42:16.149 --> 03:42:16.159 align:start position:0%
patience their famili and the phys
 
03:42:18.229 --> 03:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
Physicians who are trying to help extend
 
03:42:21.309 --> 03:42:21.319 align:start position:0%
their lives by ensuring that patient
 
03:42:22.950 --> 03:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
compassionate ensuring that
 
03:42:25.189 --> 03:42:25.199 align:start position:0%
compassionate access to emergency
 
03:42:27.950 --> 03:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
treatments remains a protected right
 
03:42:31.309 --> 03:42:31.319 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any any
 
03:42:31.319 --> 03:42:32.950 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any any
representative

03:42:32.950 --> 03:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:42:35.309 --> 03:42:35.319 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you and I'll let you take a
 
03:42:38.550 --> 03:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
breath I'm so sorry about your dad and
 
03:42:41.870 --> 03:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
it's a tough Journey y um and I also
 
03:42:44.429 --> 03:42:44.439 align:start position:0%
honor the sentiment behind this so I'm
 
03:42:46.429 --> 03:42:46.439 align:start position:0%
going to turn to some really technical
 
03:42:49.030 --> 03:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
questions about the drafting answer them
 
03:42:50.830 --> 03:42:50.840 align:start position:0%
there are there is someone behind me who
 
03:42:52.670 --> 03:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
can okay so I'll just ask the question
 
03:42:56.110 --> 03:42:56.120 align:start position:0%
if you want to pass go ahead um so the
 
03:43:00.550 --> 03:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
questions I have are on the bottom of
 
03:43:04.590 --> 03:43:04.600 align:start position:0%
page I guess it's page one uh
 
03:43:07.710 --> 03:43:07.720 align:start position:0%
where um lines 27 to
 
03:43:10.149 --> 03:43:10.159 align:start position:0%
29 and it talks
 
03:43:13.590 --> 03:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
about uh the protections for the
 
03:43:18.349 --> 03:43:18.359 align:start position:0%
providers and um it says that they're
 
03:43:19.990 --> 03:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
they're only protected if they haven't
 
03:43:23.870 --> 03:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
engaged in willful misconduct so that's
 
03:43:28.389 --> 03:43:28.399 align:start position:0%
one legal standard um is it okay to let
 
03:43:30.910 --> 03:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
them off the hook if they have been
 
03:43:34.229 --> 03:43:34.239 align:start position:0%
negligent which would not be covered if
 
03:43:36.910 --> 03:43:36.920 align:start position:0%
this statute was passed like this or is
 
03:43:39.070 --> 03:43:39.080 align:start position:0%
that some drafting that we need to work
 
03:43:42.510 --> 03:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
on I guess I'll defer that um there's a
 
03:43:45.550 --> 03:43:45.560 align:start position:0%
a lawyer behind me that will okay um and
 
03:43:49.790 --> 03:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
then I just wanted to note also I my
 
03:43:52.309 --> 03:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
question uh on the next page which is
 
03:43:53.870 --> 03:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
headed page
 
03:43:58.670 --> 03:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
two uh the draft removes almost
 
03:43:58.680 --> 03:44:00.990 align:start position:0%
two uh the draft removes almost
everything

03:44:00.990 --> 03:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
everything
 
03:44:05.070 --> 03:44:05.080 align:start position:0%
that is of protective language on lines
 
03:44:06.670 --> 03:44:06.680 align:start position:0%
2 through
 
03:44:11.229 --> 03:44:11.239 align:start position:0%
7 um and just refers to paragraph
 
03:44:15.349 --> 03:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
two I think there would you agree with
 
03:44:18.429 --> 03:44:18.439 align:start position:0%
that there might be a
 
03:44:22.510 --> 03:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
concern arising out of the removal of
 
03:44:25.990 --> 03:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
protections on page
 
03:44:29.510 --> 03:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
two um when this is supposed to provide
 
03:44:29.520 --> 03:44:31.550 align:start position:0%
two um when this is supposed to provide
more

03:44:31.550 --> 03:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:44:34.550 --> 03:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
protections I I'm I don't have the
 
03:44:37.429 --> 03:44:37.439 align:start position:0%
numbers that you have on yours so the
 
03:44:40.510 --> 03:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
the is it section one it's it says uh
 
03:44:42.830 --> 03:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
it's headed private cause of action okay
 
03:44:47.510 --> 03:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
y um and if you if you note it's
 
03:44:52.110 --> 03:44:52.120 align:start position:0%
it as redrafted by the bill
 
03:44:55.110 --> 03:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
yep it would say nothing in this chapter
 
03:44:57.590 --> 03:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
shall be construed to create a private
 
03:44:59.149 --> 03:44:59.159 align:start position:0%
cause of
 
03:45:02.149 --> 03:45:02.159 align:start position:0%
action against any person or entity
 
03:45:04.910 --> 03:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
except as specified in paragraph 2 and
 
03:45:07.590 --> 03:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
it sounds like it's removing some
 
03:45:12.269 --> 03:45:12.279 align:start position:0%
protections as opposed to adding them
 
03:45:15.550 --> 03:45:15.560 align:start position:0%
yeah because the that slowed down the
 
03:45:18.429 --> 03:45:18.439 align:start position:0%
process um and if did you did you all
 
03:45:20.030 --> 03:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
hopefully receive some of the
 
03:45:23.990 --> 03:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
testimonies from from a specific I'm I'm
 
03:45:26.389 --> 03:45:26.399 align:start position:0%
just talking about specific wording and
 
03:45:28.550 --> 03:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
and whether I'm trying to explore
 
03:45:30.710 --> 03:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
whether this language and it's tough
 
03:45:33.030 --> 03:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
it's tough for me because it's double
 
03:45:36.070 --> 03:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
negatives um I'm just trying to explore
 
03:45:37.910 --> 03:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
whether the language as written does
 
03:45:41.590 --> 03:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
exactly what you want it to do okay so
 
03:45:43.229 --> 03:45:43.239 align:start position:0%
if there are other people behind you who
 
03:45:44.550 --> 03:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
can help me with that that will be
 
03:45:46.110 --> 03:45:46.120 align:start position:0%
helpful I'm sure there
 
03:45:50.070 --> 03:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
are yes anyone else have any questions
 
03:45:50.080 --> 03:45:51.670 align:start position:0%
are yes anyone else have any questions
representative

03:45:51.670 --> 03:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:45:54.950 --> 03:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chair and I'm
 
03:45:57.349 --> 03:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure that I'm not dealing
 
03:46:00.790 --> 03:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
with a keen grasp of the obvious but
 
03:46:03.790 --> 03:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
this you're only referring here to
 
03:46:05.830 --> 03:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
legitimate clinical trials you're not
 
03:46:08.429 --> 03:46:08.439 align:start position:0%
talking about somebody like me saying if
 
03:46:10.149 --> 03:46:10.159 align:start position:0%
you go walk in the woods and touch oak
 
03:46:12.710 --> 03:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
trees you're going to be
 
03:46:15.510 --> 03:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
better I mean we're we're only talking
 
03:46:20.110 --> 03:46:20.120 align:start position:0%
about legitimate medical trials in this
 
03:46:23.790 --> 03:46:23.800 align:start position:0%
for for terminal illnesses yes yes okay
 
03:46:23.800 --> 03:46:25.030 align:start position:0%
for for terminal illnesses yes yes okay
thank

03:46:25.030 --> 03:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:46:27.910 --> 03:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
you other
 
03:46:30.990 --> 03:46:31.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative woods and then
 
03:46:32.950 --> 03:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
delas thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:46:35.030 --> 03:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh I I guess I
 
03:46:36.870 --> 03:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
need a little bit of clarification again
 
03:46:39.389 --> 03:46:39.399 align:start position:0%
someone else may be able to answer it uh
 
03:46:42.870 --> 03:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
um the the role of just uh prescribing
 
03:46:46.870 --> 03:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
an off label medication is one entity
 
03:46:49.389 --> 03:46:49.399 align:start position:0%
another entity is being prescribing a
 
03:46:51.710 --> 03:46:51.720 align:start position:0%
medication as part of a trial if it's
 
03:46:54.790 --> 03:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
part of a trial then there the irbs get
 
03:46:57.110 --> 03:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
involved uh and that's another whole
 
03:46:58.870 --> 03:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
layer and I don't see that addressed
 
03:47:01.389 --> 03:47:01.399 align:start position:0%
here so if someone either yourself or
 
03:47:03.469 --> 03:47:03.479 align:start position:0%
someone else could comp uh clarify
 
03:47:05.910 --> 03:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
whether we're talking about uh you know
 
03:47:08.710 --> 03:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
just off label which most of us as
 
03:47:11.630 --> 03:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
Physicians do it regularly versus a a
 
03:47:15.389 --> 03:47:15.399 align:start position:0%
true trial which was um referred to just
 
03:47:18.830 --> 03:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
now MH I I think the IRB if it's a trial
 
03:47:21.510 --> 03:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
the irbs are going to get involved
 
03:47:23.870 --> 03:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
03:47:26.590 --> 03:47:26.600 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
03:47:30.750 --> 03:47:30.760 align:start position:0%
damus thank you Mr chairman um is does
 
03:47:32.870 --> 03:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
this have any verbiage or does it how
 
03:47:35.870 --> 03:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
does it mesh with the um right to uh
 
03:47:39.870 --> 03:47:39.880 align:start position:0%
right to try act that was um enacted in
 
03:47:42.630 --> 03:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:46.189 --> 03:47:46.199 align:start position:0%
2018 yes um I I actually just was
 
03:47:50.349 --> 03:47:50.359 align:start position:0%
looking up that today and gosh I don't
 
03:47:52.630 --> 03:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
remember I'd have to look because that
 
03:47:56.269 --> 03:47:56.279 align:start position:0%
was a a president Trump yes yes yeah he
 
03:47:59.950 --> 03:47:59.960 align:start position:0%
signed that in 17 yeah and I don't I
 
03:48:02.110 --> 03:48:02.120 align:start position:0%
don't recall what where it actually went
 
03:48:05.070 --> 03:48:05.080 align:start position:0%
after that so whether because it there
 
03:48:06.990 --> 03:48:07.000 align:start position:0%
was also an executive order involved in
 
03:48:09.510 --> 03:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
that so I don't know if that was
 
03:48:12.710 --> 03:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
repealed afterwards or um it was hard to
 
03:48:14.030 --> 03:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
tell when I was looking it up what
 
03:48:17.590 --> 03:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
actually happened to to it so I I
 
03:48:20.389 --> 03:48:20.399 align:start position:0%
believe it's actually still
 
03:48:23.550 --> 03:48:23.560 align:start position:0%
in I think it's law yeah and I and it's
 
03:48:25.910 --> 03:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
and they're they're saying like it's a
 
03:48:29.790 --> 03:48:29.800 align:start position:0%
right to try 2.0 yeah so and many states
 
03:48:31.590 --> 03:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
have right to try laws I mean we do
 
03:48:34.990 --> 03:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
right now too this makes us Cutting Edge
 
03:48:39.750 --> 03:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
in the country of going Beyond um and
 
03:48:43.070 --> 03:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
and and as mentioned in my testimony of
 
03:48:46.189 --> 03:48:46.199 align:start position:0%
making us a hub you know know for th
 
03:48:48.630 --> 03:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
this accessibility to treatment that
 
03:48:51.469 --> 03:48:51.479 align:start position:0%
will save lives so it goes beyond what's
 
03:48:56.110 --> 03:48:56.120 align:start position:0%
out there already y anyone
 
03:49:02.750 --> 03:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:05.710 --> 03:49:05.720 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is attorney
 
03:49:18.149 --> 03:49:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:19.990 --> 03:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
03:49:22.269 --> 03:49:22.279 align:start position:0%
committee Ian huitt attorney for
 
03:49:24.750 --> 03:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
Cornerstone appearing in strong support
 
03:49:26.389 --> 03:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
of Representative maser's House Bill
 
03:49:28.750 --> 03:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
sorry pronouncing your name by the way
 
03:49:30.229 --> 03:49:30.239 align:start position:0%
oh you did a pretty good job actually
 
03:49:32.269 --> 03:49:32.279 align:start position:0%
I've heard much worse mispronunciations
 
03:49:34.950 --> 03:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
around here and we are New Hampshire's
 
03:49:36.910 --> 03:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
only full-time Christian advocacy
 
03:49:38.870 --> 03:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
organization we represent over 100
 
03:49:41.389 --> 03:49:41.399 align:start position:0%
churches around the state and I would
 
03:49:43.950 --> 03:49:43.960 align:start position:0%
love to answer any technical legal
 
03:49:45.750 --> 03:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
questions including wording questions
 
03:49:48.550 --> 03:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
about how this bill would work but in my
 
03:49:50.389 --> 03:49:50.399 align:start position:0%
testimony I thought I would talk a bit
 
03:49:53.670 --> 03:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
about why we support this bill today is
 
03:49:56.590 --> 03:49:56.600 align:start position:0%
actually Ash wedes day on which uh many
 
03:49:58.229 --> 03:49:58.239 align:start position:0%
Christians of different denominations
 
03:50:00.910 --> 03:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
around the world receive ashes on their
 
03:50:03.950 --> 03:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
foreheads and they do that often as a
 
03:50:06.229 --> 03:50:06.239 align:start position:0%
way of reme remembering the curse of the
 
03:50:08.349 --> 03:50:08.359 align:start position:0%
fall in which Christians believe
 
03:50:11.590 --> 03:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
sickness and death came into the world
 
03:50:13.550 --> 03:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
and Christians believe that we have a
 
03:50:17.110 --> 03:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
duty to treat to heal to care for the
 
03:50:19.950 --> 03:50:19.960 align:start position:0%
sick in part because we believe we are
 
03:50:22.070 --> 03:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
in a state of war with the fall the
 
03:50:24.229 --> 03:50:24.239 align:start position:0%
beginning of the ninth chapter of John
 
03:50:26.070 --> 03:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
talks about Jesus heals a man who was
 
03:50:29.269 --> 03:50:29.279 align:start position:0%
born blind and he says that his
 
03:50:31.389 --> 03:50:31.399 align:start position:0%
followers must do the same he says we
 
03:50:34.389 --> 03:50:34.399 align:start position:0%
must work the works of him who sent us
 
03:50:36.349 --> 03:50:36.359 align:start position:0%
now unfortunately in legal regimes
 
03:50:38.229 --> 03:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
around the country right now the
 
03:50:40.830 --> 03:50:40.840 align:start position:0%
government typically does not value
 
03:50:43.149 --> 03:50:43.159 align:start position:0%
healing as much as it values the
 
03:50:46.309 --> 03:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
predictability of regul a even if that
 
03:50:49.510 --> 03:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
regulation results in death so I want to
 
03:50:52.110 --> 03:50:52.120 align:start position:0%
draw your attention to two of written
 
03:50:53.710 --> 03:50:53.720 align:start position:0%
testimonies that you already have and
 
03:50:56.149 --> 03:50:56.159 align:start position:0%
I'm going to pass around copies of them
 
03:50:59.110 --> 03:50:59.120 align:start position:0%
as well but one of them is a testimony
 
03:51:01.950 --> 03:51:01.960 align:start position:0%
from Dr Bess Stillman who is a powerful
 
03:51:05.189 --> 03:51:05.199 align:start position:0%
writer and Advocate and new mom whose
 
03:51:08.590 --> 03:51:08.600 align:start position:0%
husband Jake died in August of cancer
 
03:51:10.870 --> 03:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
and there were revolutionary Medical
 
03:51:12.870 --> 03:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
Treatments in existence that may have
 
03:51:16.189 --> 03:51:16.199 align:start position:0%
been able to heal Jake and best Stillman
 
03:51:18.070 --> 03:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
and Jake traveled around the country
 
03:51:21.070 --> 03:51:21.080 align:start position:0%
seeking these treatments They begged for
 
03:51:22.950 --> 03:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
access to them they offered to pay for
 
03:51:25.030 --> 03:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
everything out of pocket they wanted to
 
03:51:27.349 --> 03:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
wave civil liability but their
 
03:51:30.429 --> 03:51:30.439 align:start position:0%
experience was even under state standard
 
03:51:32.550 --> 03:51:32.560 align:start position:0%
state right to try laws like ours and
 
03:51:35.269 --> 03:51:35.279 align:start position:0%
the federal right to try law that Health
 
03:51:38.189 --> 03:51:38.199 align:start position:0%
Care Providers were much more scared of
 
03:51:40.750 --> 03:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
the possibility of civil liability
 
03:51:42.429 --> 03:51:42.439 align:start position:0%
through harming Jake than they were
 
03:51:45.349 --> 03:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
scared of Jake dying
 
03:51:47.389 --> 03:51:47.399 align:start position:0%
I will also give you written testimony
 
03:51:51.030 --> 03:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
from a group of six sets of parents with
 
03:51:53.429 --> 03:51:53.439 align:start position:0%
of children with terminal genetic
 
03:51:55.750 --> 03:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
illnesses and therapies now in
 
03:51:57.229 --> 03:51:57.239 align:start position:0%
development like the one you heard about
 
03:51:59.149 --> 03:51:59.159 align:start position:0%
from representative merer Lucas Toro is
 
03:52:01.030 --> 03:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
an inspiring successful gene therapy
 
03:52:03.389 --> 03:52:03.399 align:start position:0%
case in Massachusetts therapies now
 
03:52:05.790 --> 03:52:05.800 align:start position:0%
being developed could potentially treat
 
03:52:08.309 --> 03:52:08.319 align:start position:0%
many of these genetic illnesses but none
 
03:52:10.830 --> 03:52:10.840 align:start position:0%
of these six children will survive to
 
03:52:13.349 --> 03:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
adulthood unless they are allowed to
 
03:52:17.030 --> 03:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
access re evolutionary treatments and
 
03:52:19.189 --> 03:52:19.199 align:start position:0%
these parents have all spoken about and
 
03:52:21.070 --> 03:52:21.080 align:start position:0%
you will read in their testimony about
 
03:52:24.550 --> 03:52:24.560 align:start position:0%
how right to try laws like ours are well
 
03:52:27.429 --> 03:52:27.439 align:start position:0%
intentioned and sound nice on paper but
 
03:52:29.349 --> 03:52:29.359 align:start position:0%
the reality is that stop wrapping up
 
03:52:32.229 --> 03:52:32.239 align:start position:0%
please providers are too Paralyzed by
 
03:52:34.750 --> 03:52:34.760 align:start position:0%
the threat of civil liability and the
 
03:52:37.269 --> 03:52:37.279 align:start position:0%
threat of regulatory interference to
 
03:52:38.750 --> 03:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
administer treatments that are needed to
 
03:52:41.550 --> 03:52:41.560 align:start position:0%
save these people's lives so we hope you
 
03:52:43.750 --> 03:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
will stand with those who cannot speak
 
03:52:45.790 --> 03:52:45.800 align:start position:0%
for themselves and join us in supporting
 
03:52:48.110 --> 03:52:48.120 align:start position:0%
representative Meers House Bill 701 I'd
 
03:52:49.910 --> 03:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
love to take any legal or technical
 
03:52:51.710 --> 03:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
questions about how this bill would work
 
03:52:53.309 --> 03:52:53.319 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:52:55.750 --> 03:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you and thank you for
 
03:52:59.469 --> 03:52:59.479 align:start position:0%
offering to take the question um I'm
 
03:53:02.630 --> 03:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
also turning you to uh the first page of
 
03:53:05.830 --> 03:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
the bill language um which isn't
 
03:53:09.950 --> 03:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
numbered but um which has online 27 to
 
03:53:13.110 --> 03:53:13.120 align:start position:0%
29 the manufacturer pharmacist facility
 
03:53:14.950 --> 03:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
provider or other person has not engaged
 
03:53:17.510 --> 03:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
in willful conduct why did you choose
 
03:53:20.389 --> 03:53:20.399 align:start position:0%
willful conduct and exclude negligent
 
03:53:22.990 --> 03:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
conduct well almost all state right to
 
03:53:26.389 --> 03:53:26.399 align:start position:0%
try laws still allow uh cause of action
 
03:53:29.070 --> 03:53:29.080 align:start position:0%
in the case of negligence uh our current
 
03:53:31.429 --> 03:53:31.439 align:start position:0%
right to try law for example says that
 
03:53:33.389 --> 03:53:33.399 align:start position:0%
you're not subject to civil liability so
 
03:53:35.030 --> 03:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
long so long as you've exercised
 
03:53:37.590 --> 03:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable care and the reality is and
 
03:53:39.590 --> 03:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
you can see this from all these patients
 
03:53:41.870 --> 03:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
who best Stillman likes to say we tried
 
03:53:43.950 --> 03:53:43.960 align:start position:0%
right to try you go into any of these
 
03:53:45.950 --> 03:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
states that have these laws you offer to
 
03:53:48.790 --> 03:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
pay and the doctors are still too
 
03:53:51.349 --> 03:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
Paralyzed by fear of civil liability to
 
03:53:54.510 --> 03:53:54.520 align:start position:0%
administer treatments that are available
 
03:53:56.349 --> 03:53:56.359 align:start position:0%
and you can imagine the attorneys at
 
03:53:58.070 --> 03:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
these medical facilities look at a law
 
03:54:00.389 --> 03:54:00.399 align:start position:0%
like ours and say it says we're going to
 
03:54:02.469 --> 03:54:02.479 align:start position:0%
be potentially subject to a lawsuit if
 
03:54:05.309 --> 03:54:05.319 align:start position:0%
we don't exercise reasonable care and
 
03:54:07.510 --> 03:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
that sounds an awful lot like the
 
03:54:09.710 --> 03:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
ordinary standard for civil liability
 
03:54:12.269 --> 03:54:12.279 align:start position:0%
for a medical provider so the entire
 
03:54:14.469 --> 03:54:14.479 align:start position:0%
impetus behind what all of these patient
 
03:54:15.910 --> 03:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
in these written testimonies are saying
 
03:54:17.750 --> 03:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
is they really they're going to die
 
03:54:20.670 --> 03:54:20.680 align:start position:0%
anyway they just want greater ability to
 
03:54:23.349 --> 03:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
wave civil liability so that doctors
 
03:54:26.269 --> 03:54:26.279 align:start position:0%
will have the incentives in place to
 
03:54:29.149 --> 03:54:29.159 align:start position:0%
offer treatment and I I just can't I
 
03:54:30.710 --> 03:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
struggle to imagine how frustrating it
 
03:54:32.389 --> 03:54:32.399 align:start position:0%
would be for these parents of these
 
03:54:34.070 --> 03:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
young children with genetic illnesses to
 
03:54:36.910 --> 03:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
be told we can't treat you because we're
 
03:54:38.790 --> 03:54:38.800 align:start position:0%
afraid of the Civil liability from
 
03:54:40.790 --> 03:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
injuring your child when the parents
 
03:54:42.030 --> 03:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
know their children are not going to
 
03:54:44.070 --> 03:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
live to be adults without treatment and
 
03:54:45.670 --> 03:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
they need to be able to wave the Civil
 
03:54:47.670 --> 03:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
liability to a great extent to make it
 
03:54:51.269 --> 03:54:51.279 align:start position:0%
available so could I follow up and I
 
03:54:52.870 --> 03:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
understand the emotional content of what
 
03:54:54.910 --> 03:54:54.920 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with I can't imagine the
 
03:54:58.750 --> 03:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
pain of having to deal with a situation
 
03:55:01.990 --> 03:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
like this but I don't think you actually
 
03:55:05.510 --> 03:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
answered my question which is um I
 
03:55:07.670 --> 03:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
didn't talk about the reasonable
 
03:55:11.670 --> 03:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable Care standard what I asked
 
03:55:16.830 --> 03:55:16.840 align:start position:0%
was um you have have not you you you
 
03:55:20.229 --> 03:55:20.239 align:start position:0%
saying here uh and I'm trying to remove
 
03:55:22.110 --> 03:55:22.120 align:start position:0%
all the double negatives because it does
 
03:55:26.309 --> 03:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
get very confusing um it sounds to me
 
03:55:31.429 --> 03:55:31.439 align:start position:0%
reading lines 27 to 29 that if you
 
03:55:34.630 --> 03:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
engaged in actual willful
 
03:55:37.189 --> 03:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
misconduct the patient has a right of
 
03:55:40.550 --> 03:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
action yes that's correct and the
 
03:55:44.830 --> 03:55:44.840 align:start position:0%
question I have is so you Escape
 
03:55:47.950 --> 03:55:47.960 align:start position:0%
liability if you have merely been
 
03:55:52.590 --> 03:55:52.600 align:start position:0%
negligent towards your critically ill
 
03:55:55.149 --> 03:55:55.159 align:start position:0%
patient yes that's correct the reason
 
03:55:58.189 --> 03:55:58.199 align:start position:0%
for that is that when you have a statute
 
03:56:00.429 --> 03:56:00.439 align:start position:0%
that says you are going to be liable in
 
03:56:02.309 --> 03:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
the case of negligence which is simply
 
03:56:03.870 --> 03:56:03.880 align:start position:0%
effectively an ordinary medical
 
03:56:06.429 --> 03:56:06.439 align:start position:0%
malpractice standard that doesn't
 
03:56:09.189 --> 03:56:09.199 align:start position:0%
provide enough incentive to encourage
 
03:56:11.309 --> 03:56:11.319 align:start position:0%
providers to administer treatments that
 
03:56:13.590 --> 03:56:13.600 align:start position:0%
people desperately want and that they
 
03:56:15.269 --> 03:56:15.279 align:start position:0%
otherwise would would like to be able to
 
03:56:16.910 --> 03:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
provide but they're deterred by civil
 
03:56:19.590 --> 03:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
liability so when we're making the
 
03:56:21.830 --> 03:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
calculation in this language that when
 
03:56:24.070 --> 03:56:24.080 align:start position:0%
someone is dying anyway and goes through
 
03:56:25.710 --> 03:56:25.720 align:start position:0%
informed consent and the other checks
 
03:56:26.830 --> 03:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
that are in here there are certain
 
03:56:28.830 --> 03:56:28.840 align:start position:0%
requirements like informed consent
 
03:56:31.389 --> 03:56:31.399 align:start position:0%
physician approval um certification that
 
03:56:33.229 --> 03:56:33.239 align:start position:0%
there's no alternative FDA approved
 
03:56:34.750 --> 03:56:34.760 align:start position:0%
treatments but when someone goes through
 
03:56:37.070 --> 03:56:37.080 align:start position:0%
those checks they want to be able to
 
03:56:39.349 --> 03:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
greatly wave civil liability because if
 
03:56:41.790 --> 03:56:41.800 align:start position:0%
they can't wave civil liability around
 
03:56:44.229 --> 03:56:44.239 align:start position:0%
negligence the reality is well it sounds
 
03:56:45.750 --> 03:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
sounds nice theoretically to say we're
 
03:56:47.550 --> 03:56:47.560 align:start position:0%
going to leave negligence liability in
 
03:56:50.189 --> 03:56:50.199 align:start position:0%
place that completely deters all of
 
03:56:51.630 --> 03:56:51.640 align:start position:0%
these facilities and doctors around the
 
03:56:53.349 --> 03:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
country from administering treatments
 
03:56:55.110 --> 03:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
that in fact exists That Dying people
 
03:56:56.590 --> 03:56:56.600 align:start position:0%
would like to
 
03:56:59.630 --> 03:56:59.640 align:start position:0%
access and can I have one one more on
 
03:57:03.030 --> 03:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
the construction of the language there
 
03:57:06.710 --> 03:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
um It also says willful condu conduct
 
03:57:06.720 --> 03:57:07.870 align:start position:0%
um It also says willful condu conduct
willful

03:57:07.870 --> 03:57:07.880 align:start position:0%
willful
 
03:57:10.990 --> 03:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
misconduct shall include any conduct
 
03:57:12.830 --> 03:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
intended to hasten the death of the
 
03:57:12.840 --> 03:57:16.269 align:start position:0%
intended to hasten the death of the
patient

03:57:16.269 --> 03:57:16.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:19.950 --> 03:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
um in do you think that including that
 
03:57:19.960 --> 03:57:21.309 align:start position:0%
um in do you think that including that
specific

03:57:21.309 --> 03:57:21.319 align:start position:0%
specific
 
03:57:24.389 --> 03:57:24.399 align:start position:0%
language and I absolutely agree we
 
03:57:28.790 --> 03:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:31.910 --> 03:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
patients but does the inclusion of that
 
03:57:35.229 --> 03:57:35.239 align:start position:0%
language again get us back into the
 
03:57:35.239 --> 03:57:37.429 align:start position:0%
language again get us back into the
tension

03:57:37.429 --> 03:57:37.439 align:start position:0%
tension
 
03:57:41.309 --> 03:57:41.319 align:start position:0%
between has what I have administered
 
03:57:45.149 --> 03:57:45.159 align:start position:0%
been truly experimental and helpful or
 
03:57:48.149 --> 03:57:48.159 align:start position:0%
oh gosh it hastened the death of the
 
03:57:50.189 --> 03:57:50.199 align:start position:0%
patient and therefore we're back to
 
03:57:51.670 --> 03:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
being concerned
 
03:57:54.950 --> 03:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
about an outcome that may not have been
 
03:57:57.389 --> 03:57:57.399 align:start position:0%
intended or anticipated but may be very
 
03:57:58.990 --> 03:57:59.000 align:start position:0%
bad or may be
 
03:58:01.469 --> 03:58:01.479 align:start position:0%
hastening well in my experience when I'm
 
03:58:03.590 --> 03:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
advising clients in a litigation context
 
03:58:04.950 --> 03:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
you know either in my current role where
 
03:58:07.070 --> 03:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
I I do constitutional litigation or
 
03:58:08.950 --> 03:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
related State statory litigation or in
 
03:58:10.510 --> 03:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
my my previous work doing civil
 
03:58:13.510 --> 03:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
litigation if there is a requirement of
 
03:58:15.750 --> 03:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
willful intent and some sort of
 
03:58:18.830 --> 03:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
malicious intent I'm much more
 
03:58:20.550 --> 03:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
comfortable telling clients they can
 
03:58:22.389 --> 03:58:22.399 align:start position:0%
proceed with uh important but
 
03:58:25.030 --> 03:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
potentially risking risky conduct and
 
03:58:26.429 --> 03:58:26.439 align:start position:0%
that is because when you have a
 
03:58:28.590 --> 03:58:28.600 align:start position:0%
statutory element like willful
 
03:58:30.630 --> 03:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
misconduct willfully hastening the death
 
03:58:32.790 --> 03:58:32.800 align:start position:0%
of the patient in order to get civil
 
03:58:34.229 --> 03:58:34.239 align:start position:0%
liability there would need to be
 
03:58:37.030 --> 03:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
significant evidence that the healthc
 
03:58:38.910 --> 03:58:38.920 align:start position:0%
care provider actually had that mental
 
03:58:41.510 --> 03:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
state it's not enough to just show that
 
03:58:43.229 --> 03:58:43.239 align:start position:0%
the conduct didn't meet a reasonable
 
03:58:45.070 --> 03:58:45.080 align:start position:0%
standard of care you need to show that
 
03:58:48.149 --> 03:58:48.159 align:start position:0%
it was willfully bad and so that uh
 
03:58:50.269 --> 03:58:50.279 align:start position:0%
reaches a compromise by not entirely
 
03:58:52.349 --> 03:58:52.359 align:start position:0%
waving civil liability we're not saying
 
03:58:54.750 --> 03:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
as long as you go through steps a a
 
03:58:58.229 --> 03:58:58.239 align:start position:0%
through C civil liability is 100% gone
 
03:59:00.389 --> 03:59:00.399 align:start position:0%
but we need to give patients like these
 
03:59:02.269 --> 03:59:02.279 align:start position:0%
ability to significantly wave civil
 
03:59:04.149 --> 03:59:04.159 align:start position:0%
liability through informed consent to
 
03:59:06.590 --> 03:59:06.600 align:start position:0%
access and pay for the treatments that
 
03:59:09.469 --> 03:59:09.479 align:start position:0%
they want and New Hampshire uh is in is
 
03:59:12.670 --> 03:59:12.680 align:start position:0%
in a especially uniquely uh wonderful
 
03:59:14.670 --> 03:59:14.680 align:start position:0%
position to enact reforms like this
 
03:59:16.830 --> 03:59:16.840 align:start position:0%
because of our proximity to a biotech
 
03:59:20.309 --> 03:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
Hub thank you thank you for bearing with
 
03:59:23.469 --> 03:59:23.479 align:start position:0%
thank you other
 
03:59:26.710 --> 03:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
questions representative delus thank you
 
03:59:28.389 --> 03:59:28.399 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
03:59:33.070 --> 03:59:33.080 align:start position:0%
question um what comes to mind is the uh
 
03:59:36.229 --> 03:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
exemption for manufacturers of vaccines
 
03:59:38.870 --> 03:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
not to go back to vaccines but those
 
03:59:42.710 --> 03:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and entities are are not
 
03:59:45.550 --> 03:59:45.560 align:start position:0%
liable for any damage Dage done could
 
03:59:48.189 --> 03:59:48.199 align:start position:0%
language from I don't even know what the
 
03:59:50.670 --> 03:59:50.680 align:start position:0%
language is I'd have to look it up but
 
03:59:54.349 --> 03:59:54.359 align:start position:0%
could something like that be fit fitted
 
03:59:58.670 --> 03:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
into this so that the the people
 
04:00:00.510 --> 04:00:00.520 align:start position:0%
administering the
 
04:00:04.469 --> 04:00:04.479 align:start position:0%
experimental uh treatments would
 
04:00:04.479 --> 04:00:06.070 align:start position:0%
experimental uh treatments would
be

04:00:06.070 --> 04:00:06.080 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:00:09.429 --> 04:00:09.439 align:start position:0%
left not liable
 
04:00:14.309 --> 04:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
for possibly having a uh an out come
 
04:00:16.910 --> 04:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
that was certainly maybe even opposite
 
04:00:19.990 --> 04:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
of what the treatment was meant to be
 
04:00:21.309 --> 04:00:21.319 align:start position:0%
thank you representative damus that's a
 
04:00:23.590 --> 04:00:23.600 align:start position:0%
helpful analogy we have the government
 
04:00:25.590 --> 04:00:25.600 align:start position:0%
has statutory blanket exemption on
 
04:00:27.550 --> 04:00:27.560 align:start position:0%
liability for vaccine manufacturers
 
04:00:29.389 --> 04:00:29.399 align:start position:0%
because it made the Judgment call that
 
04:00:31.149 --> 04:00:31.159 align:start position:0%
promoting vaccines is so important we
 
04:00:32.790 --> 04:00:32.800 align:start position:0%
want to create a special incentive
 
04:00:35.389 --> 04:00:35.399 align:start position:0%
structure that promotes vaccination now
 
04:00:36.950 --> 04:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
this is different in that that is a
 
04:00:39.870 --> 04:00:39.880 align:start position:0%
blanket waiver of liability zero
 
04:00:42.550 --> 04:00:42.560 align:start position:0%
liability uh this does not uh this goes
 
04:00:44.110 --> 04:00:44.120 align:start position:0%
to representative Weber's question this
 
04:00:45.469 --> 04:00:45.479 align:start position:0%
is more moderate than that it's not a
 
04:00:47.110 --> 04:00:47.120 align:start position:0%
blanket waiver of liability it leaves
 
04:00:50.510 --> 04:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
some liability in place um so this is
 
04:00:52.670 --> 04:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
kind of a middle ground between current
 
04:00:54.910 --> 04:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
standard right to tral laws which sound
 
04:00:56.750 --> 04:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
nice until you realize that the
 
04:00:58.950 --> 04:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
negligence liability that isn't waved is
 
04:01:00.429 --> 04:01:00.439 align:start position:0%
basically just ordinary medical
 
04:01:01.870 --> 04:01:01.880 align:start position:0%
liability which doesn't really
 
04:01:03.510 --> 04:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
incentivize providers to administer
 
04:01:05.189 --> 04:01:05.199 align:start position:0%
these treatments it's a middle ground
 
04:01:07.950 --> 04:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
between that and something like blanket
 
04:01:10.349 --> 04:01:10.359 align:start position:0%
exemption of liability um for
 
04:01:12.030 --> 04:01:12.040 align:start position:0%
vaccination now if someone goes through
 
04:01:13.990 --> 04:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
informed consent if they're dying anyway
 
04:01:15.269 --> 04:01:15.279 align:start position:0%
way you know I think certainly if it was
 
04:01:18.309 --> 04:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
my relative my child if it was me uh I'd
 
04:01:20.269 --> 04:01:20.279 align:start position:0%
be I'd be happy with if I carefully
 
04:01:22.229 --> 04:01:22.239 align:start position:0%
chose the provider with a blanket waiver
 
04:01:24.070 --> 04:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
on liability if I went through informed
 
04:01:25.630 --> 04:01:25.640 align:start position:0%
consent and went through steps a through
 
04:01:28.670 --> 04:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
C but I think D is retained in here in
 
04:01:30.950 --> 04:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
the spirit of compromise of showing that
 
04:01:32.870 --> 04:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
this isn't a total waiver on liability
 
04:01:35.309 --> 04:01:35.319 align:start position:0%
there is some left in place so it's not
 
04:01:37.309 --> 04:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
it's not absolutely anything goes but
 
04:01:39.389 --> 04:01:39.399 align:start position:0%
it's further than anyone else is going
 
04:01:41.030 --> 04:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
so that we can draw these patients and
 
04:01:42.550 --> 04:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
providers to New
 
04:01:44.990 --> 04:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you thank you for your
 
04:01:47.910 --> 04:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
question other questions repres of
 
04:01:50.870 --> 04:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
kesing so is there any other states
 
04:01:53.070 --> 04:01:53.080 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you Mr chair sorry the um
 
04:01:54.990 --> 04:01:55.000 align:start position:0%
the provisions of this is there any
 
04:01:56.630 --> 04:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
other state that has anything like this
 
04:01:59.429 --> 04:01:59.439 align:start position:0%
that you would point to yes Montana is
 
04:02:01.750 --> 04:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
very similar this would put us a a bit
 
04:02:03.790 --> 04:02:03.800 align:start position:0%
beyond where Montana is but Montana is
 
04:02:05.110 --> 04:02:05.120 align:start position:0%
currently the leading state in the
 
04:02:06.750 --> 04:02:06.760 align:start position:0%
country for ride to try and clinical
 
04:02:10.309 --> 04:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
trials in that they greatly ctail civil
 
04:02:12.790 --> 04:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
liability which ordinary standard state
 
04:02:15.710 --> 04:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
right to trial do not curtail regulatory
 
04:02:17.670 --> 04:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement which sounds good but then
 
04:02:19.670 --> 04:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
the reality is you go to these providers
 
04:02:21.590 --> 04:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
and they say I'm absolutely paralyzed
 
04:02:23.510 --> 04:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
and terrified of civil liability I can't
 
04:02:25.870 --> 04:02:25.880 align:start position:0%
treat you you'll just have to die uh
 
04:02:28.790 --> 04:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
Montana does limit civil liability but
 
04:02:30.590 --> 04:02:30.600 align:start position:0%
we're very different from Montana and
 
04:02:33.030 --> 04:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
that there is no biotechnology Hub in
 
04:02:35.269 --> 04:02:35.279 align:start position:0%
Montana or 40 minutes from Montana so
 
04:02:37.269 --> 04:02:37.279 align:start position:0%
there's every reason to think New
 
04:02:39.110 --> 04:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could play a revolutionary
 
04:02:41.070 --> 04:02:41.080 align:start position:0%
role more than any of the other 49
 
04:02:43.309 --> 04:02:43.319 align:start position:0%
states if we took the lead in this area
 
04:02:45.030 --> 04:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
and Drew some of these innovators to
 
04:02:47.030 --> 04:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
just set up shop 40 minutes away
 
04:02:49.950 --> 04:02:49.960 align:start position:0%
patients like the children and families
 
04:02:52.349 --> 04:02:52.359 align:start position:0%
in the written testimony would come to
 
04:02:54.590 --> 04:02:54.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and this bill could save
 
04:02:54.600 --> 04:02:55.750 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and this bill could save
their

04:02:55.750 --> 04:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:02:58.590 --> 04:02:58.600 align:start position:0%
lives thank you anyone
 
04:03:01.550 --> 04:03:01.560 align:start position:0%
else representative
 
04:03:04.630 --> 04:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
lontine thank you Mr chair and thanks
 
04:03:06.590 --> 04:03:06.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my question thank you and at
 
04:03:08.710 --> 04:03:08.720 align:start position:0%
the risk of embarrassing myself for a
 
04:03:11.149 --> 04:03:11.159 align:start position:0%
third time by not reading this really
 
04:03:14.469 --> 04:03:14.479 align:start position:0%
correctly today um but but somewhere in
 
04:03:18.149 --> 04:03:18.159 align:start position:0%
the statute when a patient wants this
 
04:03:22.510 --> 04:03:22.520 align:start position:0%
treatment and their consent do they not
 
04:03:26.510 --> 04:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
also sign something that we accept this
 
04:03:26.520 --> 04:03:28.189 align:start position:0%
also sign something that we accept this
experimental

04:03:28.189 --> 04:03:28.199 align:start position:0%
experimental
 
04:03:31.429 --> 04:03:31.439 align:start position:0%
and we're not going to sue the doctor
 
04:03:33.269 --> 04:03:33.279 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for your excellent
 
04:03:37.110 --> 04:03:37.120 align:start position:0%
question that is on um page one and that
 
04:03:40.950 --> 04:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
is on lines 24 through 26 there is a
 
04:03:44.990 --> 04:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
requirement of written informed con ENT
 
04:03:47.110 --> 04:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
um and that informed consent requires a
 
04:03:48.910 --> 04:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
certain mental capacity so it's not
 
04:03:52.910 --> 04:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:56.309 --> 04:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
signature representative Weber and as a
 
04:03:59.229 --> 04:03:59.239 align:start position:0%
followup to representative laman's
 
04:04:03.229 --> 04:04:03.239 align:start position:0%
question um the informed consent
 
04:04:06.670 --> 04:04:06.680 align:start position:0%
provision is very helpful but I think
 
04:04:10.429 --> 04:04:10.439 align:start position:0%
that what she was asking about is why
 
04:04:12.469 --> 04:04:12.479 align:start position:0%
would the patient not also I mean
 
04:04:16.550 --> 04:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
obviously if this is if this is PED it
 
04:04:19.229 --> 04:04:19.239 align:start position:0%
gets around the necessity but wouldn't a
 
04:04:21.269 --> 04:04:21.279 align:start position:0%
physician also ask a patient for a
 
04:04:23.469 --> 04:04:23.479 align:start position:0%
waiver of liability rather than just
 
04:04:23.479 --> 04:04:24.950 align:start position:0%
waiver of liability rather than just
informed

04:04:24.950 --> 04:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
informed
 
04:04:28.630 --> 04:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
consent well of course uh and this would
 
04:04:31.309 --> 04:04:31.319 align:start position:0%
Empower them to wave liability um so you
 
04:04:33.429 --> 04:04:33.439 align:start position:0%
take for example actually Dr Stillman
 
04:04:34.710 --> 04:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
talks about in her written testimony
 
04:04:36.670 --> 04:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
this in very explicit detail she was she
 
04:04:39.269 --> 04:04:39.279 align:start position:0%
said write up whatever you want I'll
 
04:04:42.110 --> 04:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
sign any waiver of anything you want I
 
04:04:44.550 --> 04:04:44.560 align:start position:0%
just she had she an ER doctor she'
 
04:04:45.910 --> 04:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
researched this treatment she said this
 
04:04:48.070 --> 04:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
may save my husband's life I don't care
 
04:04:49.790 --> 04:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
about the risks he's about to die in a
 
04:04:50.990 --> 04:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
matter of months please administer the
 
04:04:52.990 --> 04:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
treatment I will wave liability and the
 
04:04:55.910 --> 04:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
lawyers for the doctor advised him this
 
04:04:57.710 --> 04:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
waiver of liability will not be
 
04:05:01.149 --> 04:05:01.159 align:start position:0%
effective so um we need statutory
 
04:05:03.110 --> 04:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
clarification to say that you are
 
04:05:05.229 --> 04:05:05.239 align:start position:0%
allowed through informed consent to wave
 
04:05:07.790 --> 04:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
liability to to create a revolutionary
 
04:05:09.429 --> 04:05:09.439 align:start position:0%
legal regime that will attract these
 
04:05:11.870 --> 04:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
kinds of treatments to the
 
04:05:14.429 --> 04:05:14.439 align:start position:0%
state repres Castle
 
04:05:15.990 --> 04:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just a follow-up
 
04:05:18.910 --> 04:05:18.920 align:start position:0%
question so legally would this be
 
04:05:21.389 --> 04:05:21.399 align:start position:0%
required as one document to be signed or
 
04:05:23.110 --> 04:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
would multiple Physicians dealing with
 
04:05:26.349 --> 04:05:26.359 align:start position:0%
that patient have to sign similar forms
 
04:05:27.990 --> 04:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
for each of these yes thank you for your
 
04:05:29.870 --> 04:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
question there are multiple and this is
 
04:05:31.469 --> 04:05:31.479 align:start position:0%
fairly common among ride to tr laws but
 
04:05:33.309 --> 04:05:33.319 align:start position:0%
we incorporated this into this bill text
 
04:05:34.710 --> 04:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
there are multiple Physicians that are
 
04:05:36.670 --> 04:05:36.680 align:start position:0%
involved in this process and the the key
 
04:05:38.110 --> 04:05:38.120 align:start position:0%
Provisions to look at here are on the
 
04:05:42.510 --> 04:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
first page uh 19 through about 23 so you
 
04:05:44.349 --> 04:05:44.359 align:start position:0%
need physician certific a of
 
04:05:46.269 --> 04:05:46.279 align:start position:0%
life-threatening disease and then you
 
04:05:49.149 --> 04:05:49.159 align:start position:0%
need physician certification of no
 
04:05:51.630 --> 04:05:51.640 align:start position:0%
alternative FDA approved treatments and
 
04:05:53.750 --> 04:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
then only then would you qualify for the
 
04:05:53.760 --> 04:05:56.469 align:start position:0%
then only then would you qualify for the
informed

04:05:56.469 --> 04:05:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:58.750 --> 04:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
consent representative
 
04:06:01.630 --> 04:06:01.640 align:start position:0%
lontine thank you Mr chair but about
 
04:06:03.830 --> 04:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
that con informed
 
04:06:06.950 --> 04:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
consent um I'm a little
 
04:06:10.309 --> 04:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
surprised that you would allow
 
04:06:13.229 --> 04:06:13.239 align:start position:0%
someone who lacks a mental capacity to
 
04:06:15.830 --> 04:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
have someone else give this
 
04:06:19.070 --> 04:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
consent oh can you elaborate on that
 
04:06:21.550 --> 04:06:21.560 align:start position:0%
well if you look for example at um the
 
04:06:22.830 --> 04:06:22.840 align:start position:0%
testimony which you all have and all
 
04:06:25.469 --> 04:06:25.479 align:start position:0%
distribute from the six sets of parents
 
04:06:26.630 --> 04:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
uh one of whom is the president of
 
04:06:28.269 --> 04:06:28.279 align:start position:0%
something called the lcmd Research
 
04:06:29.910 --> 04:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
Foundation that's a lethal genetic
 
04:06:32.469 --> 04:06:32.479 align:start position:0%
illness that may very soon be treatable
 
04:06:34.149 --> 04:06:34.159 align:start position:0%
um similar genetic illnesses are being
 
04:06:36.469 --> 04:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
treated and the other parents all have
 
04:06:38.389 --> 04:06:38.399 align:start position:0%
genetic illnesses these these children
 
04:06:41.389 --> 04:06:41.399 align:start position:0%
are very young so they're certainly
 
04:06:44.269 --> 04:06:44.279 align:start position:0%
going to die unless they receive some
 
04:06:45.750 --> 04:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
revolutionary treatment when they're
 
04:06:47.750 --> 04:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
children and they don't have the
 
04:06:50.070 --> 04:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
capacity to make these sorts of informed
 
04:06:52.070 --> 04:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
decisions on their own so all of these
 
04:06:54.189 --> 04:06:54.199 align:start position:0%
parents want to air on the side of let's
 
04:06:55.550 --> 04:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
administer the treatment even though
 
04:06:57.269 --> 04:06:57.279 align:start position:0%
that that means we're giving consent on
 
04:06:59.189 --> 04:06:59.199 align:start position:0%
their behalf um because they're
 
04:07:00.830 --> 04:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
certainly not going to be in a position
 
04:07:02.389 --> 04:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
to make this decision as adults if
 
04:07:04.189 --> 04:07:04.199 align:start position:0%
they're not treated as
 
04:07:08.990 --> 04:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
children H your microphone's not on it
 
04:07:11.110 --> 04:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
wasn't the question about the minor but
 
04:07:11.120 --> 04:07:12.229 align:start position:0%
wasn't the question about the minor but
for

04:07:12.229 --> 04:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:07:15.750 --> 04:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
someone or or lack the mental
 
04:07:15.760 --> 04:07:18.149 align:start position:0%
someone or or lack the mental
capacity

04:07:18.149 --> 04:07:18.159 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
04:07:20.870 --> 04:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
um well that someone with that type of
 
04:07:23.590 --> 04:07:23.600 align:start position:0%
language is I'm I'm sorry representative
 
04:07:26.030 --> 04:07:26.040 align:start position:0%
someone with an intellectual disability
 
04:07:29.229 --> 04:07:29.239 align:start position:0%
something like that would not have the
 
04:07:30.950 --> 04:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
that be able to give
 
04:07:35.429 --> 04:07:35.439 align:start position:0%
consent yes um so the language here in
 
04:07:37.710 --> 04:07:37.720 align:start position:0%
under informed consent says if the
 
04:07:39.389 --> 04:07:39.399 align:start position:0%
patient is a minor or lacks the mental
 
04:07:40.990 --> 04:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
capacity to provide informed consent a
 
04:07:42.830 --> 04:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
parent or legal guardian has given
 
04:07:44.070 --> 04:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
written informed consent on the
 
04:07:45.710 --> 04:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
patient's behalf so yes that would
 
04:07:47.590 --> 04:07:47.600 align:start position:0%
include people who are non-ch but
 
04:07:49.429 --> 04:07:49.439 align:start position:0%
similarly don't have the legal capacity
 
04:07:51.710 --> 04:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
to make that decision that is pretty
 
04:07:53.870 --> 04:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
standard language in um that's one of
 
04:07:55.229 --> 04:07:55.239 align:start position:0%
the less revolutionary things about this
 
04:07:56.950 --> 04:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
bill that's in most right to try laws
 
04:07:59.469 --> 04:07:59.479 align:start position:0%
and the intent there is basically you
 
04:08:01.710 --> 04:08:01.720 align:start position:0%
may have an illness uh that greatly
 
04:08:04.590 --> 04:08:04.600 align:start position:0%
deprives someone of the ability to make
 
04:08:06.630 --> 04:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
an informed decision over the you know
 
04:08:09.590 --> 04:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
the course of their dying and a relative
 
04:08:11.229 --> 04:08:11.239 align:start position:0%
a legal guardian may want the capacity
 
04:08:14.750 --> 04:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
to try to save that person's life
 
04:08:14.760 --> 04:08:16.070 align:start position:0%
to try to save that person's life
representative

04:08:16.070 --> 04:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:08:18.389 --> 04:08:18.399 align:start position:0%
Lucas thank you Mr chairman thanks for
 
04:08:23.429 --> 04:08:23.439 align:start position:0%
taking my question um just um and I I
 
04:08:25.030 --> 04:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar with the appropriate
 
04:08:27.590 --> 04:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
legal terms but if someone has
 
04:08:29.670 --> 04:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
previously indicated they didn't want
 
04:08:31.790 --> 04:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
Extraordinary Measures to keep them
 
04:08:35.550 --> 04:08:35.560 align:start position:0%
alive um would
 
04:08:39.630 --> 04:08:39.640 align:start position:0%
this uh Clause once they become mentally
 
04:08:42.229 --> 04:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
unable because of their illness to make
 
04:08:44.469 --> 04:08:44.479 align:start position:0%
this kind of decision
 
04:08:46.469 --> 04:08:46.479 align:start position:0%
but we know there preferences from
 
04:08:50.750 --> 04:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
before would this bill allow
 
04:08:56.710 --> 04:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
um close relative spouse child to then
 
04:08:58.830 --> 04:08:58.840 align:start position:0%
override their previous preferences and
 
04:09:01.790 --> 04:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
make the request for the medication I
 
04:09:03.910 --> 04:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
think that's unlikely representative but
 
04:09:05.389 --> 04:09:05.399 align:start position:0%
I don't think it would hurt the intent
 
04:09:06.910 --> 04:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
of Bill whatsoever if there was an
 
04:09:09.790 --> 04:09:09.800 align:start position:0%
explicit clarification to that effect
 
04:09:13.750 --> 04:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you anyone else
 
04:09:15.510 --> 04:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
seeing no one else oh I'm sorry
 
04:09:17.670 --> 04:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
representative marel yes thank you uh
 
04:09:18.910 --> 04:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
04:09:20.910 --> 04:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
question sir
 
04:09:24.469 --> 04:09:24.479 align:start position:0%
um uh I'm thinking about health care
 
04:09:26.950 --> 04:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
proxies in this particular situation
 
04:09:28.910 --> 04:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
what do you foresee the impact of a
 
04:09:32.389 --> 04:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
health care proxy for somebody
 
04:09:34.349 --> 04:09:34.359 align:start position:0%
being and you were talking about legal
 
04:09:36.349 --> 04:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
Guardians is that correct yes but I'm
 
04:09:38.630 --> 04:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
also thinking so when I as I read your
 
04:09:40.429 --> 04:09:40.439 align:start position:0%
bill I'm thinking about somebody for
 
04:09:42.950 --> 04:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
example with Alzheimer's or some other
 
04:09:46.189 --> 04:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
demen or some other impairment for
 
04:09:49.109 --> 04:09:49.119 align:start position:0%
cognitive re sound cognitive reasoning
 
04:09:50.910 --> 04:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
can you tell me what you think that the
 
04:09:52.670 --> 04:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
health care the effect of a health care
 
04:09:54.950 --> 04:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
proxy is is that going to be valid in
 
04:09:57.910 --> 04:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
this situation if they have legal legal
 
04:09:59.109 --> 04:09:59.119 align:start position:0%
guardianship of the person
 
04:10:00.870 --> 04:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
representative than under the bill as
 
04:10:02.550 --> 04:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
written now then they would be able to
 
04:10:04.429 --> 04:10:04.439 align:start position:0%
provide written informed consent okay
 
04:10:06.269 --> 04:10:06.279 align:start position:0%
okay follow-up question sir followup
 
04:10:08.429 --> 04:10:08.439 align:start position:0%
thank you what if the healthc care proxy
 
04:10:10.990 --> 04:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily include a re a
 
04:10:13.309 --> 04:10:13.319 align:start position:0%
guardianship in our practice for example
 
04:10:15.429 --> 04:10:15.439 align:start position:0%
example as an attorney we generally
 
04:10:19.309 --> 04:10:19.319 align:start position:0%
design U paperwork for for Elder elder
 
04:10:22.269 --> 04:10:22.279 align:start position:0%
care where we have healthc care proxies
 
04:10:24.950 --> 04:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
and we have a variety of other things in
 
04:10:29.030 --> 04:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
addition to wills and so forth and um so
 
04:10:31.670 --> 04:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
the if I understand the intent of this
 
04:10:34.590 --> 04:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
statute legislation is that it's going
 
04:10:36.469 --> 04:10:36.479 align:start position:0%
to require somebody become a legal
 
04:10:38.590 --> 04:10:38.600 align:start position:0%
guardian in addition to be giving a
 
04:10:41.070 --> 04:10:41.080 align:start position:0%
healthcare proxy yes that's correct if I
 
04:10:42.870 --> 04:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
can confidently say if someone had some
 
04:10:44.510 --> 04:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
other kind of healthcare decision-making
 
04:10:46.229 --> 04:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
Authority that did not rise to the level
 
04:10:48.030 --> 04:10:48.040 align:start position:0%
of legal guardianship I can't imagine
 
04:10:50.590 --> 04:10:50.600 align:start position:0%
any Court Reading into this explicit
 
04:10:52.429 --> 04:10:52.439 align:start position:0%
requirement of legal guardianship that
 
04:10:54.070 --> 04:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
you know any other Healthcare making
 
04:10:55.670 --> 04:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
decision- making Authority is sufficient
 
04:10:58.550 --> 04:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you anyone
 
04:11:01.990 --> 04:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
else see oh representative
 
04:11:07.109 --> 04:11:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:10.710 --> 04:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
chairman this is a a very complicated
 
04:11:14.670 --> 04:11:14.680 align:start position:0%
question from my point of view my
 
04:11:18.469 --> 04:11:18.479 align:start position:0%
concerned if there's anything in this
 
04:11:21.830 --> 04:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
legislation that would allow for
 
04:11:24.469 --> 04:11:24.479 align:start position:0%
physician assisted
 
04:11:26.510 --> 04:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
suicide that was I'm sorry
 
04:11:27.830 --> 04:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
representative were you I didn't mean to
 
04:11:29.630 --> 04:11:29.640 align:start position:0%
interrupt you
 
04:11:33.070 --> 04:11:33.080 align:start position:0%
that's that that's a kind of a question
 
04:11:34.830 --> 04:11:34.840 align:start position:0%
uh particularly
 
04:11:36.670 --> 04:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
under uh
 
04:11:38.790 --> 04:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
24 line
 
04:11:38.800 --> 04:11:42.109 align:start position:0%
24 line
24

04:11:42.109 --> 04:11:42.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:45.149 --> 04:11:45.159 align:start position:0%
C the patient has given a written and
 
04:11:47.630 --> 04:11:47.640 align:start position:0%
formed consent for the use of drug
 
04:11:50.750 --> 04:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
biologic or so and
 
04:11:54.070 --> 04:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
so it seems to give
 
04:11:56.750 --> 04:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
permission uh for
 
04:11:58.630 --> 04:11:58.640 align:start position:0%
suicide yes thank you for your question
 
04:11:59.830 --> 04:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
representative I'm glad you brought that
 
04:12:01.429 --> 04:12:01.439 align:start position:0%
up some stakeholders involved in
 
04:12:04.269 --> 04:12:04.279 align:start position:0%
crafting this bill text wanted to ensure
 
04:12:06.950 --> 04:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
that the bill did not speak one way or
 
04:12:09.189 --> 04:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
the other to physician assisted suicide
 
04:12:10.830 --> 04:12:10.840 align:start position:0%
that it did not prohibit physician
 
04:12:14.070 --> 04:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
assisted suicide but also every all the
 
04:12:16.349 --> 04:12:16.359 align:start position:0%
sponsors or many of the sponsors wanted
 
04:12:17.990 --> 04:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure it did not provide any
 
04:12:20.189 --> 04:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
further authorization to physician
 
04:12:23.149 --> 04:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
assisted suicide and that is in fact why
 
04:12:26.670 --> 04:12:26.680 align:start position:0%
20 lines 28 through 29 on page one say
 
04:12:29.269 --> 04:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
willful misconduct shall include any
 
04:12:31.269 --> 04:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
conduct intended to hasten the death of
 
04:12:33.070 --> 04:12:33.080 align:start position:0%
a patient now to tie this Cinder
 
04:12:35.670 --> 04:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
representative Weber's question neither
 
04:12:38.790 --> 04:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
does this does do these two lines
 
04:12:41.189 --> 04:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
prohibit uh intentionally hastening the
 
04:12:43.309 --> 04:12:43.319 align:start position:0%
death of the patient in any new way
 
04:12:46.269 --> 04:12:46.279 align:start position:0%
because it is a double negative so it is
 
04:12:49.510 --> 04:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
saying liability is not waved under
 
04:12:51.429 --> 04:12:51.439 align:start position:0%
these circumstances so it's it
 
04:12:53.710 --> 04:12:53.720 align:start position:0%
explicitly does not wave liability if
 
04:12:55.950 --> 04:12:55.960 align:start position:0%
there is any conduct intended to hasten
 
04:12:57.830 --> 04:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
the death of the patient but neither
 
04:13:00.910 --> 04:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
would it create any new liability uh in
 
04:13:02.830 --> 04:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
that situation that doesn't exist now
 
04:13:04.550 --> 04:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
representative Weber because of the uh
 
04:13:07.309 --> 04:13:07.319 align:start position:0%
double negative of that overall
 
04:13:11.469 --> 04:13:11.479 align:start position:0%
provision thank you thank you anyone
 
04:13:13.710 --> 04:13:13.720 align:start position:0%
else seeing no one else thank you thank
 
04:13:18.750 --> 04:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:30.149 --> 04:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:32.429 --> 04:13:32.439 align:start position:0%
lewicki thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:13:34.349 --> 04:13:34.359 align:start position:0%
members of the committee you may
 
04:13:37.510 --> 04:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
remember I was here a year ago and told
 
04:13:40.469 --> 04:13:40.479 align:start position:0%
you that in New Hampshire not only um
 
04:13:42.109 --> 04:13:42.119 align:start position:0%
unlike other places not only can dead
 
04:13:44.229 --> 04:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
people vote they can uh speak before a
 
04:13:48.189 --> 04:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
legislative committee um a year ago I
 
04:13:49.590 --> 04:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
was probably a little bit closer to
 
04:13:52.389 --> 04:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
death than I am now and this is a result
 
04:13:55.229 --> 04:13:55.239 align:start position:0%
of actually doing right to try things on
 
04:13:57.710 --> 04:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
my own uh my history four years ago
 
04:13:59.750 --> 04:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
approximately this time of year I was
 
04:14:02.389 --> 04:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
told that I had a treatable condition
 
04:14:04.670 --> 04:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
when they say treatable that means
 
04:14:07.070 --> 04:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
incurable um I've been living with this
 
04:14:10.269 --> 04:14:10.279 align:start position:0%
for four years now I have tried numerous
 
04:14:13.189 --> 04:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
things that have uh you know most of the
 
04:14:14.830 --> 04:14:14.840 align:start position:0%
chicken soup basically things that are
 
04:14:17.070 --> 04:14:17.080 align:start position:0%
going to do very little harm and can
 
04:14:19.950 --> 04:14:19.960 align:start position:0%
actually have a potential Cur Curative
 
04:14:23.189 --> 04:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
effect um and within the past year I've
 
04:14:24.630 --> 04:14:24.640 align:start position:0%
done two things I was one of these
 
04:14:27.429 --> 04:14:27.439 align:start position:0%
people flying around the country um did
 
04:14:29.990 --> 04:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
one thing in Texas in uh at the end of
 
04:14:34.109 --> 04:14:34.119 align:start position:0%
April last year and that was in my mind
 
04:14:37.469 --> 04:14:37.479 align:start position:0%
um minimally effective uh then a few
 
04:14:40.349 --> 04:14:40.359 align:start position:0%
months ago I went to Florida and had a
 
04:14:43.149 --> 04:14:43.159 align:start position:0%
treatment which used agents that have
 
04:14:45.109 --> 04:14:45.119 align:start position:0%
basically passed I don't know whether
 
04:14:46.510 --> 04:14:46.520 align:start position:0%
they're completely into the public
 
04:14:50.149 --> 04:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
domain but um you know well-known agents
 
04:14:53.349 --> 04:14:53.359 align:start position:0%
in a different manner than usually given
 
04:14:55.710 --> 04:14:55.720 align:start position:0%
and I'm currently seeing very positive
 
04:14:58.630 --> 04:14:58.640 align:start position:0%
effects from that and one of the points
 
04:15:00.710 --> 04:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
um now this is somewhat different from
 
04:15:03.590 --> 04:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
hb300 last year but it's all going in
 
04:15:06.030 --> 04:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
the same direction which is basically if
 
04:15:08.309 --> 04:15:08.319 align:start position:0%
we have people who are fully informed
 
04:15:10.790 --> 04:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
then why should they not be able to try
 
04:15:12.990 --> 04:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
something that is potentially Curative
 
04:15:16.950 --> 04:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
or might extend their lives and um as
 
04:15:21.070 --> 04:15:21.080 align:start position:0%
the people before me have spoken um this
 
04:15:22.950 --> 04:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
we have an establishment the legal
 
04:15:24.590 --> 04:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
medical establishment and I don't say
 
04:15:26.670 --> 04:15:26.680 align:start position:0%
Healthcare I used to have health care
 
04:15:29.550 --> 04:15:29.560 align:start position:0%
but that was before I got this condition
 
04:15:32.429 --> 04:15:32.439 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:15:36.030 --> 04:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
um The Establishment says if you do the
 
04:15:38.910 --> 04:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
conventional thing then you're home free
 
04:15:40.790 --> 04:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
if you do something unconventional and
 
04:15:43.309 --> 04:15:43.319 align:start position:0%
it goes wrong then there's liability and
 
04:15:46.750 --> 04:15:46.760 align:start position:0%
those concerns uh prevent treatment I
 
04:15:48.630 --> 04:15:48.640 align:start position:0%
have doctors here in New Hampshire who
 
04:15:51.070 --> 04:15:51.080 align:start position:0%
are very interested in what I did in my
 
04:15:53.389 --> 04:15:53.399 align:start position:0%
treatment in Florida and who very
 
04:15:55.309 --> 04:15:55.319 align:start position:0%
possibly would be willing to do it here
 
04:15:57.950 --> 04:15:57.960 align:start position:0%
if things work out now I am a clinical
 
04:16:00.750 --> 04:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
trial of one uh there's no drug company
 
04:16:02.990 --> 04:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
that is going to promote the agents and
 
04:16:05.189 --> 04:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
the treatment that I have received
 
04:16:07.790 --> 04:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
because that treatment is never going to
 
04:16:11.070 --> 04:16:11.080 align:start position:0%
make a drug company a billion dollars um
 
04:16:15.750 --> 04:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
it um and so I cannot be a CL in a
 
04:16:17.309 --> 04:16:17.319 align:start position:0%
clinical trial there is no clinical
 
04:16:19.189 --> 04:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
trial to do the thing that I've done and
 
04:16:20.710 --> 04:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
there won't be because of the lack of
 
04:16:23.109 --> 04:16:23.119 align:start position:0%
financial incentive on the other hand
 
04:16:26.710 --> 04:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
the incentives legal and U so forth are
 
04:16:31.550 --> 04:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
to quite the opposite um and so what we
 
04:16:34.750 --> 04:16:34.760 align:start position:0%
um being able to do these things is
 
04:16:37.870 --> 04:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
really has to be outside okay and the
 
04:16:39.389 --> 04:16:39.399 align:start position:0%
other thing that I'd like to point out
 
04:16:42.269 --> 04:16:42.279 align:start position:0%
is that what we get from this not only
 
04:16:44.109 --> 04:16:44.119 align:start position:0%
is perh perhaps people's lives being
 
04:16:46.389 --> 04:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
saved or whatever we get data points in
 
04:16:47.950 --> 04:16:47.960 align:start position:0%
the past year I've produced two data
 
04:16:49.790 --> 04:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
points one of which was minimally
 
04:16:52.309 --> 04:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
effective the other which appears to be
 
04:16:55.750 --> 04:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
working um I'm quite willing to take you
 
04:16:57.269 --> 04:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
know questions on the nuts and bolts of
 
04:16:58.710 --> 04:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
this afterward I don't think I should
 
04:17:02.309 --> 04:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
get into that here so there my story
 
04:17:05.189 --> 04:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
thank you any
 
04:17:11.510 --> 04:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:14.269 --> 04:17:14.279 align:start position:0%
you Al
 
04:17:16.109 --> 04:17:16.119 align:start position:0%

s thank you chairman McDonald and thank
 
04:17:40.149 --> 04:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
you members of the committee for
 
04:17:41.870 --> 04:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak my name is Holly
 
04:17:43.469 --> 04:17:43.479 align:start position:0%
Haynes I'm a member of of the New
 
04:17:45.670 --> 04:17:45.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association for justice I'm a
 
04:17:48.149 --> 04:17:48.159 align:start position:0%
resident of wear and I'm also a medical
 
04:17:49.910 --> 04:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
malpractice attorney in Manchester New
 
04:17:52.469 --> 04:17:52.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I represent patients who
 
04:17:55.269 --> 04:17:55.279 align:start position:0%
are harmed by NE negligent medical care
 
04:17:58.229 --> 04:17:58.239 align:start position:0%
including care involving the negligent
 
04:18:01.349 --> 04:18:01.359 align:start position:0%
use of drugs biologic products and
 
04:18:04.229 --> 04:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
devices I also personally currently have
 
04:18:07.109 --> 04:18:07.119 align:start position:0%
a family member who is engaged in a
 
04:18:09.229 --> 04:18:09.239 align:start position:0%
clinical trial in the Boston area she
 
04:18:11.469 --> 04:18:11.479 align:start position:0%
has a terminal illness and there are no
 
04:18:15.070 --> 04:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
other treatments and she is um so I have
 
04:18:17.349 --> 04:18:17.359 align:start position:0%
a personal interest in this I think this
 
04:18:20.950 --> 04:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
bill is very well intentioned and I
 
04:18:22.950 --> 04:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
certainly am in favor of clinical trials
 
04:18:24.790 --> 04:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
I think they Foster advances in medicine
 
04:18:28.109 --> 04:18:28.119 align:start position:0%
that are very good for patients but for
 
04:18:29.710 --> 04:18:29.720 align:start position:0%
them to proceed they have to be highly
 
04:18:31.590 --> 04:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
regulated they have to be performed
 
04:18:34.710 --> 04:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
reasonably and they have to be performed
 
04:18:38.309 --> 04:18:38.319 align:start position:0%
responsibly um this bill does not Foster
 
04:18:39.830 --> 04:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
that or encourage that and that's the
 
04:18:41.710 --> 04:18:41.720 align:start position:0%
reason that I'm here in opposition to
 
04:18:43.550 --> 04:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
the language as Dr Ed I do think
 
04:18:45.550 --> 04:18:45.560 align:start position:0%
amendments could be made that could make
 
04:18:47.990 --> 04:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
this palatable to everyone and make it
 
04:18:50.750 --> 04:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
consistent with federal law the first
 
04:18:52.830 --> 04:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
reason for opposition to this is the
 
04:18:54.990 --> 04:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
major change in it as members of this
 
04:18:56.070 --> 04:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
committee know the New Hampshire
 
04:18:57.910 --> 04:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
Association for justice is opposed to
 
04:19:00.710 --> 04:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
any bill that encourages immunity from
 
04:19:03.229 --> 04:19:03.239 align:start position:0%
liability one of the reasons that no
 
04:19:05.429 --> 04:19:05.439 align:start position:0%
other state in the nation has this type
 
04:19:09.670 --> 04:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
of blanket immunity or stay out of court
 
04:19:11.830 --> 04:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
freedom is because it's prohibited by
 
04:19:14.070 --> 04:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
federal law I have the Federal
 
04:19:15.790 --> 04:19:15.800 align:start position:0%
Regulation which I tried to submit with
 
04:19:17.389 --> 04:19:17.399 align:start position:0%
my testimony but I wasn't allowed to
 
04:19:20.590 --> 04:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
submit to um require to attachments at
 
04:19:24.149 --> 04:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
the same time and
 
04:19:28.630 --> 04:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
CFR 21 CFR part
 
04:19:31.429 --> 04:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
5020 regarding human subjects in
 
04:19:34.790 --> 04:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
clinical trial require that no informed
 
04:19:36.710 --> 04:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
consent whether oral or written may
 
04:19:38.670 --> 04:19:38.680 align:start position:0%
include any exculpatory language through
 
04:19:40.790 --> 04:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
which the subject or the representative
 
04:19:42.750 --> 04:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
is made to wave or appear to wave any
 
04:19:45.469 --> 04:19:45.479 align:start position:0%
the subject's legal rights or releases
 
04:19:47.429 --> 04:19:47.439 align:start position:0%
or appears to release the investigator
 
04:19:48.950 --> 04:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
the sponsor the institution or the
 
04:19:50.710 --> 04:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
agents from any type of liability or
 
04:19:52.870 --> 04:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
negligence that's codified in federal
 
04:19:55.149 --> 04:19:55.159 align:start position:0%
law so the immunity Provisions are
 
04:19:57.070 --> 04:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
already in violation of that and they
 
04:19:58.429 --> 04:19:58.439 align:start position:0%
would be preempted by the Federal
 
04:20:02.309 --> 04:20:02.319 align:start position:0%
Regulation so immunity itself is not a
 
04:20:03.870 --> 04:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
good thing one of our responsibilities
 
04:20:06.910 --> 04:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
as Society members is to act reasonably
 
04:20:09.189 --> 04:20:09.199 align:start position:0%
we act reasonably and medical providers
 
04:20:11.309 --> 04:20:11.319 align:start position:0%
need to act reasonably as well I think
 
04:20:12.670 --> 04:20:12.680 align:start position:0%
that's one of the concerns that
 
04:20:16.429 --> 04:20:16.439 align:start position:0%
representative Weber raised um you can't
 
04:20:18.750 --> 04:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
be immune from unreasonable conduct
 
04:20:20.309 --> 04:20:20.319 align:start position:0%
there are many cases I don't think any
 
04:20:21.710 --> 04:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
medical provider in the state of New
 
04:20:22.670 --> 04:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I don't think any
 
04:20:24.510 --> 04:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical please start wrapping up
 
04:20:27.109 --> 04:20:27.119 align:start position:0%
manufacturer intends or would engage in
 
04:20:30.510 --> 04:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
willful misconduct to harm a patient but
 
04:20:32.189 --> 04:20:32.199 align:start position:0%
there are ways in a clinical trial that
 
04:20:35.030 --> 04:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
it could be done unreasonably if for
 
04:20:36.429 --> 04:20:36.439 align:start position:0%
example you were trying to get people
 
04:20:37.710 --> 04:20:37.720 align:start position:0%
into the trial and get them into
 
04:20:40.349 --> 04:20:40.359 align:start position:0%
treatment quickly a physician may not
 
04:20:41.990 --> 04:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
look at a patient's entire medical
 
04:20:42.000 --> 04:20:43.349 align:start position:0%
look at a patient's entire medical
history

04:20:43.349 --> 04:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
history
 
04:20:45.550 --> 04:20:45.560 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to move on quickly if
 
04:20:47.349 --> 04:20:47.359 align:start position:0%
you'll indulge me your time's pretty
 
04:20:50.030 --> 04:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
much up but maybe the other piece of
 
04:20:51.630 --> 04:20:51.640 align:start position:0%
language that I think needs to be
 
04:20:53.870 --> 04:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
amended is this bill expands liability
 
04:20:56.109 --> 04:20:56.119 align:start position:0%
sub U I'm sorry not liability but the
 
04:20:58.269 --> 04:20:58.279 align:start position:0%
scope of the statute the right to try
 
04:21:02.630 --> 04:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
statute significantly by extending it to
 
04:21:05.790 --> 04:21:05.800 align:start position:0%
um illnesses as Oppo it's not terminal
 
04:21:08.030 --> 04:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
illnesses anymore it extends it to
 
04:21:10.229 --> 04:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
life-threatening diseases which is a
 
04:21:11.830 --> 04:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
slippery slope of anything it could be
 
04:21:13.910 --> 04:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
heart disease it could be diabetes it
 
04:21:15.149 --> 04:21:15.159 align:start position:0%
could be dementia it could be
 
04:21:16.950 --> 04:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's or many other things we will
 
04:21:18.469 --> 04:21:18.479 align:start position:0%
look at your online testimony if you
 
04:21:20.149 --> 04:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
have anything else you want us to have
 
04:21:22.149 --> 04:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
please feel free to email the committee
 
04:21:24.109 --> 04:21:24.119 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman but in the meantime
 
04:21:25.630 --> 04:21:25.640 align:start position:0%
we do have questions so representative
 
04:21:27.189 --> 04:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
Weber thank
 
04:21:33.950 --> 04:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:36.670 --> 04:21:36.680 align:start position:0%
fine just didn't want to forget that
 
04:21:39.830 --> 04:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you um would you be willing to
 
04:21:44.269 --> 04:21:44.279 align:start position:0%
provide us with language that you think
 
04:21:47.189 --> 04:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
might both get us farther forward in
 
04:21:52.109 --> 04:21:52.119 align:start position:0%
allowing patients to try things that
 
04:21:53.149 --> 04:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
might be
 
04:21:56.309 --> 04:21:56.319 align:start position:0%
helpful under appropriate circumstances
 
04:21:58.630 --> 04:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
and that would not violate the federal
 
04:22:01.269 --> 04:22:01.279 align:start position:0%
law is that something you could send it
 
04:22:04.950 --> 04:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
send to us for to to work on I'm happy
 
04:22:07.189 --> 04:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
to representative Weber and I think the
 
04:22:09.510 --> 04:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
two easy amendments would be just
 
04:22:11.950 --> 04:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
eliminating the immunity provisions and
 
04:22:14.469 --> 04:22:14.479 align:start position:0%
switching all references to um
 
04:22:16.670 --> 04:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
life-threatening illness to terminal
 
04:22:18.070 --> 04:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
illness which is already defined in the
 
04:22:20.990 --> 04:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
right to try statute thank you
 
04:22:23.109 --> 04:22:23.119 align:start position:0%
representative Castle R thank you Mr
 
04:22:24.630 --> 04:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for my question I'm
 
04:22:27.550 --> 04:22:27.560 align:start position:0%
looking on line six it says ineligible
 
04:22:31.429 --> 04:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
um on page one for or not selected uh to
 
04:22:34.030 --> 04:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
participate in a clinical trial so does
 
04:22:37.349 --> 04:22:37.359 align:start position:0%
that provision there change um the
 
04:22:39.510 --> 04:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
federal let's say standing for clinical
 
04:22:40.950 --> 04:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
trial since they're not really being
 
04:22:42.790 --> 04:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
enrolled in a clinical trial just a
 
04:22:43.910 --> 04:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
question on
 
04:22:47.670 --> 04:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
that um that line if you read the entire
 
04:22:49.710 --> 04:22:49.720 align:start position:0%
portion it's regarding pre-screening to
 
04:22:52.429 --> 04:22:52.439 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not the person is
 
04:22:56.070 --> 04:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
eligible or ineligible for the trial so
 
04:22:57.670 --> 04:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh under the federal provision is there
 
04:22:59.429 --> 04:22:59.439 align:start position:0%
a screening process that they would have
 
04:23:02.349 --> 04:23:02.359 align:start position:0%
to qualify for that trial seeing is that
 
04:23:04.790 --> 04:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
I'm just asking in reference to both I
 
04:23:06.469 --> 04:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
believe that all clinical trials have
 
04:23:08.070 --> 04:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
pre-screening and I can tell you from
 
04:23:09.590 --> 04:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
personal experience with my mother's
 
04:23:11.189 --> 04:23:11.199 align:start position:0%
clinical trial I'm a co-participant in
 
04:23:13.830 --> 04:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
it and they require because it involves
 
04:23:15.710 --> 04:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's and Dementia they require a
 
04:23:17.750 --> 04:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
co-participant or a witness with the
 
04:23:19.510 --> 04:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
capability to witness all consents and
 
04:23:22.030 --> 04:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
all pre screenings and it I think it's
 
04:23:23.790 --> 04:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
required for every clinical trial to
 
04:23:25.389 --> 04:23:25.399 align:start position:0%
have a full pre-screening to determine
 
04:23:27.229 --> 04:23:27.239 align:start position:0%
whether or not a patient is eligible and
 
04:23:28.750 --> 04:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
that's one of our biggest concerns is
 
04:23:32.229 --> 04:23:32.239 align:start position:0%
that a prescreening may be done to
 
04:23:34.750 --> 04:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
cursor not thoroughly enough or not
 
04:23:36.349 --> 04:23:36.359 align:start position:0%
reasonably if you're trying to push
 
04:23:37.630 --> 04:23:37.640 align:start position:0%
people through the system to get them
 
04:23:39.870 --> 04:23:39.880 align:start position:0%
treatment quickly it may not be done
 
04:23:41.750 --> 04:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
reasonably and it may cause more harm
 
04:23:44.429 --> 04:23:44.439 align:start position:0%
than good
 
04:23:47.349 --> 04:23:47.359 align:start position:0%
represent palazov thank you Mr chair
 
04:23:49.070 --> 04:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
 
04:23:53.670 --> 04:23:53.680 align:start position:0%
question so uh I'm trying to uh
 
04:23:56.229 --> 04:23:56.239 align:start position:0%
understand the situation that was
 
04:24:00.990 --> 04:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
presented when uh doctors are afraid to
 
04:24:04.590 --> 04:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
try anything and they would rather let
 
04:24:10.109 --> 04:24:10.119 align:start position:0%
patients die than uh uh try a new
 
04:24:14.389 --> 04:24:14.399 align:start position:0%
potentially life saving uh treatment uh
 
04:24:17.309 --> 04:24:17.319 align:start position:0%
and allegedly it's because they afraid
 
04:24:20.870 --> 04:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
of um malpractice attorneys and that
 
04:24:26.229 --> 04:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
they will they will be uh fed uh
 
04:24:26.239 --> 04:24:27.750 align:start position:0%
they will they will be uh fed uh
despite

04:24:27.750 --> 04:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
despite
 
04:24:32.189 --> 04:24:32.199 align:start position:0%
uh prior agreement so could you comment
 
04:24:35.269 --> 04:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
on it sure thank you for your question
 
04:24:37.750 --> 04:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
um I think by making the amendment to
 
04:24:39.590 --> 04:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
switching everything to terminal illness
 
04:24:41.750 --> 04:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
from lifethreatening disease will be
 
04:24:44.149 --> 04:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
part of that and the Federal Regulations
 
04:24:46.469 --> 04:24:46.479 align:start position:0%
themselves already have an exception for
 
04:24:48.550 --> 04:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
patients who are at imminent threat of
 
04:24:51.149 --> 04:24:51.159 align:start position:0%
death the informed consent exception
 
04:24:52.790 --> 04:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply for that there are
 
04:24:54.670 --> 04:24:54.680 align:start position:0%
exemptions in that federal statute for
 
04:24:56.950 --> 04:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
those precise situations when there
 
04:24:59.149 --> 04:24:59.159 align:start position:0%
isn't time to get the full prescreening
 
04:25:01.070 --> 04:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
or there isn't time to get the informed
 
04:25:03.149 --> 04:25:03.159 align:start position:0%
consent because a patient is going to
 
04:25:04.670 --> 04:25:04.680 align:start position:0%
die if they don't immediately if they
 
04:25:06.229 --> 04:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
don't get the treatment so I think
 
04:25:09.109 --> 04:25:09.119 align:start position:0%
that's already covered by federal
 
04:25:12.670 --> 04:25:12.680 align:start position:0%
law other questions representative CLE
 
04:25:15.109 --> 04:25:15.119 align:start position:0%
ring thank you Mr chair I'm trying to
 
04:25:17.710 --> 04:25:17.720 align:start position:0%
word this in the proper way but why
 
04:25:20.309 --> 04:25:20.319 align:start position:0%
would it matter if a or if a patient is
 
04:25:23.469 --> 04:25:23.479 align:start position:0%
to that degree and they're about to die
 
04:25:25.750 --> 04:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
you just outlin that federal law already
 
04:25:28.030 --> 04:25:28.040 align:start position:0%
has a provision for it so why is it
 
04:25:30.189 --> 04:25:30.199 align:start position:0%
important to under the law let's say to
 
04:25:32.710 --> 04:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
do that if a patient has gone to that
 
04:25:35.670 --> 04:25:35.680 align:start position:0%
extent just curious like if they're
 
04:25:36.870 --> 04:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
about to let's say they're they're
 
04:25:38.670 --> 04:25:38.680 align:start position:0%
imminent they've only got two weeks to
 
04:25:41.429 --> 04:25:41.439 align:start position:0%
live why would you know why would the
 
04:25:43.309 --> 04:25:43.319 align:start position:0%
provision or why would this not cover
 
04:25:44.710 --> 04:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
that because that you're basically
 
04:25:47.189 --> 04:25:47.199 align:start position:0%
stating that you know there's a tri the
 
04:25:49.269 --> 04:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
trial period that you had like I think
 
04:25:52.550 --> 04:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
your family member versus somebody that
 
04:25:56.109 --> 04:25:56.119 align:start position:0%
is at the last last chance I mean you
 
04:25:57.269 --> 04:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
said there's already provision in law
 
04:25:59.550 --> 04:25:59.560 align:start position:0%
for that so why would this be different
 
04:26:01.269 --> 04:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
I think that this bill would cover that
 
04:26:02.550 --> 04:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
and it would still cover that if the
 
04:26:04.109 --> 04:26:04.119 align:start position:0%
language was just changed to terminal
 
04:26:05.830 --> 04:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
illness as it's currently defined in the
 
04:26:07.469 --> 04:26:07.479 align:start position:0%
right to Tri
 
04:26:07.479 --> 04:26:09.429 align:start position:0%
right to Tri
act

04:26:09.429 --> 04:26:09.439 align:start position:0%
act
 
04:26:13.189 --> 04:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
okay representative damus
 
04:26:16.149 --> 04:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman actually um I see
 
04:26:20.590 --> 04:26:20.600 align:start position:0%
on line five on page one also it says uh
 
04:26:23.109 --> 04:26:23.119 align:start position:0%
uh determine whether a person with a
 
04:26:25.469 --> 04:26:25.479 align:start position:0%
life-threatening disease may be so if we
 
04:26:27.670 --> 04:26:27.680 align:start position:0%
changed that language to terminal as
 
04:26:30.309 --> 04:26:30.319 align:start position:0%
well would that be part of what we' need
 
04:26:30.319 --> 04:26:31.510 align:start position:0%
well would that be part of what we' need
to

04:26:31.510 --> 04:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:26:33.990 --> 04:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
do I would suggest that every reference
 
04:26:35.469 --> 04:26:35.479 align:start position:0%
in the statute to life-threatening
 
04:26:36.830 --> 04:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
disease should be changed to terminal
 
04:26:38.349 --> 04:26:38.359 align:start position:0%
illness and that's already defined in
 
04:26:43.990 --> 04:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:44.000 --> 04:26:46.070 align:start position:0%
 
anyone

04:26:46.070 --> 04:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
04:26:49.109 --> 04:26:49.119 align:start position:0%
else saying no one else thank you thank
 
04:26:49.119 --> 04:26:56.710 align:start position:0%
else saying no one else thank you thank
you

04:26:56.710 --> 04:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:59.030 --> 04:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
chairman also signed up to speak is
 
04:26:59.040 --> 04:27:08.630 align:start position:0%
chairman also signed up to speak is
Aubrey

04:27:08.630 --> 04:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:11.710 --> 04:27:11.720 align:start position:0%
fredman uh Aubrey Mr chairman committee
 
04:27:13.630 --> 04:27:13.640 align:start position:0%
members Aubrey Friedman I speak in
 
04:27:16.469 --> 04:27:16.479 align:start position:0%
support of this bill
 
04:27:19.550 --> 04:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
um it's weird
 
04:27:22.870 --> 04:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
that it would I think everybody in this
 
04:27:24.990 --> 04:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
room most people would want to help
 
04:27:27.670 --> 04:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
somebody who wants to live
 
04:27:30.910 --> 04:27:30.920 align:start position:0%
to have access to all
 
04:27:30.920 --> 04:27:32.510 align:start position:0%
to have access to all
possible

04:27:32.510 --> 04:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
possible
 
04:27:37.229 --> 04:27:37.239 align:start position:0%
uh drugs or whatever you know any
 
04:27:39.510 --> 04:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
possible thing
 
04:27:42.750 --> 04:27:42.760 align:start position:0%
and why would we uh why Would we not
 
04:27:44.670 --> 04:27:44.680 align:start position:0%
make it easier for somebody to try
 
04:27:46.510 --> 04:27:46.520 align:start position:0%
they're in the last there's nothing to
 
04:27:49.870 --> 04:27:49.880 align:start position:0%
lose and they know it I and it it seems
 
04:27:52.630 --> 04:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
this is a crazy world where there there
 
04:27:56.710 --> 04:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
are things available and Doctors Medical
 
04:27:59.109 --> 04:27:59.119 align:start position:0%
providers won't do that because they're
 
04:28:03.269 --> 04:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
afraid of being sued that's crazy
 
04:28:05.830 --> 04:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
so I I think this bill is great if
 
04:28:09.790 --> 04:28:09.800 align:start position:0%
there's uh something in it that you
 
04:28:12.189 --> 04:28:12.199 align:start position:0%
know let's change it a little bit
 
04:28:14.349 --> 04:28:14.359 align:start position:0%
whatever but I mean this is crazy not to
 
04:28:17.030 --> 04:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
go forward I mean does your body belong
 
04:28:19.229 --> 04:28:19.239 align:start position:0%
to you or not the person I would seem to
 
04:28:21.950 --> 04:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
me if they're in the a terminal they're
 
04:28:25.830 --> 04:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
not going to be worried about suing now
 
04:28:28.070 --> 04:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
maybe family members might be who knows
 
04:28:30.070 --> 04:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
whatever you can't say but if they're
 
04:28:31.750 --> 04:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
willing to sign that they're not going
 
04:28:35.109 --> 04:28:35.119 align:start position:0%
to do it I mean what more does there
 
04:28:38.469 --> 04:28:38.479 align:start position:0%
need to be so um and then the what was
 
04:28:40.910 --> 04:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
it uh mean you either own your body or
 
04:28:43.070 --> 04:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
not does it belong to you or the state
 
04:28:45.630 --> 04:28:45.640 align:start position:0%
if the state is going to be so uh
 
04:28:47.349 --> 04:28:47.359 align:start position:0%
protective of you that you're going it's
 
04:28:49.309 --> 04:28:49.319 align:start position:0%
going to let you die doesn't make sense
 
04:28:53.790 --> 04:28:53.800 align:start position:0%
also the remote signing the TAA uh tahel
 
04:28:53.800 --> 04:28:54.630 align:start position:0%
also the remote signing the TAA uh tahel
uh

04:28:54.630 --> 04:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:28:56.750 --> 04:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
pre-screening uh that makes things
 
04:28:59.590 --> 04:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
easier again we should be compassionate
 
04:29:02.630 --> 04:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
and uh want to make things easier for
 
04:29:05.630 --> 04:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
somebody who's obviously going to die or
 
04:29:08.309 --> 04:29:08.319 align:start position:0%
is a terminal so why make it harder so
 
04:29:10.269 --> 04:29:10.279 align:start position:0%
those are something and everybody does
 
04:29:12.269 --> 04:29:12.279 align:start position:0%
remote things these days and so that's
 
04:29:15.550 --> 04:29:15.560 align:start position:0%
not even a big deal um we should be
 
04:29:17.510 --> 04:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
compassionate and I'm glad that there's
 
04:29:20.630 --> 04:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
some teeth in this bill about protecting
 
04:29:23.790 --> 04:29:23.800 align:start position:0%
the uh uh medical providers if they're
 
04:29:28.070 --> 04:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
too afraid to help out then we need to
 
04:29:30.830 --> 04:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
get rid of that uh so that people can
 
04:29:33.149 --> 04:29:33.159 align:start position:0%
give them a chance to live so I I
 
04:29:35.349 --> 04:29:35.359 align:start position:0%
totally support this bill that's it
 
04:29:38.710 --> 04:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any
 
04:29:40.910 --> 04:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
questions seeing done thank you thank
 
04:29:40.920 --> 04:29:44.469 align:start position:0%
questions seeing done thank you thank

no one else has signed up to testify
 
04:29:48.149 --> 04:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
does anyone else wish to
 
04:29:50.229 --> 04:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
testify seeing no one I am going to
 
04:29:53.990 --> 04:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on HB 701 FN
 
04:29:55.349 --> 04:29:55.359 align:start position:0%
that concludes all of the public
 
04:29:57.389 --> 04:29:57.399 align:start position:0%
hearings we had scheduled for
 
04:30:00.109 --> 04:30:00.119 align:start position:0%
today uh perhaps a brief recess would be
 
04:30:01.590 --> 04:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
in order and then we will go into
 
04:30:05.590 --> 04:30:05.600 align:start position:0%

04:50:30.470 --> 04:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
right I'd like to call the executive
 
04:50:33.788 --> 04:50:33.798 align:start position:0%
session to order we've already exec one
 
04:50:36.150 --> 04:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
of the five bills that I had mentioned
 
04:50:38.670 --> 04:50:38.680 align:start position:0%
to a number of you but um we do have
 
04:50:40.990 --> 04:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
four remaining I'd like to start off
 
04:50:43.628 --> 04:50:43.638 align:start position:0%
with hr7 and representative Maser I
 
04:50:45.708 --> 04:50:45.718 align:start position:0%
believe you have a
 
04:50:50.190 --> 04:50:50.200 align:start position:0%
motion yes Mr chair thank you I would
 
04:50:51.430 --> 04:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
like to move
 
04:50:51.440 --> 04:50:53.830 align:start position:0%
like to move
hr7

04:50:53.830 --> 04:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
hr7
 
04:50:55.830 --> 04:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
itl for
 
04:51:00.390 --> 04:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
y was H7 representative D seconds you
 
04:51:03.670 --> 04:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
wish to speak to your motion yes um so
 
04:51:07.270 --> 04:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
while we as we know while non-binding um
 
04:51:09.150 --> 04:51:09.160 align:start position:0%
just a house resolution could be used to
 
04:51:11.628 --> 04:51:11.638 align:start position:0%
justify future legisl or funding
 
04:51:14.350 --> 04:51:14.360 align:start position:0%
decisions that a lot of taxpayers and
 
04:51:18.270 --> 04:51:18.280 align:start position:0%
lawmakers uh do oppose so why and a
 
04:51:20.150 --> 04:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
question I'm going to keep this sure is
 
04:51:23.070 --> 04:51:23.080 align:start position:0%
why a house resolution on just this we
 
04:51:26.150 --> 04:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
should be priori prioritizing policies
 
04:51:28.548 --> 04:51:28.558 align:start position:0%
and Revol resolutions that address
 
04:51:31.830 --> 04:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
adoption maternal care support for women
 
04:51:33.548 --> 04:51:33.558 align:start position:0%
rather than specifically highlighting
 
04:51:36.470 --> 04:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
abortion focusing so solely on abortion
 
04:51:39.190 --> 04:51:39.200 align:start position:0%
in a resolution overlooks other crit
 
04:51:42.430 --> 04:51:42.440 align:start position:0%
critical aspects such of such as support
 
04:51:44.910 --> 04:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
for high-risk pregnancies preventive
 
04:51:47.230 --> 04:51:47.240 align:start position:0%
care such as cancer screenings for women
 
04:51:49.990 --> 04:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
and a lot more so that's why I'm voting
 
04:51:53.510 --> 04:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
itl on this other
 
04:51:56.470 --> 04:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Lucas thank
 
04:52:01.310 --> 04:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um I will be voting against
 
04:52:04.190 --> 04:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
itl uh as long as there are potentially
 
04:52:06.548 --> 04:52:06.558 align:start position:0%
deadly complications of pregnancy that
 
04:52:08.230 --> 04:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
would take the life of the mother if the
 
04:52:10.708 --> 04:52:10.718 align:start position:0%
pregnancy continued and as long as long
 
04:52:12.270 --> 04:52:12.280 align:start position:0%
as there are crimes against women
 
04:52:15.150 --> 04:52:15.160 align:start position:0%
including rape incest and sexual slavery
 
04:52:17.788 --> 04:52:17.798 align:start position:0%
there will be abortion New Hampshire
 
04:52:19.990 --> 04:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
should not victimize women for a second
 
04:52:22.548 --> 04:52:22.558 align:start position:0%
time by failing to recognize the
 
04:52:24.750 --> 04:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
importance of abortion in the provision
 
04:52:27.430 --> 04:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
of comprehensive Healthcare thank you
 
04:52:31.310 --> 04:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else any other
 
04:52:33.590 --> 04:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none uh representative
 
04:52:37.150 --> 04:52:37.160 align:start position:0%
Woods um thank you Mr chair um I I too
 
04:52:39.270 --> 04:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
will be voting against it I I completely
 
04:52:42.868 --> 04:52:42.878 align:start position:0%
agree with the previous speaker uh and
 
04:52:45.350 --> 04:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
the the need for many dimensions of
 
04:52:47.390 --> 04:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
Women's Health Care need to be
 
04:52:51.590 --> 04:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
identified um and that perhaps is is a
 
04:52:54.430 --> 04:52:54.440 align:start position:0%
time for another day uh but this
 
04:52:57.868 --> 04:52:57.878 align:start position:0%
particular issue is is a specific issue
 
04:53:00.310 --> 04:53:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh which in fact has raised uh a
 
04:53:03.350 --> 04:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
significant social dialogue both
 
04:53:07.270 --> 04:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
nationally U as Statewide and locally uh
 
04:53:10.230 --> 04:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
and a lot of it very personal um and I
 
04:53:13.948 --> 04:53:13.958 align:start position:0%
think it uh is a reflection of a
 
04:53:18.150 --> 04:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
position which is uh um worthy of of
 
04:53:20.948 --> 04:53:20.958 align:start position:0%
special attention and not to diminish
 
04:53:22.590 --> 04:53:22.600 align:start position:0%
what a previous speaker mentioned that
 
04:53:24.510 --> 04:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
other dimensions need to be addressed as
 
04:53:26.350 --> 04:53:26.360 align:start position:0%
well and I I completely agree in that
 
04:53:28.750 --> 04:53:28.760 align:start position:0%
regard uh but this is sufficiently
 
04:53:31.948 --> 04:53:31.958 align:start position:0%
special uh that I think it deserves uh a
 
04:53:34.750 --> 04:53:34.760 align:start position:0%
special place and a special comment
 
04:53:37.270 --> 04:53:37.280 align:start position:0%

0757 H ought to pass is second that I do
 
04:55:43.548 --> 04:55:43.558 align:start position:0%
you want to speak to your
 
04:55:47.670 --> 04:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
motion uh yes uh several of us on the
 
04:55:51.310 --> 04:55:51.320 align:start position:0%
committee thought that the original bill
 
04:55:56.430 --> 04:55:56.440 align:start position:0%
um didn't acknowledge um other Frontline
 
04:56:01.110 --> 04:56:01.120 align:start position:0%
workers that were um that were
 
04:56:03.110 --> 04:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
terminated um
 
04:56:06.150 --> 04:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
during uh covid for declining the
 
04:56:06.160 --> 04:56:07.670 align:start position:0%
during uh covid for declining the
covid-19

04:56:07.670 --> 04:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
covid-19
 
04:56:11.310 --> 04:56:11.320 align:start position:0%
vaccination and they they deserve equal
 
04:56:13.830 --> 04:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement um and and those that
 
04:56:16.390 --> 04:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
lost their jobs due to the vaccine
 
04:56:19.510 --> 04:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
mandates and encouraging policies that
 
04:56:22.150 --> 04:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
recognize and reintegrate them back into
 
04:56:23.390 --> 04:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
the healthc care
 
04:56:25.990 --> 04:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
Workforce and affirms the importance of
 
04:56:28.190 --> 04:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
medical choice and workplace protections
 
04:56:30.670 --> 04:56:30.680 align:start position:0%
for all health professionals so we
 
04:56:32.310 --> 04:56:32.320 align:start position:0%
thought that would Compass everyone that
 
04:56:34.590 --> 04:56:34.600 align:start position:0%
was part of the Frontline workers in
 
04:56:34.600 --> 04:56:35.590 align:start position:0%
was part of the Frontline workers in
during

04:56:35.590 --> 04:56:35.600 align:start position:0%
during
 
04:56:37.788 --> 04:56:37.798 align:start position:0%
covid representative
 
04:56:40.948 --> 04:56:40.958 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chairman
 
04:56:44.150 --> 04:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
one of the things I particularly
 
04:56:47.030 --> 04:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
appreciated about the original bill as
 
04:56:50.230 --> 04:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
originally drafted was that it
 
04:56:53.510 --> 04:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
was very
 
04:56:58.750 --> 04:56:58.760 align:start position:0%
all-encompassing and it was completely
 
04:57:01.948 --> 04:57:01.958 align:start position:0%
non-political this amendment politicizes
 
04:57:04.110 --> 04:57:04.120 align:start position:0%
the bill in a way that I think is
 
04:57:04.120 --> 04:57:05.670 align:start position:0%
the bill in a way that I think is
particularly

04:57:05.670 --> 04:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
04:57:08.190 --> 04:57:08.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunate and so I will be voting
 
04:57:10.830 --> 04:57:10.840 align:start position:0%
against the amendment and and if the
 
04:57:13.150 --> 04:57:13.160 align:start position:0%
amendment passes with great reluctance I
 
04:57:16.350 --> 04:57:16.360 align:start position:0%
will be voting against the bill and I
 
04:57:18.230 --> 04:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
would make it very clear that I am
 
04:57:20.788 --> 04:57:20.798 align:start position:0%
unwavering in my support for Frontline
 
04:57:24.670 --> 04:57:24.680 align:start position:0%
workers but I don't think that we need
 
04:57:27.470 --> 04:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
to work
 
04:57:31.150 --> 04:57:31.160 align:start position:0%
harder to enlarge the divides that we
 
04:57:32.990 --> 04:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
are already grappling
 
04:57:35.590 --> 04:57:35.600 align:start position:0%
with okay representative
 
04:57:40.590 --> 04:57:40.600 align:start position:0%
palaza uh thank you uh Mr chair uh uh I
 
04:57:44.750 --> 04:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
would agree that uh we need to support
 
04:57:47.310 --> 04:57:47.320 align:start position:0%
Frontline vocus and
 
04:57:49.990 --> 04:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
address address the shortage of
 
04:57:55.070 --> 04:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
healthcare vocus but uh I see the bill
 
04:57:58.390 --> 04:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
is originally written as very
 
04:58:03.070 --> 04:58:03.080 align:start position:0%
political uh for example uh uh page
 
04:58:08.350 --> 04:58:08.360 align:start position:0%
first lines five and six uh claim that
 
04:58:12.190 --> 04:58:12.200 align:start position:0%
uh it was pandemic that uh slaten
 
04:58:16.990 --> 04:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
economy and and and caed economic losses
 
04:58:20.110 --> 04:58:20.120 align:start position:0%
when uh it is a political statement
 
04:58:22.190 --> 04:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
because uh many of
 
04:58:25.390 --> 04:58:25.400 align:start position:0%
us uh believe that it was actually a
 
04:58:28.350 --> 04:58:28.360 align:start position:0%
government over reaction that destroyed
 
04:58:33.990 --> 04:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh e economy uh the next uh line 7
 
04:58:41.910 --> 04:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
to9 uh it uh uh lists uh only short of
 
04:58:47.110 --> 04:58:47.120 align:start position:0%
vocus um uh as as main factor for lack
 
04:58:50.270 --> 04:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
of services when many of us remember
 
04:58:53.310 --> 04:58:53.320 align:start position:0%
that it was government who closed
 
04:58:57.910 --> 04:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals to for delivering regular care
 
04:58:59.150 --> 04:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
and regular
 
04:59:05.990 --> 04:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
screening uh so so also even if uh we go
 
04:59:10.548 --> 04:59:10.558 align:start position:0%
only from testimonies that were um
 
04:59:14.470 --> 04:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
that we had in this committee uh there
 
04:59:19.430 --> 04:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
was a testimony about very concerning
 
04:59:24.310 --> 04:59:24.320 align:start position:0%
actions uh when anos was participating
 
04:59:27.190 --> 04:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
in isolating
 
04:59:30.070 --> 04:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
and uh family
 
04:59:32.430 --> 04:59:32.440 align:start position:0%
members uh and
 
04:59:35.110 --> 04:59:35.120 align:start position:0%
she understand that what she was doing
 
04:59:37.990 --> 04:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
is wrong but it's totally excused
 
04:59:41.430 --> 04:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
because it was at the order of DC but if
 
04:59:44.868 --> 04:59:44.878 align:start position:0%
you look at page two line
 
04:59:49.548 --> 04:59:49.558 align:start position:0%
five this bill is written it's actually
 
04:59:54.110 --> 04:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
sanks and reaffirms CDC so this bill has
 
04:59:58.150 --> 04:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
written is very political so this
 
05:00:02.110 --> 05:00:02.120 align:start position:0%
amendment uh I think is needed to bring
 
05:00:05.510 --> 05:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
at least some balance to it thank you
 
05:00:07.230 --> 05:00:07.240 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else representative
 
05:00:09.310 --> 05:00:09.320 align:start position:0%
kofol thank you Mr chairman so I
 
05:00:11.350 --> 05:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
actually don't see the original bill as
 
05:00:14.548 --> 05:00:14.558 align:start position:0%
political and I don't see I I understand
 
05:00:17.270 --> 05:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
why excuse me
 
05:00:21.070 --> 05:00:21.080 align:start position:0%
um there there may be a a an initial
 
05:00:23.030 --> 05:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
response to the amendment as being
 
05:00:26.750 --> 05:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
political having said that I think it is
 
05:00:28.548 --> 05:00:28.558 align:start position:0%
extraordinary I think many of us know
 
05:00:32.750 --> 05:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
people who were fired when you know
 
05:00:34.670 --> 05:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
because of a a medical personal medical
 
05:00:38.350 --> 05:00:38.360 align:start position:0%
decision that they made and
 
05:00:41.030 --> 05:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
um I I think the language in the in the
 
05:00:44.708 --> 05:00:44.718 align:start position:0%
amendment is um acknowledges that many
 
05:00:46.910 --> 05:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
people as as they were saying went from
 
05:00:49.430 --> 05:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
Heroes to zeros all of a
 
05:00:52.750 --> 05:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
sudden having said that I don't believe
 
05:00:54.708 --> 05:00:54.718 align:start position:0%
that this should be the focus of the
 
05:00:56.110 --> 05:00:56.120 align:start position:0%
bill I think it's important we
 
05:00:59.310 --> 05:00:59.320 align:start position:0%
acknowledge it so if we pass the
 
05:01:02.750 --> 05:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
amendment and are able to acknowledge
 
05:01:06.350 --> 05:01:06.360 align:start position:0%
the um the Injustice that was done to
 
05:01:08.868 --> 05:01:08.878 align:start position:0%
some people I think we can then turn our
 
05:01:11.150 --> 05:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
attention to the over all positive
 
05:01:13.670 --> 05:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
intention of the original House
 
05:01:15.670 --> 05:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
resolution uh that's why I will be
 
05:01:18.708 --> 05:01:18.718 align:start position:0%
supporting the amendment and um if it
 
05:01:20.670 --> 05:01:20.680 align:start position:0%
passes I will support the house
 
05:01:23.270 --> 05:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
resolution with a focus on the original
 
05:01:25.270 --> 05:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
intent which is that we really ought to
 
05:01:29.270 --> 05:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
uplift and acknowledge all of the people
 
05:01:33.070 --> 05:01:33.080 align:start position:0%
who have um who who have and do have
 
05:01:36.948 --> 05:01:36.958 align:start position:0%
responded and do respond um to crises
 
05:01:38.270 --> 05:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
like the
 
05:01:40.670 --> 05:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
pandemic representative
 
05:01:43.510 --> 05:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
haret uh I share uh representative
 
05:01:46.110 --> 05:01:46.120 align:start position:0%
Weber's uh disappointment I too was
 
05:01:48.350 --> 05:01:48.360 align:start position:0%
looking forward to uh supporting the
 
05:01:51.310 --> 05:01:51.320 align:start position:0%
initial bill and I'm really pretty
 
05:01:53.868 --> 05:01:53.878 align:start position:0%
disappointed in the amendment I think we
 
05:01:56.390 --> 05:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
brought a kind of political attention to
 
05:01:59.110 --> 05:01:59.120 align:start position:0%
this that was we just don't need right
 
05:02:01.910 --> 05:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
now it's unfortunate I think so I won't
 
05:02:06.510 --> 05:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:09.990 --> 05:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
McGrath so I'm one of the people that
 
05:02:10.000 --> 05:02:10.990 align:start position:0%
McGrath so I'm one of the people that
the

05:02:10.990 --> 05:02:11.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:02:13.350 --> 05:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
amendment helps
 
05:02:15.590 --> 05:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
to I guess
 
05:02:19.868 --> 05:02:19.878 align:start position:0%
showcase I think that the bill is great
 
05:02:23.110 --> 05:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
to support the Frontline
 
05:02:23.120 --> 05:02:25.910 align:start position:0%
to support the Frontline
workers

05:02:25.910 --> 05:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
workers
 
05:02:29.070 --> 05:02:29.080 align:start position:0%
um I wasn't fired for not getting the
 
05:02:31.670 --> 05:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine but I was fired for standing up
 
05:02:31.680 --> 05:02:33.070 align:start position:0%
vaccine but I was fired for standing up
for

05:02:33.070 --> 05:02:33.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:02:37.470 --> 05:02:37.480 align:start position:0%
children I am not I don't feel I'm being
 
05:02:40.390 --> 05:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
recognized in the original bill
 
05:02:42.628 --> 05:02:42.638 align:start position:0%
and although the resolution really
 
05:02:45.070 --> 05:02:45.080 align:start position:0%
focuses on being fired for not getting
 
05:02:45.080 --> 05:02:46.110 align:start position:0%
focuses on being fired for not getting
the

05:02:46.110 --> 05:02:46.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:02:49.910 --> 05:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine I feel that it does
 
05:02:53.548 --> 05:02:53.558 align:start position:0%
integrate the two people the two kinds
 
05:02:57.070 --> 05:02:57.080 align:start position:0%
of people that were on the front lines
 
05:02:57.080 --> 05:02:59.190 align:start position:0%
of people that were on the front lines
um

05:02:59.190 --> 05:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:03.708 --> 05:03:03.718 align:start position:0%
and I would urge you to vote for the
 
05:03:06.270 --> 05:03:06.280 align:start position:0%
amendment I feel like even though
 
05:03:09.270 --> 05:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
specifically it doesn't represent me
 
05:03:12.470 --> 05:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
that it kind of does and that's why I
 
05:03:15.590 --> 05:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
would support this bill with the
 
05:03:18.990 --> 05:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:22.110 --> 05:03:22.120 align:start position:0%
else as a co-sponsor of the bill uh I
 
05:03:23.788 --> 05:03:23.798 align:start position:0%
I'm prepared to vote for the amendment
 
05:03:26.350 --> 05:03:26.360 align:start position:0%
but also vote for the ultimate
 
05:03:28.948 --> 05:03:28.958 align:start position:0%
resolution whether it is amended or not
 
05:03:30.788 --> 05:03:30.798 align:start position:0%
because I think the recognition of our
 
05:03:32.868 --> 05:03:32.878 align:start position:0%
Frontline workers is is that that
 
05:03:34.750 --> 05:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
important I always try to find the
 
05:03:37.270 --> 05:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
middle ground whenever possible and and
 
05:03:38.628 --> 05:03:38.638 align:start position:0%
um it's one of the reasons I'm
 
05:03:39.868 --> 05:03:39.878 align:start position:0%
supporting the amendment because I I
 
05:03:41.868 --> 05:03:41.878 align:start position:0%
know it addressed some concerns and
 
05:03:44.150 --> 05:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
created others but anyway I'll be
 
05:03:48.070 --> 05:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
supporting I'll be voting for both so
 
05:03:50.270 --> 05:03:50.280 align:start position:0%
that being said if the clerk is ready
 
05:03:51.868 --> 05:03:51.878 align:start position:0%
I'll anyone else
 
05:03:54.868 --> 05:03:54.878 align:start position:0%
before saying no one uh I'll ask the
 
05:03:57.230 --> 05:03:57.240 align:start position:0%

05:03:58.868 --> 05:03:58.878 align:start position:0%

05:06:43.548 --> 05:06:43.558 align:start position:0%
actually um you're right we do have to
 
05:06:46.430 --> 05:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
go through all of the Motions so I would
 
05:06:53.708 --> 05:06:53.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:55.948 --> 05:06:55.958 align:start position:0%
Amendment okay so represented of Weber
 
05:06:58.708 --> 05:06:58.718 align:start position:0%
moves ought to pass
 
05:07:01.070 --> 05:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
period okay
 
05:07:04.670 --> 05:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
and um second was representative T
 
05:07:06.948 --> 05:07:06.958 align:start position:0%
representative T seconds okay any
 
05:07:12.190 --> 05:07:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:13.310 --> 05:07:13.320 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
05:07:19.190 --> 05:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
mlan uh yeah thank you um Mr chair so um
 
05:07:22.310 --> 05:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
I like the original uh amendment I I
 
05:07:23.948 --> 05:07:23.958 align:start position:0%
thought it was affirmative um I thought
 
05:07:26.430 --> 05:07:26.440 align:start position:0%
it was inclusive um I also did not have
 
05:07:29.190 --> 05:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
any problems with the amendment because
 
05:07:32.470 --> 05:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
contrary to see it as being political um
 
05:07:36.030 --> 05:07:36.040 align:start position:0%
I felt it it was recognizing people and
 
05:07:37.868 --> 05:07:37.878 align:start position:0%
and seeking to kind of pull people back
 
05:07:42.230 --> 05:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
together so I did not not see it as um
 
05:07:45.390 --> 05:07:45.400 align:start position:0%
divisive and so I I support it that
 
05:07:48.708 --> 05:07:48.718 align:start position:0%
being said if if the motion is um ought
 
05:07:51.470 --> 05:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
to pass I I will be supporting it
 
05:07:55.230 --> 05:07:55.240 align:start position:0%
because I do think that the original uh
 
05:07:57.868 --> 05:07:57.878 align:start position:0%
motion was an affirmative motion and I
 
05:07:59.868 --> 05:07:59.878 align:start position:0%
do want to support
 
05:08:02.548 --> 05:08:02.558 align:start position:0%
it anyone
 
05:08:05.150 --> 05:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
else and as I previously stated I will
 
05:08:07.350 --> 05:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
also support arop
 
05:08:10.230 --> 05:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
pass all right anyone else going going
 
05:08:14.470 --> 05:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
gone motion is ought to pass on hcr1
 
05:08:17.590 --> 05:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
16 please call the well Mr Clark rep
 
05:08:23.990 --> 05:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
Maser no rep mlan yes rep damus no rep
 
05:08:29.910 --> 05:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
kofalt no rep poov no clerk votes no rep
 
05:08:35.990 --> 05:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
marel no rep McGrath no rep kesslering
 
05:08:42.948 --> 05:08:42.958 align:start position:0%
no rep Weber yes rep McKay yes rep Woods
 
05:08:48.150 --> 05:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:53.750 --> 05:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
yes rep taes yes rep lontine yes rep
 
05:09:03.548 --> 05:09:03.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:20.270 --> 05:09:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:27.750 --> 05:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:32.708 --> 05:09:32.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:35.910 --> 05:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
eight and so so the majority motion
 
05:09:38.150 --> 05:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
would be ought to pass and the other
 
05:09:39.990 --> 05:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
motion would be
 
05:09:42.670 --> 05:09:42.680 align:start position:0%
uh ought to pass as amended right
 
05:09:45.670 --> 05:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
right we we did ought to pass as amended
 
05:09:49.070 --> 05:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
and that tied so that that failed
 
05:09:51.390 --> 05:09:51.400 align:start position:0%
because it was a tie and then the next
 
05:09:53.150 --> 05:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
motion was ought to pass and that came
 
05:09:57.390 --> 05:09:57.400 align:start position:0%
out 10 to8 so that passes V was 10 to
 
05:10:00.110 --> 05:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
eight so is the question what what does
 
05:10:02.030 --> 05:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
The Minority Report look like is that
 
05:10:04.948 --> 05:10:04.958 align:start position:0%
the question yeah who's doing it I am
 
05:10:07.990 --> 05:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
happy to write The Minority Report with
 
05:10:14.270 --> 05:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:17.430 --> 05:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
TPA that will The Minority
 
05:10:21.350 --> 05:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
Report will reflect
 
05:10:25.948 --> 05:10:25.958 align:start position:0%
otpa so it's there and if I may Mr
 
05:10:27.868 --> 05:10:27.878 align:start position:0%
chairman that Amendment will just show
 
05:10:29.750 --> 05:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
up in the calendar because he already
 
05:10:32.310 --> 05:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
has the amendment in front of him so in
 
05:10:37.030 --> 05:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
The Minority Report you write um the the
 
05:10:38.830 --> 05:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
number in and the clerk will just make
 
05:10:40.948 --> 05:10:40.958 align:start position:0%
sure that goes into the calendar for
 
05:10:44.270 --> 05:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
people's consideration at that point and
 
05:10:47.548 --> 05:10:47.558 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of the majority report who
 
05:10:49.590 --> 05:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
made the the motion representative we
 
05:10:52.270 --> 05:10:52.280 align:start position:0%
did I made the motion but it's your
 
05:10:54.788 --> 05:10:54.798 align:start position:0%
bill so I guess I'm I guess I'm writing
 
05:10:58.628 --> 05:10:58.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:02.190 --> 05:11:02.200 align:start position:0%
you why don't you write it sorry who is
 
05:11:03.470 --> 05:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
representative Weber is writing the
 
05:11:10.070 --> 05:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:12.628 --> 05:11:12.638 align:start position:0%
it's Unique
 
05:11:16.470 --> 05:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
yes all right um any other thoughts on
 
05:11:24.910 --> 05:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:29.030 --> 05:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
on okay moving on to HB 117
 
05:11:37.350 --> 05:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:41.110 --> 05:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
motion okay and um is there a second
 
05:11:43.868 --> 05:11:43.878 align:start position:0%
second representative brw
 
05:11:46.110 --> 05:11:46.120 align:start position:0%
seconds um representative McGrath you
 
05:11:47.708 --> 05:11:47.718 align:start position:0%
wish to speak to your
 
05:11:52.590 --> 05:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
motion yes thank you um
 
05:11:58.430 --> 05:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
so as a pharmacist um we interchange
 
05:12:01.350 --> 05:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
drugs all all the time and I realize
 
05:12:02.990 --> 05:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
that's what this is all about whether
 
05:12:06.390 --> 05:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
this is actually interchangeable or not
 
05:12:10.868 --> 05:12:10.878 align:start position:0%
so apparently they do do this in
 
05:12:12.670 --> 05:12:12.680 align:start position:0%
saves a ton of
 
05:12:17.150 --> 05:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
money um in the pharmacy it will save an
 
05:12:19.548 --> 05:12:19.558 align:start position:0%
incredible amount of time which we have
 
05:12:21.470 --> 05:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
very little of because they cut our
 
05:12:25.590 --> 05:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
staff all the time
 
05:12:30.150 --> 05:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
um and we we won't have to make calls
 
05:12:31.270 --> 05:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
get prior
 
05:12:34.670 --> 05:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
authorizations it will Empower us to
 
05:12:38.070 --> 05:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
consult with the patient and make the
 
05:12:39.708 --> 05:12:39.718 align:start position:0%
the decision with the
 
05:12:39.718 --> 05:12:42.190 align:start position:0%
the decision with the
patient

05:12:42.190 --> 05:12:42.200 align:start position:0%
patient
 
05:12:42.200 --> 05:12:44.150 align:start position:0%
patient
um

05:12:44.150 --> 05:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:48.070 --> 05:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
and they're not exactly the same
 
05:12:51.750 --> 05:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
medicine like a generic is but doctors
 
05:12:56.150 --> 05:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
do this all the time they might try one
 
05:12:59.350 --> 05:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
um cholesterol Med and it doesn't work
 
05:13:01.110 --> 05:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
or it has side effects so they try a
 
05:13:06.150 --> 05:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
different one so easily if there's a
 
05:13:10.030 --> 05:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
problem or the patient has not getting
 
05:13:12.510 --> 05:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
the results from the new medication it
 
05:13:15.310 --> 05:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
gets switched to the other medication
 
05:13:19.670 --> 05:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
just seems like um Common Sense Bill
 
05:13:21.830 --> 05:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative kof thank you
 
05:13:24.230 --> 05:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman so uh many of you may recall
 
05:13:26.590 --> 05:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
that this bill was first introduced in
 
05:13:29.430 --> 05:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
the last session by The Honorable U Gary
 
05:13:31.910 --> 05:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
Merchant and who is also the chair of
 
05:13:34.110 --> 05:13:34.120 align:start position:0%
the prescription drug Advisory Board and
 
05:13:37.510 --> 05:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
a champion of lowering um prescription
 
05:13:42.830 --> 05:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
drug costs for patients um so I I I
 
05:13:44.868 --> 05:13:44.878 align:start position:0%
actually have researched this fairly
 
05:13:47.350 --> 05:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
extensively because uh you know I got
 
05:13:50.190 --> 05:13:50.200 align:start position:0%
involved with with the bill last year
 
05:13:53.910 --> 05:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
and um you know this distinction between
 
05:13:58.030 --> 05:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
biosimilars and interchangeables is
 
05:13:58.040 --> 05:13:59.230 align:start position:0%
biosimilars and interchangeables is
certainly

05:13:59.230 --> 05:13:59.240 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
05:14:03.750 --> 05:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
confusing uh but um as representative
 
05:14:05.868 --> 05:14:05.878 align:start position:0%
McGrath pointed out it's there there's
 
05:14:08.910 --> 05:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
actually um you know in Europe they they
 
05:14:11.390 --> 05:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
have dispensed with that so I think um
 
05:14:15.070 --> 05:14:15.080 align:start position:0%
in the interest of saving patients money
 
05:14:18.190 --> 05:14:18.200 align:start position:0%
um you know preserving patient safety um
 
05:14:19.750 --> 05:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
I think this is a good bill and I plan
 
05:14:23.310 --> 05:14:23.320 align:start position:0%
to vote for it thank you representative
 
05:14:25.910 --> 05:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
Weber and in addition to what's already
 
05:14:27.750 --> 05:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
been said I think the bill has decent
 
05:14:30.830 --> 05:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
guard rails uh so that a provider who
 
05:14:34.230 --> 05:14:34.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't want substitution can say so and
 
05:14:36.390 --> 05:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
a patient who doesn't want substitution
 
05:14:39.548 --> 05:14:39.558 align:start position:0%
can say so so uh I think they're
 
05:14:42.948 --> 05:14:42.958 align:start position:0%
some protections there as well so I'll
 
05:14:46.150 --> 05:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
be voting for it representative Woods uh
 
05:14:49.110 --> 05:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
thank you I just Echo what
 
05:14:51.430 --> 05:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
representative Weber said and add one
 
05:14:53.788 --> 05:14:53.798 align:start position:0%
other thing I just a word of caution
 
05:14:55.990 --> 05:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
just from the technical perspective
 
05:14:59.708 --> 05:14:59.718 align:start position:0%
biosimilars are a very
 
05:15:03.868 --> 05:15:03.878 align:start position:0%
diffuse definition right now uh are
 
05:15:06.430 --> 05:15:06.440 align:start position:0%
fairly fairly concise but it's getting
 
05:15:09.150 --> 05:15:09.160 align:start position:0%
more and more diffuse and I think we
 
05:15:10.708 --> 05:15:10.718 align:start position:0%
have we're going to have to be attentive
 
05:15:14.230 --> 05:15:14.240 align:start position:0%
to this issue I I will vote for it uh
 
05:15:17.190 --> 05:15:17.200 align:start position:0%
but I just we going to have to be
 
05:15:20.948 --> 05:15:20.958 align:start position:0%
attentive thank you anyone
 
05:15:23.628 --> 05:15:23.638 align:start position:0%

05:16:10.510 --> 05:16:10.520 align:start position:0%
okay see
 
05:16:12.750 --> 05:16:12.760 align:start position:0%
none yeah representative McGrath you're
 
05:16:16.470 --> 05:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
doing the report on this thank
 
05:16:19.548 --> 05:16:19.558 align:start position:0%
you okay and then the final bill for
 
05:16:24.750 --> 05:16:24.760 align:start position:0%
executive session today HB 732 FN and
 
05:16:26.548 --> 05:16:26.558 align:start position:0%
representative kessle ring I believe you
 
05:16:28.030 --> 05:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
have an amendment that you've
 
05:16:31.270 --> 05:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
distributed yes I did Mr chair you wish
 
05:16:33.150 --> 05:16:33.160 align:start position:0%
to move your Amendment and speak to it
 
05:16:38.990 --> 05:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:41.070 --> 05:16:41.080 align:start position:0%
and representative uh D I believe you
 
05:16:42.750 --> 05:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
second you second would you like to
 
05:16:45.350 --> 05:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yes so there was a
 
05:16:48.548 --> 05:16:48.558 align:start position:0%
concern um in the bill itself that there
 
05:16:50.990 --> 05:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
was not a designated uh caregiver when
 
05:16:52.708 --> 05:16:52.718 align:start position:0%
it comes to children that are in the
 
05:16:54.350 --> 05:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
system or different things so worked
 
05:16:57.708 --> 05:16:57.718 align:start position:0%
with OS to work out the specific State
 
05:16:59.310 --> 05:16:59.320 align:start position:0%
designated caregiver which you can see
 
05:17:01.750 --> 05:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
on line 11 uh shall be the department of
 
05:17:03.150 --> 05:17:03.160 align:start position:0%
human health and services which is under
 
05:17:05.670 --> 05:17:05.680 align:start position:0%
the RSA it backs it up and then further
 
05:17:08.110 --> 05:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
down below it adds it in the other
 
05:17:11.150 --> 05:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:13.670 --> 05:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
that's now representative
 
05:17:16.230 --> 05:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you and I appreciate the
 
05:17:19.430 --> 05:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
effort but it doesn't fix the problem
 
05:17:22.390 --> 05:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
because when a child is the subject of
 
05:17:24.670 --> 05:17:24.680 align:start position:0%
an AB abuse neglect
 
05:17:27.030 --> 05:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
petition and they have been removed from
 
05:17:28.548 --> 05:17:28.558 align:start position:0%
their parents or sometimes even when
 
05:17:31.150 --> 05:17:31.160 align:start position:0%
they are still with their
 
05:17:33.990 --> 05:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
parents the parents retain their
 
05:17:36.310 --> 05:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
parental rights until they are
 
05:17:39.190 --> 05:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
terminated at the end of the proced
 
05:17:42.230 --> 05:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
ceeding so there is a period of often a
 
05:17:46.070 --> 05:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
year and sometimes more than that when
 
05:17:48.270 --> 05:17:48.280 align:start position:0%
the parents are still the person with
 
05:17:52.390 --> 05:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
the authority to consent and
 
05:17:56.430 --> 05:17:56.440 align:start position:0%
DHHS um which in this case would be
 
05:18:00.230 --> 05:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
DCF has no authority to consent I assume
 
05:18:02.110 --> 05:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
without knowing that they could go to
 
05:18:04.070 --> 05:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
the court and ask the court to give them
 
05:18:08.910 --> 05:18:08.920 align:start position:0%
that but unless and until dcyf has been
 
05:18:11.070 --> 05:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
designated the legal guardian of the
 
05:18:13.430 --> 05:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
child which does happen but it happens
 
05:18:16.548 --> 05:18:16.558 align:start position:0%
at the end uh and it happens under other
 
05:18:18.350 --> 05:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
circumstances too but not to get too
 
05:18:21.628 --> 05:18:21.638 align:start position:0%
technical about it unless DCF is the
 
05:18:24.548 --> 05:18:24.558 align:start position:0%
guardian of the child designated by a
 
05:18:27.430 --> 05:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
court they don't get to consent so we
 
05:18:29.990 --> 05:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
still have children this doesn't fix the
 
05:18:31.230 --> 05:18:31.240 align:start position:0%
problems there are children who are
 
05:18:33.670 --> 05:18:33.680 align:start position:0%
still in limbo so to answer can I answer
 
05:18:37.150 --> 05:18:37.160 align:start position:0%
your question so to answer that um OSS
 
05:18:38.750 --> 05:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
said this specifically we needed to
 
05:18:41.310 --> 05:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
include the RSA which we did that RSA
 
05:18:43.470 --> 05:18:43.480 align:start position:0%
covers basically that child is still
 
05:18:45.190 --> 05:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
under the that would have to be
 
05:18:47.590 --> 05:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
regulated under that RSA for the parent
 
05:18:49.990 --> 05:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
or Guardian the state does not have
 
05:18:52.670 --> 05:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
guardianship yet but that RSA clarifies
 
05:18:56.190 --> 05:18:56.200 align:start position:0%
when the state does take guardianship
 
05:18:59.350 --> 05:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
that it can so that RSA supposedly by
 
05:19:01.190 --> 05:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
adding it clarified it that was the
 
05:19:03.030 --> 05:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
reasoning that we put it in there and we
 
05:19:06.070 --> 05:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
added under that RSA so yes because of
 
05:19:07.788 --> 05:19:07.798 align:start position:0%
the question that came up that's why
 
05:19:09.510 --> 05:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
that RSA specific specifically listed in
 
05:19:10.990 --> 05:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
there that it's under it that's what
 
05:19:13.350 --> 05:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
I've been told for the legal side of it
 
05:19:14.830 --> 05:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
so I was trying to clear up both the
 
05:19:17.270 --> 05:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
language but also the intent and that is
 
05:19:19.788 --> 05:19:19.798 align:start position:0%
supposedly under that RSA that is the
 
05:19:22.830 --> 05:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
intent so just so you know
 
05:19:22.840 --> 05:19:24.510 align:start position:0%
intent so just so you know
representative

05:19:24.510 --> 05:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:19:27.190 --> 05:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
haret I think we can all appreciate the
 
05:19:30.590 --> 05:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
importance of making sure that kids and
 
05:19:33.670 --> 05:19:33.680 align:start position:0%
their parents understand the risks of
 
05:19:36.350 --> 05:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
psychotropic medications but as somebody
 
05:19:40.030 --> 05:19:40.040 align:start position:0%
who's literally sat in onund hundreds of
 
05:19:43.390 --> 05:19:43.400 align:start position:0%
prescribers with families and kids I've
 
05:19:46.270 --> 05:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
always seen as a matter of standard
 
05:19:49.070 --> 05:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
practice that the prescriber reviews
 
05:19:51.948 --> 05:19:51.958 align:start position:0%
with the parents and the child what the
 
05:19:54.788 --> 05:19:54.798 align:start position:0%
risks the benefits of the medications
 
05:19:57.390 --> 05:19:57.400 align:start position:0%
are what the side effects are so it's
 
05:19:57.400 --> 05:19:58.788 align:start position:0%
are what the side effects are so it's
standard

05:19:58.788 --> 05:19:58.798 align:start position:0%
standard
 
05:20:01.788 --> 05:20:01.798 align:start position:0%
practice um My worry is that we're
 
05:20:05.030 --> 05:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
trying to sort of fix something that may
 
05:20:08.190 --> 05:20:08.200 align:start position:0%
not necessarily be a problem I also have
 
05:20:10.430 --> 05:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
concerns I appreciate representative L
 
05:20:12.830 --> 05:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
montine always reminding us of
 
05:20:16.230 --> 05:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
specifically uh just including Medicaid
 
05:20:18.910 --> 05:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
patients if we're that this concerned
 
05:20:21.910 --> 05:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
about uh prescribing uh practices for
 
05:20:25.150 --> 05:20:25.160 align:start position:0%
kids why aren't we making it for all uh
 
05:20:28.230 --> 05:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
miners additionally uh the requirement
 
05:20:29.830 --> 05:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
to review the
 
05:20:33.230 --> 05:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
FDA uh literature that accompanies these
 
05:20:35.910 --> 05:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
medications I think representative Weber
 
05:20:39.590 --> 05:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
pointed out um just how uh
 
05:20:42.110 --> 05:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
impenetrable uh those documents are and
 
05:20:45.548 --> 05:20:45.558 align:start position:0%
they won't really serve in addition to
 
05:20:48.270 --> 05:20:48.280 align:start position:0%
inform uh parent or a child about what
 
05:20:49.990 --> 05:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
the risks and benefits of the medicines
 
05:20:53.470 --> 05:20:53.480 align:start position:0%
are so I will not be uh supporting uh
 
05:20:56.628 --> 05:20:56.638 align:start position:0%
the bill representative Castle I'd like
 
05:20:58.470 --> 05:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
to speak to that Mr chair specifically
 
05:21:01.270 --> 05:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
to the I asked the same question to OSS
 
05:21:02.670 --> 05:21:02.680 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to get to the bottom of it
 
05:21:04.390 --> 05:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
because I did have concern that we
 
05:21:07.510 --> 05:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
should expand it Beyond Medicaid um the
 
05:21:10.110 --> 05:21:10.120 align:start position:0%
ru making was the question because under
 
05:21:11.948 --> 05:21:11.958 align:start position:0%
certain Provisions that we put in
 
05:21:15.390 --> 05:21:15.400 align:start position:0%
Medicaid as a whole they are made uh
 
05:21:17.110 --> 05:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
let's say standards for the medical
 
05:21:19.070 --> 05:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
professionals and they follow those so
 
05:21:22.110 --> 05:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
the idea was that if we started here we
 
05:21:23.788 --> 05:21:23.798 align:start position:0%
could always expand if there was an
 
05:21:25.430 --> 05:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
issue but under Ru making more than
 
05:21:27.628 --> 05:21:27.638 align:start position:0%
likely most medical professionals would
 
05:21:30.868 --> 05:21:30.878 align:start position:0%
put that in place already themselves um
 
05:21:34.070 --> 05:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
the secondary uh question was the FDA uh
 
05:21:36.510 --> 05:21:36.520 align:start position:0%
disclaimer stuff so in the process I
 
05:21:38.190 --> 05:21:38.200 align:start position:0%
asked for a little bit more detail on
 
05:21:39.750 --> 05:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
that and said there is a simplified
 
05:21:42.430 --> 05:21:42.440 align:start position:0%
version that the medical professionals
 
05:21:44.590 --> 05:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
have just as you'd find on the bottle
 
05:21:46.470 --> 05:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
which is a label so the information that
 
05:21:49.150 --> 05:21:49.160 align:start position:0%
we were given by uh Mr or representative
 
05:21:52.110 --> 05:21:52.120 align:start position:0%
cordelli was the full spec sheet from
 
05:21:54.030 --> 05:21:54.040 align:start position:0%
the FDA it was not the simplified
 
05:21:55.670 --> 05:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
version that the medical professionals
 
05:21:58.788 --> 05:21:58.798 align:start position:0%
have or that the the what you call it
 
05:22:01.110 --> 05:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
the um people that prescribed
 
05:22:02.910 --> 05:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
medications would have anyways there's a
 
05:22:05.110 --> 05:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
simplified version of that so just to go
 
05:22:07.510 --> 05:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
with those question thank you
 
05:22:09.230 --> 05:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
representative mlan
 
05:22:11.628 --> 05:22:11.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um first of all I I
 
05:22:13.788 --> 05:22:13.798 align:start position:0%
want to thank representative Kel ring I
 
05:22:16.110 --> 05:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
think I think he did excellent work
 
05:22:19.150 --> 05:22:19.160 align:start position:0%
really in addressing some of my concerns
 
05:22:21.030 --> 05:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
and and the followup that he did you
 
05:22:23.510 --> 05:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
know in terms of understanding the scope
 
05:22:26.430 --> 05:22:26.440 align:start position:0%
and to include Medicaid or or not to
 
05:22:28.548 --> 05:22:28.558 align:start position:0%
include Medicaid he has certainly
 
05:22:31.350 --> 05:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
answered that to to my satisfaction and
 
05:22:33.270 --> 05:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
you know I certainly agree as well with
 
05:22:36.310 --> 05:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
representative Harnet that probably
 
05:22:38.910 --> 05:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
these discussions are happening um I
 
05:22:41.470 --> 05:22:41.480 align:start position:0%
know that we have many doctors um on
 
05:22:43.628 --> 05:22:43.638 align:start position:0%
this committee who are excellent doctors
 
05:22:45.470 --> 05:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
I talk a lot with representative Palmer
 
05:22:48.470 --> 05:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
who is not here but you know to get back
 
05:22:49.948 --> 05:22:49.958 align:start position:0%
to something that you were talking about
 
05:22:51.948 --> 05:22:51.958 align:start position:0%
this morning uh representative Woods
 
05:22:54.030 --> 05:22:54.040 align:start position:0%
where we we're getting more and more
 
05:22:57.510 --> 05:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
into the the corporatization of medicine
 
05:23:00.910 --> 05:23:00.920 align:start position:0%
and I I see this myself quite a bit the
 
05:23:03.270 --> 05:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
discussions that I'm having with my
 
05:23:05.750 --> 05:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
physician and across the whole spectrum
 
05:23:08.750 --> 05:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
of the healthc Care Now versus 20 years
 
05:23:12.628 --> 05:23:12.638 align:start position:0%
ago what I find quite often is they're
 
05:23:14.868 --> 05:23:14.878 align:start position:0%
looking for the signature and informed
 
05:23:16.750 --> 05:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
consent and I understand this you know
 
05:23:18.150 --> 05:23:18.160 align:start position:0%
you You' got to get people through you
 
05:23:20.390 --> 05:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
got to get people through and it seems
 
05:23:23.590 --> 05:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
to me oftentimes the the the end goal is
 
05:23:25.510 --> 05:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
is getting that signature and I don't
 
05:23:27.270 --> 05:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
think it's a bad thing it's you just
 
05:23:29.030 --> 05:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
kind of get into a rhythm and that's
 
05:23:31.030 --> 05:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
where you're going and so I'm not
 
05:23:33.110 --> 05:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
speaking as to you know the morality of
 
05:23:35.750 --> 05:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
people that's just what it is so I think
 
05:23:38.510 --> 05:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
anything that we can do that modestly
 
05:23:41.430 --> 05:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
and since this is already being done but
 
05:23:44.670 --> 05:23:44.680 align:start position:0%
modestly proceduralized us putting on
 
05:23:48.070 --> 05:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
the brakes um is not a bad thing and
 
05:23:50.150 --> 05:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
this is modest because representative as
 
05:23:52.750 --> 05:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
you pointed out it's already being done
 
05:23:54.868 --> 05:23:54.878 align:start position:0%
so let's just kind of codify where we
 
05:23:57.510 --> 05:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
are so that as this corporatization goes
 
05:23:59.110 --> 05:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
along we've at least got the brakes
 
05:24:01.070 --> 05:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
established I don't think this does any
 
05:24:02.910 --> 05:24:02.920 align:start position:0%
harm and in the future I think will help
 
05:24:05.350 --> 05:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
so I'll be supporting the
 
05:24:07.628 --> 05:24:07.638 align:start position:0%
bill uh representative woods and then
 
05:24:09.310 --> 05:24:09.320 align:start position:0%
representative MC
 
05:24:12.708 --> 05:24:12.718 align:start position:0%
um thank you U I just need clarification
 
05:24:16.548 --> 05:24:16.558 align:start position:0%
and those that deal with court with kids
 
05:24:20.150 --> 05:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
um what happens in a situation in my
 
05:24:23.230 --> 05:24:23.240 align:start position:0%
limited exposure as a hand surgeon saw
 
05:24:24.990 --> 05:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
this on a few occasions where there was
 
05:24:27.070 --> 05:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
a discrepancy between the position of
 
05:24:29.270 --> 05:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
the husband and the wife in a
 
05:24:29.280 --> 05:24:30.628 align:start position:0%
the husband and the wife in a
contentious

05:24:30.628 --> 05:24:30.638 align:start position:0%
contentious
 
05:24:34.548 --> 05:24:34.558 align:start position:0%
situation um and wouldn't uh acques to a
 
05:24:36.230 --> 05:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
particular treatment until other things
 
05:24:39.230 --> 05:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
have been settled where do we stand in
 
05:24:39.240 --> 05:24:39.990 align:start position:0%
have been settled where do we stand in
this

05:24:39.990 --> 05:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:24:43.830 --> 05:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
situation with you know um when there's
 
05:24:46.990 --> 05:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
some kind of litigation between uh the
 
05:24:50.708 --> 05:24:50.718 align:start position:0%
parents is that going to be left out in
 
05:24:53.150 --> 05:24:53.160 align:start position:0%
this in this
 
05:24:57.948 --> 05:24:57.958 align:start position:0%
bill Mr chairman yeah can I to address
 
05:25:00.470 --> 05:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
that he he deals with family law yeah I
 
05:25:03.030 --> 05:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
deal with family law on a regular basis
 
05:25:05.590 --> 05:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
okay and if you're in a situ first
 
05:25:07.990 --> 05:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
usually you will have either temporary
 
05:25:11.990 --> 05:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
Ord is in place via a parenting plan uh
 
05:25:13.910 --> 05:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
that will describe the rights and duties
 
05:25:17.230 --> 05:25:17.240 align:start position:0%
of the parents and uh in those parenting
 
05:25:19.910 --> 05:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
plans you can find online incidentally
 
05:25:22.628 --> 05:25:22.638 align:start position:0%
they're they deal with medical treatment
 
05:25:24.590 --> 05:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
they deal with decision making and a
 
05:25:27.230 --> 05:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
bunch of other things in the event that
 
05:25:29.510 --> 05:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
the parties were married or unmarried
 
05:25:31.670 --> 05:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
either way if there was an emergency
 
05:25:33.390 --> 05:25:33.400 align:start position:0%
action somebody can bring an action and
 
05:25:36.350 --> 05:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
have it heard in front of a court uh so
 
05:25:38.708 --> 05:25:38.718 align:start position:0%
if there is the standard there being
 
05:25:41.708 --> 05:25:41.718 align:start position:0%
immediate irreparable harm to a child so
 
05:25:43.868 --> 05:25:43.878 align:start position:0%
in other words if you had a a serious
 
05:25:45.670 --> 05:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
problem that involved immediate
 
05:25:48.310 --> 05:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
irreparable harm a parent can go to the
 
05:25:51.750 --> 05:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
court and get exp parte orders so and
 
05:25:53.590 --> 05:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
more likely than not if it just meets
 
05:25:56.350 --> 05:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
even a minimal standard they be
 
05:25:59.230 --> 05:25:59.240 align:start position:0%
granted would it would require some
 
05:26:01.270 --> 05:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
additional intervention right it would
 
05:26:03.670 --> 05:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
but uh you know but if you're asking if
 
05:26:06.430 --> 05:26:06.440 align:start position:0%
there's conflict okay you're going to
 
05:26:08.948 --> 05:26:08.958 align:start position:0%
probably either have a court courts are
 
05:26:10.910 --> 05:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
Guided by the best interest of the child
 
05:26:13.150 --> 05:26:13.160 align:start position:0%
standard which trumps virtually
 
05:26:15.868 --> 05:26:15.878 align:start position:0%
everything so I does that answer your
 
05:26:15.878 --> 05:26:17.350 align:start position:0%
everything so I does that answer your
question

05:26:17.350 --> 05:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:26:20.150 --> 05:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
sir sure represent McGrath that D your
 
05:26:20.160 --> 05:26:21.750 align:start position:0%
sir sure represent McGrath that D your
hand

05:26:21.750 --> 05:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
hand
 
05:26:24.590 --> 05:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
up so I definitely agree with rep
 
05:26:27.670 --> 05:26:27.680 align:start position:0%
partnet that the doctors and prescribers
 
05:26:27.680 --> 05:26:29.628 align:start position:0%
partnet that the doctors and prescribers
are

05:26:29.628 --> 05:26:29.638 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:26:33.390 --> 05:26:33.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely reading or giving informed
 
05:26:35.110 --> 05:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
consent to the patients but I'll tell
 
05:26:37.590 --> 05:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
you by the time they get to the pharmacy
 
05:26:39.510 --> 05:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
they have noide idea what they heard so
 
05:26:43.190 --> 05:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
having a piece of paper to go over and
 
05:26:45.430 --> 05:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
which we also give out at the pharmacy
 
05:26:51.750 --> 05:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
is good um and also you're right about
 
05:26:54.470 --> 05:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
Medicaid becoming the standard of care I
 
05:26:57.708 --> 05:26:57.718 align:start position:0%
know in the pharmacy if Medicaid
 
05:26:57.718 --> 05:26:59.350 align:start position:0%
know in the pharmacy if Medicaid
requires

05:26:59.350 --> 05:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
requires
 
05:27:01.830 --> 05:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
something that's the way it is for every
 
05:27:04.868 --> 05:27:04.878 align:start position:0%
single patient we
 
05:27:08.868 --> 05:27:08.878 align:start position:0%
have representative lontine
 
05:27:11.270 --> 05:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I'm going to oppose this bill
 
05:27:15.470 --> 05:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
for one it is singling out Medicaid um I
 
05:27:17.350 --> 05:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
wish that Medicaid was the standard of
 
05:27:21.030 --> 05:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
care um or should I say Medicaid
 
05:27:22.708 --> 05:27:22.718 align:start position:0%
reimbursements certainly aren't the
 
05:27:25.670 --> 05:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
standard of care right like why are we
 
05:27:27.910 --> 05:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
upholding this when their Medicaid
 
05:27:29.430 --> 05:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
payments to Providers
 
05:27:33.510 --> 05:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
are uh really not enough so here we're
 
05:27:36.590 --> 05:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
adding additional bureaucracy and
 
05:27:39.430 --> 05:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
paperwork for do
 
05:27:41.990 --> 05:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
taking care of Medicaid patients it
 
05:27:43.910 --> 05:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
seems like government
 
05:27:46.830 --> 05:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
overreach and my I I was also thinking
 
05:27:49.830 --> 05:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
earlier that every time I go pick up a
 
05:27:52.510 --> 05:27:52.520 align:start position:0%
prescription the pharmacist always asks
 
05:27:54.590 --> 05:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
me do I have any questions about it
 
05:27:56.390 --> 05:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
we're already there's already a double
 
05:28:00.510 --> 05:28:00.520 align:start position:0%
check on information provided so I feel
 
05:28:04.830 --> 05:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:07.670 --> 05:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
overreach uh representative Weber and
 
05:28:09.270 --> 05:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
then represent presor
 
05:28:14.110 --> 05:28:14.120 align:start position:0%
McGrath having had a chance to read the
 
05:28:16.628 --> 05:28:16.638 align:start position:0%
statute I'm still left with a bunch of
 
05:28:20.910 --> 05:28:20.920 align:start position:0%
questions but um in recognition of the
 
05:28:24.070 --> 05:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
effort um I'm going to vote for the
 
05:28:26.670 --> 05:28:26.680 align:start position:0%
amendment before I vote against the bill
 
05:28:28.230 --> 05:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
for all the reasons that have already
 
05:28:31.150 --> 05:28:31.160 align:start position:0%
been said uh the other thing to remember
 
05:28:33.230 --> 05:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
is that this
 
05:28:35.948 --> 05:28:35.958 align:start position:0%
is it's not even all of the Medicaid
 
05:28:39.110 --> 05:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
kids it's Medicaid to school
 
05:28:42.590 --> 05:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
programs and it sounds to me or it
 
05:28:45.150 --> 05:28:45.160 align:start position:0%
sounded to me during the testimony and I
 
05:28:47.548 --> 05:28:47.558 align:start position:0%
don't want to ascribe motive to people
 
05:28:53.190 --> 05:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
because I am sure that it could be wrong
 
05:28:56.310 --> 05:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
um I know that people are concerned
 
05:28:58.310 --> 05:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
because I read it all the time that
 
05:29:00.110 --> 05:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
their parents are somehow being treated
 
05:29:02.310 --> 05:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
at the schools without the parents not
 
05:29:04.990 --> 05:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
under not being notified and that is
 
05:29:08.310 --> 05:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
completely unacceptable but what we
 
05:29:12.390 --> 05:29:12.400 align:start position:0%
heard with respect to these procedures
 
05:29:16.510 --> 05:29:16.520 align:start position:0%
is the school set at with the parents
 
05:29:21.628 --> 05:29:21.638 align:start position:0%
involved at the five 504 the IEP and it
 
05:29:24.470 --> 05:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
is the health care provider with the
 
05:29:27.868 --> 05:29:27.878 align:start position:0%
parents already giving informed consent
 
05:29:30.670 --> 05:29:30.680 align:start position:0%
so I don't think it's necessary and I
 
05:29:34.430 --> 05:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
don't think that having extra Hoops for
 
05:29:37.548 --> 05:29:37.558 align:start position:0%
one class of people is a good idea so I
 
05:29:39.788 --> 05:29:39.798 align:start position:0%
will vote for the amendment but against
 
05:29:43.750 --> 05:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
the um against the final product
 
05:29:43.760 --> 05:29:45.868 align:start position:0%
the um against the final product
representative

05:29:45.868 --> 05:29:45.878 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:29:49.990 --> 05:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
MRA I just wanted to respond to uh rep
 
05:29:53.150 --> 05:29:53.160 align:start position:0%
lontine if your Pharmacy is asking if
 
05:29:55.548 --> 05:29:55.558 align:start position:0%
you have any questions I'll
 
05:29:59.510 --> 05:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
guarantee 100% of the people will say
 
05:30:02.590 --> 05:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
no ideally they should be coming to you
 
05:30:04.708 --> 05:30:04.718 align:start position:0%
and asking open-ended questions to make
 
05:30:07.230 --> 05:30:07.240 align:start position:0%
sure you understand what you're getting
 
05:30:09.470 --> 05:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
and that sort of thing but just to say
 
05:30:12.430 --> 05:30:12.440 align:start position:0%
do you have any questions is is not what
 
05:30:14.788 --> 05:30:14.798 align:start position:0%
they should be
 
05:30:17.948 --> 05:30:17.958 align:start position:0%
doing representative Weber and I had one
 
05:30:21.190 --> 05:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
more thing which was that if what is
 
05:30:25.670 --> 05:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
presented to the parent is the 17-page
 
05:30:27.868 --> 05:30:27.878 align:start position:0%
document that we were given which was
 
05:30:31.708 --> 05:30:31.718 align:start position:0%
not written in any kind of readable
 
05:30:34.628 --> 05:30:34.638 align:start position:0%
language um I would be very distressed
 
05:30:38.708 --> 05:30:38.718 align:start position:0%
because it isn't very helpful um and
 
05:30:41.750 --> 05:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not in the 100% of people who don't
 
05:30:43.750 --> 05:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
ask their pharmacist questions because
 
05:30:45.788 --> 05:30:45.798 align:start position:0%
mine's wonderful and I ask questions all
 
05:30:49.110 --> 05:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
the time representative kessle ring
 
05:30:50.708 --> 05:30:50.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I I want to give you
 
05:30:52.510 --> 05:30:52.520 align:start position:0%
a frame of reference why I felt so
 
05:30:54.190 --> 05:30:54.200 align:start position:0%
strongly about this because it's it's
 
05:30:56.788 --> 05:30:56.798 align:start position:0%
kind of important to say I had been
 
05:30:59.470 --> 05:30:59.480 align:start position:0%
given a medication and I asked my
 
05:31:00.750 --> 05:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
physicians's assistant who had
 
05:31:03.990 --> 05:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
prescribed it there that day and ask
 
05:31:05.628 --> 05:31:05.638 align:start position:0%
questions she couldn't provide me the
 
05:31:06.670 --> 05:31:06.680 align:start position:0%
questions I needed she said the
 
05:31:08.590 --> 05:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
pharmacist will be able to help you
 
05:31:10.868 --> 05:31:10.878 align:start position:0%
I went to the pharmacy because she was
 
05:31:12.230 --> 05:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
the end of the day trying to get me out
 
05:31:13.910 --> 05:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
it seemed like I went to the pharmacy
 
05:31:16.390 --> 05:31:16.400 align:start position:0%
and the pharmacist couldn't have could
 
05:31:18.110 --> 05:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
give me the questions I needed so I took
 
05:31:20.030 --> 05:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
the medication didn't have any questions
 
05:31:21.430 --> 05:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
and then I tore my killes tendon two
 
05:31:23.150 --> 05:31:23.160 align:start position:0%
weeks later and they said that was a
 
05:31:25.350 --> 05:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
side effect so for me it was very
 
05:31:28.310 --> 05:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
personal in this fact that we need to
 
05:31:31.030 --> 05:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
hear like what those side effects are so
 
05:31:32.868 --> 05:31:32.878 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to state
 
05:31:35.030 --> 05:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
that anyone
 
05:31:39.990 --> 05:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:41.868 --> 05:31:41.878 align:start position:0%
uh thank you I I think there's been a
 
05:31:45.030 --> 05:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
lot of really good points made um
 
05:31:47.070 --> 05:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
already for why this is problematic I
 
05:31:49.110 --> 05:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
will add that as someone who spent a lot
 
05:31:51.350 --> 05:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
of time trying to figure out how do you
 
05:31:53.868 --> 05:31:53.878 align:start position:0%
help people understand meaning patience
 
05:31:55.990 --> 05:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
or people in communities understand
 
05:31:58.150 --> 05:31:58.160 align:start position:0%
information I agree with representative
 
05:32:00.470 --> 05:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
Weber the handout is completely
 
05:32:04.510 --> 05:32:04.520 align:start position:0%
useless um and most Americans that's
 
05:32:06.670 --> 05:32:06.680 align:start position:0%
everyone overall need things written
 
05:32:09.190 --> 05:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
between 6th and e8th grade reading level
 
05:32:12.868 --> 05:32:12.878 align:start position:0%
so if we were to approve a an
 
05:32:14.590 --> 05:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
understandable handout it would be
 
05:32:17.110 --> 05:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
helpful to see that before we just say
 
05:32:19.670 --> 05:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
yes we're going to do the FDA form and
 
05:32:21.310 --> 05:32:21.320 align:start position:0%
then if we really just wanted to make
 
05:32:23.708 --> 05:32:23.718 align:start position:0%
sure there was information we could say
 
05:32:25.708 --> 05:32:25.718 align:start position:0%
that when one of these medications is
 
05:32:27.830 --> 05:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
dispensed at the pharmacy that they
 
05:32:30.430 --> 05:32:30.440 align:start position:0%
can't opt out because right now I think
 
05:32:32.270 --> 05:32:32.280 align:start position:0%
what we do is what was mentioned
 
05:32:35.070 --> 05:32:35.080 align:start position:0%
everyone signs I decline to speak to the
 
05:32:37.230 --> 05:32:37.240 align:start position:0%
pharmacist because we're all in a hurry
 
05:32:39.350 --> 05:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
and we sign and we go on our way and we
 
05:32:41.030 --> 05:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
don't take advantage of the opportunity
 
05:32:43.390 --> 05:32:43.400 align:start position:0%
provided by the law previously created I
 
05:32:45.868 --> 05:32:45.878 align:start position:0%
don't know I don't remember when that
 
05:32:47.910 --> 05:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
pharmacists must offer counseling
 
05:32:50.270 --> 05:32:50.280 align:start position:0%
because that wasn't always that way so
 
05:32:53.270 --> 05:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
there's other ways to um achieve the
 
05:32:58.708 --> 05:32:58.718 align:start position:0%
objective uh and um you know both having
 
05:33:01.390 --> 05:33:01.400 align:start position:0%
um known a lot of providers and also
 
05:33:04.070 --> 05:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
having you know mother of a child who
 
05:33:06.270 --> 05:33:06.280 align:start position:0%
needs medicine I I'm very familiar with
 
05:33:09.190 --> 05:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
the amount of rigor that goes into the
 
05:33:12.548 --> 05:33:12.558 align:start position:0%
prescribing the counseling the ongoing
 
05:33:15.230 --> 05:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
monitoring um the you know making sure
 
05:33:17.190 --> 05:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
everything's okay and so I don't think
 
05:33:19.310 --> 05:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
that a punitive there needs to be
 
05:33:21.788 --> 05:33:21.798 align:start position:0%
signatures and people are at risk I
 
05:33:23.190 --> 05:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
don't think that's constructive for
 
05:33:26.670 --> 05:33:26.680 align:start position:0%
anybody and it just creates a lot of um
 
05:33:28.788 --> 05:33:28.798 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy and potential challenges
 
05:33:30.150 --> 05:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
that really aren't going to improve
 
05:33:32.510 --> 05:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
things overall okay were you ready to
 
05:33:35.070 --> 05:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
vote no add one thing real quick if I
 
05:33:37.868 --> 05:33:37.878 align:start position:0%
can Mr chair so just I I guess the
 
05:33:39.590 --> 05:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
question would be to ask the pharmacist
 
05:33:41.230 --> 05:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
um what the simplified version is that
 
05:33:42.788 --> 05:33:42.798 align:start position:0%
they have because they have the
 
05:33:45.708 --> 05:33:45.718 align:start position:0%
simplified version that I was told is
 
05:33:48.230 --> 05:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
the the label version of it so it would
 
05:33:49.390 --> 05:33:49.400 align:start position:0%
be a lot
 
05:33:52.030 --> 05:33:52.040 align:start position:0%
smaller yeah we were we were provided
 
05:33:54.470 --> 05:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
with that so yes there was the big one
 
05:33:57.030 --> 05:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
but there were also some the yeah the
 
05:33:59.390 --> 05:33:59.400 align:start position:0%
other ones as well so we that was in
 
05:34:01.510 --> 05:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
there representative ml yeah so when
 
05:34:05.548 --> 05:34:05.558 align:start position:0%
when during the the testimony um that
 
05:34:08.270 --> 05:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
they he they had the 17-page FDA a hand
 
05:34:10.868 --> 05:34:10.878 align:start position:0%
but it's at the very back that part is
 
05:34:13.230 --> 05:34:13.240 align:start position:0%
the medication guide so that so it's not
 
05:34:14.788 --> 05:34:14.798 align:start position:0%
the whole thing it's just that little
 
05:34:17.708 --> 05:34:17.718 align:start position:0%
chunk at the back yes represent of Tes
 
05:34:20.150 --> 05:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
yeah as someone who has done a fair
 
05:34:24.390 --> 05:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
amount of um content knowledge about
 
05:34:28.350 --> 05:34:28.360 align:start position:0%
health literacy as a concept most 40% of
 
05:34:31.430 --> 05:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
Americans overall are are low health
 
05:34:33.310 --> 05:34:33.320 align:start position:0%
literacy that means they cannot
 
05:34:36.310 --> 05:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
understand basic instructions so um I
 
05:34:38.270 --> 05:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
think it's really regrettable that what
 
05:34:40.110 --> 05:34:40.120 align:start position:0%
happened did you read your package
 
05:34:41.310 --> 05:34:41.320 align:start position:0%
insert because there's one in the
 
05:34:43.510 --> 05:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
medicine there's the handout that comes
 
05:34:45.110 --> 05:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
with the receipt that the farm like they
 
05:34:46.990 --> 05:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
give you now three or four pages
 
05:34:48.910 --> 05:34:48.920 align:start position:0%
whenever you pick up any medicine and so
 
05:34:50.868 --> 05:34:50.878 align:start position:0%
I think that this is not the way to
 
05:34:54.430 --> 05:34:54.440 align:start position:0%
solve the problem I agree that there the
 
05:34:57.590 --> 05:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
the system doesn't work ideally all the
 
05:34:59.708 --> 05:34:59.718 align:start position:0%
time and I think there's ways to make
 
05:35:01.350 --> 05:35:01.360 align:start position:0%
improvements I just don't think that
 
05:35:03.910 --> 05:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
this particular Improvement will achieve
 
05:35:07.030 --> 05:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
what is um being purported as what is
 
05:35:08.628 --> 05:35:08.638 align:start position:0%
the desire
 
05:35:12.390 --> 05:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
um outcome and so um you know there's
 
05:35:14.030 --> 05:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
there's ways to make information more
 
05:35:17.190 --> 05:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
understandable there's ways to um oh
 
05:35:19.310 --> 05:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
again back to the I'm sorry lost my
 
05:35:21.430 --> 05:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
train of thought but I I I like the idea
 
05:35:23.510 --> 05:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
of making it mandatory that the
 
05:35:25.070 --> 05:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
counseling be received at the
 
05:35:26.830 --> 05:35:26.840 align:start position:0%
pharmacists in addition to the handout
 
05:35:29.070 --> 05:35:29.080 align:start position:0%
that's getting slipped into the
 
05:35:32.230 --> 05:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
bag represent cast and just to answer
 
05:35:33.868 --> 05:35:33.878 align:start position:0%
your question I did read it but there
 
05:35:36.470 --> 05:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
was only four side effects out of the 47
 
05:35:38.310 --> 05:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
or 50 that were actually listed so it's
 
05:35:40.110 --> 05:35:40.120 align:start position:0%
just one of the further one down just
 
05:35:41.590 --> 05:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
just for the
 
05:35:44.910 --> 05:35:44.920 align:start position:0%
record all right are we all set I think
 
05:35:47.390 --> 05:35:47.400 align:start position:0%

okay um okay repr cast you will write

the majority report on that and I assume
 
05:38:08.270 --> 05:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
there'll be a Minority Report by someone
 
05:38:11.708 --> 05:38:11.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:15.310 --> 05:38:15.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:18.548 --> 05:38:18.558 align:start position:0%
haret what's that motion going to be
 
05:38:21.070 --> 05:38:21.080 align:start position:0%
pass otpa
 
05:38:26.470 --> 05:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
yeah no the the minority minority it
 
05:38:29.030 --> 05:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
itl I guess there's no itla I don't know
 
05:38:30.990 --> 05:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
what I'm thinking okay Lisa so again
 
05:38:32.990 --> 05:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
thank you everyone it's been a long day
 
05:38:35.350 --> 05:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
but thank you all uh that's all we had
 
05:38:37.628 --> 05:38:37.638 align:start position:0%
