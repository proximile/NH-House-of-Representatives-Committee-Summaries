thank you Mr chair my name is

Newcastle

Newcastle
 
00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 align:start position:0%
um we have been in this place before
 
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
with this bill as the chair knows and
 
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 align:start position:0%
those of us who've served over the last
 
00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
couple of terms
 
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 align:start position:0%
um and I I believe we're in a in a good
 
00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 align:start position:0%
place now uh one of the things that our
 
00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 align:start position:0%
assistant uh Brad Greenland did was he
 
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh uh researched some of the history of
 
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
the bill to provide to some of the new
 
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.630 align:start position:0%
the bill to provide to some of the new
members

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that you'll see is
 
00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 align:start position:0%
in the last session of the legislature
 
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
we sent this bill to interim study and
 
00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 align:start position:0%
the outcome of the interim study session
 
00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 align:start position:0%
was that we did recommend it for
 
00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 align:start position:0%
legislation which is why this the
 
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 align:start position:0%
primary reason why this bill is back
 
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.070 align:start position:0%
primary reason why this bill is back
uh

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 align:start position:0%
but the overwhelming and I think the
 
00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 align:start position:0%
driving reason why this bill is back is
 
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
to really uh do what we can as a
 
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
criminal justice and Public Safety
 
00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 align:start position:0%
Committee to when we
 
00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
when we when we are aware of incidents
 
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh in of uh where Justice uh hasn't been
 
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
carried forth uh effectively and and
 
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
also when where there have been
 
00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:27.659 align:start position:0%
injustices a lot of times we're not
 
00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 align:start position:0%
necessarily in a position to correct
 
00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:30.830 align:start position:0%
necessarily in a position to correct
that

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 align:start position:0%
um uh this time though we are
 
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
um uh this bill specifically would Grant
 
00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 align:start position:0%
a posthumous uh exoneration and
 
00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 align:start position:0%
annulment in a couple of cases where
 
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 align:start position:0%
over time
 
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 align:start position:0%
um the Injustice of those convictions uh
 
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 align:start position:0%
has become more and more apparent
 
00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
so one of these folks uh Eunice goodicol
 
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
of Hampton New Hampshire
 
00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
was the only person in New Hampshire
 
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
ever convicted of witchcraft
 
00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
uh in uh she one of the things that you
 
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
you can see if you actually Google
 
00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 align:start position:0%
information on goody call was she led a
 
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
pretty tortured existence
 
00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 align:start position:0%
um she probably wasn't a very nice
 
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
person her neighbors did not like her
 
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately at the time dislike
 
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 align:start position:0%
for a person could easily turn into
 
00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 align:start position:0%
accusations of Witchcraft and there was
 
00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 align:start position:0%
a hysteria that went on at the time and
 
00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 align:start position:0%
at the time the law supported
 
00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 align:start position:0%
convictions like that
 
00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 align:start position:0%
spent a pretty good chunk of her of the
 
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 align:start position:0%
last 25 years of her life in prison
 
00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
much of that time at the expense of the
 
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
people of Hampton New Hampshire
 
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 align:start position:0%
those people in Hampton New Hampshire or
 
00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 align:start position:0%
their their descendants in 1938 actually
 
00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 align:start position:0%
formed a group called The the goody coal
 
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:52.790 align:start position:0%
formed a group called The the goody coal
Society

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
Society
 
00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
and essentially what they did was they
 
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 align:start position:0%
uh they basically forgave her crimes
 
00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 align:start position:0%
Unfortunately they don't didn't have the
 
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
power to forgive and all the crimes that
 
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 align:start position:0%
she was accused of we do have that we
 
00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
are a state where witchcraft is no
 
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
longer a crime
 
00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 align:start position:0%
um the other case is the case of Willard
 
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
upposts and I I have uh other folks here
 
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 align:start position:0%
who are going to give a testimony about
 
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
this uh but he was the head of the world
 
00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 align:start position:0%
Fellowship Center
 
00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:32.699 align:start position:0%
um and uh essentially to make a long
 
00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 align:start position:0%
story short
 
00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
um uh an overzealous New Hampshire
 
00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:40.259 align:start position:0%
prosecutor during the Red Scare of the
 
00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:44.590 align:start position:0%
prosecutor during the Red Scare of the
1950s

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
held Mr up house in contempt brought him
 
00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 align:start position:0%
up on contempt charges for not revealing
 
00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:56.660 align:start position:0%
a list of of members and attendees
 
00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 align:start position:0%
to programs at the world Fellowship
 
00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.670 align:start position:0%
to programs at the world Fellowship
Center

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
Center
 
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
which is primarily an organization
 
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 align:start position:0%
that's about uh nature and spirituality
 
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 align:start position:0%
and we have the former head of it here
 
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
today to testify to testify on that as
 
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.210 align:start position:0%
today to testify to testify on that as
well

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
um the the the upshot of this of a lot
 
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 align:start position:0%
of this is is there are
 
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 align:start position:0%
periods when there are Injustice uh in
 
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
our past and in our current law really
 
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow a good mechanism for us to
 
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 align:start position:0%
address this so one of the things that's
 
00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:32.759 align:start position:0%
been brought up in the past is well gee
 
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:35.340 align:start position:0%
why can't the governor just pardon these
 
00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:36.230 align:start position:0%
why can't the governor just pardon these
people

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:38.819 align:start position:0%
and the reason the governor can't just
 
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
pardon these people is that the way that
 
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
our law works now uh is that the
 
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
governor can only pardon people who are
 
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
alive which is why we're talking about
 
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
um annulments and exonerations
 
00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:52.490 align:start position:0%
um annulments and exonerations
um

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.110 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:54.670 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:59.029 --> 00:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
to essentially sum up one of the things
 
00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:00.539 align:start position:0%
that we have within our power to do
 
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
today is to correct an injustice that
 
00:07:07.309 --> 00:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
was done a great Injustice that was
 
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
actually done to uh to two people who
 
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:13.620 align:start position:0%
you know who who didn't deserve it who
 
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
may have had issues in other areas
 
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
but this is not the way our justice
 
00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:23.180 align:start position:0%
system our just the systems should work
 
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:27.300 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that are our
 
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
justice system uh should do when we
 
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
don't have the power to actually go back
 
00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:35.300 align:start position:0%
and fix things is to make an admission
 
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
that sometimes we make the wrong
 
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
decision and uh and to do what we can to
 
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
to correct the record so that's really
 
00:07:47.809 --> 00:07:47.819 align:start position:0%
why uh why we're here today
 
00:07:47.819 --> 00:07:48.350 align:start position:0%
why uh why we're here today
um

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
one of the other things that I would I
 
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:52.860 align:start position:0%
would like to do uh with the chairs
 
00:07:57.589 --> 00:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
Indulgence is to read a testimony that
 
00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
was sent to us uh by Arne Albert who was
 
00:08:05.089 --> 00:08:05.099 align:start position:0%
not able uh to make it Arne testified at
 
00:08:08.089 --> 00:08:08.099 align:start position:0%
hearings both times on the previous
 
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:11.340 align:start position:0%
bills he is out of town and unable to
 
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:13.380 align:start position:0%
join us in person today so with the
 
00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
chairs Indulgence I would read that I
 
00:08:19.089 --> 00:08:19.099 align:start position:0%
would also let the chair know that
 
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:22.860 align:start position:0%
this testimony was also sent in email to
 
00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
the committee so if you decide in the
 
00:08:26.809 --> 00:08:26.819 align:start position:0%
interest of time that that would work
 
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:32.820 align:start position:0%
um you can go ahead and read it into the
 
00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:33.529 align:start position:0%
um you can go ahead and read it into the
record

00:08:33.529 --> 00:08:33.539 align:start position:0%
record
 
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:42.300 align:start position:0%
and if anybody has any questions about
 
00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
the bill the legislation
 
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
um I I think we have folks who are maybe
 
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:49.860 align:start position:0%
better equipped to tell the story and to
 
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
really relate the history of what
 
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:52.740 align:start position:0%
actually happened during these events
 
00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:54.779 align:start position:0%
than me but I would be more than happy
 
00:08:59.570 --> 00:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.070 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh assuming this is a terrific bill in
 
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
correcting an injustice I have two
 
00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:09.300 align:start position:0%
questions first uh why can't the
 
00:09:11.329 --> 00:09:11.339 align:start position:0%
governor pardon someone who is not
 
00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
living the second question is does the
 
00:09:17.449 --> 00:09:17.459 align:start position:0%
legislature really have this Authority
 
00:09:20.449 --> 00:09:20.459 align:start position:0%
there are questions our law currently as
 
00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:22.860 align:start position:0%
I read it and I'm I'm not a lawyer but
 
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
my examination of the statute the pardon
 
00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
statute really only does apply to people
 
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:31.380 align:start position:0%
who are living and these these two folks
 
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:33.720 align:start position:0%
obviously aren't living anymore as to
 
00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:37.019 align:start position:0%
whether or not we have the ability to uh
 
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
to exonerate and in all convictions we
 
00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
do and uh in the last session of the
 
00:09:44.449 --> 00:09:44.459 align:start position:0%
legislature we actually uh we actually
 
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:49.140 align:start position:0%
did that in hb2 when we annulled the uh
 
00:09:52.009 --> 00:09:52.019 align:start position:0%
and all the convictions of the folks who
 
00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
violated uh uh covid orders uh at the at
 
00:09:59.329 --> 00:09:59.339 align:start position:0%
the time so I don't think it's a it's a
 
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:01.140 align:start position:0%
power that we use a lot in the
 
00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
legislature and I think we're very
 
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
careful about how we use it
 
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:07.140 align:start position:0%
um but uh it is something that there is
 
00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
precedent for
 
00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
you're welcome uh just for the in case
 
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
anyone else is going to ask I am going
 
00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:15.300 align:start position:0%
to be soliciting an opinion from the
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office and possibly
 
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
um I I personally actually wrote the the
 
00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
majority report recommending this for
 
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
future legislation I still support the
 
00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:30.540 align:start position:0%
idea behind it I just want to make sure
 
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
it's constitutionally sound
 
00:10:35.449 --> 00:10:35.459 align:start position:0%
and I do know that in the past there has
 
00:10:38.329 --> 00:10:38.339 align:start position:0%
been some uh confusion over where goody
 
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
Cole in particular was convicted
 
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
she was convicted in a court in
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts at the time the state of
 
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and the state of
 
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:50.940 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts actually didn't exist what
 
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:53.160 align:start position:0%
existed back in her time in this in the
 
00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:56.540 align:start position:0%
1650s was the province of New Hampshire
 
00:10:58.690 --> 00:10:58.700 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:01.260 align:start position:0%
essentially New Hampshire was just sort
 
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:03.540 align:start position:0%
of a series of land grants stitched
 
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
together without any real type of a
 
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
judicial system so at the time we relied
 
00:11:11.389 --> 00:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
on courts uh down in down in
 
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts she actually served most
 
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
of her jail time down in Boston but she
 
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
was a citizen of Hampton New Hampshire
 
00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:21.660 align:start position:0%
which is part of New Hampshire now
 
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
so there are some gray areas you know
 
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
admittedly but
 
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
there are always gray areas in the law
 
00:11:32.569 --> 00:11:32.579 align:start position:0%
and this may be an opportunity just to
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
correct something that I think a lot of
 
00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
people over many years have been trying
 
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:47.220 align:start position:0%
says that the language needed to be
 
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:48.660 align:start position:0%
clarified from the initial version I'm
 
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:49.860 align:start position:0%
just wondering what if there are
 
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
differences in this language than
 
00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
previous versions
 
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
I I think the it's less the language
 
00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
issue and more the issue that uh that
 
00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
the chair raises so there there is an
 
00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
issue uh you know ultimately whether we
 
00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
have the authority to actually
 
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
um uh exonerate and pardon somebody who
 
00:12:14.329 --> 00:12:14.339 align:start position:0%
may not have been uh you know
 
00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
technically who who actually may have
 
00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:19.140 align:start position:0%
may have been convicted in a in a court
 
00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:21.300 align:start position:0%
in another state
 
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
um even though at the time we were
 
00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:27.660 align:start position:0%
basically in the same judicial uh
 
00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
judicial region I guess you might call
 
00:12:29.399 --> 00:12:30.290 align:start position:0%
judicial region I guess you might call
it

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:30.300 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:34.670 align:start position:0%
it
so

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:36.300 align:start position:0%
okay you can go ahead and read that now
 
00:12:38.269 --> 00:12:38.279 align:start position:0%
that you wanted to read you wanted to
 
00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
read that testimony
 
00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:41.820 align:start position:0%
would you like I can do that yeah go
 
00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:45.949 align:start position:0%
would you like I can do that yeah go
ahead

00:12:45.949 --> 00:12:45.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
so again this testimony is from uh from
 
00:12:50.329 --> 00:12:50.339 align:start position:0%
Arnie Alpert
 
00:12:52.129 --> 00:12:52.139 align:start position:0%
I regret that I'm unable to be with you
 
00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
in person today to testify in support of
 
00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
hb89 relative to posthumous exonerations
 
00:12:59.150 --> 00:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
and annulments but I'm happy to respond
 
00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:01.980 align:start position:0%
by email to any questions you may have
 
00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
in 1951 the general court adopted the
 
00:13:06.889 --> 00:13:06.899 align:start position:0%
subversive activities act which defined
 
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
and criminalized being a subversive two
 
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
years later the Attorney General Louis
 
00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
Wyman launched a wide-ranging
 
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
investigation to find out where any
 
00:13:19.129 --> 00:13:19.139 align:start position:0%
subversives might be lurking Wyman
 
00:13:21.129 --> 00:13:21.139 align:start position:0%
looked high and he looked low among
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
among the places he looked were at UNH
 
00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:26.940 align:start position:0%
and Dartmouth faculty he interviewed 130
 
00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:29.519 align:start position:0%
Witnesses under oath and even more on an
 
00:13:31.009 --> 00:13:31.019 align:start position:0%
informal basis
 
00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
among those he subpoenaed for deposition
 
00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:35.100 align:start position:0%
was Dr Willard uphaus who had recently
 
00:13:36.889 --> 00:13:36.899 align:start position:0%
been appointed executive director of the
 
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
world Fellowship Center a summer Retreat
 
00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
near Mount chakurua in Albany New
 
00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:42.350 align:start position:0%
near Mount chakurua in Albany New
Hampshire

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
Dr uphouse went to Wyman's office at the
 
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
state house and brought him information
 
00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:51.300 align:start position:0%
uh about world Fellowship when asked he
 
00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
was willing to provide the Attorney
 
00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:55.160 align:start position:0%
General with names of Staff
 
00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
records for which the state are and with
 
00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:00.180 align:start position:0%
with names of staff and and also for
 
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
records for which the state already had
 
00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.069 align:start position:0%
records for which the state already had
access

00:14:03.069 --> 00:14:03.079 align:start position:0%
access
 
00:14:05.449 --> 00:14:05.459 align:start position:0%
he was also willing to provide the names
 
00:14:07.129 --> 00:14:07.139 align:start position:0%
of people who had been speakers of the
 
00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:09.060 align:start position:0%
center and even invited Wyman to be a
 
00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:10.009 align:start position:0%
center and even invited Wyman to be a
speaker

00:14:10.009 --> 00:14:10.019 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:12.959 align:start position:0%
but Dr uppost blocked when attorney
 
00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:15.720 align:start position:0%
general Wyman demanded the center's
 
00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:17.820 align:start position:0%
guest list which he knew would subject
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
people to further investigation a
 
00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
superior court judge ruled Dr uphouse in
 
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
contempt prompting an appeal that went
 
00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:27.720 align:start position:0%
uh all the way up to the United States
 
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court when the Supreme Court
 
00:14:32.569 --> 00:14:32.579 align:start position:0%
ruled six years later after the investor
 
00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:34.620 align:start position:0%
after the investigation began on the
 
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
side of the state and Dr uphouse still
 
00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:40.620 align:start position:0%
refused to violate the privacy of world
 
00:14:44.449 --> 00:14:44.459 align:start position:0%
Fellowship guests the state sent the now
 
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
elderly doctor up house to the Merrimack
 
00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:49.620 align:start position:0%
County House of Corrections uh where he
 
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
sat for a year
 
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
during the course of the year the up
 
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
house case became a matter of
 
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
international controversy and frankly a
 
00:14:59.090 --> 00:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
source of embarrassment to the state
 
00:15:00.829 --> 00:15:00.839 align:start position:0%
two points that I want to emphasize
 
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:03.720 align:start position:0%
first after an investigation that he
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
claimed took two and one half man years
 
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
Lewis Wyman never charged anyone in New
 
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:10.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with the crime of being a
 
00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:11.990 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with the crime of being a
subversive

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
subversive
 
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
second looking back with more than 60
 
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
years of hindsight we should see the
 
00:15:18.889 --> 00:15:18.899 align:start position:0%
episode as an example of what happens
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
when political passions overcome good
 
00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.129 align:start position:0%
when political passions overcome good
judgment

00:15:22.129 --> 00:15:22.139 align:start position:0%
judgment
 
00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:25.380 align:start position:0%
we can also see Dr Willett up house as a
 
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
champion for the rights of conscience
 
00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
and the protection of privacy from State
 
00:15:29.399 --> 00:15:30.590 align:start position:0%

territory that David and Arnie covered
 
00:16:29.449 --> 00:16:29.459 align:start position:0%
um my name is Andy Davis I um until uh
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
about a year ago for 21 years was the
 
00:16:35.329 --> 00:16:35.339 align:start position:0%
co-director of the world Fellowship
 
00:16:39.949 --> 00:16:39.959 align:start position:0%
Center uh the the second uh director
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
after Willard house who we're referring
 
00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
the world Fellowship was founded in 1941
 
00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:54.060 align:start position:0%
by Charles in Eugenia Weller who at that
 
00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:57.660 align:start position:0%
point were in their 70s they were social
 
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
activists and reformers who began in
 
00:17:03.769 --> 00:17:03.779 align:start position:0%
Chicago in the um the first Gilded Age
 
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
in the 1890s but by 1953 the wellers
 
00:17:12.049 --> 00:17:12.059 align:start position:0%
were in their 80s and they were ready to
 
00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:15.839 align:start position:0%
retire from uh what was in this Essence
 
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:18.780 align:start position:0%
their retirement job so they cast about
 
00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:22.079 align:start position:0%
and they ended up hiring much younger
 
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:24.660 align:start position:0%
directors people who were about my age
 
00:17:29.169 --> 00:17:29.179 align:start position:0%
now Willard and Ola up house
 
00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
and um by the time Willard came to World
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
Fellowship he had already seen many
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
lives and careers destroyed by
 
00:17:41.039 --> 00:17:42.710 align:start position:0%
lives and careers destroyed by
McCarthyism

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
McCarthyism
 
00:17:45.409 --> 00:17:45.419 align:start position:0%
he had suffered the effects itself to
 
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
organizations that he had been a part of
 
00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
the national religion and labor
 
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
foundation and the American peace
 
00:17:55.970 --> 00:17:55.980 align:start position:0%
Crusade had been ripped apart by
 
00:17:59.529 --> 00:17:59.539 align:start position:0%
internal divisions or disbanded because
 
00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:02.580 align:start position:0%
of the climate of fear that was
 
00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:05.820 align:start position:0%
generated during that time
 
00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
so at the end of their first summer as
 
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
directors Willard Nola were closing down
 
00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:15.140 align:start position:0%
World Fellowship for the winter and
 
00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
Willard took a break to go into Conway
 
00:18:21.409 --> 00:18:21.419 align:start position:0%
and run some errands and he picked up a
 
00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
copy of the union leader and uh was uh
 
00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
uh his attention was caught by the main
 
00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
headline that said Pro red takes over
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Fellowship group and of
 
00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:39.900 align:start position:0%
course the uh Pro red that was being
 
00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:46.020 align:start position:0%
um he read further to discover the news
 
00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
that he supposedly supported the
 
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
Communist party and was harboring
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
members of subversive organizations that
 
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
was news to himself and uh in a sidebar
 
00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
on the front page the Attorney General
 
00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
Louis Wyman pledged to get down to what
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
was going on at the world Fellowship
 
00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:07.909 align:start position:0%
was going on at the world Fellowship
Center

00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:07.919 align:start position:0%
Center
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
so this began seven years of
 
00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
interrogations and Court appearances
 
00:19:15.049 --> 00:19:15.059 align:start position:0%
that went through the New Hampshire
 
00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:18.780 align:start position:0%
Superior Court in which as stated he was
 
00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:22.140 align:start position:0%
convicted of contempt for refusing to
 
00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:23.710 align:start position:0%
convicted of contempt for refusing to
expose

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:23.720 align:start position:0%
expose
 
00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:27.900 align:start position:0%
guests of his Center to the sort of
 
00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
scrutiny and ordeal that he was going
 
00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
through and uh
 
00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
the case went all the way did the U.S
 
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court I'm not sure that was
 
00:19:42.549 --> 00:19:42.559 align:start position:0%
mentioned already but on November 14
 
00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:46.799 align:start position:0%
1958 the U.S Supreme Court ruled five to
 
00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:49.860 align:start position:0%
four that the public interest outweighed
 
00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:53.780 align:start position:0%
up houses private rights given the power
 
00:19:57.409 --> 00:19:57.419 align:start position:0%
granted Wyman by the legislature the
 
00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:01.380 align:start position:0%
Attorney General could force up house to
 
00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:05.240 align:start position:0%
produce the guest list or prosecute him
 
00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:08.220 align:start position:0%
Justice William Brennan wrote the
 
00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
dissent in which he was joined by the
 
00:20:14.029 --> 00:20:14.039 align:start position:0%
Chief Justice and justices black and
 
00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
Douglas he argued that the state had not
 
00:20:20.409 --> 00:20:20.419 align:start position:0%
proved a sufficient interest to justify
 
00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
counterbalancing the interest of privacy
 
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
as it relates to freedom of speech and
 
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.850 align:start position:0%
as it relates to freedom of speech and
assembly

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
assembly
 
00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:31.620 align:start position:0%
so as Arnie mentioned the Willard up
 
00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:34.020 align:start position:0%
house case became a cause celebrity the
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
day that he was led away to jail 200
 
00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
supporters were on hand to sing America
 
00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
My Country Tis of Thee and A Mighty
 
00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
Fortress Is Our God which was Willard's
 
00:20:48.529 --> 00:20:48.539 align:start position:0%
favorite hymn and hundreds of college
 
00:20:51.529 --> 00:20:51.539 align:start position:0%
students around New England demonstrated
 
00:20:54.409 --> 00:20:54.419 align:start position:0%
for his release and
 
00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:57.660 align:start position:0%
um on his 70th birthday which he
 
00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:00.780 align:start position:0%
celebrated in the Bosque in jail he
 
00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:03.900 align:start position:0%
received 720 cards from around the
 
00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:06.549 align:start position:0%
received 720 cards from around the
country

00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:10.280 align:start position:0%
well incarcerated up House Road is
 
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:13.080 align:start position:0%

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:15.900 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.330 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:27.409 --> 00:21:27.419 align:start position:0%
it might interest you to know that um
 
00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
Willard up house was included on the
 
00:21:33.649 --> 00:21:33.659 align:start position:0%
Concord Monitor list of the hundred most
 
00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
influential people in New Hampshire
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
during the 20th century and um and in
 
00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:43.140 align:start position:0%
case you're wondering Louis Wyman didn't
 
00:21:45.409 --> 00:21:45.419 align:start position:0%
make the list
 
00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
another person on the list was Judge
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
Hugh bounds of Laconia who served on the
 
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Superior Court U.S
 
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
District Court and the U.S court of
 
00:21:58.430 --> 00:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
appeals in the first circuit earlier in
 
00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
this career he had been a defense
 
00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
attorney in Willard House's case when he
 
00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:08.220 align:start position:0%
died in December of 2003 at his memorial
 
00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
service in the federal courthouse here
 
00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
in Concord he was eulogized by his
 
00:22:16.789 --> 00:22:16.799 align:start position:0%
friend Justice David souter who taking
 
00:22:20.029 --> 00:22:20.039 align:start position:0%
stock of his long career specifically
 
00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:22.980 align:start position:0%
referenced bound to spirited defense of
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
Willard house
 
00:22:27.409 --> 00:22:27.419 align:start position:0%
Suter said that what stood out was
 
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
bounds's argument that the state had not
 
00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
a scrap of evidence to so much as
 
00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:36.559 align:start position:0%
suggest up house engaged in subversion
 
00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
bounds Suter said was facing a quote
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
facing realities that the powers that be
 
00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
did not want to face and did not want
 
00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
others to face it was as if he knew
 
00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:52.380 align:start position:0%
Sutra continued that human beings do not
 
00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:56.220 align:start position:0%
so much avoid responsibility as evade it
 
00:22:59.690 --> 00:22:59.700 align:start position:0%
and we evade what we do not want to see
 
00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
bounds he said had the courage to see
 
00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
so my hope today is that you would
 
00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
look at the Choice your legislative
 
00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:19.380 align:start position:0%
forebears made in 1941 and 1951
 
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
see how that choice affected individual
 
00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
human beings and rectify their mistake
 
00:23:28.909 --> 00:23:28.919 align:start position:0%
in the day characterized by the politics
 
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
of division this is a moment to unite
 
00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
with people of conscience across
 
00:23:38.029 --> 00:23:38.039 align:start position:0%
boundaries of space and time
 
00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
I'd like to end on a brief personal note
 
00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:43.460 align:start position:0%
Randy Cushing was a dear friend of mine
 
00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
and three weeks before he died I visited
 
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
him at his home in Hampton where at that
 
00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
point he was on a bed in front of the
 
00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
bay window looking out on the street on
 
00:23:58.130 --> 00:23:58.140 align:start position:0%
winnekuna Road
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
and that day being able to see this
 
00:24:03.049 --> 00:24:03.059 align:start position:0%
build through
 
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
so uh of course I said Renny you have
 
00:24:09.289 --> 00:24:09.299 align:start position:0%
other things to worry about right now

Troy and Fitzwilliam
 
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
I'm here this morning to introduce House
 
00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
Bill 97 which will establish an
 
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
additional penalty for a violation of
 
00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:48.950 align:start position:0%
additional penalty for a violation of
privacy

00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:52.020 align:start position:0%
this legislation is truly a bipartisan
 
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
effort of state representatives and
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
Senators to address inconsistencies in
 
00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
the law when it comes to adequately
 
00:47:59.390 --> 00:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
protecting individuals against sexual
 
00:48:02.210 --> 00:48:02.220 align:start position:0%
exploit exploitation especially when it
 
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
last year we had a bill that was in
 
00:48:08.569 --> 00:48:08.579 align:start position:0%
front of us in the criminal justice
 
00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:10.500 align:start position:0%
committee that was to establish a study
 
00:48:12.770 --> 00:48:12.780 align:start position:0%
committee and I had asked a question
 
00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:16.260 align:start position:0%
during the testimony of that and
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
basically from my own from my own
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
question I realized just how serious
 
00:48:23.569 --> 00:48:23.579 align:start position:0%
this really is and over the summer I
 
00:48:26.089 --> 00:48:26.099 align:start position:0%
reached out to the coalition to
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
to work with them to make this bill
 
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
become a reality
 
00:48:34.849 --> 00:48:34.859 align:start position:0%
hb97 is not creating a new law it is
 
00:48:36.829 --> 00:48:36.839 align:start position:0%
specifically addressing the unlawful and
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
non-consensual violation of someone's
 
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
privacy for sexual arousal or
 
00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:42.470 align:start position:0%
privacy for sexual arousal or
gratification

00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
gratification
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
the impact of these crimes can be
 
00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:45.470 align:start position:0%
the impact of these crimes can be
debilitating

00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
debilitating
 
00:48:47.329 --> 00:48:47.339 align:start position:0%
and demoralizing for the victims and
 
00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:50.220 align:start position:0%
they have long-term very real very
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
psychological and emotional consequences
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
victims may suffer from extreme
 
00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:56.510 align:start position:0%
victims may suffer from extreme
depression

00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
depression
 
00:48:59.809 --> 00:48:59.819 align:start position:0%
isolation unemployment Rising medical
 
00:49:01.609 --> 00:49:01.619 align:start position:0%
costs and homelessness just to name a
 
00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
few none of which are any fault of their
 
00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:05.750 align:start position:0%
few none of which are any fault of their
own

00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
own
 
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
what's worse is often these crimes can
 
00:49:09.530 --> 00:49:09.540 align:start position:0%
become extremely dangerous over time if
 
00:49:11.809 --> 00:49:11.819 align:start position:0%
they're not stopped even more concerning
 
00:49:13.609 --> 00:49:13.619 align:start position:0%
is these crimes also can be signs of
 
00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:16.500 align:start position:0%
lethal intent if not taken seriously
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
it is time that we amend the statute to
 
00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:19.740 align:start position:0%
ensure that we are protecting the
 
00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
victims against these against being
 
00:49:25.370 --> 00:49:25.380 align:start position:0%
abused over and over again
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
there are several individuals that are
 
00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:28.740 align:start position:0%
in the room today that are going to
 
00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
testify on behalf of this bill they have
 
00:49:32.809 --> 00:49:32.819 align:start position:0%
the very real examples
 
00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
of where this law could have helped the
 
00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:36.780 align:start position:0%
victims and they also will be able to
 
00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
explain how the implementation will work
 
00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
with the other law
 
00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:42.780 align:start position:0%
so I would respectfully ask
 
00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:43.980 align:start position:0%
that you
 
00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:45.720 align:start position:0%
ask the questions for the professionals
 
00:49:47.690 --> 00:49:47.700 align:start position:0%
that are behind me this morning
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
please consider passing this bill so we
 
00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:51.720 align:start position:0%
are better able to support the victims
 
00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:53.220 align:start position:0%
their families and all of our
 
00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:55.550 align:start position:0%
their families and all of our
communities

00:49:55.550 --> 00:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:49:59.809 --> 00:49:59.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:20.349 --> 00:50:20.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair and members of the
 
00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Pamela kylig and I
 
00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
am the public policy specialist at the
 
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Coalition against Domestic
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
and Sexual Violence as some of you know
 
00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:34.140 align:start position:0%
the Coalition is the umbrella
 
00:50:36.290 --> 00:50:36.300 align:start position:0%
Organization for our 12 community-based
 
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:38.400 align:start position:0%

00:50:40.849 --> 00:50:40.859 align:start position:0%
confidential services to nearly 15 000
 
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
survivors of sexual and domestic
 
00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
violence annually I'm here to speak in
 
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
support of hb97 legislation that will
 
00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
bring our state's violation of privacy
 
00:50:54.109 --> 00:50:54.119 align:start position:0%
statute RSA 6449 into alignment with
 
00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
other similar laws relative to sexual
 
00:50:59.089 --> 00:50:59.099 align:start position:0%
violence and exploitation as the good
 
00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative said and thank you so
 
00:51:04.549 --> 00:51:04.559 align:start position:0%
much for the opportunity to speak today
 
00:51:06.349 --> 00:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
um I think first and foremost I just
 
00:51:07.849 --> 00:51:07.859 align:start position:0%
wanted to provide a brief overview of
 
00:51:10.690 --> 00:51:10.700 align:start position:0%
the legislation and why it's important
 
00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:14.220 align:start position:0%
RSA 6449 is one of several statutes that
 
00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:15.900 align:start position:0%
seek to address crimes relating to
 
00:51:18.829 --> 00:51:18.839 align:start position:0%
sexual violence and abuse and this bill
 
00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
specifically speaks to paragraph 3A of
 
00:51:25.309 --> 00:51:25.319 align:start position:0%
the statute that involves videoing and
 
00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:28.740 align:start position:0%
just observing for the purpose of sexual
 
00:51:31.010 --> 00:51:31.020 align:start position:0%
gratification and arousal
 
00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:33.420 align:start position:0%
um and so those
 
00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:34.980 align:start position:0%
um there's two statues that I just
 
00:51:36.970 --> 00:51:36.980 align:start position:0%
wanted to briefly highlight and I have
 
00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:38.940 align:start position:0%
materials that I'll hand out to the
 
00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:43.500 align:start position:0%
committee after my testimony so RSA 6 45
 
00:51:45.950 --> 00:51:45.960 align:start position:0%
1 relative to lewdness and indecent
 
00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:49.500 align:start position:0%
exposure an RSA 652 obscene matter
 
00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
already have specific Provisions that
 
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
address cases where offenders commit the
 
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
same crime again and again so this
 
00:51:58.309 --> 00:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
statute is just looking across the board
 
00:52:00.109 --> 00:52:00.119 align:start position:0%
when we're treating these crimes and
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
looking at the specific pattern of
 
00:52:06.109 --> 00:52:06.119 align:start position:0%
behavior that comes with sexual violence
 
00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:07.740 align:start position:0%
and making sure that we're addressing
 
00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:10.140 align:start position:0%
this severity of not only when this
 
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
crime happens once but when it happens
 
00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:16.020 align:start position:0%
again and so I think just it's really
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
important to highlight that although it
 
00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
may seem like it's just about a video
 
00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:22.740 align:start position:0%
recording this can actually escalate
 
00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:25.680 align:start position:0%
into physical violence and lead to a
 
00:52:28.069 --> 00:52:28.079 align:start position:0%
significant harm on the victim as well
 
00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:31.500 align:start position:0%
as making the general family involved or
 
00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:34.020 align:start position:0%
Community not feeling safe
 
00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:34.670 align:start position:0%
Community not feeling safe
um

00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
and then I guess I just wanted to also
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
highlight that violations of privacy can
 
00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:41.700 align:start position:0%
be co-occurring with acts of stalking
 
00:52:43.549 --> 00:52:43.559 align:start position:0%
sexual assault domestic violence and
 
00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
child abuse and offenders in these cases
 
00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:48.180 align:start position:0%
are seeking to undermine a victim's
 
00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
sense of safety and control and I'm sure
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear from other folks in
 
00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:54.660 align:start position:0%
the room today just like what what we're
 
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
really talking about in terms of the
 
00:52:59.049 --> 00:52:59.059 align:start position:0%
types of behavior involved of
 
00:52:59.059 --> 00:53:00.730 align:start position:0%
types of behavior involved of
progressively

00:53:00.730 --> 00:53:00.740 align:start position:0%
progressively
 
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
escalating from you know looking into a
 
00:53:04.849 --> 00:53:04.859 align:start position:0%
window to eventually breaking into a
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
house and then potentially even
 
00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:08.940 align:start position:0%
committing sexual assault so the goal of
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
this legislation not only to bring it
 
00:53:13.309 --> 00:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
into alignment with other similar
 
00:53:16.309 --> 00:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
statutes is to really ensure that the
 
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate interventions come in place
 
00:53:20.329 --> 00:53:20.339 align:start position:0%
to not only limit the harm to the victim
 
00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:23.220 align:start position:0%
but also ensure that sex offenders and
 
00:53:25.069 --> 00:53:25.079 align:start position:0%
individuals perpetuating these crimes
 
00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
are getting the uh the the support they
 
00:53:31.069 --> 00:53:31.079 align:start position:0%
need to stop this behavior
 
00:53:31.079 --> 00:53:32.089 align:start position:0%
need to stop this behavior
um

00:53:32.089 --> 00:53:32.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
and I guess um just to kind of
 
00:53:36.770 --> 00:53:36.780 align:start position:0%
um another part of the handouts that I'm
 
00:53:38.450 --> 00:53:38.460 align:start position:0%
going to be giving you today highlight a
 
00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
few case studies that kind of illustrate
 
00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:41.930 align:start position:0%
few case studies that kind of illustrate
how

00:53:41.930 --> 00:53:41.940 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:53:43.790 --> 00:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
um this type of behavior can happen over
 
00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
and over again and we have countless
 
00:53:48.349 --> 00:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
situations in our state where
 
00:53:50.089 --> 00:53:50.099 align:start position:0%
individuals have committed acts under
 
00:53:53.690 --> 00:53:53.700 align:start position:0%
RSA 6449 and later went on um to
 
00:53:56.210 --> 00:53:56.220 align:start position:0%
committing those physically to
 
00:53:57.770 --> 00:53:57.780 align:start position:0%
physically assault their victim so I
 
00:53:59.150 --> 00:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
just wanted to highlight that this is
 
00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
something we're seeing and something
 
00:54:03.890 --> 00:54:03.900 align:start position:0%
that we really want to address so I
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
would just like to conclude by just
 
00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
asking you all to consider supporting
 
00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:10.260 align:start position:0%
hb97 and I'd be more than happy to
 
00:54:13.609 --> 00:54:13.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:15.349 --> 00:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
I have a question
 
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
um do you have any information on other
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
states that have passed similar
 
00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:21.049 align:start position:0%
states that have passed similar
legislation

00:54:21.049 --> 00:54:21.059 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:25.309 --> 00:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
I'd be um but I don't know off the top
 
00:54:36.349 --> 00:54:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:39.049 --> 00:54:39.059 align:start position:0%
represent Bolden go ahead thank you um
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question I recall
 
00:54:43.549 --> 00:54:43.559 align:start position:0%
that there was someone who was arrested
 
00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
for recording people in restrooms in the
 
00:54:49.849 --> 00:54:49.859 align:start position:0%
Manchester Mall can you speak to how
 
00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:53.220 align:start position:0%
this would affect that yeah and I I know
 
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
that there's a prosecutor in the room
 
00:54:56.030 --> 00:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
that might be able to speak more to the
 
00:54:58.730 --> 00:54:58.740 align:start position:0%
technical aspects of that but I think um
 
00:55:00.650 --> 00:55:00.660 align:start position:0%
and I might know actually exactly what
 
00:55:02.329 --> 00:55:02.339 align:start position:0%
case you're referring to
 
00:55:04.370 --> 00:55:04.380 align:start position:0%
um but I think when we see cases like
 
00:55:06.049 --> 00:55:06.059 align:start position:0%
that oftentimes it's not just one
 
00:55:08.510 --> 00:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
restroom and so oftentimes there are
 
00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
many victims um spanning over multiple
 
00:55:13.730 --> 00:55:13.740 align:start position:0%
incidences and so when you have right
 
00:55:16.370 --> 00:55:16.380 align:start position:0%
now it's a I think a misdemeanor level
 
00:55:19.490 --> 00:55:19.500 align:start position:0%
offense and so but there's no
 
00:55:21.650 --> 00:55:21.660 align:start position:0%
um way to address a subsequent offense
 
00:55:24.430 --> 00:55:24.440 align:start position:0%
so the same person might be
 
00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:26.940 align:start position:0%
convicted for a violation of privacy the
 
00:55:28.730 --> 00:55:28.740 align:start position:0%
first time and then they could be
 
00:55:30.589 --> 00:55:30.599 align:start position:0%
convicted again and then again and again
 
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
but the penalty is not raising so this
 
00:55:35.089 --> 00:55:35.099 align:start position:0%
bill specifically is acknowledging when
 
00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
it happens two or more times to really
 
00:55:39.770 --> 00:55:39.780 align:start position:0%
ensure that it's being treated seriously
 
00:55:42.170 --> 00:55:42.180 align:start position:0%
and it's acknowledged that this is this
 
00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
is um a really really impacts victims
 
00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:46.380 align:start position:0%
who are experienced seeing this type of
 
00:55:51.049 --> 00:55:51.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:53.640 align:start position:0%
representative Newell
 
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
um that example just kind of brings up a
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
question for me
 
00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
um kind of nitpicky but uh does it you
 
00:56:02.329 --> 00:56:02.339 align:start position:0%
know when we're talking about multiple
 
00:56:03.650 --> 00:56:03.660 align:start position:0%
cases are we talking about multiple
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
people for example in that situation uh
 
00:56:07.730 --> 00:56:07.740 align:start position:0%
they may have viewed many people it's
 
00:56:10.010 --> 00:56:10.020 align:start position:0%
one incident they would probably go to
 
00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
court for you know one overall incident
 
00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:15.540 align:start position:0%
but it could be multiple people so when
 
00:56:17.390 --> 00:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
we're saying second and third offense
 
00:56:18.410 --> 00:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
and things like that are we talking
 
00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:20.460 align:start position:0%
about the person or the incident the
 
00:56:25.549 --> 00:56:25.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:27.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:56:30.349 --> 00:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:59.329 --> 00:56:59.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:01.549 --> 00:57:01.559 align:start position:0%
I am trainable a little bit slow but I'm
 
00:57:01.559 --> 00:57:02.809 align:start position:0%
I am trainable a little bit slow but I'm
trainable

00:57:02.809 --> 00:57:02.819 align:start position:0%
trainable
 
00:57:02.819 --> 00:57:03.710 align:start position:0%
trainable
um

00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:03.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:05.450 --> 00:57:05.460 align:start position:0%
my name is Dr Scott Hampton I'm the
 
00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:07.500 align:start position:0%
director of of ending the violence which
 
00:57:09.589 --> 00:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
is an organization in Dover where we
 
00:57:12.049 --> 00:57:12.059 align:start position:0%
work with perpetrators of Domestic and
 
00:57:14.569 --> 00:57:14.579 align:start position:0%
Sexual Violence and also offer training
 
00:57:16.730 --> 00:57:16.740 align:start position:0%
and consultation for other Professionals
 
00:57:17.930 --> 00:57:17.940 align:start position:0%
in the field
 
00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
over the last 32 years I've worked with
 
00:57:24.589 --> 00:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
thousands of perpetrators and victims of
 
00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
interpersonal violence and my testimony
 
00:57:29.450 --> 00:57:29.460 align:start position:0%
today is me based on what I've learned
 
00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:31.740 align:start position:0%
from that experience
 
00:57:34.730 --> 00:57:34.740 align:start position:0%
um I am here today in support of House
 
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
Bill 97 and I do appreciate the
 
00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity to share some of my views
 
00:57:40.370 --> 00:57:40.380 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:57:42.650 --> 00:57:42.660 align:start position:0%
um the focus of my testimony is going to
 
00:57:44.930 --> 00:57:44.940 align:start position:0%
be on the deterrent effect that I
 
00:57:46.730 --> 00:57:46.740 align:start position:0%
believe the proposed legislation would
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
have on offenders
 
00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:49.549 align:start position:0%
have on offenders
um

00:57:49.549 --> 00:57:49.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:52.130 --> 00:57:52.140 align:start position:0%
to do that I'm going to explain the
 
00:57:54.589 --> 00:57:54.599 align:start position:0%
forces that have not only allowed but
 
00:57:57.049 --> 00:57:57.059 align:start position:0%
actually encouraged offenders to violate
 
00:57:59.930 --> 00:57:59.940 align:start position:0%
privacy on route to sometimes committing
 
00:58:02.809 --> 00:58:02.819 align:start position:0%
even more serious offenses than that
 
00:58:02.819 --> 00:58:03.589 align:start position:0%
even more serious offenses than that
um

00:58:03.589 --> 00:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
to begin I just want to talk about
 
00:58:08.030 --> 00:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
sexual violence point out that sexual
 
00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:10.260 align:start position:0%
violence is different from other forms
 
00:58:12.589 --> 00:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
of assaulted Behavior because it's not
 
00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:15.839 align:start position:0%
inherently violent it's contextual and
 
00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:18.680 align:start position:0%
what I mean by that is that for example
 
00:58:22.790 --> 00:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
sexual intercourse fondling voyeurism
 
00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
may or may not be a crime
 
00:58:26.210 --> 00:58:26.220 align:start position:0%
all depending on whether or not there
 
00:58:28.549 --> 00:58:28.559 align:start position:0%
was fully informed form consent
 
00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
what that does is it creates some
 
00:58:31.609 --> 00:58:31.619 align:start position:0%
ambiguity which makes it difficult for
 
00:58:33.650 --> 00:58:33.660 align:start position:0%
us to sometimes determine whether or not
 
00:58:36.109 --> 00:58:36.119 align:start position:0%
a sex crime has been committed but even
 
00:58:37.970 --> 00:58:37.980 align:start position:0%
more importantly it actually makes it
 
00:58:40.970 --> 00:58:40.980 align:start position:0%
easy for offenders to delude themselves
 
00:58:42.589 --> 00:58:42.599 align:start position:0%
into thinking that they haven't crossed
 
00:58:44.450 --> 00:58:44.460 align:start position:0%
some significant line when in fact
 
00:58:45.890 --> 00:58:45.900 align:start position:0%
they've actually caused a pretty
 
00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
significant pretty significant harm
 
00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:50.510 align:start position:0%
significant pretty significant harm
um

00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:52.069 --> 00:58:52.079 align:start position:0%
um so where do they learn this where do
 
00:58:53.329 --> 00:58:53.339 align:start position:0%
they learn that it's okay actually to
 
00:58:55.609 --> 00:58:55.619 align:start position:0%
invade someone else's privacy well two
 
00:58:55.619 --> 00:58:56.750 align:start position:0%
invade someone else's privacy well two
words

00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
words
 
00:58:58.490 --> 00:58:58.500 align:start position:0%
sex education
 
00:59:01.250 --> 00:59:01.260 align:start position:0%
now bear with me for a moment may not be
 
00:59:02.349 --> 00:59:02.359 align:start position:0%
going the Direction You Think I'm Going
 
00:59:04.849 --> 00:59:04.859 align:start position:0%
the most popular
 
00:59:09.010 --> 00:59:09.020 align:start position:0%
sex education program in the world
 
00:59:12.349 --> 00:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
enthusiastically endorses voyeurism
 
00:59:13.789 --> 00:59:13.799 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it teaches people
 
00:59:15.470 --> 00:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes as young as 10 years old
 
00:59:17.690 --> 00:59:17.700 align:start position:0%
sometimes even younger that it's okay
 
00:59:19.250 --> 00:59:19.260 align:start position:0%
not just to look at people who are naked
 
00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:20.700 align:start position:0%
but actually watch them while they're
 
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
engaged and what probably should be a
 
00:59:23.930 --> 00:59:23.940 align:start position:0%
private sexual encounter with another
 
00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:24.910 align:start position:0%
private sexual encounter with another
person

00:59:24.910 --> 00:59:24.920 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:59:27.170 --> 00:59:27.180 align:start position:0%
it also teaches them I do see some
 
00:59:28.609 --> 00:59:28.619 align:start position:0%
confused looks I'm going to take care of
 
00:59:31.309 --> 00:59:31.319 align:start position:0%
that in a moment it also teaches them
 
00:59:34.250 --> 00:59:34.260 align:start position:0%
that it's okay during sexual behavior to
 
00:59:36.829 --> 00:59:36.839 align:start position:0%
slap strangle degrade humiliate and
 
00:59:38.270 --> 00:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
commit other acts of violence during
 
00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
um so what do we call this ubiquitous
 
00:59:48.549 --> 00:59:48.559 align:start position:0%
sexual education program pornography
 
00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
multi-billion Dollar business that
 
00:59:53.450 --> 00:59:53.460 align:start position:0%
unfortunately is the training ground for
 
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
for many sex offenders
 
00:59:57.890 --> 00:59:57.900 align:start position:0%
um even before sex offenders have a
 
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
chance to groom their own victims the
 
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
institutional pornography has groomed
 
01:00:04.730 --> 01:00:04.740 align:start position:0%
many of these offenders to commit their
 
01:00:06.589 --> 01:00:06.599 align:start position:0%
Crimes by sending the message that it's
 
01:00:09.349 --> 01:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
okay to seek sexual and other forms of
 
01:00:11.089 --> 01:00:11.099 align:start position:0%
gratification at the expense of another
 
01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:12.540 align:start position:0%
human being
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
so why is this so important let me just
 
01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
give you um like I said I've worked with
 
01:00:18.049 --> 01:00:18.059 align:start position:0%
a lot of offenders let me just give you
 
01:00:20.569 --> 01:00:20.579 align:start position:0%
one example it's a generic example of
 
01:00:22.970 --> 01:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
one person's progression from
 
01:00:24.650 --> 01:00:24.660 align:start position:0%
voyeuristic activities to something more
 
01:00:26.569 --> 01:00:26.579 align:start position:0%
severe so this guy walks out of his
 
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
house walks down the street notices
 
01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:30.900 align:start position:0%
um it's night time so it's dark outside
 
01:00:33.349 --> 01:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
he notices that there's a light on in a
 
01:00:34.609 --> 01:00:34.619 align:start position:0%
woman's bedroom
 
01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:36.420 align:start position:0%
he's standing on the sidewalk looks in
 
01:00:39.049 --> 01:00:39.059 align:start position:0%
sees her getting undressed stands on the
 
01:00:41.450 --> 01:00:41.460 align:start position:0%
sidewalk watches her okay the next time
 
01:00:44.329 --> 01:00:44.339 align:start position:0%
he comes out same street same situation
 
01:00:47.329 --> 01:00:47.339 align:start position:0%
this time he walks halfway onto her yard
 
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
wants to get a closer look watches goes
 
01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
on home next time he walks up to the
 
01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:53.990 align:start position:0%
on home next time he walks up to the
window

01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
window
 
01:00:55.490 --> 01:00:55.500 align:start position:0%
the next time he waits until she's
 
01:00:57.890 --> 01:00:57.900 align:start position:0%
asleep walks on to this is how he's
 
01:00:59.030 --> 01:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
describing to me in group how is
 
01:01:01.370 --> 01:01:01.380 align:start position:0%
progression work walks onto her front
 
01:01:03.049 --> 01:01:03.059 align:start position:0%
porch and just stands her from when
 
01:01:04.789 --> 01:01:04.799 align:start position:0%
seeing what it feels like to be close to
 
01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:06.660 align:start position:0%
her front door next time he puts his
 
01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:08.460 align:start position:0%
hand on the door handle doesn't try to
 
01:01:10.549 --> 01:01:10.559 align:start position:0%
open it but imagines walking inside the
 
01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:12.780 align:start position:0%
house next time he opens the door closes
 
01:01:15.049 --> 01:01:15.059 align:start position:0%
it this progresses walks in the house
 
01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
walks down the hallway goes to the end
 
01:01:19.849 --> 01:01:19.859 align:start position:0%
of her bedroom goes to the foot of her
 
01:01:22.370 --> 01:01:22.380 align:start position:0%
bed the final night he violently rapes
 
01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:23.390 align:start position:0%
bed the final night he violently rapes
her

01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
her
 
01:01:26.589 --> 01:01:26.599 align:start position:0%
so it began as a Gateway offense
 
01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
progressed unabatedly to a violent
 
01:01:31.490 --> 01:01:31.500 align:start position:0%
sexual act there was no message along
 
01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
the way there was nothing that said you
 
01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
have a reason to stop but we have an
 
01:01:37.549 --> 01:01:37.559 align:start position:0%
opportunity today to give him a reason
 
01:01:39.049 --> 01:01:39.059 align:start position:0%
to stop
 
01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:41.640 align:start position:0%
um voyeurism is a gateway offense so
 
01:01:44.270 --> 01:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
just like a someone who's a drug addict
 
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
they start with cigarettes and um and
 
01:01:49.549 --> 01:01:49.559 align:start position:0%
beer and marijuana before they progress
 
01:01:52.010 --> 01:01:52.020 align:start position:0%
to cocaine and heroin sex offenders do
 
01:01:53.809 --> 01:01:53.819 align:start position:0%
the same thing they always describe to
 
01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
me say well I start off with a low
 
01:01:59.390 --> 01:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
contact low risk offense like voyeurism
 
01:02:01.370 --> 01:02:01.380 align:start position:0%
before I Progressive the more severe
 
01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
even worse offenses like sexual assault
 
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
um and rape
 
01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
um they're not satisfied by pornography
 
01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
they want to be part of the action so
 
01:02:12.049 --> 01:02:12.059 align:start position:0%
like that case study I just mentioned
 
01:02:13.609 --> 01:02:13.619 align:start position:0%
they engage what we call successive
 
01:02:17.690 --> 01:02:17.700 align:start position:0%
approximations and if along the way no
 
01:02:19.730 --> 01:02:19.740 align:start position:0%
one is objecting no one is saying this
 
01:02:21.289 --> 01:02:21.299 align:start position:0%
is not okay no one says you have to stop
 
01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
they will continue to progress the guys
 
01:02:24.829 --> 01:02:24.839 align:start position:0%
in my group that's what I'm going to
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
leave you with
 
01:02:27.230 --> 01:02:27.240 align:start position:0%
um the men that I've worked with in my
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
group and I've worked with some women as
 
01:02:28.559 --> 01:02:29.930 align:start position:0%
group and I've worked with some women as
well

01:02:29.930 --> 01:02:29.940 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:02:34.010 --> 01:02:34.020 align:start position:0%
um describe this gradual escalation from
 
01:02:37.609 --> 01:02:37.619 align:start position:0%
this low risk low violence onward some
 
01:02:39.650 --> 01:02:39.660 align:start position:0%
had dozens of victims some had committed
 
01:02:41.270 --> 01:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
hundreds of sex crimes before there was
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
any meaningful consequence to them
 
01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:44.270 align:start position:0%
any meaningful consequence to them
um

01:02:44.270 --> 01:02:44.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
they all told me I had no intention of
 
01:02:48.289 --> 01:02:48.299 align:start position:0%
stopping until I was gonna until I was
 
01:02:50.030 --> 01:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
caught until someone said that this was
 
01:02:51.770 --> 01:02:51.780 align:start position:0%
none of them and this is the important
 
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
point for today I think none of them
 
01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
that I can remember over the 32 years
 
01:02:58.370 --> 01:02:58.380 align:start position:0%
ever told me that they got that that
 
01:03:00.829 --> 01:03:00.839 align:start position:0%
firm message because they merely
 
01:03:03.770 --> 01:03:03.780 align:start position:0%
violated someone's privacy it was always
 
01:03:05.329 --> 01:03:05.339 align:start position:0%
something more severe than that before
 
01:03:07.130 --> 01:03:07.140 align:start position:0%
the system said wow this is really not
 
01:03:09.410 --> 01:03:09.420 align:start position:0%
okay you need to stop doing that
 
01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:12.299 align:start position:0%
um so victims are waiting for us to send
 
01:03:14.270 --> 01:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
that message offenders are waiting for
 
01:03:15.770 --> 01:03:15.780 align:start position:0%
us to send that message I think we all
 
01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:17.220 align:start position:0%
are waiting for that message to be sent
 
01:03:18.770 --> 01:03:18.780 align:start position:0%
and I think you have an opportunity
 
01:03:21.770 --> 01:03:21.780 align:start position:0%
today to deliver that message so thank
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
you for listening to me
 
01:03:25.069 --> 01:03:25.079 align:start position:0%
um and and considering my request that
 
01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
you support House Bill 97 I'd be glad to
 
01:03:30.170 --> 01:03:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:35.930 --> 01:03:35.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:03:38.089 --> 01:03:38.099 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify where you were
 
01:03:38.099 --> 01:03:38.870 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify where you were
you work

01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
you work
 
01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
um in in Dover well actually I work in
 
01:03:41.930 --> 01:03:41.940 align:start position:0%
Dover and I also work in Texas but
 
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
that's not relevant today
 
01:03:46.130 --> 01:03:46.140 align:start position:0%
um uh ending I work in two places ending
 
01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:47.640 align:start position:0%
the violence uh which is where we work
 
01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
with offenders I also am the coordinator
 
01:03:52.370 --> 01:03:52.380 align:start position:0%
for the Stratford County supervised
 
01:03:54.410 --> 01:03:54.420 align:start position:0%
visitation center so I work with the
 
01:03:56.990 --> 01:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
offenders the victims and the children
 
01:03:59.809 --> 01:03:59.819 align:start position:0%
um during a reunification process
 
01:03:59.819 --> 01:04:01.609 align:start position:0%
um during a reunification process
follow-up

01:04:01.609 --> 01:04:01.619 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:04:02.930 --> 01:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:04:04.609 --> 01:04:04.619 align:start position:0%
um thanks for taking another question so
 
01:04:05.809 --> 01:04:05.819 align:start position:0%
that is what I was trying to understand
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
is the stories that you shared are
 
01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
people that are local to New Hampshire
 
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
yes and this one example was was in our
 
01:04:16.130 --> 01:04:16.140 align:start position:0%
sex offender treatment program probably
 
01:04:18.289 --> 01:04:18.299 align:start position:0%
10 years ago or so but I've heard
 
01:04:20.569 --> 01:04:20.579 align:start position:0%
variations on the theme and a lot of
 
01:04:22.609 --> 01:04:22.619 align:start position:0%
this where one of the one of the what we
 
01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
do in a treatment program is we we go
 
01:04:25.549 --> 01:04:25.559 align:start position:0%
through what are called offense cycles
 
01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:28.140 align:start position:0%
and so we try to do is we map out
 
01:04:29.450 --> 01:04:29.460 align:start position:0%
um the progression of what they did how
 
01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:30.660 align:start position:0%
they make decisions what were you
 
01:04:32.270 --> 01:04:32.280 align:start position:0%
thinking feeling and doing at various
 
01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:33.660 align:start position:0%
stages and how does that progress over
 
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
time and this is a a generic but a very
 
01:04:39.890 --> 01:04:39.900 align:start position:0%
common presentation that I would hear
 
01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative Staley
 
01:04:43.370 --> 01:04:43.380 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you for your
 
01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:44.450 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you for your
testimony

01:04:44.450 --> 01:04:44.460 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:04:46.730 --> 01:04:46.740 align:start position:0%
um I live in Durham and you may be
 
01:04:49.130 --> 01:04:49.140 align:start position:0%
familiar we had a person who was
 
01:04:51.530 --> 01:04:51.540 align:start position:0%
nicknamed Jack the snipper yes who um
 
01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
was going into people's homes for those
 
01:04:55.849 --> 01:04:55.859 align:start position:0%
of you were not familiar and uh breaking
 
01:04:57.470 --> 01:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
into their spaces and he while they
 
01:04:59.210 --> 01:04:59.220 align:start position:0%
slept um literally cutting off their
 
01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
underwear and taking it as trophy how
 
01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
would this legislation be likely to uh
 
01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
stop his behavior or to ensure that
 
01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
um he didn't just continue to be
 
01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
essentially caught and released like a
 
01:05:16.609 --> 01:05:16.619 align:start position:0%
fish catch and releases is a really good
 
01:05:18.289 --> 01:05:18.299 align:start position:0%
analogy for it because I hear that
 
01:05:19.609 --> 01:05:19.619 align:start position:0%
conversation a lot from the from the
 
01:05:21.770 --> 01:05:21.780 align:start position:0%
guys in my group I've had people who've
 
01:05:23.390 --> 01:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
come to my program who've been been
 
01:05:27.289 --> 01:05:27.299 align:start position:0%
convicted on misdemeanors and
 
01:05:29.270 --> 01:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
um sometimes they they blow off Groove
 
01:05:30.109 --> 01:05:30.119 align:start position:0%
they don't really care what the
 
01:05:31.309 --> 01:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
probation officer is telling them to do
 
01:05:33.770 --> 01:05:33.780 align:start position:0%
whatever and I've heard them say well um
 
01:05:35.450 --> 01:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
you know my thing they do constant
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
comparisons with each other so they'll
 
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
say things like well I only got
 
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
convicted of a misdemeanor you know that
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
person got convicted of a felony and you
 
01:05:44.210 --> 01:05:44.220 align:start position:0%
know so what I did really wasn't all
 
01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:45.660 align:start position:0%
that bad they're constantly doing these
 
01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
comparisons so I think when we upgrade
 
01:05:49.309 --> 01:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
this the same way when we upgraded the
 
01:05:51.289 --> 01:05:51.299 align:start position:0%
strangulation statute after the Missy
 
01:05:52.910 --> 01:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
Charbonneau case and that went from a
 
01:05:55.549 --> 01:05:55.559 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor to a class B felony the
 
01:05:57.650 --> 01:05:57.660 align:start position:0%
conversations that I heard
 
01:05:59.930 --> 01:05:59.940 align:start position:0%
um amongst the people in my group
 
01:06:01.970 --> 01:06:01.980 align:start position:0%
um about wow I never thought it was that
 
01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
bad and just the fact that it was moved
 
01:06:06.349 --> 01:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
up to a felony was a tap on the shoulder
 
01:06:07.490 --> 01:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
and and they're starting to ask me
 
01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
questions why do they think it's that
 
01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
bad I thought it was it was it was no
 
01:06:12.829 --> 01:06:12.839 align:start position:0%
big deal before so I'm imagining there's
 
01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
going to be the same kind of impact that
 
01:06:16.329 --> 01:06:16.339 align:start position:0%
we had when we when we upgraded
 
01:06:18.289 --> 01:06:18.299 align:start position:0%
strangulation just by going from
 
01:06:21.289 --> 01:06:21.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:21.299 --> 01:06:22.630 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:06:25.490 --> 01:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
EK this this may be a question for the
 
01:06:27.410 --> 01:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
chair are we going to hear from someone
 
01:06:30.130 --> 01:06:30.140 align:start position:0%
from the Judiciary the reason I'm asking
 
01:06:33.170 --> 01:06:33.180 align:start position:0%
is that we're trivializing a misdemeanor
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
you've spent you if it where are the
 
01:06:37.549 --> 01:06:37.559 align:start position:0%
judges on this the misdemeanor carries a
 
01:06:39.650 --> 01:06:39.660 align:start position:0%
year in jail I mean that's not trivial
 
01:06:41.930 --> 01:06:41.940 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering
 
01:06:45.829 --> 01:06:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:48.180 align:start position:0%
as far as I know no one from Judiciary
 
01:06:51.349 --> 01:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
is going to be taking a position on this
 
01:06:56.450 --> 01:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:58.190 --> 01:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
um so the one thing I would say is that
 
01:06:59.930 --> 01:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
I I completely agree with you if I think
 
01:07:02.450 --> 01:07:02.460 align:start position:0%
about where I am in life right now
 
01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:03.780 align:start position:0%
um and if someone said how about we
 
01:07:05.630 --> 01:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
change your life and and convict you of
 
01:07:08.930 --> 01:07:08.940 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor that's going to sting
 
01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
the Baseline for a lot of people my
 
01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
program is different
 
01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:13.740 align:start position:0%
um for some of them a misdemeanor is
 
01:07:16.490 --> 01:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
like having a bad cold and and something
 
01:07:18.650 --> 01:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
that they can just take in stride so for
 
01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
you and me that's a that would be a
 
01:07:22.490 --> 01:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
significant change for some of them not
 
01:07:28.069 --> 01:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:30.529 --> 01:07:30.539 align:start position:0%
representative Guthrie
 
01:07:32.089 --> 01:07:32.099 align:start position:0%
just curious
 
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
um your program is it for um
 
01:07:37.730 --> 01:07:37.740 align:start position:0%
changing behaviors what
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
trying to understand your program when
 
01:07:41.089 --> 01:07:41.099 align:start position:0%
it comes to
 
01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
um the person that's assaulted someone
 
01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
good question
 
01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:47.940 align:start position:0%
um changing Behavior yes changing the
 
01:07:50.029 --> 01:07:50.039 align:start position:0%
attitudes and belief systems that
 
01:07:52.490 --> 01:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
support that behavior even even more
 
01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
foundational so you know we can say well
 
01:07:57.890 --> 01:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
you can't do X Y and Z but if they don't
 
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
understand why x y and z are a problem
 
01:08:03.770 --> 01:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
or or the bigger issue then that change
 
01:08:04.970 --> 01:08:04.980 align:start position:0%
isn't going to last very long so it's
 
01:08:06.829 --> 01:08:06.839 align:start position:0%
both attitudes and behaviors that feed
 
01:08:09.289 --> 01:08:09.299 align:start position:0%
into the to the actual actual crimes
 
01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:16.020 align:start position:0%
so what would you say your success rate
 
01:08:17.809 --> 01:08:17.819 align:start position:0%
is at this time
 
01:08:20.570 --> 01:08:20.580 align:start position:0%
and how long have you been uh in this
 
01:08:23.450 --> 01:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
process one one of the challenges with
 
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
success is that the most common way of
 
01:08:26.329 --> 01:08:26.339 align:start position:0%
measuring that is what we call
 
01:08:26.339 --> 01:08:27.530 align:start position:0%
measuring that is what we call
recidivism

01:08:27.530 --> 01:08:27.540 align:start position:0%
recidivism
 
01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
there's a problem with that statistic
 
01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:30.420 align:start position:0%
even though it's a favorite amongst
 
01:08:32.570 --> 01:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
researchers recidivism doesn't tell you
 
01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:34.140 align:start position:0%
whether someone's recommitted a crime
 
01:08:35.809 --> 01:08:35.819 align:start position:0%
recidivism tells you whether someone was
 
01:08:35.819 --> 01:08:36.829 align:start position:0%
recidivism tells you whether someone was
caught

01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
caught
 
01:08:39.530 --> 01:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
So my answer to how successful we are do
 
01:08:41.630 --> 01:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
we have people who have chosen not to
 
01:08:43.789 --> 01:08:43.799 align:start position:0%
recommit those crimes yeah what we try
 
01:08:45.709 --> 01:08:45.719 align:start position:0%
to do is we say how can you go about
 
01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
getting your needs met in a way that are
 
01:08:50.329 --> 01:08:50.339 align:start position:0%
that don't cause problems for you or for
 
01:08:51.769 --> 01:08:51.779 align:start position:0%
someone else so give them alternatives
 
01:08:53.689 --> 01:08:53.699 align:start position:0%
are there ways to engage in a healthy
 
01:08:55.249 --> 01:08:55.259 align:start position:0%
relationship that don't involve invading
 
01:08:57.530 --> 01:08:57.540 align:start position:0%
someone's privacy for instance so we do
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
have success for that it's hard to
 
01:09:01.249 --> 01:09:01.259 align:start position:0%
measure because we have some people who
 
01:09:04.729 --> 01:09:04.739 align:start position:0%
never get re-arrested but find new ways
 
01:09:07.729 --> 01:09:07.739 align:start position:0%
of avoiding accountability and so it's
 
01:09:10.130 --> 01:09:10.140 align:start position:0%
it's a we don't have solid data for that
 
01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid to say
 
01:09:15.410 --> 01:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
but what I would say is that that our
 
01:09:17.630 --> 01:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
success isn't based on what happens in
 
01:09:19.789 --> 01:09:19.799 align:start position:0%
my program solely it's based on the
 
01:09:21.410 --> 01:09:21.420 align:start position:0%
community response
 
01:09:24.289 --> 01:09:24.299 align:start position:0%
so when an entire community
 
01:09:26.689 --> 01:09:26.699 align:start position:0%
takes an issue seriously we have much
 
01:09:28.490 --> 01:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
better success it was like someone said
 
01:09:30.650 --> 01:09:30.660 align:start position:0%
offender programs are are most effective
 
01:09:33.110 --> 01:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
in communities that don't need them
 
01:09:34.490 --> 01:09:34.500 align:start position:0%
which is kind of a weird statement if
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
you think about it but it's true it says
 
01:09:39.229 --> 01:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
if we all take it seriously then that's
 
01:09:41.689 --> 01:09:41.699 align:start position:0%
where the change really happens the
 
01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:43.980 align:start position:0%
program Itself by itself won't do it
 
01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
legislation my work law enforcement how
 
01:09:50.209 --> 01:09:50.219 align:start position:0%
much we follow through is important
 
01:09:52.729 --> 01:09:52.739 align:start position:0%
and I believe the witness testified 32
 
01:09:52.739 --> 01:09:53.510 align:start position:0%
and I believe the witness testified 32
years

01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:09:55.790 --> 01:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
representative scitec well this is
 
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
actually slightly off topic I'll make it
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
quick you're a doctor I believe when
 
01:10:02.450 --> 01:10:02.460 align:start position:0%
what you said you can change Behavior
 
01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
can you change the foundational attitude
 
01:10:06.770 --> 01:10:06.780 align:start position:0%
of someone who is given to this
 
01:10:10.669 --> 01:10:10.679 align:start position:0%
inclination can that ever change
 
01:10:12.530 --> 01:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
um it's probably a matter of degree and
 
01:10:13.790 --> 01:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
they certainly are individual
 
01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:15.470 align:start position:0%
they certainly are individual
differences

01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
differences
 
01:10:17.810 --> 01:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
um we have there are basically three
 
01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:21.060 align:start position:0%
groups of people who commit sex offenses
 
01:10:23.570 --> 01:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
there's one group of people who
 
01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely want to do harm these are the
 
01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:28.020 align:start position:0%
more so sociopathic Psychopathic ones
 
01:10:30.290 --> 01:10:30.300 align:start position:0%
change with them is very difficult and
 
01:10:32.689 --> 01:10:32.699 align:start position:0%
unlikely and the best we can do is do a
 
01:10:34.729 --> 01:10:34.739 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of monitoring and give
 
01:10:37.130 --> 01:10:37.140 align:start position:0%
them fewer options to to act out
 
01:10:38.570 --> 01:10:38.580 align:start position:0%
they're the ones who want to cause harm
 
01:10:40.189 --> 01:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
there are ones on the other end of the
 
01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
spectrum who really don't want to cause
 
01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
harm but they're really lacking
 
01:10:44.270 --> 01:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
information so they really don't
 
01:10:45.890 --> 01:10:45.900 align:start position:0%
understand boundaries very well and
 
01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
maybe they grew up in an environment
 
01:10:49.130 --> 01:10:49.140 align:start position:0%
where boundaries didn't exist or they
 
01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
were just really distorted those people
 
01:10:52.490 --> 01:10:52.500 align:start position:0%
we can make a tremendous amount of
 
01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
change and then there's a group in the
 
01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
Middle where they don't want to cause
 
01:10:58.189 --> 01:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
harm but they don't really care if they
 
01:11:01.610 --> 01:11:01.620 align:start position:0%
do a lot of people who commit what we
 
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
call date rapes and stuff are sort of
 
01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
those like you know I'm going to go out
 
01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
and you know buyer beware kind of thing
 
01:11:08.510 --> 01:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
and they're kind of in the middle so we
 
01:11:11.169 --> 01:11:11.179 align:start position:0%
can have a significant impact on them
 
01:11:14.450 --> 01:11:14.460 align:start position:0%
when we when we offer alternatives to
 
01:11:15.649 --> 01:11:15.659 align:start position:0%
them but there's some people that are
 
01:11:15.659 --> 01:11:19.490 align:start position:0%
them but there's some people that are
untouchable

01:11:19.490 --> 01:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:21.780 align:start position:0%
representative Noel
 
01:11:23.149 --> 01:11:23.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question sure
 
01:11:26.450 --> 01:11:26.460 align:start position:0%
is your program a mandated
 
01:11:28.610 --> 01:11:28.620 align:start position:0%
um a part of a recovery
 
01:11:30.169 --> 01:11:30.179 align:start position:0%
um scheme or something like that or is
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
it voluntary
 
01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:34.070 align:start position:0%
it voluntary
um

01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to change the question a
 
01:11:37.010 --> 01:11:37.020 align:start position:0%
little bit most of the people coming to
 
01:11:39.290 --> 01:11:39.300 align:start position:0%
our program are court ordered
 
01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
um we do get some people who are
 
01:11:43.250 --> 01:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
otherwise referred so in other words
 
01:11:45.530 --> 01:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
when we talk about voluntary that makes
 
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
it sound like they just on their own
 
01:11:48.590 --> 01:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
want to do it we have people who have
 
01:11:50.689 --> 01:11:50.699 align:start position:0%
other reasons like oh my partner said if
 
01:11:51.709 --> 01:11:51.719 align:start position:0%
I don't come to your program he's going
 
01:11:53.870 --> 01:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
to leave me well is that voluntary it's
 
01:11:55.550 --> 01:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
not court ordered but yeah you sort of
 
01:11:57.649 --> 01:11:57.659 align:start position:0%
see where I'm going with that we used to
 
01:11:59.510 --> 01:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
do just um Court mandate but what's
 
01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
interesting is that we've had people
 
01:12:03.770 --> 01:12:03.780 align:start position:0%
talking with other people I have a guy
 
01:12:05.570 --> 01:12:05.580 align:start position:0%
in my program he talks to someone that
 
01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
he goes to work with and I just had
 
01:12:09.410 --> 01:12:09.420 align:start position:0%
someone about three months ago who said
 
01:12:12.169 --> 01:12:12.179 align:start position:0%
this he said um I've never been arrested
 
01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
for committing for committing this kind
 
01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
of crime however I want to keep it that
 
01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
way and and can I be part of the
 
01:12:20.630 --> 01:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
conversation so I get a phone call
 
01:12:22.729 --> 01:12:22.739 align:start position:0%
saying you know I'm not Court referred
 
01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
but I could use some of the stuff you
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
guys talk about are your doors open and
 
01:12:29.330 --> 01:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
I say yes so I would say we have about
 
01:12:31.790 --> 01:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
15 of the people in our program that are
 
01:12:33.530 --> 01:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
otherwise referred the rest are court
 
01:12:39.410 --> 01:12:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:41.090 --> 01:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
there'll be no further questions thank
 
01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony thank you for
 
01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:53.169 --> 01:12:53.179 align:start position:0%
the chair calls Stephen
 
01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:56.340 align:start position:0%
and and there's Enders
 
01:12:57.950 --> 01:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
you have to Pardon Me on my reading
 
01:13:00.530 --> 01:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
glasses today
 
01:13:02.649 --> 01:13:02.659 align:start position:0%
I have Spears
 
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman members of the
 
01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Steven Andrus I'm a
 
01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
prosecutor in the Merrimack County
 
01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
Attorney's Office I'm an assistant
 
01:13:13.010 --> 01:13:13.020 align:start position:0%
County attorney I've been a prosecutor
 
01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:16.140 align:start position:0%
for a little over 20 years now
 
01:13:18.050 --> 01:13:18.060 align:start position:0%
um really what we're talking about here
 
01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
is punishment for a crime which is
 
01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
really a policy decision for the
 
01:13:25.250 --> 01:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
legislature to make and certainly Dr
 
01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
Hampton is giving you some
 
01:13:30.530 --> 01:13:30.540 align:start position:0%
some reasons to consider that policy I
 
01:13:32.030 --> 01:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
mean personally as a prosecutor I
 
01:13:33.649 --> 01:13:33.659 align:start position:0%
support the idea of an increased
 
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
sentence for a second offense I spoke to
 
01:13:37.610 --> 01:13:37.620 align:start position:0%
County attorney Halverson earlier today
 
01:13:40.490 --> 01:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
he also indicated that he supported this
 
01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:42.229 align:start position:0%
he also indicated that he supported this
legislation

01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
really there's a number of statutes in
 
01:13:46.010 --> 01:13:46.020 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire where we already have
 
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
secondary subsequent offenses with
 
01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
increased punishment or increased
 
01:13:51.490 --> 01:13:51.500 align:start position:0%
criminal liability
 
01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
indecent exposure has passages for
 
01:13:56.090 --> 01:13:56.100 align:start position:0%
second or subsequent offenses being
 
01:13:59.750 --> 01:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
felonies stalking has a provision where
 
01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
a second or subsequent offense can be
 
01:14:03.890 --> 01:14:03.900 align:start position:0%
charged as a felony cruelty to animals
 
01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:05.110 align:start position:0%
charged as a felony cruelty to animals
has

01:14:05.110 --> 01:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:14:07.729 --> 01:14:07.739 align:start position:0%
felony Provisions for subsequent
 
01:14:07.739 --> 01:14:08.750 align:start position:0%
felony Provisions for subsequent
offenses

01:14:08.750 --> 01:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
offenses
 
01:14:11.090 --> 01:14:11.100 align:start position:0%
even theft in New Hampshire a third
 
01:14:13.130 --> 01:14:13.140 align:start position:0%
offense can be charged as a felony
 
01:14:15.410 --> 01:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
regardless of value and then throughout
 
01:14:17.390 --> 01:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
the motor vehicle code there's there's
 
01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
examples where subsequent offenses have
 
01:14:21.709 --> 01:14:21.719 align:start position:0%
higher penalties such as operating after
 
01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
suspension or driving while intoxicated
 
01:14:25.970 --> 01:14:25.980 align:start position:0%
for example
 
01:14:28.850 --> 01:14:28.860 align:start position:0%
to explain a little bit about how it
 
01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
actually works in practice
 
01:14:33.850 --> 01:14:33.860 align:start position:0%
a person would have to be arrested
 
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
charged with a violation of 644.9 and
 
01:14:40.430 --> 01:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
then convicted of that violation and
 
01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
after conviction commit a subsequent
 
01:14:44.990 --> 01:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
offense for this to be charged as a
 
01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
felony offense
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
so there were questions about multiple
 
01:14:51.530 --> 01:14:51.540 align:start position:0%
victims that type of thing if you did
 
01:14:54.290 --> 01:14:54.300 align:start position:0%
this if you committed a violation of
 
01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
privacy against 10 people with no prior
 
01:14:59.270 --> 01:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
convictions all 10 of those would end up
 
01:15:01.610 --> 01:15:01.620 align:start position:0%
being charged as misdemeanors you'd have
 
01:15:03.890 --> 01:15:03.900 align:start position:0%
to be convicted at least once and then a
 
01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
subsequent offense could be charged as a
 
01:15:08.149 --> 01:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
as a felony level offense
 
01:15:11.209 --> 01:15:11.219 align:start position:0%
but as I said this is in line with other
 
01:15:13.250 --> 01:15:13.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire statutes and certainly as
 
01:15:15.410 --> 01:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
a policy decision for for the
 
01:15:17.090 --> 01:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
legislature to make
 
01:15:20.510 --> 01:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
01:15:23.149 --> 01:15:23.159 align:start position:0%
I have a question would this legislation
 
01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:24.780 align:start position:0%
if it were passed and signed into law
 
01:15:28.189 --> 01:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
would it assist you in obtaining plea
 
01:15:30.189 --> 01:15:30.199 align:start position:0%
Bargains and things of that nature
 
01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely I think it would assist in
 
01:15:36.290 --> 01:15:36.300 align:start position:0%
in working cases out I think it would
 
01:15:38.450 --> 01:15:38.460 align:start position:0%
also perhaps assist in maybe not having
 
01:15:40.970 --> 01:15:40.980 align:start position:0%
subsequent cases because as Dr Hampton
 
01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
said if you're convicted the first time
 
01:15:44.990 --> 01:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
and you're told if you do this again
 
01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
it's a felony that may deter your
 
01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:48.669 align:start position:0%
it's a felony that may deter your
behavior

01:15:48.669 --> 01:15:48.679 align:start position:0%
behavior
 
01:15:51.550 --> 01:15:51.560 align:start position:0%
certainly as representative Saitek
 
01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned before a misdemeanor is not a
 
01:15:57.530 --> 01:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
trivial offense an offender can spend up
 
01:15:59.630 --> 01:15:59.640 align:start position:0%
to a year in jail for a misdemeanor
 
01:16:01.130 --> 01:16:01.140 align:start position:0%
level offense
 
01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:02.630 align:start position:0%
level offense
however

01:16:02.630 --> 01:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:16:05.570 --> 01:16:05.580 align:start position:0%
our goal isn't always to incarcerate
 
01:16:07.370 --> 01:16:07.380 align:start position:0%
people in fact that's not our goal at
 
01:16:10.729 --> 01:16:10.739 align:start position:0%
all and if I had a person charged with
 
01:16:12.709 --> 01:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
violation of privacy one of the things I
 
01:16:14.810 --> 01:16:14.820 align:start position:0%
would want is for them to participate in
 
01:16:18.530 --> 01:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
a program like Dr Hampton offers so I
 
01:16:20.810 --> 01:16:20.820 align:start position:0%
would probably do a suspended sentence
 
01:16:22.430 --> 01:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
or a proportion of that sentence
 
01:16:24.950 --> 01:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
suspended conditioned on them receiving
 
01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
treatment I can only hang 12 months over
 
01:16:29.050 --> 01:16:29.060 align:start position:0%
their head
 
01:16:31.970 --> 01:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
and it's in a suspended sense
 
01:16:33.770 --> 01:16:33.780 align:start position:0%
if it was a felony level offense
 
01:16:36.410 --> 01:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
obviously there's there's a greater
 
01:16:39.590 --> 01:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
ability to incarcerate a person on a
 
01:16:42.590 --> 01:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
felony level offense there's also
 
01:16:44.510 --> 01:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
um collateral consequences of a felony
 
01:16:47.209 --> 01:16:47.219 align:start position:0%
conviction which we may be able to to
 
01:16:49.090 --> 01:16:49.100 align:start position:0%
bargain with to get that person
 
01:16:51.470 --> 01:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
hopefully into treatment and the help
 
01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:56.570 --> 01:16:56.580 align:start position:0%
thank you could you just briefly to the
 
01:16:59.390 --> 01:16:59.400 align:start position:0%
committee explain on first offenses is
 
01:17:01.070 --> 01:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
there any type of a continuance where
 
01:17:02.990 --> 01:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
there's not a conviction
 
01:17:04.850 --> 01:17:04.860 align:start position:0%
um like a without a finding type of
 
01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
thing where this would not be triggered
 
01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:09.590 align:start position:0%
thing where this would not be triggered
certainly

01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:10.189 align:start position:0%
certainly
um

01:17:10.189 --> 01:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
there's a range of penalties that we can
 
01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
we can sort of discuss for first
 
01:17:20.110 --> 01:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
offenses with the
 
01:17:23.149 --> 01:17:23.159 align:start position:0%
there's a range of
 
01:17:26.570 --> 01:17:26.580 align:start position:0%
of conviction and non-conviction
 
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
um resolutions to criminal cases we send
 
01:17:31.610 --> 01:17:31.620 align:start position:0%
criminal cases to Diversion on a regular
 
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
basis where diversion is a program that
 
01:17:36.350 --> 01:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
if you go through a certain program take
 
01:17:38.810 --> 01:17:38.820 align:start position:0%
classes maybe perform community service
 
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
we would agree not to prosecute you for
 
01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
the crime there's no set rule that says
 
01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
we can't send a violation of privacy
 
01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
case to Diversion
 
01:17:52.430 --> 01:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
um I'd be unlikely to send a violation
 
01:17:54.350 --> 01:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
or privacy case to Diversion because of
 
01:17:56.570 --> 01:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
the nature of the case
 
01:17:56.580 --> 01:17:57.229 align:start position:0%
the nature of the case
um

01:17:57.229 --> 01:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:00.790 --> 01:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
so there are absolutely non-conviction
 
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
resolutions that could occur
 
01:18:05.930 --> 01:18:05.940 align:start position:0%
um there are conviction resolutions that
 
01:18:07.370 --> 01:18:07.380 align:start position:0%
could occur
 
01:18:09.410 --> 01:18:09.420 align:start position:0%
and as we had said you can get anything
 
01:18:12.649 --> 01:18:12.659 align:start position:0%
from no time in the house Corrections up
 
01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
to 12 months stand committed there can
 
01:18:17.689 --> 01:18:17.699 align:start position:0%
be fines up to two thousand dollars we
 
01:18:19.970 --> 01:18:19.980 align:start position:0%
could have follow-up treatment
 
01:18:19.980 --> 01:18:21.470 align:start position:0%
could have follow-up treatment
uh

01:18:21.470 --> 01:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:18:24.169 --> 01:18:24.179 align:start position:0%
there's possibilities of a conditional
 
01:18:25.970 --> 01:18:25.980 align:start position:0%
discharge on a misdemeanor case where
 
01:18:27.770 --> 01:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
after you fulfill the conditions of your
 
01:18:29.810 --> 01:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
sentence the the conviction would
 
01:18:31.970 --> 01:18:31.980 align:start position:0%
essentially be vacated so there's a
 
01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
there's certainly a variety of tools
 
01:18:35.689 --> 01:18:35.699 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be unique to this statute
 
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
but in general exist for all misdemeanor
 
01:18:42.770 --> 01:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
and felony prosecution
 
01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:51.229 --> 01:18:51.239 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks for taking my question
 
01:18:53.090 --> 01:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate hearing that you believe
 
01:18:55.370 --> 01:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
that you could potentially If This Were
 
01:18:56.750 --> 01:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
to pass
 
01:18:58.630 --> 01:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
um arranged for
 
01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
agreements where someone would enter
 
01:19:02.689 --> 01:19:02.699 align:start position:0%
treatment under a suspended sentence and
 
01:19:05.090 --> 01:19:05.100 align:start position:0%
I assume good behavior do you see that
 
01:19:07.850 --> 01:19:07.860 align:start position:0%
being more common
 
01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:11.340 align:start position:0%
I I'm asking because I can see that the
 
01:19:13.970 --> 01:19:13.980 align:start position:0%
benefits of maybe not having people in
 
01:19:16.850 --> 01:19:16.860 align:start position:0%
the jails as much absolutely
 
01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
um it says in the New Hampshire
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
Constitution that the purpose of the
 
01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system is essentially
 
01:19:25.130 --> 01:19:25.140 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation so Rehabilitation is
 
01:19:27.229 --> 01:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
something that whenever we're crafting a
 
01:19:29.090 --> 01:19:29.100 align:start position:0%
sentence is something that we're looking
 
01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:30.290 align:start position:0%
sentence is something that we're looking
at

01:19:30.290 --> 01:19:30.300 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:31.729 align:start position:0%
at
um

01:19:31.729 --> 01:19:31.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:31.739 --> 01:19:32.990 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:19:32.990 --> 01:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:34.970 --> 01:19:34.980 align:start position:0%
in almost every
 
01:19:37.610 --> 01:19:37.620 align:start position:0%
offer I've ever made as a prosecutor
 
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
there's been some degree of
 
01:19:43.970 --> 01:19:43.980 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation within that offer
 
01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:45.770 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation within that offer
um

01:19:45.770 --> 01:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:48.110 --> 01:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
jail is even
 
01:19:50.750 --> 01:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
in my opinion partially a form of
 
01:19:53.209 --> 01:19:53.219 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation because it may cause you
 
01:19:56.870 --> 01:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
to look at what you've done and uh think
 
01:19:58.370 --> 01:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
perhaps you don't want to do that in the
 
01:19:58.380 --> 01:19:59.209 align:start position:0%
perhaps you don't want to do that in the
future

01:19:59.209 --> 01:19:59.219 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:20:02.209 --> 01:20:02.219 align:start position:0%
so whenever I had I knew that whenever
 
01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
I've had violation of privacy cases
 
01:20:06.229 --> 01:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
there's always been a sex offender
 
01:20:13.610 --> 01:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:15.649 --> 01:20:15.659 align:start position:0%
representative sailing
 
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you so much you heard my question
 
01:20:21.290 --> 01:20:21.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:22.910 --> 01:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
a community
 
01:20:25.250 --> 01:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
um I'm curious how your perspective of
 
01:20:27.709 --> 01:20:27.719 align:start position:0%
how this might potentially stop someone
 
01:20:30.229 --> 01:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
like him from perpetuating his behaviors
 
01:20:32.689 --> 01:20:32.699 align:start position:0%
and also what you see is the potential
 
01:20:36.290 --> 01:20:36.300 align:start position:0%
downfalls of this type of legislation
 
01:20:39.229 --> 01:20:39.239 align:start position:0%
um I'm not completely familiar with with
 
01:20:41.090 --> 01:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
the the snipper case I know I heard
 
01:20:43.370 --> 01:20:43.380 align:start position:0%
about it on the news if that individual
 
01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
didn't have a prior conviction this
 
01:20:49.250 --> 01:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
legislation wouldn't affect him at all
 
01:20:51.169 --> 01:20:51.179 align:start position:0%
this would only affect subsequent
 
01:20:53.810 --> 01:20:53.820 align:start position:0%
convictions my recollection from that
 
01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
case as you indicated that he was
 
01:20:58.010 --> 01:20:58.020 align:start position:0%
actually entering people's homes and I
 
01:20:59.930 --> 01:20:59.940 align:start position:0%
would assume that instead of being
 
01:21:01.610 --> 01:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
charged with violation and privacy that
 
01:21:02.930 --> 01:21:02.940 align:start position:0%
he would have been charged with burglary
 
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
which is a felony level offense for
 
01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
breaking and entering into the dwelling
 
01:21:09.770 --> 01:21:09.780 align:start position:0%
of another with the intent to commit a
 
01:21:11.930 --> 01:21:11.940 align:start position:0%
crime therein with the crime either
 
01:21:15.110 --> 01:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
being theft of of the underwear or the
 
01:21:17.630 --> 01:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
crime being violation of privacy so I
 
01:21:18.890 --> 01:21:18.900 align:start position:0%
think that there's
 
01:21:21.410 --> 01:21:21.420 align:start position:0%
there are felony level statutes that
 
01:21:23.209 --> 01:21:23.219 align:start position:0%
sort of address some of this Behavior
 
01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
especially when you're entering people's
 
01:21:27.050 --> 01:21:27.060 align:start position:0%
houses I would expect that you would be
 
01:21:30.110 --> 01:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
charged with burglary rather than
 
01:21:33.470 --> 01:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:35.330 --> 01:21:35.340 align:start position:0%
representative Newell answers your
 
01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:38.030 align:start position:0%
representative Newell answers your
question

01:21:38.030 --> 01:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:39.410 --> 01:21:39.420 align:start position:0%
the chair
 
01:21:41.209 --> 01:21:41.219 align:start position:0%
um that question kind of brought up
 
01:21:43.729 --> 01:21:43.739 align:start position:0%
another question from me which is if
 
01:21:45.470 --> 01:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
there is some type of diversion or
 
01:21:48.350 --> 01:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
program uh when you say non-conviction
 
01:21:50.990 --> 01:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
options what we're talking about here is
 
01:21:53.990 --> 01:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
based on incidences how many incidences
 
01:21:56.270 --> 01:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
so it kind of Builds on itself right and
 
01:21:58.430 --> 01:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
what I'm curious about is if it's a
 
01:22:00.470 --> 01:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
non-conviction option which I think
 
01:22:01.850 --> 01:22:01.860 align:start position:0%
could be a good option but does that
 
01:22:03.950 --> 01:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
count towards this where a second or
 
01:22:05.390 --> 01:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
third offense would have would carry a
 
01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
different weight it would not count
 
01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
toward this so you would need a
 
01:22:11.209 --> 01:22:11.219 align:start position:0%
conviction for a subsequent offense to
 
01:22:13.850 --> 01:22:13.860 align:start position:0%
be a felony so if a first offense was
 
01:22:17.330 --> 01:22:17.340 align:start position:0%
sent to Diversion for whatever reason
 
01:22:19.070 --> 01:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
I don't want to say that would that
 
01:22:20.810 --> 01:22:20.820 align:start position:0%
would end up being a freebie for the the
 
01:22:22.370 --> 01:22:22.380 align:start position:0%
purposes of this statute but it wouldn't
 
01:22:25.729 --> 01:22:25.739 align:start position:0%
count as a prior conviction okay thank
 
01:22:25.739 --> 01:22:29.630 align:start position:0%
count as a prior conviction okay thank
you

01:22:29.630 --> 01:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:31.550 --> 01:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
there be no further questions thank you
 
01:22:33.229 --> 01:22:33.239 align:start position:0%
for your testimony thank you
 
01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else in the audience
 
01:22:39.050 --> 01:22:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:41.689 --> 01:22:41.699 align:start position:0%
they're being none I'm going to go ahead
 
01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
and close the public hearing on HP 97 FN
 
01:22:49.490 --> 01:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
and the committee will be in recess
 
01:23:00.410 --> 01:23:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:06.169 --> 01:48:06.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:08.450 --> 01:48:08.460 align:start position:0%
six I'm going to go ahead and open the
 
01:48:10.990 --> 01:48:11.000 align:start position:0%
public hearing on H HP
 
01:48:15.709 --> 01:48:15.719 align:start position:0%
107 FN and I'm going to turn sharing
 
01:48:17.510 --> 01:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
this hearing over to the vice chair
 
01:48:26.330 --> 01:48:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:29.209 --> 01:48:29.219 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:48:31.310 --> 01:48:31.320 align:start position:0%
um representative verville
 
01:49:01.930 --> 01:49:01.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:04.970 --> 01:49:04.980 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair honorable members
 
01:49:07.129 --> 01:49:07.139 align:start position:0%
of the of the committee
 
01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
um it's like deja vu all over again so
 
01:49:13.870 --> 01:49:13.880 align:start position:0%
this is the this is the third time
 
01:49:16.790 --> 01:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
this bill Works its way wins its way
 
01:49:18.590 --> 01:49:18.600 align:start position:0%
through the house
 
01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:19.490 align:start position:0%
through the house
um

01:49:19.490 --> 01:49:19.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:22.970 --> 01:49:22.980 align:start position:0%
the first time it passed the house and
 
01:49:27.290 --> 01:49:27.300 align:start position:0%
died in a senate Omnibus Bill
 
01:49:30.169 --> 01:49:30.179 align:start position:0%
last term it passed the house and a very
 
01:49:32.270 --> 01:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
nice bipartisan vote
 
01:49:35.330 --> 01:49:35.340 align:start position:0%
and uh went over to the the Senate where
 
01:49:38.750 --> 01:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
they decided interim study
 
01:49:41.450 --> 01:49:41.460 align:start position:0%
so maybe the third time's a charm I
 
01:49:43.850 --> 01:49:43.860 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know
 
01:49:46.129 --> 01:49:46.139 align:start position:0%
so this bill was
 
01:49:49.010 --> 01:49:49.020 align:start position:0%
requested from a constituent of mine in
 
01:49:52.250 --> 01:49:52.260 align:start position:0%
in Deerfield and there's some papers
 
01:49:56.030 --> 01:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
working around for two news stories from
 
01:49:58.430 --> 01:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
the Genesis of this
 
01:50:00.770 --> 01:50:00.780 align:start position:0%
of this bill I emailed them to you so
 
01:50:02.270 --> 01:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
you don't need the paper copy if you
 
01:50:05.810 --> 01:50:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:07.669 --> 01:50:07.679 align:start position:0%
you heard a lot of testimony this
 
01:50:09.950 --> 01:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
morning that carries over to this bill
 
01:50:13.070 --> 01:50:13.080 align:start position:0%
very very nicely and so
 
01:50:14.990 --> 01:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
what this bill
 
01:50:16.970 --> 01:50:16.980 align:start position:0%
aims to do
 
01:50:18.950 --> 01:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
is to prevent
 
01:50:21.709 --> 01:50:21.719 align:start position:0%
registered sex offenders
 
01:50:25.250 --> 01:50:25.260 align:start position:0%
from hiring managing
 
01:50:29.450 --> 01:50:29.460 align:start position:0%
and supervising minors
 
01:50:32.750 --> 01:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't prevent them working
 
01:50:34.609 --> 01:50:34.619 align:start position:0%
at a business
 
01:50:37.010 --> 01:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
that has minors present
 
01:50:40.189 --> 01:50:40.199 align:start position:0%
it just prevents them from being placed
 
01:50:43.550 --> 01:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
in a managing managing or supervisory
 
01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:46.310 align:start position:0%
in a managing managing or supervisory
role

01:50:46.310 --> 01:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:48.649 --> 01:50:48.659 align:start position:0%
of minors
 
01:50:48.659 --> 01:50:50.209 align:start position:0%
of minors
and

01:50:50.209 --> 01:50:50.219 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:50:52.669 --> 01:50:52.679 align:start position:0%
working directly
 
01:50:54.770 --> 01:50:54.780 align:start position:0%
with them
 
01:50:57.229 --> 01:50:57.239 align:start position:0%
this serves two purposes
 
01:50:57.239 --> 01:50:59.390 align:start position:0%
this serves two purposes
one

01:50:59.390 --> 01:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:51:02.330 --> 01:51:02.340 align:start position:0%
it protects our miners
 
01:51:06.109 --> 01:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
against being potential prey to
 
01:51:09.770 --> 01:51:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:11.990 --> 01:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
we heard discussion earlier about
 
01:51:14.870 --> 01:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
recidivism rates on registered sex
 
01:51:18.050 --> 01:51:18.060 align:start position:0%
offenders and it's if not the highest
 
01:51:20.629 --> 01:51:20.639 align:start position:0%
one of the most highest recidivism rates
 
01:51:23.390 --> 01:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
of any crime
 
01:51:26.570 --> 01:51:26.580 align:start position:0%
and we also heard interesting testimony
 
01:51:28.910 --> 01:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
that when we talk about recidivism we're
 
01:51:32.270 --> 01:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
talking about people that get caught
 
01:51:35.330 --> 01:51:35.340 align:start position:0%
so the rate is likely much much higher
 
01:51:39.890 --> 01:51:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:42.350 --> 01:51:42.360 align:start position:0%
and so for that reason
 
01:51:43.609 --> 01:51:43.619 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:51:46.250 --> 01:51:46.260 align:start position:0%
this change in the law all right this is
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
not new law this is a this is to close a
 
01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:50.090 align:start position:0%
not new law this is a this is to close a
loophole

01:51:50.090 --> 01:51:50.100 align:start position:0%
loophole
 
01:51:52.370 --> 01:51:52.380 align:start position:0%
in existing RSA
 
01:51:55.370 --> 01:51:55.380 align:start position:0%
that will protect the registered sex
 
01:51:55.380 --> 01:51:57.169 align:start position:0%
that will protect the registered sex
offender

01:51:57.169 --> 01:51:57.179 align:start position:0%
offender
 
01:51:59.570 --> 01:51:59.580 align:start position:0%
so if it prohibits the registered sex
 
01:52:01.370 --> 01:52:01.380 align:start position:0%
offender from doing something how does
 
01:52:02.870 --> 01:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
it protect them
 
01:52:05.750 --> 01:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
it protects them because it prevents
 
01:52:09.350 --> 01:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
them being placed into a position
 
01:52:13.070 --> 01:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
where to recommit the crime or similar
 
01:52:16.609 --> 01:52:16.619 align:start position:0%
crime is not presented to them
 
01:52:19.729 --> 01:52:19.739 align:start position:0%
so it it prevents putting them where
 
01:52:26.450 --> 01:52:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:29.149 --> 01:52:29.159 align:start position:0%
last term and I know it's a new term and
 
01:52:31.669 --> 01:52:31.679 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a new house I I get all that
 
01:52:33.189 --> 01:52:33.199 align:start position:0%
last term
 
01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
we had a subcommittee
 
01:52:38.510 --> 01:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
we did great work
 
01:52:41.030 --> 01:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
the language that's in front of you
 
01:52:44.209 --> 01:52:44.219 align:start position:0%
came out of that subcommittee
 
01:52:47.870 --> 01:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
this is language that was approved by
 
01:52:50.709 --> 01:52:50.719 align:start position:0%
State Police
 
01:52:53.750 --> 01:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
prosecutor's office
 
01:52:56.030 --> 01:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
victims advocates
 
01:52:59.330 --> 01:52:59.340 align:start position:0%
as well as offender Advocates right
 
01:53:01.010 --> 01:53:01.020 align:start position:0%
everybody has an advocate and everybody
 
01:53:04.189 --> 01:53:04.199 align:start position:0%
should have an advocate and we all came
 
01:53:08.410 --> 01:53:08.420 align:start position:0%
around the table Republicans Democrats
 
01:53:12.290 --> 01:53:12.300 align:start position:0%
victims people that are trying to to fix
 
01:53:14.149 --> 01:53:14.159 align:start position:0%
their lives for mistakes they've made in
 
01:53:16.970 --> 01:53:16.980 align:start position:0%
the past and we all agreed that this
 
01:53:19.430 --> 01:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
language was good language that this
 
01:53:22.250 --> 01:53:22.260 align:start position:0%
language closes the loophole that
 
01:53:26.629 --> 01:53:26.639 align:start position:0%
currently exists in our law that allows
 
01:53:29.950 --> 01:53:29.960 align:start position:0%
um situations like you see going around
 
01:53:32.030 --> 01:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
to occur
 
01:53:34.189 --> 01:53:34.199 align:start position:0%
so the first was
 
01:53:36.590 --> 01:53:36.600 align:start position:0%
a landscaper
 
01:53:39.050 --> 01:53:39.060 align:start position:0%
from my community
 
01:53:42.050 --> 01:53:42.060 align:start position:0%
registered sex offender was hiring and
 
01:53:44.149 --> 01:53:44.159 align:start position:0%
directly managing directly supervising
 
01:53:47.149 --> 01:53:47.159 align:start position:0%
minors that that puts both the minor and
 
01:53:49.970 --> 01:53:49.980 align:start position:0%
the offender in in a potentially very
 
01:53:52.490 --> 01:53:52.500 align:start position:0%
dangerous position
 
01:53:55.129 --> 01:53:55.139 align:start position:0%
and the intent of the law was to to
 
01:53:57.890 --> 01:53:57.900 align:start position:0%
disallow that but the law
 
01:54:01.129 --> 01:54:01.139 align:start position:0%
by interpretation by the courts
 
01:54:03.649 --> 01:54:03.659 align:start position:0%
does not does not prevent it and so the
 
01:54:06.709 --> 01:54:06.719 align:start position:0%
law needs to be changed so it does
 
01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
the second incident
 
01:54:11.090 --> 01:54:11.100 align:start position:0%
I was a
 
01:54:14.090 --> 01:54:14.100 align:start position:0%
carnival ride operator
 
01:54:17.629 --> 01:54:17.639 align:start position:0%
working for the vendor that provided
 
01:54:20.270 --> 01:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
rides at the Deerfield Fair
 
01:54:22.430 --> 01:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
an operator
 
01:54:25.070 --> 01:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
is a registered sex offender
 
01:54:27.649 --> 01:54:27.659 align:start position:0%
is operating a ride
 
01:54:30.470 --> 01:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
physically assisting children both on
 
01:54:33.290 --> 01:54:33.300 align:start position:0%
and off the ride
 
01:54:36.350 --> 01:54:36.360 align:start position:0%
checking restraints checking buckles so
 
01:54:38.510 --> 01:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
very close proximity
 
01:54:41.090 --> 01:54:41.100 align:start position:0%
we all know that minor children have
 
01:54:43.850 --> 01:54:43.860 align:start position:0%
favorite rides and therefore are likely
 
01:54:46.550 --> 01:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
to Loop through and ride that ride many
 
01:54:50.450 --> 01:54:50.460 align:start position:0%
times providing many opportunities for
 
01:54:52.729 --> 01:54:52.739 align:start position:0%
for contact that that this law was
 
01:54:55.310 --> 01:54:55.320 align:start position:0%
designed to prevent
 
01:54:57.950 --> 01:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
but as it was originally written
 
01:55:00.950 --> 01:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
in the eyes of the Court does not and so
 
01:55:04.070 --> 01:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
this language merely closes
 
01:55:06.830 --> 01:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
an accidental loophole an existing New
 
01:55:08.510 --> 01:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law
 
01:55:10.910 --> 01:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
I would strongly encourage every member
 
01:55:12.890 --> 01:55:12.900 align:start position:0%
of this committee to vote in favor of
 
01:55:12.900 --> 01:55:13.910 align:start position:0%
of this committee to vote in favor of
this

01:55:13.910 --> 01:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:55:16.010 --> 01:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
so that we can we can bring it to the
 
01:55:19.550 --> 01:55:19.560 align:start position:0%
floor of the House pass it for a third
 
01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:21.350 align:start position:0%
floor of the House pass it for a third
time

01:55:21.350 --> 01:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:55:24.169 --> 01:55:24.179 align:start position:0%
and then hopefully get it through the
 
01:55:25.990 --> 01:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
through the other body
 
01:55:28.669 --> 01:55:28.679 align:start position:0%
that's the intent of the law this
 
01:55:30.790 --> 01:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
language has been gone over many times
 
01:55:33.530 --> 01:55:33.540 align:start position:0%
and and so that's uh that's what we're
 
01:55:37.729 --> 01:55:37.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:39.350 --> 01:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative are there any
 
01:55:43.070 --> 01:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:45.530 --> 01:55:45.540 align:start position:0%
representative Muse
 
01:55:46.970 --> 01:55:46.980 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
01:55:49.250 --> 01:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
um does your bill actually include the
 
01:55:51.470 --> 01:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
language that was suggested by
 
01:55:53.870 --> 01:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn last year
 
01:55:56.570 --> 01:55:56.580 align:start position:0%
in his Amendment
 
01:55:59.689 --> 01:55:59.699 align:start position:0%
so for those that are new and for those
 
01:56:02.629 --> 01:56:02.639 align:start position:0%
that have been with us for a while
 
01:56:05.629 --> 01:56:05.639 align:start position:0%
this when this bill came to the floor of
 
01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
the house
 
01:56:09.109 --> 01:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn
 
01:56:12.169 --> 01:56:12.179 align:start position:0%
offered a floor Amendment
 
01:56:14.390 --> 01:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
I don't know what his motivation was he
 
01:56:16.910 --> 01:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
didn't testify in the committee when the
 
01:56:18.890 --> 01:56:18.900 align:start position:0%
bill came before committee
 
01:56:21.410 --> 01:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
he didn't participate or attend the
 
01:56:23.330 --> 01:56:23.340 align:start position:0%
subcommittee hearings
 
01:56:26.149 --> 01:56:26.159 align:start position:0%
and he never reached out to myself or
 
01:56:29.270 --> 01:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
any of the co-sponsors on the bill
 
01:56:32.510 --> 01:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:56:34.310 --> 01:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
I was a little surprised by the floor
 
01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:35.330 align:start position:0%
I was a little surprised by the floor
Amendment

01:56:35.330 --> 01:56:35.340 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:56:38.270 --> 01:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
the effect of the floor amendment in my
 
01:56:38.280 --> 01:56:40.070 align:start position:0%
the effect of the floor amendment in my
opinion

01:56:40.070 --> 01:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
01:56:42.410 --> 01:56:42.420 align:start position:0%
would change language
 
01:56:45.350 --> 01:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
to leave the loophole open
 
01:56:49.430 --> 01:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
so while the language was changed under
 
01:56:52.010 --> 01:56:52.020 align:start position:0%
that floor Amendment it would have left
 
01:56:54.770 --> 01:56:54.780 align:start position:0%
the loophole open so it sounded nice but
 
01:56:58.310 --> 01:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
it removed the the teeth
 
01:57:00.830 --> 01:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
and so there was a floor debate on the
 
01:57:02.629 --> 01:57:02.639 align:start position:0%
Lynn Amendment
 
01:57:05.450 --> 01:57:05.460 align:start position:0%
and that floor amendment was
 
01:57:07.430 --> 01:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
resoundingly defeated on the floor of
 
01:57:11.090 --> 01:57:11.100 align:start position:0%
the house and so no this bill does not
 
01:57:13.970 --> 01:57:13.980 align:start position:0%
include the language of the the one
 
01:57:13.980 --> 01:57:18.050 align:start position:0%
include the language of the the one
Amendment

01:57:18.050 --> 01:57:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:19.010 --> 01:57:19.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:57:19.020 --> 01:57:24.530 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
representative

01:57:24.530 --> 01:57:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:28.010 --> 01:57:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:30.709 --> 01:57:30.719 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks for taking my question
 
01:57:33.410 --> 01:57:33.420 align:start position:0%
um my perception is that there's
 
01:57:36.950 --> 01:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
different levels of being a Regis
 
01:57:39.410 --> 01:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
required to register on the sex offender
 
01:57:42.229 --> 01:57:42.239 align:start position:0%
registry I don't know if that's accurate
 
01:57:45.229 --> 01:57:45.239 align:start position:0%
um but you have in your handouts here at
 
01:57:47.570 --> 01:57:47.580 align:start position:0%
Edward Proctor and David getchell were
 
01:57:47.580 --> 01:57:48.350 align:start position:0%
Edward Proctor and David getchell were
those

01:57:48.350 --> 01:57:48.360 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:57:52.250 --> 01:57:52.260 align:start position:0%
people convicted of crime against minors
 
01:57:54.109 --> 01:57:54.119 align:start position:0%
to your knowledge
 
01:57:57.770 --> 01:57:57.780 align:start position:0%
thank you for the for the question
 
01:58:01.790 --> 01:58:01.800 align:start position:0%
um I do not know the the specifics of
 
01:58:05.270 --> 01:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
the crimes they committed uh but they
 
01:58:08.510 --> 01:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
were convicted of sexual crimes and are
 
01:58:12.770 --> 01:58:12.780 align:start position:0%
forced to register as as far as
 
01:58:15.290 --> 01:58:15.300 align:start position:0%
I believe they both were but I I
 
01:58:19.689 --> 01:58:19.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:24.589 --> 01:58:24.599 align:start position:0%
so if I may Madam chairman
 
01:58:26.510 --> 01:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not an expert
 
01:58:30.770 --> 01:58:30.780 align:start position:0%
in the registered sex offender database
 
01:58:33.050 --> 01:58:33.060 align:start position:0%
one of the challenges
 
01:58:36.770 --> 01:58:36.780 align:start position:0%
that we know we face is when we when we
 
01:58:38.990 --> 01:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
try to get too fine when we try to put
 
01:58:40.850 --> 01:58:40.860 align:start position:0%
too fine a point on it when we try to
 
01:58:43.490 --> 01:58:43.500 align:start position:0%
get too granular
 
01:58:46.970 --> 01:58:46.980 align:start position:0%
the language starts to get difficult and
 
01:58:50.689 --> 01:58:50.699 align:start position:0%
and is more open to interpretation
 
01:58:50.699 --> 01:58:53.390 align:start position:0%
and is more open to interpretation
the

01:58:53.390 --> 01:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:58:56.089 --> 01:58:56.099 align:start position:0%
to be quite Frank
 
01:58:59.990 --> 01:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
the most of the opposition to closing
 
01:59:01.609 --> 01:59:01.619 align:start position:0%
this loophole
 
01:59:05.530 --> 01:59:05.540 align:start position:0%
is a fear that it will further reduce
 
01:59:09.229 --> 01:59:09.239 align:start position:0%
limited employment opportunities for
 
01:59:11.990 --> 01:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
registered sex offenders and the
 
01:59:13.669 --> 01:59:13.679 align:start position:0%
original language
 
01:59:13.679 --> 01:59:15.770 align:start position:0%
original language
potentially

01:59:15.770 --> 01:59:15.780 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
could have prevented
 
01:59:20.629 --> 01:59:20.639 align:start position:0%
a registered sex offender
 
01:59:23.570 --> 01:59:23.580 align:start position:0%
from becoming a corner store corner
 
01:59:26.209 --> 01:59:26.219 align:start position:0%
store clerk
 
01:59:26.219 --> 01:59:28.070 align:start position:0%
store clerk
because

01:59:28.070 --> 01:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:59:30.890 --> 01:59:30.900 align:start position:0%
come in after school they buy candy he's
 
01:59:33.109 --> 01:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
the clerk she's the clerk they're making
 
01:59:34.910 --> 01:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
a transaction so they're they're
 
01:59:36.709 --> 01:59:36.719 align:start position:0%
servicing children but they're they're
 
01:59:38.510 --> 01:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
they're not right they're not in a
 
01:59:41.629 --> 01:59:41.639 align:start position:0%
direct supervisory uh type of type of
 
01:59:43.550 --> 01:59:43.560 align:start position:0%
role the business is not to provide
 
01:59:45.229 --> 01:59:45.239 align:start position:0%
services to children to the general
 
01:59:47.629 --> 01:59:47.639 align:start position:0%
public so those sort of incidentally
 
01:59:51.649 --> 01:59:51.659 align:start position:0%
incidental type um encounters
 
01:59:54.109 --> 01:59:54.119 align:start position:0%
um I I agree we don't want to Bear to
 
01:59:55.370 --> 01:59:55.380 align:start position:0%
ban them
 
01:59:58.129 --> 01:59:58.139 align:start position:0%
and it it was argued that well gee whiz
 
01:59:59.629 --> 01:59:59.639 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:00:02.930 --> 02:00:02.940 align:start position:0%
you could you could have a a landscaping
 
02:00:06.169 --> 02:00:06.179 align:start position:0%
Crow of of three people and so perhaps
 
02:00:07.970 --> 02:00:07.980 align:start position:0%
one of them is a registered sex offender
 
02:00:10.070 --> 02:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps one's actually the the
 
02:00:13.070 --> 02:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
supervisor and then the third employee
 
02:00:15.350 --> 02:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
is a minor
 
02:00:18.649 --> 02:00:18.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:18.659 --> 02:00:21.169 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:00:21.169 --> 02:00:21.179 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:00:24.169 --> 02:00:24.179 align:start position:0%
until the supervising manager has to go
 
02:00:26.270 --> 02:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
somewhere else until they're called off
 
02:00:29.330 --> 02:00:29.340 align:start position:0%
that location and now the minor child is
 
02:00:31.609 --> 02:00:31.619 align:start position:0%
Left Behind on a job site with the
 
02:00:33.169 --> 02:00:33.179 align:start position:0%
registered sex offender at that point it
 
02:00:36.229 --> 02:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
becomes a problem so if if the trio has
 
02:00:38.810 --> 02:00:38.820 align:start position:0%
to be broken apart then then the the
 
02:00:41.450 --> 02:00:41.460 align:start position:0%
registered sex offender has to be the
 
02:00:43.430 --> 02:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
the third person out
 
02:00:45.589 --> 02:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
right The Miner has to go with the
 
02:00:47.570 --> 02:00:47.580 align:start position:0%
non-registered sex offender so that
 
02:00:49.550 --> 02:00:49.560 align:start position:0%
they're not left alone
 
02:00:51.589 --> 02:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
that's that's the thing we don't want
 
02:00:53.629 --> 02:00:53.639 align:start position:0%
them we don't want them alone with
 
02:00:55.010 --> 02:00:55.020 align:start position:0%
children because that's when you have
 
02:00:57.410 --> 02:00:57.420 align:start position:0%
these these opportunities
 
02:00:59.870 --> 02:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:01:02.450 --> 02:01:02.460 align:start position:0%
Representative no
 
02:01:04.430 --> 02:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:01:06.229 --> 02:01:06.239 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
02:01:06.239 --> 02:01:07.310 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

02:01:07.310 --> 02:01:07.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:01:08.750 --> 02:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm curious you know just looking
 
02:01:10.370 --> 02:01:10.380 align:start position:0%
through this one of the example cases
 
02:01:12.530 --> 02:01:12.540 align:start position:0%
that was handed out here and it says
 
02:01:14.689 --> 02:01:14.699 align:start position:0%
Edward Proctor of Deerfield was
 
02:01:17.030 --> 02:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
previously convicted of a sexual assault
 
02:01:19.129 --> 02:01:19.139 align:start position:0%
and at the time of his arrest in 2016
 
02:01:20.930 --> 02:01:20.940 align:start position:0%
was listed on the State Sex Offender
 
02:01:23.629 --> 02:01:23.639 align:start position:0%
Registry however he no longer appears on
 
02:01:26.570 --> 02:01:26.580 align:start position:0%
the list and that's I'm saying
 
02:01:29.689 --> 02:01:29.699 align:start position:0%
um is there a statute of limitations for
 
02:01:31.370 --> 02:01:31.380 align:start position:0%
how long you're on the sex offender list
 
02:01:33.830 --> 02:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
it seems like these cases are are fairly
 
02:01:36.649 --> 02:01:36.659 align:start position:0%
serious so I I'm just shocked to to hear
 
02:01:38.390 --> 02:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
that someone would not would no longer
 
02:01:39.470 --> 02:01:39.480 align:start position:0%
be on the list
 
02:01:42.350 --> 02:01:42.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so again I am
 
02:01:45.050 --> 02:01:45.060 align:start position:0%
not an expert on the sex offender
 
02:01:45.060 --> 02:01:47.149 align:start position:0%
not an expert on the sex offender
registry

02:01:47.149 --> 02:01:47.159 align:start position:0%
registry
 
02:01:49.250 --> 02:01:49.260 align:start position:0%
um and and happy not to be to be quite
 
02:01:49.260 --> 02:01:50.510 align:start position:0%
um and and happy not to be to be quite
Frank

02:01:50.510 --> 02:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
Frank
 
02:01:53.510 --> 02:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
I I don't know the circumstances as to
 
02:01:53.520 --> 02:01:54.410 align:start position:0%
I I don't know the circumstances as to
how

02:01:54.410 --> 02:01:54.420 align:start position:0%
how
 
02:01:56.750 --> 02:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
um that person came off the the registry
 
02:01:59.810 --> 02:01:59.820 align:start position:0%
my my understanding and you have to take
 
02:02:01.310 --> 02:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
it with a grain of salt I am not a
 
02:02:03.589 --> 02:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
lawyer I don't want to play a lawyer but
 
02:02:05.209 --> 02:02:05.219 align:start position:0%
my understanding is basically when
 
02:02:06.410 --> 02:02:06.420 align:start position:0%
you're put on the registry you're
 
02:02:08.689 --> 02:02:08.699 align:start position:0%
essentially put on for life and and
 
02:02:10.609 --> 02:02:10.619 align:start position:0%
there is some debate whether that's
 
02:02:12.589 --> 02:02:12.599 align:start position:0%
appropriate or not appropriate and if
 
02:02:15.050 --> 02:02:15.060 align:start position:0%
somebody wants to file legislation to to
 
02:02:16.669 --> 02:02:16.679 align:start position:0%
address those issues I I wouldn't
 
02:02:20.149 --> 02:02:20.159 align:start position:0%
discourage that from being considered
 
02:02:22.850 --> 02:02:22.860 align:start position:0%
my my guess is
 
02:02:25.669 --> 02:02:25.679 align:start position:0%
um there was probably some change in his
 
02:02:28.310 --> 02:02:28.320 align:start position:0%
status either either there was an appeal
 
02:02:30.350 --> 02:02:30.360 align:start position:0%
and it got overturned
 
02:02:32.330 --> 02:02:32.340 align:start position:0%
um and and that allowed for for him to
 
02:02:33.890 --> 02:02:33.900 align:start position:0%
come off the road I don't know I don't
 
02:02:35.570 --> 02:02:35.580 align:start position:0%
know the details
 
02:02:37.430 --> 02:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
um you know once that person's off the
 
02:02:39.050 --> 02:02:39.060 align:start position:0%
registry then they don't have to worry
 
02:02:41.530 --> 02:02:41.540 align:start position:0%
about any of this right it's it's it's
 
02:02:43.729 --> 02:02:43.739 align:start position:0%
only when they're on the registry and
 
02:02:45.890 --> 02:02:45.900 align:start position:0%
they they have they have a duty they
 
02:02:48.589 --> 02:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
have an obligation to notify potential
 
02:02:50.330 --> 02:02:50.340 align:start position:0%
employers right
 
02:02:53.870 --> 02:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
so that that nobody is is is caught in
 
02:02:55.850 --> 02:02:55.860 align:start position:0%
in arrears but that's
 
02:02:57.830 --> 02:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
we're just look
 
02:03:00.890 --> 02:03:00.900 align:start position:0%
I I won't lie to you my my intention is
 
02:03:03.709 --> 02:03:03.719 align:start position:0%
to protect children right that my
 
02:03:05.510 --> 02:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
constituent came to me and requested
 
02:03:07.370 --> 02:03:07.380 align:start position:0%
this and and when I looked into it I
 
02:03:08.689 --> 02:03:08.699 align:start position:0%
said yeah this this needs to be
 
02:03:11.510 --> 02:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
addressed and it was upon further review
 
02:03:13.669 --> 02:03:13.679 align:start position:0%
that I realized that this is protecting
 
02:03:16.189 --> 02:03:16.199 align:start position:0%
both sides right we are we are we are
 
02:03:18.290 --> 02:03:18.300 align:start position:0%
protecting potential victims from being
 
02:03:21.530 --> 02:03:21.540 align:start position:0%
victimized and we are protecting uh past
 
02:03:24.470 --> 02:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
offenders from reoffending by not
 
02:03:26.629 --> 02:03:26.639 align:start position:0%
putting them into a position where we're
 
02:03:29.629 --> 02:03:29.639 align:start position:0%
doing both groups a favor
 
02:03:32.510 --> 02:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
as for the employment opportunities you
 
02:03:35.510 --> 02:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
know we we are blessed
 
02:03:37.609 --> 02:03:37.619 align:start position:0%
that we live in New Hampshire because we
 
02:03:41.390 --> 02:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
have a very very resilient job market we
 
02:03:43.790 --> 02:03:43.800 align:start position:0%
typically have one of the lowest if not
 
02:03:46.490 --> 02:03:46.500 align:start position:0%
the lowest unemployment rates in the
 
02:03:46.500 --> 02:03:47.629 align:start position:0%
the lowest unemployment rates in the
nation

02:03:47.629 --> 02:03:47.639 align:start position:0%
nation
 
02:03:49.310 --> 02:03:49.320 align:start position:0%
I'm old enough to have lived through the
 
02:03:52.250 --> 02:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
recession of the 1980s and we had a lot
 
02:03:55.310 --> 02:03:55.320 align:start position:0%
of economy in a few baskets and it hit
 
02:03:58.669 --> 02:03:58.679 align:start position:0%
and it hurt and New Hampshire went to
 
02:04:01.129 --> 02:04:01.139 align:start position:0%
Great Lengths to diversify our economy
 
02:04:03.350 --> 02:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
so the next downturn didn't take
 
02:04:04.970 --> 02:04:04.980 align:start position:0%
everything down with it and that's a
 
02:04:07.250 --> 02:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
success story for New Hampshire and so
 
02:04:09.410 --> 02:04:09.420 align:start position:0%
there are plenty of job opportunities
 
02:04:11.570 --> 02:04:11.580 align:start position:0%
for these people other than directly
 
02:04:13.790 --> 02:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
supervising directly working with minor
 
02:04:16.490 --> 02:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
children I I don't and we can all make
 
02:04:18.890 --> 02:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
our own decisions on this for sure but I
 
02:04:21.470 --> 02:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
don't see this bill this closing of a
 
02:04:23.689 --> 02:04:23.699 align:start position:0%
loophole being overly burdensome on
 
02:04:23.699 --> 02:04:25.129 align:start position:0%
loophole being overly burdensome on
anybody

02:04:25.129 --> 02:04:25.139 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
02:04:28.490 --> 02:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:30.709 --> 02:04:30.719 align:start position:0%
I just would like to take a moment and
 
02:04:32.629 --> 02:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
point out to the committee that there is
 
02:04:35.089 --> 02:04:35.099 align:start position:0%
a statute for registered sex offenders
 
02:04:37.129 --> 02:04:37.139 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is it depends on
 
02:04:40.070 --> 02:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
the time of the sentencing uh whenever
 
02:04:41.570 --> 02:04:41.580 align:start position:0%
our researcher comes back in I could ask
 
02:04:43.550 --> 02:04:43.560 align:start position:0%
him to look that up for us or if
 
02:04:45.290 --> 02:04:45.300 align:start position:0%
somebody has a computer out and would
 
02:04:46.970 --> 02:04:46.980 align:start position:0%
like to but I do know that they answer
 
02:04:48.169 --> 02:04:48.179 align:start position:0%
the question has been going around there
 
02:04:50.050 --> 02:04:50.060 align:start position:0%
that there is a statute for that
 
02:04:51.709 --> 02:04:51.719 align:start position:0%
representative Boulder you have another
 
02:04:51.719 --> 02:04:57.649 align:start position:0%
representative Boulder you have another
question

02:04:57.649 --> 02:04:57.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:00.050 --> 02:05:00.060 align:start position:0%
I was hoping to figure out and maybe
 
02:05:01.609 --> 02:05:01.619 align:start position:0%
there's something Fred
 
02:05:03.649 --> 02:05:03.659 align:start position:0%
can do and I could just email Brad and
 
02:05:05.270 --> 02:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
ask him and I guess he can like send the
 
02:05:07.070 --> 02:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
answer to everyone but to understand if
 
02:05:09.050 --> 02:05:09.060 align:start position:0%
there's different levels of registering
 
02:05:10.430 --> 02:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
on the sex offender registry and if
 
02:05:11.629 --> 02:05:11.639 align:start position:0%
there's a difference between is that
 
02:05:12.890 --> 02:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
what you were saying yeah that's exactly
 
02:05:14.149 --> 02:05:14.159 align:start position:0%
what I was saying okay when he comes
 
02:05:17.149 --> 02:05:17.159 align:start position:0%
back and if there's a way to
 
02:05:17.159 --> 02:05:18.830 align:start position:0%
back and if there's a way to
to

02:05:18.830 --> 02:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:05:18.840 --> 02:05:19.810 align:start position:0%
to
um

02:05:19.810 --> 02:05:19.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:23.209 --> 02:05:23.219 align:start position:0%
differentiate between sex offenses as it
 
02:05:26.450 --> 02:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
relates to this bill also thanks yep
 
02:05:29.390 --> 02:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
when when our researcher uh returns I'll
 
02:05:30.649 --> 02:05:30.659 align:start position:0%
certainly ask him to that and send the
 
02:05:31.790 --> 02:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
information to all the committee because
 
02:05:33.229 --> 02:05:33.239 align:start position:0%
it seems like we all a lot of us have
 
02:05:34.910 --> 02:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
the same question are there any other
 
02:05:36.050 --> 02:05:36.060 align:start position:0%
questions for the representative
 
02:05:38.270 --> 02:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
02:05:38.280 --> 02:05:39.890 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
foreign

02:05:39.890 --> 02:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:05:42.109 --> 02:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
I have a question I don't know if you're
 
02:05:44.930 --> 02:05:44.940 align:start position:0%
aware of uh representative Lynn has sent
 
02:05:48.290 --> 02:05:48.300 align:start position:0%
email around that suggested a change to
 
02:05:51.290 --> 02:05:51.300 align:start position:0%
this and he gave an example about a
 
02:05:51.300 --> 02:05:52.850 align:start position:0%
this and he gave an example about a
child

02:05:52.850 --> 02:05:52.860 align:start position:0%
child
 
02:05:55.910 --> 02:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
that may get director Services which I
 
02:05:58.070 --> 02:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
think would be probably an extreme case
 
02:06:00.890 --> 02:06:00.900 align:start position:0%
but in Market Basket where the child
 
02:06:02.870 --> 02:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
might come up and buy something a minor
 
02:06:06.350 --> 02:06:06.360 align:start position:0%
might might do that and I I so I read
 
02:06:08.330 --> 02:06:08.340 align:start position:0%
the bill and it says Direct Services to
 
02:06:09.830 --> 02:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
to minors
 
02:06:12.410 --> 02:06:12.420 align:start position:0%
and I'm just wondering if that's an
 
02:06:15.290 --> 02:06:15.300 align:start position:0%
inclusive or exclusive enough
 
02:06:19.310 --> 02:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
that the language and the bill would not
 
02:06:22.850 --> 02:06:22.860 align:start position:0%
affect that kind of situation
 
02:06:23.810 --> 02:06:23.820 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:06:25.850 --> 02:06:25.860 align:start position:0%
representative I I appreciate it we've
 
02:06:29.089 --> 02:06:29.099 align:start position:0%
gone around on this quite a bit and
 
02:06:31.609 --> 02:06:31.619 align:start position:0%
um you know the prosecutors the state
 
02:06:34.790 --> 02:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
police the the victims Advocates the the
 
02:06:36.709 --> 02:06:36.719 align:start position:0%
offenders Advocates
 
02:06:38.930 --> 02:06:38.940 align:start position:0%
um were certainly not uncomfortable with
 
02:06:40.370 --> 02:06:40.380 align:start position:0%
this language when we did the
 
02:06:40.380 --> 02:06:41.689 align:start position:0%
this language when we did the
subcommittee

02:06:41.689 --> 02:06:41.699 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
02:06:43.669 --> 02:06:43.679 align:start position:0%
um I understand that representative Lynn
 
02:06:46.430 --> 02:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
has that as a concern
 
02:06:48.470 --> 02:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
um I I don't I think the interpretation
 
02:06:51.350 --> 02:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
of Direct Services is when that is the
 
02:06:53.450 --> 02:06:53.460 align:start position:0%
purpose of the business is to provide
 
02:06:56.330 --> 02:06:56.340 align:start position:0%
Direct Services an example would be a
 
02:06:58.430 --> 02:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
private school that that is a business
 
02:07:01.310 --> 02:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
that provides Direct Services to minor
 
02:07:03.290 --> 02:07:03.300 align:start position:0%
children and
 
02:07:05.570 --> 02:07:05.580 align:start position:0%
um you know that's already prohibited in
 
02:07:09.109 --> 02:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
other parts of of Statute right so
 
02:07:09.119 --> 02:07:10.070 align:start position:0%
other parts of of Statute right so
um

02:07:10.070 --> 02:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:16.850 --> 02:07:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:19.609 --> 02:07:19.619 align:start position:0%
I don't believe
 
02:07:22.430 --> 02:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
that if I'm working at a grocery store I
 
02:07:23.750 --> 02:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
hate to use brand names right because
 
02:07:26.270 --> 02:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
because they have they have competition
 
02:07:29.810 --> 02:07:29.820 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm I'm a registered sex offender
 
02:07:32.209 --> 02:07:32.219 align:start position:0%
I'm working at a grocery store
 
02:07:36.169 --> 02:07:36.179 align:start position:0%
and I manage the bread aisle
 
02:07:38.810 --> 02:07:38.820 align:start position:0%
and a child comes down the aisle because
 
02:07:41.450 --> 02:07:41.460 align:start position:0%
the parent sent them off go get English
 
02:07:41.460 --> 02:07:42.709 align:start position:0%
the parent sent them off go get English
muffins

02:07:42.709 --> 02:07:42.719 align:start position:0%
muffins
 
02:07:45.830 --> 02:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
and the child is looking and can't find
 
02:07:47.209 --> 02:07:47.219 align:start position:0%
English muffins
 
02:07:49.790 --> 02:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
sees me in a store clerk uniform and
 
02:07:52.970 --> 02:07:52.980 align:start position:0%
says excuse me sir where can I find the
 
02:07:55.010 --> 02:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
English muffins and I say the English
 
02:07:57.530 --> 02:07:57.540 align:start position:0%
muffins are there
 
02:07:59.629 --> 02:07:59.639 align:start position:0%
right that did I provide a direct
 
02:08:02.810 --> 02:08:02.820 align:start position:0%
service yeah I gave him location of the
 
02:08:04.250 --> 02:08:04.260 align:start position:0%
English muffins
 
02:08:07.310 --> 02:08:07.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not in a supervisory role I'm not in
 
02:08:09.770 --> 02:08:09.780 align:start position:0%
a managerial role over that person has
 
02:08:11.030 --> 02:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
an appointment this is a this is an
 
02:08:13.070 --> 02:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
employee thing so so that's a that's a
 
02:08:15.410 --> 02:08:15.420 align:start position:0%
customer so I don't I don't think that
 
02:08:17.450 --> 02:08:17.460 align:start position:0%
that fits the the definition
 
02:08:20.209 --> 02:08:20.219 align:start position:0%
now I again I'm not a lawyer you know
 
02:08:22.550 --> 02:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
can somebody drag it out that that far
 
02:08:25.609 --> 02:08:25.619 align:start position:0%
you know maybe so and so let the
 
02:08:28.010 --> 02:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
employer decide what position they want
 
02:08:29.750 --> 02:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
that that person to have you know
 
02:08:31.790 --> 02:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of jobs that aren't
 
02:08:34.370 --> 02:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
customer facing in most of these
 
02:08:36.530 --> 02:08:36.540 align:start position:0%
businesses that these people could could
 
02:08:40.550 --> 02:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
fill so if we're going to air in any
 
02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:42.229 align:start position:0%
fill so if we're going to air in any
direction

02:08:42.229 --> 02:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
direction
 
02:08:44.930 --> 02:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
I would suggest it's our duty our
 
02:08:47.450 --> 02:08:47.460 align:start position:0%
responsibility to err on the side of
 
02:08:47.460 --> 02:08:49.450 align:start position:0%
responsibility to err on the side of
caution

02:08:49.450 --> 02:08:49.460 align:start position:0%
caution
 
02:08:53.510 --> 02:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
instead of airing on on the side of of
 
02:08:57.410 --> 02:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
some minuscule chance of a what if I'll
 
02:08:59.689 --> 02:08:59.699 align:start position:0%
flush it out further if if if he'll
 
02:09:02.209 --> 02:09:02.219 align:start position:0%
indulge me
 
02:09:04.669 --> 02:09:04.679 align:start position:0%
so I'm the parent that just sent the
 
02:09:08.750 --> 02:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
child to me to find the English muffins
 
02:09:08.760 --> 02:09:09.890 align:start position:0%
child to me to find the English muffins
right

02:09:09.890 --> 02:09:09.900 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:09:11.930 --> 02:09:11.940 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:09:14.870 --> 02:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
how am I going to know
 
02:09:17.750 --> 02:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
that the bread clerk is a registered sex
 
02:09:20.330 --> 02:09:20.340 align:start position:0%
offender and then file some sort of
 
02:09:22.790 --> 02:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
complaint on a one-time interaction like
 
02:09:22.800 --> 02:09:23.570 align:start position:0%
complaint on a one-time interaction like
that

02:09:23.570 --> 02:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:09:26.810 --> 02:09:26.820 align:start position:0%
I I think I don't believe that that's I
 
02:09:29.089 --> 02:09:29.099 align:start position:0%
don't believe that's reasonable to think
 
02:09:30.589 --> 02:09:30.599 align:start position:0%
that that would
 
02:09:32.209 --> 02:09:32.219 align:start position:0%
um that that would occur
 
02:09:34.490 --> 02:09:34.500 align:start position:0%
in fact I would go a step further and
 
02:09:36.770 --> 02:09:36.780 align:start position:0%
say I don't have children
 
02:09:38.870 --> 02:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
and I know I'm a registered sex offender
 
02:09:41.750 --> 02:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
and I see myself working in a in a store
 
02:09:43.790 --> 02:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
I could tell the story you know that
 
02:09:46.490 --> 02:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
person is on the registered sex offender
 
02:09:48.050 --> 02:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
list and you have them working in a job
 
02:09:49.490 --> 02:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
where they're near children and you
 
02:09:51.109 --> 02:09:51.119 align:start position:0%
should you should consider doing some
 
02:09:53.689 --> 02:09:53.699 align:start position:0%
due diligence around that my my gut
 
02:09:55.729 --> 02:09:55.739 align:start position:0%
tells me any employer that was notified
 
02:09:57.410 --> 02:09:57.420 align:start position:0%
of of that
 
02:09:59.810 --> 02:09:59.820 align:start position:0%
um would take that seriously and and
 
02:10:01.910 --> 02:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
take some some corrective actions there
 
02:10:03.709 --> 02:10:03.719 align:start position:0%
it's it's hypothetical but you're asking
 
02:10:07.310 --> 02:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
a hypothetical so no I I don't
 
02:10:10.070 --> 02:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
a business providing Direct Services to
 
02:10:10.080 --> 02:10:11.089 align:start position:0%
a business providing Direct Services to
minors

02:10:11.089 --> 02:10:11.099 align:start position:0%
minors
 
02:10:13.550 --> 02:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
a business providing Direct Services to
 
02:10:15.410 --> 02:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
minors I don't believe a grocery store
 
02:10:17.810 --> 02:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
provides Direct Services to minors I
 
02:10:20.689 --> 02:10:20.699 align:start position:0%
don't I don't believe that the clerk at
 
02:10:23.450 --> 02:10:23.460 align:start position:0%
a local convenience store that is
 
02:10:25.669 --> 02:10:25.679 align:start position:0%
selling items to to Children before or
 
02:10:27.890 --> 02:10:27.900 align:start position:0%
after school is providing Direct
 
02:10:30.470 --> 02:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
Services I mean you're selling Goods but
 
02:10:32.870 --> 02:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
I I don't I don't believe that that's
 
02:10:36.350 --> 02:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:39.290 --> 02:10:39.300 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative Newman
 
02:10:41.450 --> 02:10:41.460 align:start position:0%
I probably should not have mentioned the
 
02:10:44.030 --> 02:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
public business I probably should be
 
02:10:47.470 --> 02:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
more generic I don't have any uh
 
02:10:50.089 --> 02:10:50.099 align:start position:0%
any I don't oppose anything that you
 
02:10:51.470 --> 02:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
said I agree with everything that you've
 
02:10:52.910 --> 02:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
said about that it was a hypothetical
 
02:10:54.410 --> 02:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
one and maybe an extreme one I only
 
02:10:56.209 --> 02:10:56.219 align:start position:0%
asked the question for
 
02:10:58.430 --> 02:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
to find out I'm not a lawyer just to
 
02:10:59.810 --> 02:10:59.820 align:start position:0%
clarify the language and what your
 
02:11:02.089 --> 02:11:02.099 align:start position:0%
opinion was and I appreciate your answer
 
02:11:04.669 --> 02:11:04.679 align:start position:0%
my question is and this is just because
 
02:11:07.129 --> 02:11:07.139 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of a geeky kind of person is do
 
02:11:08.870 --> 02:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
you in the law is there and maybe
 
02:11:10.430 --> 02:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
someone else can answer this question in
 
02:11:12.470 --> 02:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
the law is there or in New Hampshire law
 
02:11:16.070 --> 02:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
is there any actual definition in any of
 
02:11:19.490 --> 02:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
the statutes that describes the term
 
02:11:22.070 --> 02:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
um provides Direct Services to minors uh
 
02:11:23.570 --> 02:11:23.580 align:start position:0%
you I don't know whether you know that
 
02:11:25.490 --> 02:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
or not but I'd just be curious thank you
 
02:11:27.109 --> 02:11:27.119 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
02:11:28.850 --> 02:11:28.860 align:start position:0%
representative it's it's actually an
 
02:11:30.530 --> 02:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
excellent question
 
02:11:32.570 --> 02:11:32.580 align:start position:0%
um I do not know where that it would be
 
02:11:36.229 --> 02:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
defined um in in RSA
 
02:11:38.089 --> 02:11:38.099 align:start position:0%
but again
 
02:11:41.030 --> 02:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
I will loop back to my position that if
 
02:11:43.609 --> 02:11:43.619 align:start position:0%
we are going to air we should err on the
 
02:11:45.709 --> 02:11:45.719 align:start position:0%
side of caution we should err on the
 
02:11:47.629 --> 02:11:47.639 align:start position:0%
side of protecting children and we
 
02:11:49.970 --> 02:11:49.980 align:start position:0%
should err on the side of preventing
 
02:11:53.990 --> 02:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
opportunities for people to commit again
 
02:11:57.470 --> 02:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative just to clarify
 
02:12:00.649 --> 02:12:00.659 align:start position:0%
you are saying that if a person owns an
 
02:12:00.659 --> 02:12:02.030 align:start position:0%
you are saying that if a person owns an
arcade

02:12:02.030 --> 02:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
arcade
 
02:12:04.310 --> 02:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
and a person comes in and applies for a
 
02:12:07.669 --> 02:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
job that is a knowing registered sex
 
02:12:07.679 --> 02:12:09.050 align:start position:0%
job that is a knowing registered sex
offender

02:12:09.050 --> 02:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
offender
 
02:12:11.209 --> 02:12:11.219 align:start position:0%
that that would be a perfect example of
 
02:12:12.470 --> 02:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
a place that that
 
02:12:14.689 --> 02:12:14.699 align:start position:0%
sex offender should not be seeking
 
02:12:14.699 --> 02:12:20.510 align:start position:0%
sex offender should not be seeking
employment

02:12:20.510 --> 02:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:23.089 --> 02:12:23.099 align:start position:0%
no I don't I don't believe that that
 
02:12:27.950 --> 02:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
statement as made is correct so I get
 
02:12:30.169 --> 02:12:30.179 align:start position:0%
people get mad at me because they say
 
02:12:33.950 --> 02:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
I'm too specific on language so I own an
 
02:12:36.109 --> 02:12:36.119 align:start position:0%
arcade registered sex offender comes in
 
02:12:38.330 --> 02:12:38.340 align:start position:0%
applies for work are they prohibited
 
02:12:40.070 --> 02:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
from working there I would say no they
 
02:12:43.609 --> 02:12:43.619 align:start position:0%
are not they they should not be managing
 
02:12:45.950 --> 02:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
other employees that are minors under
 
02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:47.629 align:start position:0%
other employees that are minors under
them

02:12:47.629 --> 02:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:12:50.149 --> 02:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
um if if I owned a business like that
 
02:12:52.250 --> 02:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
because there were all are already
 
02:12:52.260 --> 02:12:53.569 align:start position:0%
because there were all are already
certain

02:12:53.569 --> 02:12:53.579 align:start position:0%
certain
 
02:12:53.579 --> 02:12:54.229 align:start position:0%
certain
um

02:12:54.229 --> 02:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:57.589 --> 02:12:57.599 align:start position:0%
prescriptions in law that would not be a
 
02:12:59.569 --> 02:12:59.579 align:start position:0%
good candidate if my arcade is
 
02:13:01.430 --> 02:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
frequented by children which we all know
 
02:13:04.129 --> 02:13:04.139 align:start position:0%
they are it it's
 
02:13:06.050 --> 02:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
so it goes back to the carnival ride
 
02:13:08.390 --> 02:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
operator can I work for the carnival
 
02:13:11.750 --> 02:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
ride company yes I can I can set rides
 
02:13:14.390 --> 02:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
up I can break rides down I can clean
 
02:13:18.350 --> 02:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
rides at night I should not be helping
 
02:13:21.709 --> 02:13:21.719 align:start position:0%
children on and off rides on a
 
02:13:24.470 --> 02:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
repetitive basis so is there a job at
 
02:13:26.330 --> 02:13:26.340 align:start position:0%
the at the arcade for a registered sex
 
02:13:28.430 --> 02:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
offender sweeping the floors after the
 
02:13:30.410 --> 02:13:30.420 align:start position:0%
children are gone absolutely things like
 
02:13:31.510 --> 02:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
that sure
 
02:13:33.709 --> 02:13:33.719 align:start position:0%
any employer
 
02:13:36.530 --> 02:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
that's hiring registered sex offenders
 
02:13:38.569 --> 02:13:38.579 align:start position:0%
that are going to be
 
02:13:40.850 --> 02:13:40.860 align:start position:0%
doing that kind of work I think I don't
 
02:13:43.010 --> 02:13:43.020 align:start position:0%
think they would do that if I would
 
02:13:43.020 --> 02:13:43.850 align:start position:0%
think they would do that if I would
think

02:13:43.850 --> 02:13:43.860 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:13:45.950 --> 02:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
it's actually clear did a great job of
 
02:13:47.510 --> 02:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
clarifying that thank you very much are
 
02:13:53.030 --> 02:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:58.189 --> 02:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:59.510 --> 02:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
is that a question
 
02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:01.810 align:start position:0%
is that a question
yeah

02:14:01.810 --> 02:14:01.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:05.270 --> 02:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
isn't that a loophole that yes they can
 
02:14:07.069 --> 02:14:07.079 align:start position:0%
come work for that it's supposed to work
 
02:14:09.830 --> 02:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
sweep the floors but now they're short
 
02:14:12.229 --> 02:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
one day and he's out on the floor
 
02:14:14.390 --> 02:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
the the short one day shouldn't simply
 
02:14:15.890 --> 02:14:15.900 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be allowed so it goes back to
 
02:14:17.510 --> 02:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
the landscaper so I have a registered
 
02:14:20.209 --> 02:14:20.219 align:start position:0%
sex offender that's on a landscaping on
 
02:14:21.709 --> 02:14:21.719 align:start position:0%
a landscaping team he can't be the
 
02:14:23.750 --> 02:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
manager he can't be the supervisor of
 
02:14:25.729 --> 02:14:25.739 align:start position:0%
the minor that's that's what we're
 
02:14:25.739 --> 02:14:28.669 align:start position:0%
the minor that's that's what we're
disallowing

02:14:28.669 --> 02:14:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:30.589 --> 02:14:30.599 align:start position:0%
that's and I apologies thank you for the
 
02:14:30.599 --> 02:14:31.609 align:start position:0%
that's and I apologies thank you for the
question

02:14:31.609 --> 02:14:31.619 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:14:34.550 --> 02:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
representative scitec
 
02:14:38.629 --> 02:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
I see in the present law which I think
 
02:14:43.010 --> 02:14:43.020 align:start position:0%
I see in the present law not limited to
 
02:14:44.810 --> 02:14:44.820 align:start position:0%
uh involving the care instruction
 
02:14:47.330 --> 02:14:47.340 align:start position:0%
Guidance the language that struck out
 
02:14:49.250 --> 02:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
but not limited to
 
02:14:51.709 --> 02:14:51.719 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me that the court has
 
02:14:53.870 --> 02:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
tried to balance
 
02:14:57.709 --> 02:14:57.719 align:start position:0%
uh competing rights here uh I don't see
 
02:14:59.990 --> 02:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
why the president law isn't working your
 
02:15:02.390 --> 02:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
constituent's unhappy but these are
 
02:15:05.030 --> 02:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
aren't egregious examples I'm reading
 
02:15:06.470 --> 02:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
here it seems like the court has
 
02:15:06.480 --> 02:15:07.970 align:start position:0%
here it seems like the court has
balanced

02:15:07.970 --> 02:15:07.980 align:start position:0%
balanced
 
02:15:07.980 --> 02:15:08.930 align:start position:0%
balanced
um

02:15:08.930 --> 02:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:10.790 --> 02:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that's quite a question
 
02:15:14.569 --> 02:15:14.579 align:start position:0%
but what's wrong with the present law
 
02:15:16.790 --> 02:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative that is an
 
02:15:19.250 --> 02:15:19.260 align:start position:0%
excellent question and I apologize if I
 
02:15:21.229 --> 02:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
if I have not made the answer to that
 
02:15:21.239 --> 02:15:23.870 align:start position:0%
if I have not made the answer to that
clear

02:15:23.870 --> 02:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
clear
 
02:15:27.530 --> 02:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
first of all where we're striking out
 
02:15:30.410 --> 02:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
the examples uh because they're they're
 
02:15:30.420 --> 02:15:31.910 align:start position:0%
the examples uh because they're they're
often

02:15:31.910 --> 02:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
often
 
02:15:34.430 --> 02:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
um used to narrow focus and we don't
 
02:15:36.709 --> 02:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
want a narrow Focus
 
02:15:39.589 --> 02:15:39.599 align:start position:0%
the problem with the current law
 
02:15:41.930 --> 02:15:41.940 align:start position:0%
is it puts minors
 
02:15:44.510 --> 02:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
under direct supervision under direct
 
02:15:44.520 --> 02:15:46.370 align:start position:0%
under direct supervision under direct
management

02:15:46.370 --> 02:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
management
 
02:15:48.709 --> 02:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
right direct supervision or oversight of
 
02:15:48.719 --> 02:15:50.270 align:start position:0%
right direct supervision or oversight of
minors

02:15:50.270 --> 02:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
minors
 
02:15:52.129 --> 02:15:52.139 align:start position:0%
you're putting them in close proximity
 
02:15:53.510 --> 02:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
so you're putting a registered sex
 
02:15:56.270 --> 02:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
offender and a minor together
 
02:15:57.890 --> 02:15:57.900 align:start position:0%
I used to be
 
02:15:59.750 --> 02:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
a school teacher
 
02:16:02.629 --> 02:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
and every school teacher job I ever had
 
02:16:04.490 --> 02:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
and I only had a handful but I had a
 
02:16:06.290 --> 02:16:06.300 align:start position:0%
handful every
 
02:16:09.350 --> 02:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
teaching job I had I had to pass a
 
02:16:11.390 --> 02:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
criminal background check
 
02:16:13.310 --> 02:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
do you know why we have criminal
 
02:16:16.370 --> 02:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
background checks for teachers I know
 
02:16:18.109 --> 02:16:18.119 align:start position:0%
you do because I know you're a former
 
02:16:20.750 --> 02:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
educator as well and we
 
02:16:25.910 --> 02:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:28.310 --> 02:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
we do that because we don't want
 
02:16:30.950 --> 02:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
registered sex offenders or or people
 
02:16:32.270 --> 02:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
with with
 
02:16:34.790 --> 02:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
bad criminal backgrounds working in
 
02:16:37.790 --> 02:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
schools with children we do that to
 
02:16:40.910 --> 02:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
protect the children in that case we do
 
02:16:44.570 --> 02:16:44.580 align:start position:0%
not do that to to protect the the person
 
02:16:47.450 --> 02:16:47.460 align:start position:0%
seeking employment we do it to protect
 
02:16:48.889 --> 02:16:48.899 align:start position:0%
the children
 
02:16:50.030 --> 02:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:16:52.429 --> 02:16:52.439 align:start position:0%
why do you rob banks
 
02:16:54.830 --> 02:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
because that's where the money is
 
02:16:58.129 --> 02:16:58.139 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
02:17:02.450 --> 02:17:02.460 align:start position:0%
this is to protect children beyond the
 
02:17:04.730 --> 02:17:04.740 align:start position:0%
schoolhouse setting if it's good enough
 
02:17:06.889 --> 02:17:06.899 align:start position:0%
for a public school
 
02:17:11.509 --> 02:17:11.519 align:start position:0%
it's good enough for children everywhere
 
02:17:14.209 --> 02:17:14.219 align:start position:0%
I mean I guess the question is
 
02:17:18.410 --> 02:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
what closing the loop what is the damage
 
02:17:20.450 --> 02:17:20.460 align:start position:0%
what is the damage of closing this
 
02:17:20.460 --> 02:17:21.530 align:start position:0%
what is the damage of closing this
loophole

02:17:21.530 --> 02:17:21.540 align:start position:0%
loophole
 
02:17:23.690 --> 02:17:23.700 align:start position:0%
it's a rhetorical question answer it
 
02:17:26.690 --> 02:17:26.700 align:start position:0%
your own way in your own head
 
02:17:30.950 --> 02:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:34.969 --> 02:17:34.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:34.979 --> 02:17:36.290 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:17:36.290 --> 02:17:36.300 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:17:39.770 --> 02:17:39.780 align:start position:0%
so most of us are probably parents
 
02:17:42.230 --> 02:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
and if we're not I would assume we love
 
02:17:44.389 --> 02:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
and cherish children
 
02:17:46.669 --> 02:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
what is the damage if we don't close the
 
02:17:46.679 --> 02:17:48.830 align:start position:0%
what is the damage if we don't close the
loophole

02:17:48.830 --> 02:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
loophole
 
02:17:51.650 --> 02:17:51.660 align:start position:0%
that damage the damage of not close at
 
02:17:53.750 --> 02:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
the potential damage of not closing the
 
02:17:57.650 --> 02:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
loophole in my opinion is far greater
 
02:18:01.549 --> 02:18:01.559 align:start position:0%
than any any protection or any lack of
 
02:18:03.650 --> 02:18:03.660 align:start position:0%
damage on on the other side of the
 
02:18:03.660 --> 02:18:05.270 align:start position:0%
damage on on the other side of the
Ledger

02:18:05.270 --> 02:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
Ledger
 
02:18:07.310 --> 02:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
in my opinion this is a loophole that
 
02:18:10.190 --> 02:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
needs to be closed the house is voted in
 
02:18:13.849 --> 02:18:13.859 align:start position:0%
favor of this legislation twice before
 
02:18:15.910 --> 02:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
first time it died in an ominous Bill
 
02:18:18.049 --> 02:18:18.059 align:start position:0%
Omnibus Bill
 
02:18:20.030 --> 02:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
I guess both are correct
 
02:18:20.040 --> 02:18:21.589 align:start position:0%
I guess both are correct
um

02:18:21.589 --> 02:18:21.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:25.849 --> 02:18:25.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:27.770 --> 02:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
people are a little nervous this might
 
02:18:30.169 --> 02:18:30.179 align:start position:0%
be too too constricting
 
02:18:32.570 --> 02:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
and it's my colleague from the house who
 
02:18:34.490 --> 02:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
we've referred to earlier
 
02:18:36.950 --> 02:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
and it and it got interim studied in the
 
02:18:38.270 --> 02:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
Senate and the Senate hasn't done
 
02:18:38.280 --> 02:18:39.169 align:start position:0%
Senate and the Senate hasn't done
anything

02:18:39.169 --> 02:18:39.179 align:start position:0%
anything
 
02:18:41.089 --> 02:18:41.099 align:start position:0%
we've passed it twice we should pass it
 
02:18:43.429 --> 02:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
a third time we should bring it to the
 
02:18:45.530 --> 02:18:45.540 align:start position:0%
other body we should get this pass we
 
02:18:47.030 --> 02:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
should close this loophole and we should
 
02:18:48.589 --> 02:18:48.599 align:start position:0%
protect New Hampshire children that's
 
02:18:50.810 --> 02:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
what we should do that's that's my
 
02:18:53.870 --> 02:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:56.209 --> 02:18:56.219 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I believe that
 
02:18:59.030 --> 02:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
we have asked the representative I think
 
02:19:01.429 --> 02:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
that we're going to move on from here uh
 
02:19:03.349 --> 02:19:03.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative for
 
02:19:06.589 --> 02:19:06.599 align:start position:0%
your presentation Mr Greenland while you
 
02:19:09.110 --> 02:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
are out we have some questions we were
 
02:19:11.150 --> 02:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
hoping that you could help us with
 
02:19:15.650 --> 02:19:15.660 align:start position:0%
um we have some questions around the
 
02:19:20.629 --> 02:19:20.639 align:start position:0%
the sex offender registry and how long a
 
02:19:22.790 --> 02:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
person would would be put on there and
 
02:19:24.349 --> 02:19:24.359 align:start position:0%
our understanding is you know it kind of
 
02:19:25.790 --> 02:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
goes with it whenever they're sentenced
 
02:19:28.910 --> 02:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
would you be able to get us some some
 
02:19:30.889 --> 02:19:30.899 align:start position:0%
facts on the
 
02:19:33.110 --> 02:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
the registry for sex offenders and send
 
02:19:35.330 --> 02:19:35.340 align:start position:0%

of Corrections is neutral on HB 107.
 
02:20:21.349 --> 02:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
as the largest Rehabilitation treatment
 
02:20:23.210 --> 02:20:23.220 align:start position:0%
provider for sexual offenders in the
 
02:20:25.070 --> 02:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire the Department of
 
02:20:27.349 --> 02:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
Corrections supports legislation to
 
02:20:29.150 --> 02:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
safeguard individuals and families
 
02:20:31.969 --> 02:20:31.979 align:start position:0%
living in our community
 
02:20:34.610 --> 02:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
we want to do all that we can to protect
 
02:20:36.530 --> 02:20:36.540 align:start position:0%
our children and keep them from falling
 
02:20:38.510 --> 02:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
victim to those who do them harm
 
02:20:40.790 --> 02:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
while HB 107 has the greatest of
 
02:20:42.349 --> 02:20:42.359 align:start position:0%
intentions we ask the committee to
 
02:20:43.730 --> 02:20:43.740 align:start position:0%
consider the use of more specific
 
02:20:46.010 --> 02:20:46.020 align:start position:0%
language in regard to providing Direct
 
02:20:48.290 --> 02:20:48.300 align:start position:0%
Services to minors or supervision or
 
02:20:50.090 --> 02:20:50.100 align:start position:0%
oversight of minors
 
02:20:52.010 --> 02:20:52.020 align:start position:0%
as a department our goal is to assist
 
02:20:54.110 --> 02:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
those who are incarcerated in their
 
02:20:56.270 --> 02:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
successful and safe re-entry into the
 
02:20:58.309 --> 02:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
community this includes transitioning
 
02:21:00.050 --> 02:21:00.060 align:start position:0%
individuals who have been convicted of
 
02:21:01.610 --> 02:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
sexual offenses
 
02:21:04.490 --> 02:21:04.500 align:start position:0%
the broad language in HB 107 could have
 
02:21:06.590 --> 02:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence of restricting
 
02:21:08.389 --> 02:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
employment options for a group of people
 
02:21:10.730 --> 02:21:10.740 align:start position:0%
already at a disadvantage when entering
 
02:21:12.110 --> 02:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
the workforce
 
02:21:15.770 --> 02:21:15.780 align:start position:0%
many individuals enter fields of retail
 
02:21:17.570 --> 02:21:17.580 align:start position:0%
or Food Service upon their release from
 
02:21:17.580 --> 02:21:19.010 align:start position:0%
or Food Service upon their release from
incarceration

02:21:19.010 --> 02:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
incarceration
 
02:21:22.250 --> 02:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
this bill will this bill prevent them
 
02:21:23.870 --> 02:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
from working in industries that sell
 
02:21:25.910 --> 02:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
their products to minors or who serve
 
02:21:28.610 --> 02:21:28.620 align:start position:0%
food to minors will this prevent
 
02:21:30.770 --> 02:21:30.780 align:start position:0%
a sexual offender from becoming a shift
 
02:21:32.469 --> 02:21:32.479 align:start position:0%
supervisor at a fast food restaurant
 
02:21:34.550 --> 02:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
because they would be providing direct
 
02:21:36.650 --> 02:21:36.660 align:start position:0%
supervision to minors
 
02:21:37.730 --> 02:21:37.740 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of
 
02:21:39.889 --> 02:21:39.899 align:start position:0%
Corrections agrees with the existing
 
02:21:42.830 --> 02:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
risk restrictions listed in current law
 
02:21:45.110 --> 02:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
and even go a step further to include
 
02:21:47.690 --> 02:21:47.700 align:start position:0%
others such as school bus driver or
 
02:21:49.490 --> 02:21:49.500 align:start position:0%
employment at a business whose primary
 
02:21:51.410 --> 02:21:51.420 align:start position:0%
intent is to deliver services to minors
 
02:21:54.590 --> 02:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
such as arcades trampoline parks Etc
 
02:21:56.809 --> 02:21:56.819 align:start position:0%
employment is vital for successful
 
02:21:59.270 --> 02:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
reintegration into the community these
 
02:22:01.309 --> 02:22:01.319 align:start position:0%
individuals need employment to afford
 
02:22:03.410 --> 02:22:03.420 align:start position:0%
treatment and engage in positive healthy
 
02:22:05.870 --> 02:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
and appropriate activities by further
 
02:22:07.370 --> 02:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
restricting a person with a sexual
 
02:22:09.410 --> 02:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
offenses employment it inadvertently
 
02:22:12.290 --> 02:22:12.300 align:start position:0%
increases risk factors through reduced
 
02:22:15.410 --> 02:22:15.420 align:start position:0%
unemployment reduced employability thus
 
02:22:18.170 --> 02:22:18.180 align:start position:0%
increasing the likelihood of reoffence
 
02:22:20.389 --> 02:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
stable employment provides the structure
 
02:22:23.389 --> 02:22:23.399 align:start position:0%
necessary to assist individuals with a
 
02:22:25.610 --> 02:22:25.620 align:start position:0%
successful transition and provides them
 
02:22:27.170 --> 02:22:27.180 align:start position:0%
with the income necessary to obtain
 
02:22:29.870 --> 02:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
housing and treatment to prevent
 
02:22:29.880 --> 02:22:31.010 align:start position:0%
housing and treatment to prevent
homelessness

02:22:31.010 --> 02:22:31.020 align:start position:0%
homelessness
 
02:22:32.990 --> 02:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
according to David Prescott a researcher
 
02:22:35.210 --> 02:22:35.220 align:start position:0%
for the association for the treatment of
 
02:22:37.490 --> 02:22:37.500 align:start position:0%
sexual abusers research has shown that
 
02:22:38.870 --> 02:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
offenders who are able to maintain
 
02:22:41.090 --> 02:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
stability in their homes and employment
 
02:22:43.610 --> 02:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
are less likely to commit further crimes
 
02:22:45.469 --> 02:22:45.479 align:start position:0%
public policy is therefore most
 
02:22:47.270 --> 02:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
effective when it considers those
 
02:22:49.130 --> 02:22:49.140 align:start position:0%
factors that prevent crime as well as
 
02:22:51.590 --> 02:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
those that make communities safer
 
02:22:53.750 --> 02:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
in closing I would like to reiterate the
 
02:22:55.370 --> 02:22:55.380 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections support for
 
02:22:56.630 --> 02:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
legislation that keeps our community
 
02:22:58.730 --> 02:22:58.740 align:start position:0%
safe it would urge the committee to
 
02:22:59.990 --> 02:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
consider the use of more specific
 
02:23:01.969 --> 02:23:01.979 align:start position:0%
languages they move forward thank you
 
02:23:03.830 --> 02:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
for this opportunity and for your time
 
02:23:05.809 --> 02:23:05.819 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions or and
 
02:23:07.309 --> 02:23:07.319 align:start position:0%

02:23:10.309 --> 02:23:10.319 align:start position:0%

thank you for your testimony are there
 
02:23:17.990 --> 02:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:19.490 --> 02:23:19.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:23:21.950 --> 02:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
um thanks for taking my question
 
02:23:23.870 --> 02:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
um I know that the grocery store we're
 
02:23:25.790 --> 02:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
not going to mention anymore that is a
 
02:23:27.710 --> 02:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
pinnacle of this community
 
02:23:30.110 --> 02:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
um hires at 14.
 
02:23:33.650 --> 02:23:33.660 align:start position:0%
is it currently legal for to your
 
02:23:33.660 --> 02:23:34.849 align:start position:0%
is it currently legal for to your
knowledge

02:23:34.849 --> 02:23:34.859 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
02:23:37.490 --> 02:23:37.500 align:start position:0%
um and I know that I'm the lawmaker but
 
02:23:40.370 --> 02:23:40.380 align:start position:0%
is it currently legal for a business
 
02:23:42.830 --> 02:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
like that to put a convicted sex
 
02:23:44.630 --> 02:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
offender in a position of authority over
 
02:23:47.450 --> 02:23:47.460 align:start position:0%
someone who's 14 who's maybe a co-worker
 
02:23:49.910 --> 02:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not a lawyer but I can tell you that
 
02:23:52.730 --> 02:23:52.740 align:start position:0%
at a super like a supermarket
 
02:23:54.830 --> 02:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
Mike they're not running a criminal
 
02:23:56.870 --> 02:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
background check so if someone did
 
02:23:58.790 --> 02:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
become a supervisor I would say yes
 
02:24:00.950 --> 02:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
current law allows for that because you
 
02:24:02.210 --> 02:24:02.220 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even know
 
02:24:05.330 --> 02:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:08.690 --> 02:24:08.700 align:start position:0%
hold on one second representative scitec
 
02:24:11.330 --> 02:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
uh you have obviously have prepared
 
02:24:13.370 --> 02:24:13.380 align:start position:0%
remarks do you mind emailing that to us
 
02:24:15.170 --> 02:24:15.180 align:start position:0%
yes and I have written copies as well
 
02:24:17.090 --> 02:24:17.100 align:start position:0%
that I'm happy to provide I can give to
 
02:24:19.690 --> 02:24:19.700 align:start position:0%

02:24:23.210 --> 02:24:23.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:25.429 --> 02:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question when
 
02:24:28.370 --> 02:24:28.380 align:start position:0%
you say more specific language
 
02:24:30.590 --> 02:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
um it looks like the way that the law is
 
02:24:32.389 --> 02:24:32.399 align:start position:0%
written now is they actually make an
 
02:24:36.190 --> 02:24:36.200 align:start position:0%
attempt to identify specific situations
 
02:24:39.849 --> 02:24:39.859 align:start position:0%
what what the bill would do is actually
 
02:24:43.130 --> 02:24:43.140 align:start position:0%
generalize these these situations in in
 
02:24:44.510 --> 02:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
certain ways
 
02:24:47.929 --> 02:24:47.939 align:start position:0%
can can you tell me why the doc thinks
 
02:24:49.849 --> 02:24:49.859 align:start position:0%
it's important that we actually get
 
02:24:53.030 --> 02:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
insultingly specific with the with the
 
02:24:55.969 --> 02:24:55.979 align:start position:0%
conditions in this particular bill
 
02:24:59.210 --> 02:24:59.220 align:start position:0%
um I do think so again I reference that
 
02:25:01.730 --> 02:25:01.740 align:start position:0%
a good portion of our responsibility is
 
02:25:03.469 --> 02:25:03.479 align:start position:0%
to make sure people safely transition
 
02:25:05.450 --> 02:25:05.460 align:start position:0%
back into communities
 
02:25:08.450 --> 02:25:08.460 align:start position:0%
um if we have language that's broad that
 
02:25:09.889 --> 02:25:09.899 align:start position:0%
prevents people from getting a stable
 
02:25:14.090 --> 02:25:14.100 align:start position:0%
job that prevents us from safely
 
02:25:16.070 --> 02:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
rehabilitating folks and getting them
 
02:25:18.230 --> 02:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
into a stable environment so that they
 
02:25:20.270 --> 02:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
don't reoffend I know Abby if you want
 
02:25:22.130 --> 02:25:22.140 align:start position:0%
to add do you have anything to add or
 
02:25:22.140 --> 02:25:22.929 align:start position:0%
to add do you have anything to add or
you

02:25:22.929 --> 02:25:22.939 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:25:24.590 --> 02:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question
 
02:25:25.910 --> 02:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
representative or do you want me to get
 
02:25:28.790 --> 02:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
a little bit more specific
 
02:25:31.309 --> 02:25:31.319 align:start position:0%
um actually if if you could be more
 
02:25:33.910 --> 02:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
specific about things that that actually
 
02:25:37.250 --> 02:25:37.260 align:start position:0%
so for instance um the the current law
 
02:25:38.870 --> 02:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
actually lays out some specific
 
02:25:42.170 --> 02:25:42.180 align:start position:0%
situations where this this is prohibited
 
02:25:47.450 --> 02:25:47.460 align:start position:0%
um does the doc think having uh some uh
 
02:25:50.389 --> 02:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
additional uh conditions
 
02:25:53.630 --> 02:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
um that would actually uh potentially
 
02:25:55.910 --> 02:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
address some of Representative verbal's
 
02:25:55.920 --> 02:25:57.110 align:start position:0%
address some of Representative verbal's
concerns

02:25:57.110 --> 02:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
02:25:59.510 --> 02:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
um does it does the doc think it's
 
02:26:01.370 --> 02:26:01.380 align:start position:0%
worthwhile for us to look at adding
 
02:26:03.950 --> 02:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
things like that absolutely we would be
 
02:26:06.670 --> 02:26:06.680 align:start position:0%
supportive of looking at more specific
 
02:26:08.929 --> 02:26:08.939 align:start position:0%
examples of
 
02:26:11.210 --> 02:26:11.220 align:start position:0%
situations that you would not want a
 
02:26:14.210 --> 02:26:14.220 align:start position:0%
registered sex offender to be in we just
 
02:26:16.370 --> 02:26:16.380 align:start position:0%
feel that this language is too broad
 
02:26:19.630 --> 02:26:19.640 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
02:26:22.309 --> 02:26:22.319 align:start position:0%
I I actually have a question you had
 
02:26:25.250 --> 02:26:25.260 align:start position:0%
mentioned you know the rehabilitation
 
02:26:27.889 --> 02:26:27.899 align:start position:0%
process and you know people getting back
 
02:26:30.950 --> 02:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
to work and being members of society my
 
02:26:32.570 --> 02:26:32.580 align:start position:0%
question is
 
02:26:35.990 --> 02:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
will you give us an example
 
02:26:39.849 --> 02:26:39.859 align:start position:0%
of the percentage of sex offenders that
 
02:26:43.010 --> 02:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
re-offend or are re-offenders do you
 
02:26:45.050 --> 02:26:45.060 align:start position:0%
know that
 
02:26:46.670 --> 02:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
um we don't have the statistics in front
 
02:26:48.410 --> 02:26:48.420 align:start position:0%
of us I'd be happy to give that to you
 
02:26:50.030 --> 02:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
as soon as possible so we can we can do
 
02:26:51.530 --> 02:26:51.540 align:start position:0%
that and send you information out there
 
02:26:53.210 --> 02:26:53.220 align:start position:0%
I actually would find that very helpful
 
02:26:54.469 --> 02:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other questions
 
02:26:56.809 --> 02:26:56.819 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
02:26:58.490 --> 02:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
02:26:58.500 --> 02:26:59.570 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
you

02:26:59.570 --> 02:26:59.580 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:26:59.580 --> 02:27:01.849 align:start position:0%
you
Mr

02:27:01.849 --> 02:27:01.859 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
02:27:01.859 --> 02:27:03.650 align:start position:0%
Mr
parole

02:27:03.650 --> 02:27:03.660 align:start position:0%
parole
 
02:27:12.770 --> 02:27:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:15.469 --> 02:27:15.479 align:start position:0%
good afternoon sorry I lost my voice I'm
 
02:27:17.330 --> 02:27:17.340 align:start position:0%
uh Richard Perrault I'm a detective
 
02:27:18.349 --> 02:27:18.359 align:start position:0%
Sergeant with the New Hampshire State
 
02:27:20.809 --> 02:27:20.819 align:start position:0%
Police and I am the commander of the sex
 
02:27:24.469 --> 02:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
offender registry here in New Hampshire
 
02:27:28.370 --> 02:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
um again that's uh that's who I am uh
 
02:27:30.590 --> 02:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
I'm here obviously today to
 
02:27:32.270 --> 02:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
um provide some testimony into this
 
02:27:34.750 --> 02:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
state police is not taking a position
 
02:27:38.090 --> 02:27:38.100 align:start position:0%
for or against the proposed law however
 
02:27:40.070 --> 02:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh the language I think in the proposed
 
02:27:42.410 --> 02:27:42.420 align:start position:0%
law is is vague and open to
 
02:27:44.570 --> 02:27:44.580 align:start position:0%
interpretation uh for example the
 
02:27:48.230 --> 02:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
definition of what a direct service is
 
02:27:49.490 --> 02:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
um that can mean a lot of different
 
02:27:52.910 --> 02:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
things to a lot of different people
 
02:27:55.730 --> 02:27:55.740 align:start position:0%
as we're all seeing in here today
 
02:27:57.530 --> 02:27:57.540 align:start position:0%
there's also
 
02:27:59.870 --> 02:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
no definition of what a criminal
 
02:28:02.990 --> 02:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
background check is
 
02:28:06.349 --> 02:28:06.359 align:start position:0%
the in the proposed law
 
02:28:08.330 --> 02:28:08.340 align:start position:0%
or Republic or private employer
 
02:28:10.550 --> 02:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
organization whose primary intent is to
 
02:28:12.590 --> 02:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
provide Direct Services to minors
 
02:28:15.230 --> 02:28:15.240 align:start position:0%
will conduct a criminal background check
 
02:28:17.510 --> 02:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
does that include a criminal record
 
02:28:20.330 --> 02:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
check or Does it include
 
02:28:23.090 --> 02:28:23.100 align:start position:0%
you know the employer calling his last
 
02:28:25.010 --> 02:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
previous three jobs and finding out if
 
02:28:26.690 --> 02:28:26.700 align:start position:0%
he actually worked there so
 
02:28:29.389 --> 02:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
uh those things I think are a little too
 
02:28:29.399 --> 02:28:33.889 align:start position:0%
uh those things I think are a little too
vague

02:28:33.889 --> 02:28:33.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:35.990 --> 02:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
I understand this is obviously by
 
02:28:37.910 --> 02:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
reading this this is kind of an
 
02:28:39.650 --> 02:28:39.660 align:start position:0%
amendment to the law
 
02:28:42.110 --> 02:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
that already uh talks about providing
 
02:28:45.410 --> 02:28:45.420 align:start position:0%
Direct Services to minors
 
02:28:45.420 --> 02:28:46.849 align:start position:0%
Direct Services to minors
um

02:28:46.849 --> 02:28:46.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:48.410 --> 02:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
there are
 
02:28:51.230 --> 02:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
to convolute this a little more
 
02:28:54.050 --> 02:28:54.060 align:start position:0%
there are some offenses sex offenses
 
02:28:56.150 --> 02:28:56.160 align:start position:0%
that do not require
 
02:28:56.160 --> 02:28:57.830 align:start position:0%
that do not require
registration

02:28:57.830 --> 02:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
registration
 
02:29:01.270 --> 02:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
it's quite a convoluted system
 
02:29:04.790 --> 02:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
so those things that are
 
02:29:06.710 --> 02:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
maybe will pop up in a background
 
02:29:09.170 --> 02:29:09.180 align:start position:0%
criminal record check but that subject
 
02:29:11.690 --> 02:29:11.700 align:start position:0%
may not be on the sex offender registry
 
02:29:13.730 --> 02:29:13.740 align:start position:0%
so if the employer goes to the sex
 
02:29:16.010 --> 02:29:16.020 align:start position:0%
offender registry to find find out if
 
02:29:18.110 --> 02:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
this offender if the subject or
 
02:29:20.750 --> 02:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
applicant is an offender that obviously
 
02:29:27.349 --> 02:29:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:29.570 --> 02:29:29.580 align:start position:0%
as far as fiscal impacts I know I was
 
02:29:31.490 --> 02:29:31.500 align:start position:0%
supposed to talk about that briefly I I
 
02:29:33.590 --> 02:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
don't know what the fiscal impact I
 
02:29:35.469 --> 02:29:35.479 align:start position:0%
don't have hard numbers on that however
 
02:29:38.389 --> 02:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
we at the sex offender registry continue
 
02:29:40.030 --> 02:29:40.040 align:start position:0%
to get calls
 
02:29:43.790 --> 02:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
weekly more daily of employers who
 
02:29:45.530 --> 02:29:45.540 align:start position:0%
actually ask us hey
 
02:29:47.270 --> 02:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
you know we want to hire this guy he's
 
02:29:50.090 --> 02:29:50.100 align:start position:0%
on the list can we hire them
 
02:29:52.190 --> 02:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
so I would imagine in this case if
 
02:29:54.050 --> 02:29:54.060 align:start position:0%
they're required to do criminal
 
02:29:56.090 --> 02:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
background checks that's going to
 
02:29:56.100 --> 02:29:57.349 align:start position:0%
background checks that's going to
require

02:29:57.349 --> 02:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
require
 
02:29:59.570 --> 02:29:59.580 align:start position:0%
either fingerprints or submission of
 
02:30:01.130 --> 02:30:01.140 align:start position:0%
criminal record check through the state
 
02:30:03.710 --> 02:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
those calls are going to uh
 
02:30:06.190 --> 02:30:06.200 align:start position:0%
you know be more likely to happen
 
02:30:08.870 --> 02:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
more frequently than than now
 
02:30:11.690 --> 02:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
so again State Police is not taking a
 
02:30:13.730 --> 02:30:13.740 align:start position:0%
position either way but I think the
 
02:30:16.370 --> 02:30:16.380 align:start position:0%
language in this should be should be
 
02:30:19.730 --> 02:30:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:21.410 --> 02:30:21.420 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
02:30:21.420 --> 02:30:23.990 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
Newman

02:30:23.990 --> 02:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:26.290 --> 02:30:26.300 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:30:29.690 --> 02:30:29.700 align:start position:0%
hi there different degrees of background
 
02:30:31.550 --> 02:30:31.560 align:start position:0%
checks is that why there is a problem
 
02:30:33.770 --> 02:30:33.780 align:start position:0%
with not having a legal definition of
 
02:30:35.750 --> 02:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
what a background check is well I think
 
02:30:38.690 --> 02:30:38.700 align:start position:0%
you know if you ask if you ask me what a
 
02:30:41.510 --> 02:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
background check is I've done
 
02:30:45.170 --> 02:30:45.180 align:start position:0%
you know 15 or at least probably 10 to
 
02:30:48.110 --> 02:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
15 background checks on new hires for us
 
02:30:51.230 --> 02:30:51.240 align:start position:0%
a background check for me would be uh
 
02:30:53.170 --> 02:30:53.180 align:start position:0%
everything from
 
02:30:56.090 --> 02:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
getting his criminal his or her criminal
 
02:30:58.309 --> 02:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
record from the state speaking with
 
02:30:59.929 --> 02:30:59.939 align:start position:0%
previous employers speaking with
 
02:31:02.330 --> 02:31:02.340 align:start position:0%
neighbors speaking with
 
02:31:02.340 --> 02:31:03.950 align:start position:0%
neighbors speaking with
um

02:31:03.950 --> 02:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:05.750 --> 02:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
you know previous employers to see how
 
02:31:08.030 --> 02:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
he was as an employee that's a
 
02:31:09.530 --> 02:31:09.540 align:start position:0%
background check to me
 
02:31:11.570 --> 02:31:11.580 align:start position:0%
background check to
 
02:31:13.309 --> 02:31:13.319 align:start position:0%
the owner of a small convenience store
 
02:31:14.389 --> 02:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
could be
 
02:31:16.370 --> 02:31:16.380 align:start position:0%
calling Walmart and Burger King and
 
02:31:18.230 --> 02:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
Target and the last three places that he
 
02:31:20.870 --> 02:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
that he or she worked that could be his
 
02:31:22.790 --> 02:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
background check and it may not pop up
 
02:31:25.130 --> 02:31:25.140 align:start position:0%
or may not indicate that he's a sex
 
02:31:27.770 --> 02:31:27.780 align:start position:0%
offender if he's not running if he or
 
02:31:29.270 --> 02:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
she is not running a criminal background
 
02:31:31.130 --> 02:31:31.140 align:start position:0%
check through the state
 
02:31:34.070 --> 02:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
02:31:35.750 --> 02:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative Selleck
 
02:31:37.670 --> 02:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks for your time and for
 
02:31:39.170 --> 02:31:39.180 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:31:41.570 --> 02:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
um you as as well as the Department of
 
02:31:43.429 --> 02:31:43.439 align:start position:0%
Corrections both referenced using more
 
02:31:45.469 --> 02:31:45.479 align:start position:0%
specific language
 
02:31:48.230 --> 02:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
um could ask you what language you would
 
02:31:50.450 --> 02:31:50.460 align:start position:0%
find specific enough
 
02:31:53.270 --> 02:31:53.280 align:start position:0%
you know I don't know ma'am um but I
 
02:31:53.280 --> 02:31:54.170 align:start position:0%
you know I don't know ma'am um but I
think

02:31:54.170 --> 02:31:54.180 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:31:56.270 --> 02:31:56.280 align:start position:0%
where it says employment in businesses
 
02:31:59.030 --> 02:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
providing Direct Services to minors or
 
02:32:01.790 --> 02:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
direct supervision or oversight of
 
02:32:04.429 --> 02:32:04.439 align:start position:0%
minors I think that's
 
02:32:05.990 --> 02:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
could be interpreted a lot of different
 
02:32:08.450 --> 02:32:08.460 align:start position:0%
ways when I
 
02:32:11.389 --> 02:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
talked to some some people
 
02:32:13.250 --> 02:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
earlier today and this week regarding
 
02:32:15.170 --> 02:32:15.180 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:32:17.270 --> 02:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
the first thing that popped up was wait
 
02:32:18.830 --> 02:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
a minute
 
02:32:20.450 --> 02:32:20.460 align:start position:0%
my kid can't go to Dairy Queen and buy
 
02:32:21.530 --> 02:32:21.540 align:start position:0%
an ice cream
 
02:32:23.030 --> 02:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
I said well I don't think that's the
 
02:32:24.710 --> 02:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
intent of the law
 
02:32:27.050 --> 02:32:27.060 align:start position:0%
but that's the way he interpreted it
 
02:32:28.570 --> 02:32:28.580 align:start position:0%
when I asked him that
 
02:32:31.490 --> 02:32:31.500 align:start position:0%
you know if you ask somebody that owns a
 
02:32:32.809 --> 02:32:32.819 align:start position:0%
landscape company maybe they're going to
 
02:32:34.309 --> 02:32:34.319 align:start position:0%
have a different interpretation of that
 
02:32:37.250 --> 02:32:37.260 align:start position:0%
so I think it I really don't know
 
02:32:39.469 --> 02:32:39.479 align:start position:0%
how to word that better
 
02:32:41.570 --> 02:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
but I think
 
02:32:43.309 --> 02:32:43.319 align:start position:0%
I think it's open to a lot of
 
02:32:43.319 --> 02:32:45.050 align:start position:0%
I think it's open to a lot of
interpretation

02:32:45.050 --> 02:32:45.060 align:start position:0%
interpretation
 
02:32:45.060 --> 02:32:47.690 align:start position:0%
interpretation
yes

02:32:47.690 --> 02:32:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:47.700 --> 02:32:50.929 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:32:50.929 --> 02:32:50.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:52.429 --> 02:32:52.439 align:start position:0%
um I'm just trying to parse out and I
 
02:32:53.570 --> 02:32:53.580 align:start position:0%
think we are going to be getting a
 
02:32:55.250 --> 02:32:55.260 align:start position:0%
little bit more information
 
02:32:58.490 --> 02:32:58.500 align:start position:0%
um around this but I'm curious you know
 
02:33:01.190 --> 02:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
I mean how would someone be on uh you
 
02:33:03.050 --> 02:33:03.060 align:start position:0%
would do a criminal records check right
 
02:33:05.690 --> 02:33:05.700 align:start position:0%
criminal background check you would find
 
02:33:08.990 --> 02:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
an offense that is a sexual nature yes
 
02:33:11.210 --> 02:33:11.220 align:start position:0%
but what you're saying is they might it
 
02:33:12.410 --> 02:33:12.420 align:start position:0%
might come up in that but they wouldn't
 
02:33:14.870 --> 02:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
be on the sex offender list and so I'm
 
02:33:16.790 --> 02:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
just I'm really curious why that would
 
02:33:18.950 --> 02:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
happen you know why someone would not be
 
02:33:21.889 --> 02:33:21.899 align:start position:0%
on the so it is it is quite convoluted
 
02:33:24.230 --> 02:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
um but you know as an example
 
02:33:27.410 --> 02:33:27.420 align:start position:0%
uh indecent exposure indecent exposure
 
02:33:29.270 --> 02:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
and lewdness if the victim is not under
 
02:33:32.030 --> 02:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
16 it is not registerable unless they do
 
02:33:33.590 --> 02:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
it twice in five years
 
02:33:37.250 --> 02:33:37.260 align:start position:0%
so if you could have a situation where
 
02:33:40.250 --> 02:33:40.260 align:start position:0%
you know uh you've got well I mean it
 
02:33:42.170 --> 02:33:42.180 align:start position:0%
kind of outlines it there you've got a
 
02:33:43.910 --> 02:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
situation where you've got a gentleman
 
02:33:45.830 --> 02:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
urinating and then you know on the side
 
02:33:46.790 --> 02:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
of a building
 
02:33:48.950 --> 02:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
in front of a
 
02:33:50.870 --> 02:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
you know 17 year old
 
02:33:53.270 --> 02:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
it's not registerable but if he does it
 
02:33:54.349 --> 02:33:54.359 align:start position:0%
again and
 
02:33:58.429 --> 02:33:58.439 align:start position:0%
five years it's going to be so he
 
02:34:01.250 --> 02:34:01.260 align:start position:0%
is convicted of that indecent exposure
 
02:34:03.290 --> 02:34:03.300 align:start position:0%
but he's it's going to show up on his
 
02:34:05.690 --> 02:34:05.700 align:start position:0%
criminal record but he's not on the he's
 
02:34:07.969 --> 02:34:07.979 align:start position:0%
not on the registration
 
02:34:10.250 --> 02:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
so you've got there are you know a few
 
02:34:13.429 --> 02:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
examples of that so
 
02:34:15.650 --> 02:34:15.660 align:start position:0%
the other part of that to answer your
 
02:34:18.110 --> 02:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
question if
 
02:34:19.730 --> 02:34:19.740 align:start position:0%
if businesses that provide Direct
 
02:34:21.889 --> 02:34:21.899 align:start position:0%
Services to minors and again that's a
 
02:34:24.830 --> 02:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
that's a broad statement
 
02:34:28.370 --> 02:34:28.380 align:start position:0%
I it's my belief that those
 
02:34:32.030 --> 02:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
the certain the certain sex acts
 
02:34:34.070 --> 02:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
um or the certain convictions of sexual
 
02:34:34.080 --> 02:34:35.690 align:start position:0%
um or the certain convictions of sexual
acts

02:34:35.690 --> 02:34:35.700 align:start position:0%
acts
 
02:34:37.849 --> 02:34:37.859 align:start position:0%
the ones that they have to register for
 
02:34:40.670 --> 02:34:40.680 align:start position:0%
possibly should be in that law as well
 
02:34:43.010 --> 02:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
so that it's it's very clear-cut because
 
02:34:45.770 --> 02:34:45.780 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen is you've got the
 
02:34:47.450 --> 02:34:47.460 align:start position:0%
manager of a small convenience store now
 
02:34:49.790 --> 02:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
having to do a criminal background check
 
02:34:51.950 --> 02:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
and gets his criminal background check
 
02:34:54.230 --> 02:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
but doesn't necessarily know how to
 
02:34:56.809 --> 02:34:56.819 align:start position:0%
interpret that and see you know well you
 
02:34:58.070 --> 02:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
were convicted of this so you're not
 
02:34:59.570 --> 02:34:59.580 align:start position:0%
going to have a job here
 
02:35:02.630 --> 02:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
well I don't have to register not on the
 
02:35:04.550 --> 02:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
registry yeah I urinated on a building
 
02:35:06.410 --> 02:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
but I'm clearly not well you're not
 
02:35:08.630 --> 02:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
going to get the job so I think and
 
02:35:11.389 --> 02:35:11.399 align:start position:0%
that's going to cause uh
 
02:35:13.910 --> 02:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
that's going to cause multiple
 
02:35:16.610 --> 02:35:16.620 align:start position:0%
my opinion questions calls to local
 
02:35:20.630 --> 02:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions local PDS my office to
 
02:35:22.370 --> 02:35:22.380 align:start position:0%
clarify those things for different
 
02:35:24.349 --> 02:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
businesses does that make sense yes it
 
02:35:26.690 --> 02:35:26.700 align:start position:0%
does I'd like to ask a follow-up if
 
02:35:29.210 --> 02:35:29.220 align:start position:0%
possible okay
 
02:35:29.220 --> 02:35:29.929 align:start position:0%
possible okay
um

02:35:29.929 --> 02:35:29.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:32.750 --> 02:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
I think in my reading of this the the
 
02:35:36.230 --> 02:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
onus is put on the individual the person
 
02:35:38.929 --> 02:35:38.939 align:start position:0%
who has a record or you know
 
02:35:40.429 --> 02:35:40.439 align:start position:0%
um so it
 
02:35:42.170 --> 02:35:42.180 align:start position:0%
in the in the way that this is written
 
02:35:44.990 --> 02:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't clarify to my knowledge or
 
02:35:46.490 --> 02:35:46.500 align:start position:0%
you know the way that I'm reading it
 
02:35:49.190 --> 02:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
that it would be a responsibility of the
 
02:35:50.389 --> 02:35:50.399 align:start position:0%
business owner it would be the
 
02:35:52.370 --> 02:35:52.380 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the individual who is
 
02:35:54.170 --> 02:35:54.180 align:start position:0%
trying to get a job or something like
 
02:35:56.389 --> 02:35:56.399 align:start position:0%
that that they would be the person who
 
02:35:58.670 --> 02:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
is responsible for that in the end
 
02:36:00.710 --> 02:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
I see that a person is guilty of a class
 
02:36:02.389 --> 02:36:02.399 align:start position:0%
B felony have been convicted the
 
02:36:04.070 --> 02:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and the paragraph or he or
 
02:36:05.270 --> 02:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
she knowingly fails to provide that
 
02:36:07.429 --> 02:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
information so I agree that the owner
 
02:36:09.110 --> 02:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
can only do he can only work with what
 
02:36:11.030 --> 02:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
he has for information so if that
 
02:36:13.750 --> 02:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
applicant leaves that off
 
02:36:13.760 --> 02:36:15.650 align:start position:0%
applicant leaves that off
however

02:36:15.650 --> 02:36:15.660 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:36:18.530 --> 02:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
however now if that applicant fills out
 
02:36:21.050 --> 02:36:21.060 align:start position:0%
that packet properly with his name
 
02:36:23.450 --> 02:36:23.460 align:start position:0%
date of birth all his information and
 
02:36:25.670 --> 02:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
the owner of that business is required
 
02:36:27.110 --> 02:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
to do a criminal background check and
 
02:36:29.929 --> 02:36:29.939 align:start position:0%
does that not only if that you know
 
02:36:31.309 --> 02:36:31.319 align:start position:0%
comes to light that he's now a sex
 
02:36:31.319 --> 02:36:32.510 align:start position:0%
comes to light that he's now a sex
offender

02:36:32.510 --> 02:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
offender
 
02:36:34.550 --> 02:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
that applicant's going to be charged I
 
02:36:36.469 --> 02:36:36.479 align:start position:0%
would imagine for knowingly leaving that
 
02:36:39.590 --> 02:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
off and he's not going to get the job so
 
02:36:42.230 --> 02:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:36:44.809 --> 02:36:44.819 align:start position:0%

um we're going to be appointing I know
 
02:37:08.750 --> 02:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
some people probably had some more
 
02:37:10.010 --> 02:37:10.020 align:start position:0%
questions I'm going to appoint a
 
02:37:12.050 --> 02:37:12.060 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on this
 
02:37:14.210 --> 02:37:14.220 align:start position:0%

02:38:17.110 --> 02:38:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:19.910 --> 02:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Roy
 
02:38:23.450 --> 02:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
um I am I will be introducing
 
02:38:28.010 --> 02:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:29.510 --> 02:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
I feel like there was a certain way I
 
02:38:30.770 --> 02:38:30.780 align:start position:0%
was supposed to say that but it's my
 
02:38:32.809 --> 02:38:32.819 align:start position:0%
first time so bear with me
 
02:38:35.809 --> 02:38:35.819 align:start position:0%
my name is Jody Newell I am representing
 
02:38:38.570 --> 02:38:38.580 align:start position:0%
Cheshire 4 which is a little Slice of
 
02:38:40.910 --> 02:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
Heaven over there in Keene
 
02:38:42.889 --> 02:38:42.899 align:start position:0%
so the bill that I'm introducing today
 
02:38:45.410 --> 02:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
uh removing testing equipment from the
 
02:38:46.969 --> 02:38:46.979 align:start position:0%
definition of drug paraphernalia in the
 
02:38:48.770 --> 02:38:48.780 align:start position:0%
controlled Drug Act that actually should
 
02:38:51.530 --> 02:38:51.540 align:start position:0%
be testing and analyzing equipment
 
02:38:53.090 --> 02:38:53.100 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to keep it very brief it is
 
02:38:55.250 --> 02:38:55.260 align:start position:0%
a very very brief piece of legislation
 
02:38:56.630 --> 02:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
it's pretty quick I think you probably
 
02:38:59.090 --> 02:38:59.100 align:start position:0%
would have read through it in uh in
 
02:39:01.250 --> 02:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
about two minutes so I will try not to
 
02:39:03.889 --> 02:39:03.899 align:start position:0%
take up a whole lot of time
 
02:39:06.950 --> 02:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
um so the idea of removing this from the
 
02:39:08.809 --> 02:39:08.819 align:start position:0%
definition of drug paraphernalia is that
 
02:39:12.050 --> 02:39:12.060 align:start position:0%
there is a little bit of confusion
 
02:39:15.889 --> 02:39:15.899 align:start position:0%
um and uh you know vagueness around what
 
02:39:17.389 --> 02:39:17.399 align:start position:0%
is considered drug paraphernalia and
 
02:39:19.429 --> 02:39:19.439 align:start position:0%
then how that gets used
 
02:39:21.950 --> 02:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
um how people are responsible I think
 
02:39:24.349 --> 02:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
we're all familiar with um fentanyl test
 
02:39:26.990 --> 02:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
strips and things like that that's uh
 
02:39:29.450 --> 02:39:29.460 align:start position:0%
that would fall under this heading But
 
02:39:31.190 --> 02:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
it includes other ones like spectrometer
 
02:39:33.710 --> 02:39:33.720 align:start position:0%
and things like that we all know that we
 
02:39:38.210 --> 02:39:38.220 align:start position:0%
have a substance use issue the opiate
 
02:39:41.150 --> 02:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
overdose crisis is still raging in New
 
02:39:43.370 --> 02:39:43.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fortunately
 
02:39:45.469 --> 02:39:45.479 align:start position:0%
um in contrast to a lot of other states
 
02:39:49.070 --> 02:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
our overdose deaths went down I would
 
02:39:51.590 --> 02:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
like to call out the fact that it was
 
02:39:53.230 --> 02:39:53.240 align:start position:0%
the accessibility
 
02:39:56.150 --> 02:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
and the use encouraged use of harm
 
02:39:57.710 --> 02:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
reduction tools that allowed that
 
02:39:57.720 --> 02:39:58.990 align:start position:0%
reduction tools that allowed that
because

02:39:58.990 --> 02:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:40:01.370 --> 02:40:01.380 align:start position:0%
overdoses themselves did not go down
 
02:40:03.830 --> 02:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
overdose deaths went down people were
 
02:40:05.510 --> 02:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
able to reduce those deaths because the
 
02:40:07.790 --> 02:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
availability of Narcan a variety of
 
02:40:07.800 --> 02:40:08.690 align:start position:0%
availability of Narcan a variety of
different

02:40:08.690 --> 02:40:08.700 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:40:11.630 --> 02:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
um overdose harm reduction tools
 
02:40:13.730 --> 02:40:13.740 align:start position:0%
fentanyl test strips are something that
 
02:40:16.190 --> 02:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
we want to encourage people to use right
 
02:40:18.349 --> 02:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
we want people to be able to have this
 
02:40:21.349 --> 02:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
so that they do not die because there
 
02:40:23.389 --> 02:40:23.399 align:start position:0%
was something that was in their drugs
 
02:40:26.270 --> 02:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
that they did not know was there now we
 
02:40:27.710 --> 02:40:27.720 align:start position:0%
don't really want to encourage use but
 
02:40:29.870 --> 02:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
if someone is going to use if we are
 
02:40:32.750 --> 02:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
dealing with reality uh what we could do
 
02:40:34.910 --> 02:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
is we can reduce the harm on that person
 
02:40:38.210 --> 02:40:38.220 align:start position:0%
providing things like this provide for
 
02:40:41.270 --> 02:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
people to knowledgeably use substances
 
02:40:43.610 --> 02:40:43.620 align:start position:0%
and it saves lives it has been proven
 
02:40:45.290 --> 02:40:45.300 align:start position:0%
over and over I have studies I can send
 
02:40:45.300 --> 02:40:46.210 align:start position:0%
over and over I have studies I can send
you

02:40:46.210 --> 02:40:46.220 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:40:50.870 --> 02:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
to illustrate the idea of why this
 
02:40:53.870 --> 02:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
particular drug paraphernalia in the
 
02:40:55.550 --> 02:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
categories categorization of drug
 
02:40:57.650 --> 02:40:57.660 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia and what the implications
 
02:41:00.170 --> 02:41:00.180 align:start position:0%
are of having something like this as
 
02:41:02.450 --> 02:41:02.460 align:start position:0%
under that heading I'd like to just
 
02:41:04.670 --> 02:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
share a story a short story and like I
 
02:41:07.130 --> 02:41:07.140 align:start position:0%
said I'm going to keep it brief
 
02:41:08.570 --> 02:41:08.580 align:start position:0%
um my boys and I were driving across the
 
02:41:09.710 --> 02:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
country we did this a whole lot when
 
02:41:10.790 --> 02:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
they were little
 
02:41:12.410 --> 02:41:12.420 align:start position:0%
um it's probably 10 or 11 years ago they
 
02:41:13.670 --> 02:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
were still toddlers they were still in
 
02:41:15.170 --> 02:41:15.180 align:start position:0%
booster seats and car seats we'll just
 
02:41:16.309 --> 02:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
say that
 
02:41:17.330 --> 02:41:17.340 align:start position:0%
um and we're driving across the country
 
02:41:18.889 --> 02:41:18.899 align:start position:0%
we're going through Arkansas and there's
 
02:41:20.630 --> 02:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of highway traffic and so I said
 
02:41:21.889 --> 02:41:21.899 align:start position:0%
oh I'm just going to take this alternate
 
02:41:23.389 --> 02:41:23.399 align:start position:0%
route we get off on this alternate route
 
02:41:25.370 --> 02:41:25.380 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately apparently I was still
 
02:41:27.110 --> 02:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
driving like I was on the highway so I
 
02:41:28.610 --> 02:41:28.620 align:start position:0%
got pulled over I was speeding going
 
02:41:29.929 --> 02:41:29.939 align:start position:0%
about 10 miles above the speed limit
 
02:41:32.030 --> 02:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
well the officer pulls me over and uh
 
02:41:33.889 --> 02:41:33.899 align:start position:0%
it's a veteran and he's training a
 
02:41:36.770 --> 02:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
rookie and uh he comes over to my window
 
02:41:38.510 --> 02:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
and he's kind of you know the passenger
 
02:41:39.710 --> 02:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
side window and it's kind of leaning
 
02:41:40.790 --> 02:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
over and talking to me through that
 
02:41:40.800 --> 02:41:42.410 align:start position:0%
over and talking to me through that
window

02:41:42.410 --> 02:41:42.420 align:start position:0%
window
 
02:41:44.150 --> 02:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
um you know we're talking about speeding
 
02:41:45.410 --> 02:41:45.420 align:start position:0%
and where am I coming from I had
 
02:41:46.849 --> 02:41:46.859 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts place at the time and here
 
02:41:48.590 --> 02:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
I am in Arkansas
 
02:41:51.410 --> 02:41:51.420 align:start position:0%
um and he mentions to me uh he says what
 
02:41:53.809 --> 02:41:53.819 align:start position:0%
is that smell I said well I'm not sure
 
02:41:55.250 --> 02:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
what that smell is because I'm driving
 
02:41:57.830 --> 02:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
in a car with my toddlers say I don't
 
02:41:59.990 --> 02:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
smoke in my car but I do smoke he says
 
02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:00.830 align:start position:0%
smoke in my car but I do smoke he says
well

02:42:00.830 --> 02:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:42:02.030 --> 02:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
um you know what what brand of
 
02:42:04.010 --> 02:42:04.020 align:start position:0%
cigarettes do you smoke I said oh well
 
02:42:05.750 --> 02:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
there's not really a brand I roll my own
 
02:42:07.190 --> 02:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
you know and he's very curious about
 
02:42:09.710 --> 02:42:09.720 align:start position:0%
that and I said here I have my setup uh
 
02:42:10.849 --> 02:42:10.859 align:start position:0%
because you know when I take a break I
 
02:42:11.870 --> 02:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
want to get out of the car I have my
 
02:42:13.070 --> 02:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
whole setup over here to roll up a
 
02:42:15.110 --> 02:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
cigarette right so I have a box of tubes
 
02:42:17.690 --> 02:42:17.700 align:start position:0%
I have a big bag of tobacco and then I
 
02:42:18.950 --> 02:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
have this crank machine where you just
 
02:42:20.210 --> 02:42:20.220 align:start position:0%
kind of put the tube with the filter on
 
02:42:21.770 --> 02:42:21.780 align:start position:0%
the end of it put the tobacco in boom
 
02:42:23.510 --> 02:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
you crank it wonderful great little
 
02:42:26.210 --> 02:42:26.220 align:start position:0%
machine handy dandy well he did not know
 
02:42:28.790 --> 02:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
what that was and even though I was
 
02:42:31.309 --> 02:42:31.319 align:start position:0%
explaining to him and I had the entire
 
02:42:33.530 --> 02:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
set up there he decided that that was
 
02:42:36.050 --> 02:42:36.060 align:start position:0%
drug paraphernalia
 
02:42:40.309 --> 02:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
a tobacco rolling setup so because he
 
02:42:42.770 --> 02:42:42.780 align:start position:0%
decided that that allowed him to be able
 
02:42:45.410 --> 02:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
to search my car uh get my children and
 
02:42:47.150 --> 02:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
I out of the car asked me to get out
 
02:42:49.309 --> 02:42:49.319 align:start position:0%
pull out the car seats the booster seat
 
02:42:50.870 --> 02:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
all that kind of stuff I'm sitting on
 
02:42:53.450 --> 02:42:53.460 align:start position:0%
the side of basically some random route
 
02:42:56.270 --> 02:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
in Arkansas humiliated out of my mind
 
02:42:58.790 --> 02:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
for about 30 to 45 minutes because this
 
02:43:00.110 --> 02:43:00.120 align:start position:0%
officer decided that this was drug
 
02:43:02.090 --> 02:43:02.100 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia and because of that he was
 
02:43:04.490 --> 02:43:04.500 align:start position:0%
able to steal my property he took my
 
02:43:06.650 --> 02:43:06.660 align:start position:0%
property my rolling machine which is
 
02:43:08.090 --> 02:43:08.100 align:start position:0%
wonderful because I have that because
 
02:43:09.830 --> 02:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
I'm broke and it saves you money but
 
02:43:12.469 --> 02:43:12.479 align:start position:0%
okay uh takes my property he pulls
 
02:43:14.090 --> 02:43:14.100 align:start position:0%
everything out of my car we're on a six
 
02:43:15.469 --> 02:43:15.479 align:start position:0%
to eight week road trip do you want to
 
02:43:17.090 --> 02:43:17.100 align:start position:0%
know how much stuff was in my car there
 
02:43:19.190 --> 02:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
was a lot pulls out the booster seats
 
02:43:20.929 --> 02:43:20.939 align:start position:0%
all this kind of stuff me and my toddler
 
02:43:22.849 --> 02:43:22.859 align:start position:0%
children on the side of the road of
 
02:43:24.110 --> 02:43:24.120 align:start position:0%
course he's going through everything and
 
02:43:25.910 --> 02:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
he's thinking that you know every every
 
02:43:27.710 --> 02:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
little cigar box is going to be hit the
 
02:43:29.330 --> 02:43:29.340 align:start position:0%
jackpot oh we're gonna find the weed
 
02:43:30.650 --> 02:43:30.660 align:start position:0%
we're gonna find something no he found
 
02:43:31.969 --> 02:43:31.979 align:start position:0%
nothing there was nothing in my car
 
02:43:33.710 --> 02:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
because he considered this drug
 
02:43:36.230 --> 02:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia it allowed him to take
 
02:43:38.389 --> 02:43:38.399 align:start position:0%
possession of my property it allowed him
 
02:43:41.210 --> 02:43:41.220 align:start position:0%
to to negate my civil liberties and
 
02:43:43.429 --> 02:43:43.439 align:start position:0%
search my car and it allowed him to
 
02:43:46.250 --> 02:43:46.260 align:start position:0%
humiliate me on the side of the road
 
02:43:48.889 --> 02:43:48.899 align:start position:0%
this is a minor story
 
02:43:51.230 --> 02:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
so and at the end of the day I have a
 
02:43:53.210 --> 02:43:53.220 align:start position:0%
charge for drug paraphernalia position
 
02:43:54.950 --> 02:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
because he decided that that was drug
 
02:43:57.530 --> 02:43:57.540 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia so the importance of
 
02:44:00.590 --> 02:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
identifying what is and what isn't drug
 
02:44:03.290 --> 02:44:03.300 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia I find very important for
 
02:44:05.450 --> 02:44:05.460 align:start position:0%
our civil liberties and to be able to
 
02:44:07.790 --> 02:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
save lives in this situation as far as
 
02:44:09.950 --> 02:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the overdose crisis
 
02:44:12.349 --> 02:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
I'm going to
 
02:44:15.349 --> 02:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
wrap it up there I do have the um I do
 
02:44:17.690 --> 02:44:17.700 align:start position:0%
have the RSA that this is included in
 
02:44:19.250 --> 02:44:19.260 align:start position:0%
I'll pass it around I have copies for
 
02:44:20.929 --> 02:44:20.939 align:start position:0%
everyone so that you can see where this
 
02:44:24.349 --> 02:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
fits into the control Drug Act and yeah
 
02:44:29.690 --> 02:44:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:32.210 --> 02:44:32.220 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
02:44:34.070 --> 02:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
could you just give a brief description
 
02:44:37.010 --> 02:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
about what the test strips are like and
 
02:44:39.650 --> 02:44:39.660 align:start position:0%
how they're used or cumbersome or or
 
02:44:42.230 --> 02:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
that whole situation to the degree that
 
02:44:44.270 --> 02:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
you think is necessary to clarify that
 
02:44:47.450 --> 02:44:47.460 align:start position:0%
yeah they're pretty much I mean picture
 
02:44:49.070 --> 02:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
a pregnancy test
 
02:44:54.710 --> 02:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:56.389 --> 02:44:56.399 align:start position:0%
there'll be no further questions thank
 
02:45:01.929 --> 02:45:01.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:05.929 --> 02:45:05.939 align:start position:0%
the chair calls and
 
02:45:27.290 --> 02:45:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:29.570 --> 02:45:29.580 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
02:45:31.670 --> 02:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
thanks for having me here uh I paused a
 
02:45:33.830 --> 02:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
second there because uh representative
 
02:45:35.750 --> 02:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
Newman I believe you asked about test
 
02:45:35.760 --> 02:45:37.550 align:start position:0%
Newman I believe you asked about test
strips

02:45:37.550 --> 02:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
strips
 
02:45:39.590 --> 02:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
I have some right here it's it's in a
 
02:45:41.510 --> 02:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
little packet
 
02:45:41.520 --> 02:45:42.889 align:start position:0%
little packet
um

02:45:42.889 --> 02:45:42.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:44.990 --> 02:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
it's used for urinalysis to test if
 
02:45:47.570 --> 02:45:47.580 align:start position:0%
somebody has you know it'll show up in
 
02:45:49.550 --> 02:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
your urine what drugs you're using if
 
02:45:51.170 --> 02:45:51.180 align:start position:0%
you have the right panels to test for it
 
02:45:53.510 --> 02:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
but you can use it to test your drugs by
 
02:45:55.910 --> 02:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
taking a little bit of the powder and
 
02:45:58.250 --> 02:45:58.260 align:start position:0%
mixing it with some water and and you
 
02:46:00.230 --> 02:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
dip it in the same way so that's how
 
02:46:03.290 --> 02:46:03.300 align:start position:0%
they are used so it is a it's a medical
 
02:46:07.090 --> 02:46:07.100 align:start position:0%
tool basically it is a urinalysis device
 
02:46:10.610 --> 02:46:10.620 align:start position:0%
that is used in a in a medical setting
 
02:46:13.490 --> 02:46:13.500 align:start position:0%
in that way but can also be used
 
02:46:16.370 --> 02:46:16.380 align:start position:0%
to see if if fentanyl pings on there
 
02:46:17.809 --> 02:46:17.819 align:start position:0%
does that help
 
02:46:19.610 --> 02:46:19.620 align:start position:0%
Mr can I say thank you for that
 
02:46:23.570 --> 02:46:23.580 align:start position:0%
clarification it was absolutely confused
 
02:46:23.580 --> 02:46:25.190 align:start position:0%
clarification it was absolutely confused
okay

02:46:25.190 --> 02:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:46:27.410 --> 02:46:27.420 align:start position:0%
if you would like to know more you know
 
02:46:29.809 --> 02:46:29.819 align:start position:0%
I can leave them here for visual aid for
 
02:46:32.150 --> 02:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
anybody who would like them but let us
 
02:46:33.830 --> 02:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
move forward thank you so much everybody
 
02:46:36.710 --> 02:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
my name is anina Hansen I'm a resident
 
02:46:38.990 --> 02:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
of Peterborough I'm a person in recovery
 
02:46:42.349 --> 02:46:42.359 align:start position:0%
from alcoholism and I support HB 287
 
02:46:44.150 --> 02:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
because it eliminates the possibility
 
02:46:46.610 --> 02:46:46.620 align:start position:0%
that anyone could face legal charges for
 
02:46:48.770 --> 02:46:48.780 align:start position:0%
possession of a medical tool that helps
 
02:46:50.570 --> 02:46:50.580 align:start position:0%
to keep people alive
 
02:46:52.070 --> 02:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
there's someone else who would have
 
02:46:53.990 --> 02:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
loved to be here today testifying in
 
02:46:56.030 --> 02:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill and that's my life
 
02:46:58.550 --> 02:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
partner Phil spaniola Phil was a New
 
02:47:00.590 --> 02:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Rep for Belknap County
 
02:47:02.630 --> 02:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
who sat on the Health and Human Services
 
02:47:04.849 --> 02:47:04.859 align:start position:0%
committee and he was in long-term
 
02:47:07.010 --> 02:47:07.020 align:start position:0%
recovery from alcohol and heroin
 
02:47:07.020 --> 02:47:08.270 align:start position:0%
recovery from alcohol and heroin
addiction

02:47:08.270 --> 02:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
addiction
 
02:47:10.730 --> 02:47:10.740 align:start position:0%
my guy was Fearless about sharing his
 
02:47:13.070 --> 02:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
story of substance addiction right up
 
02:47:14.630 --> 02:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
until he wasn't
 
02:47:17.150 --> 02:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
until his mental health issues untreated
 
02:47:19.610 --> 02:47:19.620 align:start position:0%
during covid got the better of him and
 
02:47:21.710 --> 02:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
he relapsed and a year and a half ago
 
02:47:24.170 --> 02:47:24.180 align:start position:0%
died in a Manchester drug den of a
 
02:47:26.150 --> 02:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
fentanyl overdose
 
02:47:28.370 --> 02:47:28.380 align:start position:0%
if I could go back I would do anything
 
02:47:30.650 --> 02:47:30.660 align:start position:0%
to get some fentanyl test strips in his
 
02:47:33.410 --> 02:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
hands I would say honey while we figure
 
02:47:35.270 --> 02:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
out how to get you the help you need
 
02:47:38.090 --> 02:47:38.100 align:start position:0%
let's keep you safe
 
02:47:40.429 --> 02:47:40.439 align:start position:0%
I know it seems counter-intuitive to
 
02:47:43.490 --> 02:47:43.500 align:start position:0%
help people use illegal drugs safely
 
02:47:46.490 --> 02:47:46.500 align:start position:0%
I thought so too last March eight months
 
02:47:48.530 --> 02:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
after Phil's death I took a job at a
 
02:47:50.630 --> 02:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
recovery Community organization and
 
02:47:51.830 --> 02:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
that's where I first encountered
 
02:47:54.590 --> 02:47:54.600 align:start position:0%
fentanyl test strips me a woman who lost
 
02:47:56.270 --> 02:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
the man I thought I would grow old with
 
02:47:58.910 --> 02:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
due to fentanyl poisoning I'm supposed
 
02:48:00.889 --> 02:48:00.899 align:start position:0%
to help people see if their drugs have
 
02:48:03.170 --> 02:48:03.180 align:start position:0%
fentanyl so they can keep using
 
02:48:05.750 --> 02:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
but as I learned more I realized it
 
02:48:07.550 --> 02:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
actually makes sense
 
02:48:09.770 --> 02:48:09.780 align:start position:0%
the basic science of substance addiction
 
02:48:12.170 --> 02:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
teaches that once someone is chemically
 
02:48:14.870 --> 02:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
addicted to a drug the physiology of the
 
02:48:16.309 --> 02:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
brain changes
 
02:48:19.809 --> 02:48:19.819 align:start position:0%
because drugs mirror the pain ending
 
02:48:22.370 --> 02:48:22.380 align:start position:0%
pleasure-inducing chemical response of
 
02:48:25.190 --> 02:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
natural life-sustaining processes such
 
02:48:26.690 --> 02:48:26.700 align:start position:0%
as eating
 
02:48:28.969 --> 02:48:28.979 align:start position:0%
the brain can come to associate drugs
 
02:48:31.429 --> 02:48:31.439 align:start position:0%
with survival in the same way
 
02:48:33.530 --> 02:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
in addition to having served as a State
 
02:48:35.990 --> 02:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
Rep Phil worked in recovery he owned two
 
02:48:38.090 --> 02:48:38.100 align:start position:0%
sober houses there was no one better
 
02:48:40.130 --> 02:48:40.140 align:start position:0%
educated than he on the dangers of
 
02:48:42.950 --> 02:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
street drugs so why did he use because
 
02:48:45.950 --> 02:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
his brain had been hijacked reprogrammed
 
02:48:48.230 --> 02:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
to demand that he pick up heroin in
 
02:48:50.510 --> 02:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
order to live the same way your brain
 
02:48:52.969 --> 02:48:52.979 align:start position:0%
would demand usurface to breathe after
 
02:48:54.950 --> 02:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
being underwater too long
 
02:48:58.550 --> 02:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
logic leaves this is survival
 
02:49:01.190 --> 02:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
of course the brain can be reminded oh
 
02:49:03.250 --> 02:49:03.260 align:start position:0%
right I can stay alive without this drug
 
02:49:05.690 --> 02:49:05.700 align:start position:0%
millions of people have recovered from
 
02:49:07.070 --> 02:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
substance addiction
 
02:49:09.469 --> 02:49:09.479 align:start position:0%
I'm six years sober and I'm living my
 
02:49:11.210 --> 02:49:11.220 align:start position:0%
best life
 
02:49:13.550 --> 02:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
but you know who cannot recover from
 
02:49:15.650 --> 02:49:15.660 align:start position:0%
substance addiction
 
02:49:17.510 --> 02:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
dead people
 
02:49:20.510 --> 02:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
dead people have a zero percent recovery
 
02:49:23.150 --> 02:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
success rate and that is why I have
 
02:49:25.070 --> 02:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
fallen in love with fentanyl test strips
 
02:49:27.950 --> 02:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
because each one represents a second
 
02:49:31.070 --> 02:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
chance a precious person someone's
 
02:49:34.130 --> 02:49:34.140 align:start position:0%
beloved getting another chance
 
02:49:43.610 --> 02:49:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:46.790 --> 02:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's drug overdose rates are
 
02:49:51.950 --> 02:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
54 higher than the national average
 
02:49:54.710 --> 02:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
addressing our state's drug problem is a
 
02:49:56.570 --> 02:49:56.580 align:start position:0%
big issue and it shouldn't get bogged
 
02:49:59.330 --> 02:49:59.340 align:start position:0%
down in tiny distractions it's a crime
 
02:50:02.330 --> 02:50:02.340 align:start position:0%
to use drugs such as heroin cocaine or
 
02:50:04.730 --> 02:50:04.740 align:start position:0%
meth all of which are now routinely
 
02:50:06.530 --> 02:50:06.540 align:start position:0%
contaminated with fentanyl and
 
02:50:08.510 --> 02:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
potentially lethal amounts
 
02:50:11.150 --> 02:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
but it should not be a crime to try and
 
02:50:13.790 --> 02:50:13.800 align:start position:0%
stay alive long enough to stop using
 
02:50:13.800 --> 02:50:15.050 align:start position:0%
stay alive long enough to stop using
them

02:50:15.050 --> 02:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:50:17.090 --> 02:50:17.100 align:start position:0%
I just learned a few days ago when
 
02:50:18.590 --> 02:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
representative Newell asked me to
 
02:50:20.750 --> 02:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
testify today that fentanyl test strips
 
02:50:22.250 --> 02:50:22.260 align:start position:0%
are legally classified as drug
 
02:50:24.230 --> 02:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia and let me tell you that
 
02:50:26.450 --> 02:50:26.460 align:start position:0%
was a real shock because now in my
 
02:50:28.190 --> 02:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
professional capacity I carry them
 
02:50:31.250 --> 02:50:31.260 align:start position:0%
around in my car by the box full
 
02:50:33.349 --> 02:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
you mean to tell me I could be charged
 
02:50:35.750 --> 02:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
with possessing drug paraphernalia
 
02:50:38.770 --> 02:50:38.780 align:start position:0%
oh get out of here what a distraction
 
02:50:41.270 --> 02:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
diverting our valuable law enforcement
 
02:50:44.090 --> 02:50:44.100 align:start position:0%
resources away from the problem and the
 
02:50:44.100 --> 02:50:45.010 align:start position:0%
resources away from the problem and the
solution

02:50:45.010 --> 02:50:45.020 align:start position:0%
solution
 
02:50:48.050 --> 02:50:48.060 align:start position:0%
sidetracked by a technicality while our
 
02:50:50.030 --> 02:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
actual drug problems continue unchecked
 
02:50:51.710 --> 02:50:51.720 align:start position:0%
and they are big like I am not
 
02:50:53.510 --> 02:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
minimizing that in any way and I so
 
02:50:54.889 --> 02:50:54.899 align:start position:0%
appreciate the effort that law
 
02:50:57.650 --> 02:50:57.660 align:start position:0%
enforcement makes and the the uphill
 
02:50:59.870 --> 02:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
battle they are fighting and I just
 
02:51:02.270 --> 02:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
think this is uh
 
02:51:04.370 --> 02:51:04.380 align:start position:0%
a distracting issue
 
02:51:07.190 --> 02:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
if my guy was alive he'd be here today
 
02:51:10.070 --> 02:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
testifying in favor of this bill and the
 
02:51:12.590 --> 02:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
irony is that if he had had fentanyl
 
02:51:15.469 --> 02:51:15.479 align:start position:0%
test strips he could be alive
 
02:51:18.469 --> 02:51:18.479 align:start position:0%
giving people who use drugs materials to
 
02:51:20.929 --> 02:51:20.939 align:start position:0%
test their drugs is not about promoting
 
02:51:24.110 --> 02:51:24.120 align:start position:0%
drug use or illegal Behavior it's about
 
02:51:26.570 --> 02:51:26.580 align:start position:0%
keeping humans who are in trouble alive
 
02:51:31.490 --> 02:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
until they can get help period
 
02:51:33.349 --> 02:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
and let's never forget that the problem
 
02:51:35.570 --> 02:51:35.580 align:start position:0%
isn't just out there
 
02:51:37.610 --> 02:51:37.620 align:start position:0%
sometimes the people who would benefit
 
02:51:40.010 --> 02:51:40.020 align:start position:0%
from fentanyl test strips are sitting
 
02:51:43.309 --> 02:51:43.319 align:start position:0%
right here in these chairs
 
02:51:46.610 --> 02:51:46.620 align:start position:0%
or have loved ones people
 
02:51:48.410 --> 02:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
that are close to you who might be
 
02:51:50.510 --> 02:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
struggling with this too
 
02:51:54.710 --> 02:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
so I'm asking for Phil and for me and
 
02:51:56.570 --> 02:51:56.580 align:start position:0%
for all the people with hijacked brains
 
02:51:58.190 --> 02:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
and for all the people who love them
 
02:52:01.969 --> 02:52:01.979 align:start position:0%
please support HB 287 and remove the
 
02:52:03.650 --> 02:52:03.660 align:start position:0%
possibility that anyone could face
 
02:52:05.630 --> 02:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
criminal charges for possession of test
 
02:52:08.269 --> 02:52:08.279 align:start position:0%
strips so that we can keep our focus on
 
02:52:10.670 --> 02:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
the real problems around drug use and
 
02:52:13.969 --> 02:52:13.979 align:start position:0%
help our citizen live citizens live to
 
02:52:16.730 --> 02:52:16.740 align:start position:0%
tell their recovery stories
 
02:52:18.710 --> 02:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:52:22.910 --> 02:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
open to questions there's anything
 
02:52:24.349 --> 02:52:24.359 align:start position:0%
um no questions thank you very much for
 
02:52:27.050 --> 02:52:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:29.510 --> 02:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
this time the chair will call Daniel
 
02:52:29.520 --> 02:52:35.269 align:start position:0%
this time the chair will call Daniel
kopobia

02:52:35.269 --> 02:52:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:37.309 --> 02:52:37.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and members
 
02:52:38.929 --> 02:52:38.939 align:start position:0%
of the committee I'm a representative
 
02:52:40.849 --> 02:52:40.859 align:start position:0%
Popovich Miller I'm a freshman from
 
02:52:43.010 --> 02:52:43.020 align:start position:0%
Windham and I really appreciate your
 
02:52:44.870 --> 02:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
time I know how busy you are so I'm
 
02:52:47.750 --> 02:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
gonna keep this as short as I can and
 
02:52:49.370 --> 02:52:49.380 align:start position:0%
try not to repeat anything that you
 
02:52:51.170 --> 02:52:51.180 align:start position:0%
already know like for example the fact
 
02:52:51.180 --> 02:52:52.790 align:start position:0%
already know like for example the fact
that

02:52:52.790 --> 02:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:52:56.210 --> 02:52:56.220 align:start position:0%
drug use is deadly even when the drugs
 
02:52:58.670 --> 02:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
are pure but contaminated drugs are
 
02:53:01.550 --> 02:53:01.560 align:start position:0%
deadlier and you know I think it
 
02:53:03.410 --> 02:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
behooves us to do whatever we can to
 
02:53:05.030 --> 02:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
decrease that damage at the end of the
 
02:53:06.950 --> 02:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
day harm reduction is the right way to
 
02:53:08.990 --> 02:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
look at the drug policy
 
02:53:12.349 --> 02:53:12.359 align:start position:0%
right now the law is written includes
 
02:53:14.090 --> 02:53:14.100 align:start position:0%
those two words that this bill is trying
 
02:53:15.950 --> 02:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
to remove that include the testing and
 
02:53:17.450 --> 02:53:17.460 align:start position:0%
analyzing equipment in drug
 
02:53:19.610 --> 02:53:19.620 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia therefore providing an
 
02:53:22.790 --> 02:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
incentive for people not to have them
 
02:53:25.370 --> 02:53:25.380 align:start position:0%
which leads to worse outcomes and I
 
02:53:26.690 --> 02:53:26.700 align:start position:0%
believe that the
 
02:53:28.910 --> 02:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
the words were included at the time when
 
02:53:30.469 --> 02:53:30.479 align:start position:0%
the bill was written because at the time
 
02:53:32.750 --> 02:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
everybody thought that only drug dealers
 
02:53:34.730 --> 02:53:34.740 align:start position:0%
would need those things we are in a
 
02:53:37.130 --> 02:53:37.140 align:start position:0%
different world today where that those
 
02:53:39.650 --> 02:53:39.660 align:start position:0%
types of devices medical devices are
 
02:53:41.570 --> 02:53:41.580 align:start position:0%
available widely and you know we need to
 
02:53:43.490 --> 02:53:43.500 align:start position:0%
cons reconsider the impact of that
 
02:53:45.530 --> 02:53:45.540 align:start position:0%
policy removing the testing and
 
02:53:48.290 --> 02:53:48.300 align:start position:0%
analyzing equipment would allow us to
 
02:53:50.389 --> 02:53:50.399 align:start position:0%
still prosecute drug dealers look at the
 
02:53:52.190 --> 02:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
remaining drug paraphernalia the
 
02:53:54.050 --> 02:53:54.060 align:start position:0%
finishes it's extensive there is no drug
 
02:53:56.210 --> 02:53:56.220 align:start position:0%
dealer that's just gonna have testing
 
02:53:58.910 --> 02:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
and analyzing equipment it would not in
 
02:54:00.950 --> 02:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
any way decrease the ability of our
 
02:54:03.590 --> 02:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
justice system to prosecute and you know
 
02:54:06.050 --> 02:54:06.060 align:start position:0%
put the drug dealers where they belong
 
02:54:09.230 --> 02:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
but it would allow people who just have
 
02:54:11.210 --> 02:54:11.220 align:start position:0%
the testing equipment whether it's for
 
02:54:14.269 --> 02:54:14.279 align:start position:0%
themselves or you know people like we
 
02:54:15.889 --> 02:54:15.899 align:start position:0%
just heard people who just try to help
 
02:54:18.110 --> 02:54:18.120 align:start position:0%
others and provide services to people in
 
02:54:20.269 --> 02:54:20.279 align:start position:0%
need not worry about you know criminally
 
02:54:22.730 --> 02:54:22.740 align:start position:0%
being criminally prosecuted for allowing
 
02:54:24.910 --> 02:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
to help
 
02:54:24.920 --> 02:54:26.870 align:start position:0%
to help
I

02:54:26.870 --> 02:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:54:29.570 --> 02:54:29.580 align:start position:0%
the law as written just removes the
 
02:54:31.969 --> 02:54:31.979 align:start position:0%
definition of those two words removes it
 
02:54:34.010 --> 02:54:34.020 align:start position:0%
from the law but frankly one could argue
 
02:54:36.050 --> 02:54:36.060 align:start position:0%
and this is not the intent of this law
 
02:54:36.060 --> 02:54:37.190 align:start position:0%
and this is not the intent of this law
that

02:54:37.190 --> 02:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:54:39.410 --> 02:54:39.420 align:start position:0%
drug dealers who have testing and
 
02:54:41.090 --> 02:54:41.100 align:start position:0%
equipment should receive a more
 
02:54:42.830 --> 02:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
favorable outcome because they are
 
02:54:45.050 --> 02:54:45.060 align:start position:0%
trying to you know do less harm but
 
02:54:46.730 --> 02:54:46.740 align:start position:0%
again that's beyond the scope of this
 
02:54:46.740 --> 02:54:47.750 align:start position:0%
again that's beyond the scope of this
law

02:54:47.750 --> 02:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:54:50.389 --> 02:54:50.399 align:start position:0%
I want to also remind everybody that
 
02:54:52.670 --> 02:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
banning those devices by making their
 
02:54:55.429 --> 02:54:55.439 align:start position:0%
position illegal is providing a
 
02:54:57.410 --> 02:54:57.420 align:start position:0%
disincentive to people who research and
 
02:55:00.170 --> 02:55:00.180 align:start position:0%
produce those devices if you know that
 
02:55:01.730 --> 02:55:01.740 align:start position:0%
you cannot sell them in the state of New
 
02:55:03.230 --> 02:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at least not legally less
 
02:55:05.870 --> 02:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
money will be invested in life-saving
 
02:55:08.210 --> 02:55:08.220 align:start position:0%
Technologies and drugs so
 
02:55:10.910 --> 02:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
to sum up from the point of view of
 
02:55:13.070 --> 02:55:13.080 align:start position:0%
Criminal Justice this bill does not in
 
02:55:14.750 --> 02:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
any way decrease the ability to
 
02:55:17.510 --> 02:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
prosecute drug dealers from the point of
 
02:55:19.250 --> 02:55:19.260 align:start position:0%
view of Public Safety it will have a
 
02:55:21.769 --> 02:55:21.779 align:start position:0%
clear positive impact by helping people
 
02:55:25.010 --> 02:55:25.020 align:start position:0%
help themselves or help others and since
 
02:55:27.290 --> 02:55:27.300 align:start position:0%
I didn't know at the time when I
 
02:55:28.670 --> 02:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored the bill that I'm going to
 
02:55:30.410 --> 02:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
end up on the finance committee but
 
02:55:33.110 --> 02:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
that's where I ended up I can assure you
 
02:55:35.450 --> 02:55:35.460 align:start position:0%
that any revenues that the state misses
 
02:55:37.730 --> 02:55:37.740 align:start position:0%
are going to be tiny and the expenditure
 
02:55:40.130 --> 02:55:40.140 align:start position:0%
is a Prosecuting people in these
 
02:55:42.469 --> 02:55:42.479 align:start position:0%
situations are gonna greatly you know
 
02:55:44.269 --> 02:55:44.279 align:start position:0%
basically it's going to have a positive
 
02:55:46.250 --> 02:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
Financial impact to even though frankly
 
02:55:47.389 --> 02:55:47.399 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't really be your
 
02:55:50.469 --> 02:55:50.479 align:start position:0%
consideration but since it has an FN
 
02:55:52.429 --> 02:55:52.439 align:start position:0%
designation you know that's something
 
02:55:54.410 --> 02:55:54.420 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to bring up I really
 
02:55:55.849 --> 02:55:55.859 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time and I'm available
 
02:55:59.630 --> 02:55:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:01.969 --> 02:56:01.979 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
02:56:04.790 --> 02:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:16.389 --> 02:56:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:18.410 --> 02:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
02:56:20.630 --> 02:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
um to the committee um I am Carrie Nolte

I'm an associate professor of nursing at
 
02:56:25.250 --> 02:56:25.260 align:start position:0%
the University of New Hampshire where my
 
02:56:27.830 --> 02:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
research focuses on harm reduction and
 
02:56:29.750 --> 02:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
reducing drug related harms like
 
02:56:32.150 --> 02:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
infection and overdose I'm also a family
 
02:56:34.969 --> 02:56:34.979 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner who practices in
 
02:56:37.010 --> 02:56:37.020 align:start position:0%
healthcare for the homeless through van
 
02:56:40.309 --> 02:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
based Outreach and I'm here speaking on
 
02:56:42.050 --> 02:56:42.060 align:start position:0%
behalf of myself although with my
 
02:56:43.929 --> 02:56:43.939 align:start position:0%
expertise is my background
 
02:56:47.150 --> 02:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
I have submitted written testimony by
 
02:56:50.450 --> 02:56:50.460 align:start position:0%
email to the committee including quite a
 
02:56:52.670 --> 02:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
few links and education around drug
 
02:56:55.550 --> 02:56:55.560 align:start position:0%
checking and the evidence for it
 
02:56:59.510 --> 02:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
um and I just want to speak out in
 
02:57:03.110 --> 02:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
support of House Bill 287
 
02:57:06.710 --> 02:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
um as you know there is currently some
 
02:57:08.389 --> 02:57:08.399 align:start position:0%
question as to whether fentanyl test
 
02:57:12.110 --> 02:57:12.120 align:start position:0%
strips could be prosecuted but I would
 
02:57:15.530 --> 02:57:15.540 align:start position:0%
also like to share a little bit about
 
02:57:18.889 --> 02:57:18.899 align:start position:0%
comprehensive drug checking so we um and
 
02:57:20.870 --> 02:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
call the committee's attention to House
 
02:57:24.650 --> 02:57:24.660 align:start position:0%
Bill 470 which is also has been referred
 
02:57:26.450 --> 02:57:26.460 align:start position:0%
to your committee and hopefully will be
 
02:57:28.070 --> 02:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
heard at a later date
 
02:57:30.530 --> 02:57:30.540 align:start position:0%
so fentanyl test strips are very
 
02:57:32.750 --> 02:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
important in order to check the presence
 
02:57:35.389 --> 02:57:35.399 align:start position:0%
of one substance fentanyl we anticipate
 
02:57:37.610 --> 02:57:37.620 align:start position:0%
there also will be more rapid tests
 
02:57:39.769 --> 02:57:39.779 align:start position:0%
available for other substances that are
 
02:57:42.429 --> 02:57:42.439 align:start position:0%
being cut into the drug Supply
 
02:57:45.230 --> 02:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
but in the meantime a best practice
 
02:57:47.809 --> 02:57:47.819 align:start position:0%
around comprehensive drug checking has
 
02:57:47.819 --> 02:57:48.730 align:start position:0%
around comprehensive drug checking has
been

02:57:48.730 --> 02:57:48.740 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:57:51.230 --> 02:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
developed and
 
02:57:55.309 --> 02:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
um in my opinion House Bill 470 more
 
02:57:58.130 --> 02:57:58.140 align:start position:0%
comprehensively allows this
 
02:57:59.809 --> 02:57:59.819 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
02:58:02.269 --> 02:58:02.279 align:start position:0%
um within comprehensive drug checking
 
02:58:05.269 --> 02:58:05.279 align:start position:0%
these are usually using what what are
 
02:58:07.610 --> 02:58:07.620 align:start position:0%
called ftir machines
 
02:58:10.130 --> 02:58:10.140 align:start position:0%
um don't ask me the abbreviation uh in
 
02:58:14.030 --> 02:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
order to get the specific substances one
 
02:58:15.830 --> 02:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
substance we're seeing in clinical care
 
02:58:17.510 --> 02:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
or we think we're seeing in clinical
 
02:58:19.910 --> 02:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
care but we can't quantify it because we
 
02:58:22.370 --> 02:58:22.380 align:start position:0%
don't have comprehensive drug checking
 
02:58:25.910 --> 02:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
is something called xylazine xylazine is
 
02:58:28.429 --> 02:58:28.439 align:start position:0%
a animal tranquilizer it's used in
 
02:58:32.090 --> 02:58:32.100 align:start position:0%
veterinary medicine and we perceive that
 
02:58:34.610 --> 02:58:34.620 align:start position:0%
based on the based on it being
 
02:58:37.429 --> 02:58:37.439 align:start position:0%
identified in local States Massachusetts
 
02:58:39.650 --> 02:58:39.660 align:start position:0%
and Rhode Island with similar
 
02:58:41.630 --> 02:58:41.640 align:start position:0%
presentations it's present in New
 
02:58:41.640 --> 02:58:42.370 align:start position:0%
presentations it's present in New
Hampshire

02:58:42.370 --> 02:58:42.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:58:45.710 --> 02:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
some of it can cause different sedating
 
02:58:49.010 --> 02:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
side effects than opiates it can cause a
 
02:58:51.290 --> 02:58:51.300 align:start position:0%
decrease in heart rate but probably the
 
02:58:52.849 --> 02:58:52.859 align:start position:0%
most prom dominant thing we're seeing
 
02:58:55.250 --> 02:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
clinically is really really severe
 
02:58:58.610 --> 02:58:58.620 align:start position:0%
wounds that are more like are are
 
02:59:01.849 --> 02:59:01.859 align:start position:0%
infected but are also more consistent
 
02:59:03.349 --> 02:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
with Burns there's almost like a
 
02:59:06.710 --> 02:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
chemical burn component to using this so
 
02:59:09.830 --> 02:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
as substances will be ever changing and
 
02:59:11.690 --> 02:59:11.700 align:start position:0%
the drug Supply will become more and
 
02:59:14.809 --> 02:59:14.819 align:start position:0%
more dangerous I think you see the
 
02:59:16.490 --> 02:59:16.500 align:start position:0%
importance based on two bills being
 
02:59:19.190 --> 02:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
brought to the house in this session on
 
02:59:21.830 --> 02:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
drug checking and although I support
 
02:59:25.309 --> 02:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
House Bill 287 I think that the
 
02:59:28.510 --> 02:59:28.520 align:start position:0%
committee could take a deeper dive into
 
02:59:32.150 --> 02:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
470 and consider that as a best practice
 
02:59:35.510 --> 02:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
which has been used across other states
 
02:59:38.510 --> 02:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
um one of the one of the concerns around
 
02:59:41.990 --> 02:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
um so House Bill 287 will eliminate
 
02:59:44.809 --> 02:59:44.819 align:start position:0%
testing and analyzing and that is
 
02:59:46.550 --> 02:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
important for Rapid test strips like
 
02:59:49.730 --> 02:59:49.740 align:start position:0%
fentanyl test strips but comprehensive
 
02:59:52.010 --> 02:59:52.020 align:start position:0%
drug checking does go beyond that there
 
02:59:54.230 --> 02:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
will be processing and preparing and
 
02:59:57.170 --> 02:59:57.180 align:start position:0%
packaging and so those are some of the
 
02:59:58.730 --> 02:59:58.740 align:start position:0%
things and I won't go into all of the
 
03:00:00.650 --> 03:00:00.660 align:start position:0%
details but will be coming to the
 
03:00:02.269 --> 03:00:02.279 align:start position:0%
committee to look at and I'm happy to
 
03:00:07.370 --> 03:00:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:09.290 --> 03:00:09.300 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
03:00:11.510 --> 03:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
all right representative Newman do you
 
03:00:13.849 --> 03:00:13.859 align:start position:0%
have a question I I just had a quick
 
03:00:16.190 --> 03:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
question about 470s and you said it was
 
03:00:18.170 --> 03:00:18.180 align:start position:0%
more comprehensive than this does it
 
03:00:20.630 --> 03:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
move drug power yeah that representative
 
03:00:22.429 --> 03:00:22.439 align:start position:0%
that's coming so we'll we'll address
 
03:00:31.070 --> 03:00:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:43.510 --> 03:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:43.520 --> 03:00:46.929 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:00:46.929 --> 03:00:46.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:49.309 --> 03:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry for my handwriting it's
 
03:00:50.990 --> 03:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
actually Kate Bry I'm the vice president
 
03:00:53.630 --> 03:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
of graduate I'm sure I'm sure it was my
 
03:00:56.090 --> 03:00:56.100 align:start position:0%
handwriting I'll be very brief
 
03:00:58.250 --> 03:00:58.260 align:start position:0%
um uh we do support new future I'm um
 
03:01:00.650 --> 03:01:00.660 align:start position:0%
the vice president of advocacy
 
03:01:02.469 --> 03:01:02.479 align:start position:0%
um at new Futures we support
 
03:01:04.969 --> 03:01:04.979 align:start position:0%
evidence-based uh prevention treatment
 
03:01:07.910 --> 03:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
and Recovery policies for health and
 
03:01:10.010 --> 03:01:10.020 align:start position:0%
wellness and substance use disorder we
 
03:01:11.710 --> 03:01:11.720 align:start position:0%
are in support of house bill
 
03:01:14.210 --> 03:01:14.220 align:start position:0%
287. we stand with our colleagues who
 
03:01:15.710 --> 03:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
have said it'd be great for the
 
03:01:17.690 --> 03:01:17.700 align:start position:0%
committee to also take a deeper dive
 
03:01:20.330 --> 03:01:20.340 align:start position:0%
into HB 470 since that's more
 
03:01:20.340 --> 03:01:22.190 align:start position:0%
into HB 470 since that's more
comprehensive

03:01:22.190 --> 03:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
comprehensive
 
03:01:24.170 --> 03:01:24.180 align:start position:0%
um so it won't go into long testimony
 
03:01:27.469 --> 03:01:27.479 align:start position:0%
today but I will leave you with both a
 
03:01:31.190 --> 03:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
CDC overview of functional test strips
 
03:01:33.469 --> 03:01:33.479 align:start position:0%
um why they are effective harm reduction
 
03:01:36.170 --> 03:01:36.180 align:start position:0%
strategy as well as a more detailed
 
03:01:39.830 --> 03:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
article from Health Affairs outlining
 
03:01:42.170 --> 03:01:42.180 align:start position:0%
why these strips Empower people and save
 
03:01:44.090 --> 03:01:44.100 align:start position:0%
lives and so hopefully that will provide
 
03:01:49.610 --> 03:01:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:52.670 --> 03:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony oh
 
03:01:52.680 --> 03:01:55.730 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony oh
representative

03:01:55.730 --> 03:01:55.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:55.740 --> 03:01:56.269 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:01:56.269 --> 03:01:56.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:58.370 --> 03:01:58.380 align:start position:0%
one of the things I know that your
 
03:01:58.380 --> 03:02:00.250 align:start position:0%
one of the things I know that your
organization

03:02:00.250 --> 03:02:00.260 align:start position:0%
organization
 
03:02:03.969 --> 03:02:03.979 align:start position:0%
is is very selective with um
 
03:02:06.769 --> 03:02:06.779 align:start position:0%
when it comes to supporting things like
 
03:02:09.170 --> 03:02:09.180 align:start position:0%
legalization this isn't something that
 
03:02:11.929 --> 03:02:11.939 align:start position:0%
you do lightly as we'll probably find
 
03:02:14.230 --> 03:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
out during the Cannabis hearings
 
03:02:16.849 --> 03:02:16.859 align:start position:0%
but the can you talk a little bit about
 
03:02:19.630 --> 03:02:19.640 align:start position:0%
a harm reduction strategy and and and
 
03:02:22.370 --> 03:02:22.380 align:start position:0%
where your organization is on that and
 
03:02:25.309 --> 03:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
and how and what you think of that as an
 
03:02:27.469 --> 03:02:27.479 align:start position:0%
overall way for sort of lessening the
 
03:02:30.290 --> 03:02:30.300 align:start position:0%
the impact of the the issues we're
 
03:02:32.210 --> 03:02:32.220 align:start position:0%
seeing with fentanyl and other opioids
 
03:02:32.220 --> 03:02:33.110 align:start position:0%
seeing with fentanyl and other opioids
now

03:02:33.110 --> 03:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:02:35.750 --> 03:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
so we are absolutely supportive of the
 
03:02:37.910 --> 03:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
full Continuum of Care with substance
 
03:02:39.910 --> 03:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
use disorder that means prevention
 
03:02:43.190 --> 03:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
primary secondary tertiary uh treatment
 
03:02:46.130 --> 03:02:46.140 align:start position:0%
and Recovery harm reduction is a key
 
03:02:48.110 --> 03:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
piece of the puzzle
 
03:02:50.750 --> 03:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
um and so a functional test strips along
 
03:02:53.150 --> 03:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
with Narcan and the Good Samaritan law
 
03:02:55.309 --> 03:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
all bills we supported and actually
 
03:02:58.010 --> 03:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
helped write we are very
 
03:03:00.610 --> 03:03:00.620 align:start position:0%
um uh behind harm reduction strategies
 
03:03:03.410 --> 03:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
when we get into the Cannabis discussion
 
03:03:05.929 --> 03:03:05.939 align:start position:0%
I think the issues we have has been
 
03:03:08.690 --> 03:03:08.700 align:start position:0%
around a lack of
 
03:03:11.150 --> 03:03:11.160 align:start position:0%
um principles around protecting children
 
03:03:14.269 --> 03:03:14.279 align:start position:0%
in previous versions of the law we want
 
03:03:16.190 --> 03:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
to be careful about not advertising and
 
03:03:17.870 --> 03:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
marketing to them we want to be careful
 
03:03:20.330 --> 03:03:20.340 align:start position:0%
about making sure we have potency limits
 
03:03:22.610 --> 03:03:22.620 align:start position:0%
just like we do with alcohol so those
 
03:03:24.769 --> 03:03:24.779 align:start position:0%
are basic prevention primary prevention
 
03:03:27.349 --> 03:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
but we also support tertiary and
 
03:03:29.090 --> 03:03:29.100 align:start position:0%
secondary prevention steps of which
 
03:03:31.690 --> 03:03:31.700 align:start position:0%
functional chest strips are one
 
03:03:33.710 --> 03:03:33.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:03:37.670 --> 03:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:40.610 --> 03:03:40.620 align:start position:0%
the chair calls Frank Knack from the
 
03:03:40.620 --> 03:03:57.250 align:start position:0%
the chair calls Frank Knack from the
ACLU

03:03:57.250 --> 03:03:57.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:59.269 --> 03:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee
 
03:04:00.469 --> 03:04:00.479 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for the opportunity to
 
03:04:02.570 --> 03:04:02.580 align:start position:0%
testify today my name is Frank canac I'm
 
03:04:04.429 --> 03:04:04.439 align:start position:0%
the policy director with the ACLU of New
 
03:04:05.809 --> 03:04:05.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we are here in strong
 
03:04:09.290 --> 03:04:09.300 align:start position:0%
support of HB 287
 
03:04:10.910 --> 03:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
um this really provides New Hampshire as
 
03:04:12.349 --> 03:04:12.359 align:start position:0%
as you've heard with an opportunity to
 
03:04:13.910 --> 03:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
build on its harm reduction successes
 
03:04:15.769 --> 03:04:15.779 align:start position:0%
you know when naloxone was introduced
 
03:04:17.990 --> 03:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
back in 2015
 
03:04:18.000 --> 03:04:18.590 align:start position:0%
back in 2015
um

03:04:18.590 --> 03:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:21.710 --> 03:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
by 2017 we had seen the peak in the
 
03:04:23.929 --> 03:04:23.939 align:start position:0%
current peak in overdose deaths at 490
 
03:04:27.170 --> 03:04:27.180 align:start position:0%
and uh we had you know more recently the
 
03:04:29.030 --> 03:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire drug monitoring initiative
 
03:04:30.170 --> 03:04:30.180 align:start position:0%
which is part of the Department of
 
03:04:33.110 --> 03:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services uh quote state
 
03:04:35.809 --> 03:04:35.819 align:start position:0%
that naloxone very likely contributed to
 
03:04:37.910 --> 03:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
it both a decline in overdose deaths and
 
03:04:40.010 --> 03:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
the EMS provided Narcan Administration
 
03:04:42.349 --> 03:04:42.359 align:start position:0%
through 2019 and then if you look at
 
03:04:44.929 --> 03:04:44.939 align:start position:0%
just 20 uh November 21 through October
 
03:04:47.690 --> 03:04:47.700 align:start position:0%
22 that one year period
 
03:04:50.090 --> 03:04:50.100 align:start position:0%
um uh the the administration of naloxone
 
03:04:54.349 --> 03:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
by EMS saved 865 lives and so the the
 
03:04:56.210 --> 03:04:56.220 align:start position:0%
Embrace of harm reduction strategies by
 
03:04:58.429 --> 03:04:58.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is having a huge positive
 
03:05:01.790 --> 03:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
impact at saving lives and the um this
 
03:05:04.010 --> 03:05:04.020 align:start position:0%
legislation is the next step in ensuring
 
03:05:05.590 --> 03:05:05.600 align:start position:0%
that we have a harm reduction
 
03:05:08.269 --> 03:05:08.279 align:start position:0%
a number of harm reduction tools that
 
03:05:10.730 --> 03:05:10.740 align:start position:0%
continue to save lives
 
03:05:12.650 --> 03:05:12.660 align:start position:0%
and so I want to touch on two myths
 
03:05:14.929 --> 03:05:14.939 align:start position:0%
around around funnel test strips that
 
03:05:17.450 --> 03:05:17.460 align:start position:0%
may come up um having so far
 
03:05:19.550 --> 03:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
one is that they're used to test the
 
03:05:21.230 --> 03:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
purity of the substance and that's just
 
03:05:23.450 --> 03:05:23.460 align:start position:0%
not true it's like a Cova test strip it
 
03:05:25.730 --> 03:05:25.740 align:start position:0%
just tests whether the substance is in
 
03:05:28.490 --> 03:05:28.500 align:start position:0%
there or not and so the notion that you
 
03:05:30.530 --> 03:05:30.540 align:start position:0%
know people are using it to test the
 
03:05:32.690 --> 03:05:32.700 align:start position:0%
drug Purity is is just not true it's not
 
03:05:35.690 --> 03:05:35.700 align:start position:0%
how they function and the second is that
 
03:05:37.790 --> 03:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
they encourage drug use and for this I
 
03:05:39.710 --> 03:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
want to just quote the director of the
 
03:05:41.630 --> 03:05:41.640 align:start position:0%
office of National Drug control policy
 
03:05:44.269 --> 03:05:44.279 align:start position:0%
who said quote there is no scientific
 
03:05:46.250 --> 03:05:46.260 align:start position:0%
evidence to support this notion that
 
03:05:47.990 --> 03:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
harm reduction services like fentanyl
 
03:05:49.790 --> 03:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
test strip somehow encourage drug use
 
03:05:52.670 --> 03:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
but there is significant evidence to
 
03:05:54.349 --> 03:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
support the fact that these tools can
 
03:05:55.969 --> 03:05:55.979 align:start position:0%
save lives and so this is coming from
 
03:05:58.010 --> 03:05:58.020 align:start position:0%
the head of the office of national
 
03:06:00.170 --> 03:06:00.180 align:start position:0%
control drug control policies in
 
03:06:02.630 --> 03:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
addition you have major governmental
 
03:06:04.429 --> 03:06:04.439 align:start position:0%
non-governmental medical and public
 
03:06:06.830 --> 03:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
health organizations all stating that we
 
03:06:08.389 --> 03:06:08.399 align:start position:0%
should have these harm reduction tools
 
03:06:10.670 --> 03:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
available including the CDC the
 
03:06:11.870 --> 03:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
Substance Abuse and Mental Health
 
03:06:14.150 --> 03:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
Services Administration and the American
 
03:06:16.849 --> 03:06:16.859 align:start position:0%
Medical Association and finally 24
 
03:06:16.859 --> 03:06:18.230 align:start position:0%
Medical Association and finally 24
States

03:06:18.230 --> 03:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
States
 
03:06:19.910 --> 03:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
um have legalized both The Possession
 
03:06:22.210 --> 03:06:22.220 align:start position:0%
and distribution of fentanyl test strips
 
03:06:24.830 --> 03:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
including our neighbors in Vermont Maine
 
03:06:27.530 --> 03:06:27.540 align:start position:0%
and Massachusetts and in just the period
 
03:06:31.610 --> 03:06:31.620 align:start position:0%
between August 1 2021 and August 31 2022
 
03:06:34.190 --> 03:06:34.200 align:start position:0%
so just that 13-month recent period we
 
03:06:35.809 --> 03:06:35.819 align:start position:0%
saw 10 States move in this direction
 
03:06:38.650 --> 03:06:38.660 align:start position:0%
including deep red States like Alabama
 
03:06:42.469 --> 03:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
Tennessee and
 
03:06:44.389 --> 03:06:44.399 align:start position:0%
um Louisiana and so this is again
 
03:06:46.070 --> 03:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
another harm reduction option that we
 
03:06:48.469 --> 03:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
have that we should embrace and happy to
 
03:06:52.130 --> 03:06:52.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:56.809 --> 03:06:56.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:58.849 --> 03:06:58.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
03:07:00.469 --> 03:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
my question
 
03:07:02.750 --> 03:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
um is there any evidence that the use of
 
03:07:04.309 --> 03:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
a fentanyl test strip might discourage
 
03:07:07.250 --> 03:07:07.260 align:start position:0%
drug use in that it may identify an
 
03:07:07.260 --> 03:07:08.389 align:start position:0%
drug use in that it may identify an
unwanted

03:07:08.389 --> 03:07:08.399 align:start position:0%
unwanted
 
03:07:11.150 --> 03:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
substance that wasn't what someone
 
03:07:17.330 --> 03:07:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:19.490 --> 03:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
um but what I can say is there is six
 
03:07:20.929 --> 03:07:20.939 align:start position:0%
significant evidence through
 
03:07:22.969 --> 03:07:22.979 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed studies that show that
 
03:07:24.650 --> 03:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
when people use fentanyl test strips
 
03:07:27.410 --> 03:07:27.420 align:start position:0%
that there's a much greater likelihood
 
03:07:29.510 --> 03:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
that they will ensure that they're using
 
03:07:31.610 --> 03:07:31.620 align:start position:0%
with someone else who could call 9-1-1
 
03:07:34.490 --> 03:07:34.500 align:start position:0%
or administer Narcan if they have an
 
03:07:37.130 --> 03:07:37.140 align:start position:0%
overdose that they'll use less of the
 
03:07:39.530 --> 03:07:39.540 align:start position:0%
drug if it tests positive for Fentanyl
 
03:07:42.349 --> 03:07:42.359 align:start position:0%
and so again these are documented
 
03:07:44.330 --> 03:07:44.340 align:start position:0%
documented findings that show that these
 
03:07:46.250 --> 03:07:46.260 align:start position:0%
are significant harm reduction tool that
 
03:07:52.849 --> 03:07:52.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:57.290 --> 03:07:57.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:00.110 --> 03:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
it's time to chair calls representative
 
03:08:13.610 --> 03:08:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:17.510 --> 03:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
hi thank you for hearing me today
 
03:08:20.030 --> 03:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
um my name is Christine Siebert I'm from
 
03:08:22.190 --> 03:08:22.200 align:start position:0%
Ward one in Manchester
 
03:08:23.809 --> 03:08:23.819 align:start position:0%
um District 21.
 
03:08:26.389 --> 03:08:26.399 align:start position:0%
and I'll make this brief because a lot
 
03:08:28.010 --> 03:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
of people already hit on a lot of the
 
03:08:30.650 --> 03:08:30.660 align:start position:0%
points and they did a great job
 
03:08:33.230 --> 03:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
um but I just wanted to bring up they
 
03:08:35.570 --> 03:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
are a harm reduction tool
 
03:08:37.550 --> 03:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
um the big one I want to mention is they
 
03:08:40.429 --> 03:08:40.439 align:start position:0%
do not assist in the use of drugs so
 
03:08:42.950 --> 03:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
they are not used as a tool Within
 
03:08:46.130 --> 03:08:46.140 align:start position:0%
actual the drug use itself
 
03:08:48.050 --> 03:08:48.060 align:start position:0%
um and we obviously have a really big
 
03:08:50.090 --> 03:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
problem in Manchester
 
03:08:53.690 --> 03:08:53.700 align:start position:0%
our services are overwhelmed our
 
03:08:59.030 --> 03:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
response the EMS fire everyone they also
 
03:09:00.889 --> 03:09:00.899 align:start position:0%
have to send everyone out
 
03:09:03.230 --> 03:09:03.240 align:start position:0%
when anything happens there's also
 
03:09:06.290 --> 03:09:06.300 align:start position:0%
people that overdose multiple times and
 
03:09:09.769 --> 03:09:09.779 align:start position:0%
this also you know contributes to the
 
03:09:12.170 --> 03:09:12.180 align:start position:0%
fatigue that you hear many First
 
03:09:14.630 --> 03:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
Responders speak of
 
03:09:18.170 --> 03:09:18.180 align:start position:0%
and so this is and when I was canvassing
 
03:09:20.870 --> 03:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
for my for running for office this last
 
03:09:23.809 --> 03:09:23.819 align:start position:0%
time this past summer this was something
 
03:09:26.230 --> 03:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of people brought up
 
03:09:29.330 --> 03:09:29.340 align:start position:0%
so this would be and a lot of it is
 
03:09:31.910 --> 03:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
about the money and the services that a
 
03:09:34.250 --> 03:09:34.260 align:start position:0%
lot of this costs so I just believe
 
03:09:36.889 --> 03:09:36.899 align:start position:0%
overall this is a great tool
 
03:09:39.110 --> 03:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
and I understand maybe someone
 
03:09:42.530 --> 03:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
originally did this with some hopefully
 
03:09:45.769 --> 03:09:45.779 align:start position:0%
good intentions but the pro problems
 
03:09:47.389 --> 03:09:47.399 align:start position:0%
become overwhelming and it's become
 
03:09:49.910 --> 03:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
overwhelming across the entire country
 
03:09:49.920 --> 03:09:52.790 align:start position:0%
overwhelming across the entire country
so

03:09:52.790 --> 03:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:09:55.550 --> 03:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
I hope you will vote in support of this
 
03:09:55.560 --> 03:09:56.870 align:start position:0%
I hope you will vote in support of this
bill

03:09:56.870 --> 03:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:09:58.969 --> 03:09:58.979 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
03:10:02.870 --> 03:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:04.969 --> 03:10:04.979 align:start position:0%
this time the chair calls Lauren
 
03:10:04.979 --> 03:10:16.130 align:start position:0%
this time the chair calls Lauren
McKinley

03:10:16.130 --> 03:10:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:18.710 --> 03:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
hi my name is Lauren McGinley I am the
 
03:10:20.450 --> 03:10:20.460 align:start position:0%
executive director of the New Hampshire
 
03:10:23.030 --> 03:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
harm reduction Coalition I wanted to
 
03:10:25.610 --> 03:10:25.620 align:start position:0%
take just a few moments to say
 
03:10:25.620 --> 03:10:26.389 align:start position:0%
take just a few moments to say
um

03:10:26.389 --> 03:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:28.309 --> 03:10:28.319 align:start position:0%
it I'll go so far as to say that New
 
03:10:29.990 --> 03:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire harm reduction Coalition is
 
03:10:31.730 --> 03:10:31.740 align:start position:0%
probably the state's largest distributor
 
03:10:33.830 --> 03:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
of fentanyl test strips we've been
 
03:10:37.190 --> 03:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
utilizing them since April of 2021 when
 
03:10:41.170 --> 03:10:41.180 align:start position:0%
the CDC and samsa issued a co-request to
 
03:10:43.790 --> 03:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
funded entities to begin using them to
 
03:10:47.210 --> 03:10:47.220 align:start position:0%
prevent fatal overdoses due to fentanyl
 
03:10:49.750 --> 03:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
contamination in all substances
 
03:10:52.070 --> 03:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
so it's important to think when we think
 
03:10:54.410 --> 03:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
fentanyl we generally think a
 
03:10:56.269 --> 03:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
contaminant in heroin
 
03:10:58.309 --> 03:10:58.319 align:start position:0%
fentanyl can be a contaminant and is
 
03:11:00.590 --> 03:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
currently being seen as a contaminant in
 
03:11:03.530 --> 03:11:03.540 align:start position:0%
a lot of substances that people are not
 
03:11:05.269 --> 03:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
familiar with the presence of fentanyl
 
03:11:07.910 --> 03:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
or in how to react to a potential
 
03:11:12.170 --> 03:11:12.180 align:start position:0%
fentanyl or opioid induced overdose
 
03:11:16.250 --> 03:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
so if you casually use say cocaine on
 
03:11:18.889 --> 03:11:18.899 align:start position:0%
the weekends as many college students
 
03:11:21.969 --> 03:11:21.979 align:start position:0%
typically will start to experiment with
 
03:11:25.610 --> 03:11:25.620 align:start position:0%
you would not have the proper tools on
 
03:11:30.410 --> 03:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
hand to address a an opioid induced
 
03:11:33.230 --> 03:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
overdose because cocaine users stimulant
 
03:11:36.530 --> 03:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
users are not typically aware of how to
 
03:11:39.769 --> 03:11:39.779 align:start position:0%
to react to an overdose like that so
 
03:11:41.809 --> 03:11:41.819 align:start position:0%
fentanyl test strips serve a really
 
03:11:44.210 --> 03:11:44.220 align:start position:0%
important tool with people who use drugs
 
03:11:47.510 --> 03:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
to identify not only what is in their
 
03:11:49.610 --> 03:11:49.620 align:start position:0%
drug Supply so the presence of fentanyl
 
03:11:51.590 --> 03:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
is a yes or no that these fentanyl test
 
03:11:54.110 --> 03:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
strips can provide nothing further than
 
03:11:57.110 --> 03:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
that but also where fentanyl is starting
 
03:12:00.950 --> 03:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
to be seen including in stimulants like
 
03:12:03.769 --> 03:12:03.779 align:start position:0%
cocaine and methamphetamines
 
03:12:05.630 --> 03:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
um as the largest distributor of
 
03:12:07.250 --> 03:12:07.260 align:start position:0%
fentanyl test strips I just want to call
 
03:12:08.929 --> 03:12:08.939 align:start position:0%
to um
 
03:12:11.750 --> 03:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
the committee's attention that Federal
 
03:12:13.790 --> 03:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
resources are completely able to be
 
03:12:15.710 --> 03:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
applied to the purchase of fentanyl test
 
03:12:18.710 --> 03:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
strips and have been able to to been
 
03:12:23.330 --> 03:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
utilized since April of 2021. we have an
 
03:12:25.309 --> 03:12:25.319 align:start position:0%
incredibly large surplus of fentanyl
 
03:12:29.030 --> 03:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
test strips and have made the offer to
 
03:12:31.969 --> 03:12:31.979 align:start position:0%
supply them to whichever organization
 
03:12:33.830 --> 03:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
feels like they would benefit from
 
03:12:36.710 --> 03:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
having them additionally I would be
 
03:12:38.450 --> 03:12:38.460 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions if people
 
03:12:41.150 --> 03:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
have questions relative to how a person
 
03:12:43.670 --> 03:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
who uses drugs utilizes fentanyl test
 
03:12:46.309 --> 03:12:46.319 align:start position:0%
strips or what some of the anecdotal
 
03:12:48.710 --> 03:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
responses have been having them as a
 
03:12:52.849 --> 03:12:52.859 align:start position:0%
supply at our harm reduction events
 
03:12:55.070 --> 03:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
that's it I have a question are are
 
03:12:57.110 --> 03:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
people able to just do you have a
 
03:12:58.610 --> 03:12:58.620 align:start position:0%
location where people are able to come
 
03:13:01.429 --> 03:13:01.439 align:start position:0%
in and obtain these yes yep absolutely
 
03:13:04.190 --> 03:13:04.200 align:start position:0%
so we make ourselves present in in many
 
03:13:06.349 --> 03:13:06.359 align:start position:0%
different ways and we've had people
 
03:13:08.570 --> 03:13:08.580 align:start position:0%
reach out to us via social media we've
 
03:13:10.190 --> 03:13:10.200 align:start position:0%
had people show up at some of our harm
 
03:13:11.990 --> 03:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
reduction events or syringe service
 
03:13:14.990 --> 03:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
programs we also have the ability to
 
03:13:16.969 --> 03:13:16.979 align:start position:0%
connect them to a regional care
 
03:13:19.849 --> 03:13:19.859 align:start position:0%
coordinator who can help them procure
 
03:13:21.590 --> 03:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
the test strips but then also review
 
03:13:23.510 --> 03:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
with them quickly how to use it
 
03:13:26.750 --> 03:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
appropriately to interpret the results
 
03:13:29.389 --> 03:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
and if if this bill were passed and to
 
03:13:31.010 --> 03:13:31.020 align:start position:0%
become law do you have the
 
03:13:32.870 --> 03:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to to get these out into
 
03:13:34.070 --> 03:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
the community
 
03:13:36.590 --> 03:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
um in a more in a broader broader way
 
03:13:38.750 --> 03:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
quickly yes absolutely we already have
 
03:13:40.969 --> 03:13:40.979 align:start position:0%
practice with that um we are currently a
 
03:13:42.710 --> 03:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
covered entity that is allowed to
 
03:13:44.809 --> 03:13:44.819 align:start position:0%
distribute fentanyl test strips because
 
03:13:47.990 --> 03:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
they are included in the SSP law in the
 
03:13:49.670 --> 03:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
03:13:52.670 --> 03:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
um as any tools that are used to prevent
 
03:13:52.680 --> 03:13:56.809 align:start position:0%
um as any tools that are used to prevent
overdoses

03:13:56.809 --> 03:13:56.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:00.349 --> 03:14:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:01.910 --> 03:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:14:04.490 --> 03:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
your testimony sure you're saying that
 
03:14:04.500 --> 03:14:05.150 align:start position:0%
your testimony sure you're saying that
um

03:14:05.150 --> 03:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:07.490 --> 03:14:07.500 align:start position:0%
the distribution of test of fentanyl
 
03:14:08.750 --> 03:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
test strips is currently federally
 
03:14:12.830 --> 03:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
funded and that also under current law
 
03:14:15.769 --> 03:14:15.779 align:start position:0%
someone who obtains that
 
03:14:17.929 --> 03:14:17.939 align:start position:0%
through federal funds could be charged
 
03:14:20.389 --> 03:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
with possession of paraphernalia
 
03:14:22.790 --> 03:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh great question and it is slightly
 
03:14:26.150 --> 03:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
confusing so the list of entities in the
 
03:14:28.010 --> 03:14:28.020 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that can safely
 
03:14:31.070 --> 03:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
distribute fentanyl test strips is very
 
03:14:33.950 --> 03:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
small I know that my organization is
 
03:14:36.530 --> 03:14:36.540 align:start position:0%
protected under the SSP law in the state
 
03:14:38.150 --> 03:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire because I can
 
03:14:42.110 --> 03:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
distribute a list of supplies syringes
 
03:14:45.889 --> 03:14:45.899 align:start position:0%
safe injection equipment Narcan naloxone
 
03:14:49.429 --> 03:14:49.439 align:start position:0%
and any other device that may prevent
 
03:14:52.010 --> 03:14:52.020 align:start position:0%
harms occurring from the use of
 
03:14:52.020 --> 03:14:53.570 align:start position:0%
harms occurring from the use of
substances

03:14:53.570 --> 03:14:53.580 align:start position:0%
substances
 
03:14:56.030 --> 03:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
there are many places that are not
 
03:14:58.610 --> 03:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
protected but
 
03:15:01.250 --> 03:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
are able to distribute them if they feel
 
03:15:04.370 --> 03:15:04.380 align:start position:0%
like the legal risk is
 
03:15:06.410 --> 03:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
to to be clear though whoever you give
 
03:15:08.269 --> 03:15:08.279 align:start position:0%
it to would be in violation once they
 
03:15:10.910 --> 03:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
possess it I don't believe so actually I
 
03:15:12.830 --> 03:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
think that the onus is on the
 
03:15:14.929 --> 03:15:14.939 align:start position:0%
Distributing entity and once they are
 
03:15:17.450 --> 03:15:17.460 align:start position:0%
received by individuals
 
03:15:21.650 --> 03:15:21.660 align:start position:0%
um that there is not a legal risk there
 
03:15:24.650 --> 03:15:24.660 align:start position:0%
I am not a lawyer though we do
 
03:15:28.130 --> 03:15:28.140 align:start position:0%
there is one here okay represent Bolden
 
03:15:29.450 --> 03:15:29.460 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up
 
03:15:32.870 --> 03:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry I didn't mean to steal that
 
03:15:36.889 --> 03:15:36.899 align:start position:0%
so to be clear if I go to the new
 
03:15:39.710 --> 03:15:39.720 align:start position:0%
shelter on Maple Street in Manchester
 
03:15:41.150 --> 03:15:41.160 align:start position:0%
um where they have test strips available
 
03:15:43.910 --> 03:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
and I take some and I have them on me
 
03:15:46.910 --> 03:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
and I've stopped could I be charged with
 
03:15:49.309 --> 03:15:49.319 align:start position:0%
possession and similarly if I were to
 
03:15:52.190 --> 03:15:52.200 align:start position:0%
say give one to the guy that camps at
 
03:15:54.889 --> 03:15:54.899 align:start position:0%
the Hanford by my house like I did
 
03:15:56.750 --> 03:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
recently could he be charged with
 
03:15:59.090 --> 03:15:59.100 align:start position:0%
possession of paraphernalia this is a
 
03:16:00.830 --> 03:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
great question and one that we've been
 
03:16:02.990 --> 03:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
struggling with in the state since
 
03:16:05.330 --> 03:16:05.340 align:start position:0%
um Samson the CDC requested that
 
03:16:07.490 --> 03:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
programs start Distributing them in this
 
03:16:07.500 --> 03:16:08.230 align:start position:0%
programs start Distributing them in this
way

03:16:08.230 --> 03:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
way
 
03:16:11.389 --> 03:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
and I don't have a great answer for you
 
03:16:11.399 --> 03:16:12.469 align:start position:0%
and I don't have a great answer for you
um

03:16:12.469 --> 03:16:12.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:15.290 --> 03:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I think it kind of highlights
 
03:16:16.969 --> 03:16:16.979 align:start position:0%
the need for the clarification of
 
03:16:19.250 --> 03:16:19.260 align:start position:0%
language like this because
 
03:16:21.830 --> 03:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
um I think it was said best it is such a
 
03:16:24.590 --> 03:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
distracting technicality to be held up
 
03:16:26.929 --> 03:16:26.939 align:start position:0%
on when such important work can be done
 
03:16:28.849 --> 03:16:28.859 align:start position:0%
with the utilization of this and many
 
03:16:33.290 --> 03:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:35.690 --> 03:16:35.700 align:start position:0%
your test morning
 
03:16:37.550 --> 03:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
um is there anyone else who wishes to
 
03:16:39.349 --> 03:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
testify about this who has not handed in
 
03:16:49.190 --> 03:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:51.650 --> 03:16:51.660 align:start position:0%
um now unless you're an attorney
 
03:16:54.889 --> 03:16:54.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:08.469 --> 03:17:08.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:10.790 --> 03:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair oh did you call me
 
03:17:12.950 --> 03:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
officially I
 
03:17:16.190 --> 03:17:16.200 align:start position:0%
The Honorable representative
 
03:17:17.690 --> 03:17:17.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I didn't get your
 
03:17:20.750 --> 03:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
card yet so there it is
 
03:17:22.610 --> 03:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
uh and thank you honorable members of
 
03:17:23.630 --> 03:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
03:17:25.730 --> 03:17:25.740 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is Ellen Reed
 
03:17:27.889 --> 03:17:27.899 align:start position:0%
and I represent Newmarket and new fields
 
03:17:29.510 --> 03:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
and I hesitated to put my card in
 
03:17:30.769 --> 03:17:30.779 align:start position:0%
because I don't think there's too much
 
03:17:32.450 --> 03:17:32.460 align:start position:0%
that I can add but there were a couple
 
03:17:34.429 --> 03:17:34.439 align:start position:0%
small things that I thought I could add
 
03:17:36.410 --> 03:17:36.420 align:start position:0%
first I want to clarify the answer that
 
03:17:38.030 --> 03:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
I just received it's the members of
 
03:17:40.490 --> 03:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
those organizations that may have some
 
03:17:44.090 --> 03:17:44.100 align:start position:0%
legal protection so if you have joined
 
03:17:45.710 --> 03:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
one of those organizations and you're
 
03:17:47.510 --> 03:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
officially a member then you might have
 
03:17:50.210 --> 03:17:50.220 align:start position:0%
in court after a police officer has
 
03:17:51.830 --> 03:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
charged you with paraphernalia and you
 
03:17:53.030 --> 03:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
go through that process you might have
 
03:17:55.610 --> 03:17:55.620 align:start position:0%
some legal protection there
 
03:17:58.670 --> 03:17:58.680 align:start position:0%
however so I cannot speak as other
 
03:18:01.969 --> 03:18:01.979 align:start position:0%
people have as a person who uses any
 
03:18:03.530 --> 03:18:03.540 align:start position:0%
drugs I actually developed an
 
03:18:05.150 --> 03:18:05.160 align:start position:0%
intolerance to marijuana when I was in
 
03:18:07.969 --> 03:18:07.979 align:start position:0%
my 20s and I have a commercial driver's
 
03:18:10.969 --> 03:18:10.979 align:start position:0%
license so I I can't I don't have a dog
 
03:18:13.309 --> 03:18:13.319 align:start position:0%
in the race in that sense and I'm not an
 
03:18:15.530 --> 03:18:15.540 align:start position:0%
expert like the other people but I am a
 
03:18:19.070 --> 03:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
lawmaker as you all are and I can say in
 
03:18:21.170 --> 03:18:21.180 align:start position:0%
my opinion as a lawmaker this should
 
03:18:24.290 --> 03:18:24.300 align:start position:0%
have never been put into this law
 
03:18:24.300 --> 03:18:24.950 align:start position:0%
have never been put into this law
um

03:18:24.950 --> 03:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:27.590 --> 03:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
the Ridiculousness of the idea of
 
03:18:30.230 --> 03:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
testing and analyzing equipment being
 
03:18:32.210 --> 03:18:32.220 align:start position:0%
put into the paraphernalia law I think
 
03:18:33.889 --> 03:18:33.899 align:start position:0%
is made clear by the fact that you just
 
03:18:35.269 --> 03:18:35.279 align:start position:0%
witnessed a crime from an earlier
 
03:18:38.269 --> 03:18:38.279 align:start position:0%
speaker who showed you paraphernalia
 
03:18:39.769 --> 03:18:39.779 align:start position:0%
I don't think anybody in this room
 
03:18:41.030 --> 03:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
thinks that she should should be
 
03:18:41.040 --> 03:18:42.650 align:start position:0%
thinks that she should should be
arrested

03:18:42.650 --> 03:18:42.660 align:start position:0%
arrested
 
03:18:44.990 --> 03:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
um I think that these words were put
 
03:18:49.309 --> 03:18:49.319 align:start position:0%
into law in a punitive sense
 
03:18:51.349 --> 03:18:51.359 align:start position:0%
um at a time where it was more common
 
03:18:53.090 --> 03:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
although we haven't gotten rid of stigma
 
03:18:55.010 --> 03:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
it was more common to think of drug
 
03:18:57.290 --> 03:18:57.300 align:start position:0%
users in a stigmatized way that they
 
03:18:59.030 --> 03:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
have an inherent moral feeling instead
 
03:19:00.710 --> 03:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
of the Way That We Now understand them
 
03:19:03.530 --> 03:19:03.540 align:start position:0%
to have a health condition
 
03:19:05.690 --> 03:19:05.700 align:start position:0%
and we know that we cannot penalize
 
03:19:08.809 --> 03:19:08.819 align:start position:0%
people out of mental health or substance
 
03:19:11.510 --> 03:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
abuse conditions
 
03:19:13.849 --> 03:19:13.859 align:start position:0%
um I think we all know unquestionably
 
03:19:17.030 --> 03:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
that the State and the country are
 
03:19:18.530 --> 03:19:18.540 align:start position:0%
tending towards legalization of
 
03:19:20.210 --> 03:19:20.220 align:start position:0%
different substances anyway but I think
 
03:19:21.830 --> 03:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
of the purpose the original purpose of
 
03:19:25.570 --> 03:19:25.580 align:start position:0%
these laws was originally to help people
 
03:19:29.510 --> 03:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
not use drugs then we should not in fact
 
03:19:32.570 --> 03:19:32.580 align:start position:0%
be punishing people who are just trying
 
03:19:34.910 --> 03:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
to survive their condition and the last
 
03:19:37.250 --> 03:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
thing I'll say as a lawmaker since I
 
03:19:38.570 --> 03:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
know that you have another bill that's
 
03:19:41.110 --> 03:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
similar but more complicated
 
03:19:44.510 --> 03:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
One path forward maybe to pass this so
 
03:19:46.010 --> 03:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
that you have at least something through
 
03:19:47.990 --> 03:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
the simpler thing and retain the other
 
03:19:50.330 --> 03:19:50.340 align:start position:0%
more complex Bill you'll probably want
 
03:19:53.090 --> 03:19:53.100 align:start position:0%
to get into more detail over the the
 
03:19:55.610 --> 03:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
fall and then you have either a second
 
03:19:57.349 --> 03:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
bite at the Apple or another piece of
 
03:19:58.670 --> 03:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
legislation if you want to get into more
 
03:20:00.889 --> 03:20:00.899 align:start position:0%
details but that is my opinion as a
 
03:20:02.630 --> 03:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
lawmaker thank you very much for your
 
03:20:03.950 --> 03:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
time I can't imagine anybody has
 
03:20:06.650 --> 03:20:06.660 align:start position:0%
questions but I'm here for them
 
03:20:09.530 --> 03:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
uh representative wheeler thank you
 
03:20:10.730 --> 03:20:10.740 align:start position:0%
representative Reed for taking my
 
03:20:11.929 --> 03:20:11.939 align:start position:0%
question and thank you Mr chairman for
 
03:20:14.269 --> 03:20:14.279 align:start position:0%
letting me uh ask it
 
03:20:16.250 --> 03:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
um my question was for representative
 
03:20:17.990 --> 03:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
Newell but I'm wondering if you'd be
 
03:20:19.730 --> 03:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
able to answer it seeing as though you
 
03:20:22.010 --> 03:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
had your last sentence there um there is
 
03:20:24.830 --> 03:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
HP 470 on the docket here and I'm just
 
03:20:27.110 --> 03:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
wondering why this legislation came
 
03:20:28.910 --> 03:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
representative I I don't mean to
 
03:20:30.710 --> 03:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
interrupt you but are you a co-sponsor
 
03:20:33.170 --> 03:20:33.180 align:start position:0%
on this bill am I not allowed no you're
 
03:20:34.910 --> 03:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
not we're not alone my apologies I
 
03:20:36.290 --> 03:20:36.300 align:start position:0%
didn't know that's why I shattered my
 
03:20:37.730 --> 03:20:37.740 align:start position:0%
hands for the last bill but she heard it
 
03:20:39.469 --> 03:20:39.479 align:start position:0%
so if she wants to go ahead and answer
 
03:20:41.210 --> 03:20:41.220 align:start position:0%
that's okay
 
03:20:43.130 --> 03:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
um I think the new house rule that I
 
03:20:44.990 --> 03:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
helped get through is that everyone is
 
03:20:47.809 --> 03:20:47.819 align:start position:0%
entitled uh to either participate from
 
03:20:49.309 --> 03:20:49.319 align:start position:0%
one or the other side regardless of
 
03:20:51.050 --> 03:20:51.060 align:start position:0%
condition of co-sponsorship however
 
03:20:53.389 --> 03:20:53.399 align:start position:0%
having said that yes I would I would say
 
03:20:55.670 --> 03:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
that I think a prudent way forward to
 
03:20:57.530 --> 03:20:57.540 align:start position:0%
make sure that this committee has the
 
03:20:59.510 --> 03:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
ability to pass this either this this
 
03:21:01.730 --> 03:21:01.740 align:start position:0%
concept either this year or next year
 
03:21:03.290 --> 03:21:03.300 align:start position:0%
depending on whether or not the Senate
 
03:21:06.230 --> 03:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
goes for this year's version is to pass
 
03:21:09.230 --> 03:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
one and retain one and since the other
 
03:21:10.969 --> 03:21:10.979 align:start position:0%
one that you have before you is the more
 
03:21:12.530 --> 03:21:12.540 align:start position:0%
complex one it makes sense that that's
 
03:21:14.210 --> 03:21:14.220 align:start position:0%
the one retained this is very simple
 
03:21:16.429 --> 03:21:16.439 align:start position:0%
elegant language I think just strikes
 
03:21:18.349 --> 03:21:18.359 align:start position:0%
two words and I think it makes sense to
 
03:21:19.429 --> 03:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
go ahead and get it in the sentence
 
03:21:22.309 --> 03:21:22.319 align:start position:0%
hands sooner rather than later
 
03:21:24.650 --> 03:21:24.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:21:28.250 --> 03:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
at this time I'm going to ask there's a
 
03:21:29.690 --> 03:21:29.700 align:start position:0%
captain here from the state police if
 
03:21:31.790 --> 03:21:31.800 align:start position:0%
you could come up and just elucidate a
 
03:21:34.790 --> 03:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
little bit on the legality of possession
 
03:21:39.110 --> 03:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:43.790 --> 03:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
chairman uh yes just uh so to to kind of
 
03:21:46.730 --> 03:21:46.740 align:start position:0%
address the the overall question I guess
 
03:21:48.650 --> 03:21:48.660 align:start position:0%
by the
 
03:21:51.170 --> 03:21:51.180 align:start position:0%
um the technicality of it could somebody
 
03:21:53.570 --> 03:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
technically be in violation of
 
03:21:56.330 --> 03:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
possessing drug paraphernalia it seems
 
03:21:59.450 --> 03:21:59.460 align:start position:0%
like that that probably could be but I
 
03:22:01.130 --> 03:22:01.140 align:start position:0%
am not aware of any
 
03:22:05.030 --> 03:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
um of any current cases like this
 
03:22:07.130 --> 03:22:07.140 align:start position:0%
um in that situation where you know
 
03:22:09.530 --> 03:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
fentanyl test strips have been charged
 
03:22:11.630 --> 03:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
as drug paraphernalia or anything like
 
03:22:14.450 --> 03:22:14.460 align:start position:0%
that I do understand that the intention
 
03:22:17.870 --> 03:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
of the bill is to you know support the
 
03:22:19.370 --> 03:22:19.380 align:start position:0%
harm reduction
 
03:22:21.710 --> 03:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
um you know tools that we already have
 
03:22:23.269 --> 03:22:23.279 align:start position:0%
in place
 
03:22:25.670 --> 03:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
um as from the state police perspective
 
03:22:27.710 --> 03:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
I wasn't going to take a position on
 
03:22:29.330 --> 03:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
this bill one way or another my
 
03:22:31.130 --> 03:22:31.140 align:start position:0%
intention was to monitor it to see if
 
03:22:33.110 --> 03:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
there were potentially any unintended
 
03:22:33.120 --> 03:22:34.790 align:start position:0%
there were potentially any unintended
consequences

03:22:34.790 --> 03:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
03:22:37.309 --> 03:22:37.319 align:start position:0%
um with taking that language out at the
 
03:22:40.550 --> 03:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
moment I don't see any but I'm also not
 
03:22:43.429 --> 03:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
an attorney I'm not well versed in uh
 
03:22:45.110 --> 03:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
you know in a lot of the the legal
 
03:22:48.590 --> 03:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
aspects of these things but by the
 
03:22:51.290 --> 03:22:51.300 align:start position:0%
letter of the law that it somebody could
 
03:22:53.690 --> 03:22:53.700 align:start position:0%
potentially be be charged
 
03:22:57.290 --> 03:22:57.300 align:start position:0%
um but by like I say I'm not aware of
 
03:22:58.610 --> 03:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
any cases
 
03:23:00.950 --> 03:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
um of that happening at the moment
 
03:23:03.410 --> 03:23:03.420 align:start position:0%
so just to put a fine point on it
 
03:23:06.110 --> 03:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
currently there is legal liability
 
03:23:06.120 --> 03:23:08.090 align:start position:0%
currently there is legal liability
exposure

03:23:08.090 --> 03:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
exposure
 
03:23:09.769 --> 03:23:09.779 align:start position:0%
um regardless of whether or not it's
 
03:23:11.929 --> 03:23:11.939 align:start position:0%
being charged it's still out there in my
 
03:23:14.690 --> 03:23:14.700 align:start position:0%
in my opinion I think that that there
 
03:23:16.010 --> 03:23:16.020 align:start position:0%
could be
 
03:23:16.020 --> 03:23:17.389 align:start position:0%
could be
um

03:23:17.389 --> 03:23:17.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:20.269 --> 03:23:20.279 align:start position:0%
but I also was not aware of the people
 
03:23:21.889 --> 03:23:21.899 align:start position:0%
that are Distributing it
 
03:23:23.870 --> 03:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
um so that is new to me
 
03:23:25.729 --> 03:23:25.739 align:start position:0%
um and you know their protections that
 
03:23:27.469 --> 03:23:27.479 align:start position:0%
they have with it coming from from
 
03:23:30.229 --> 03:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
federal funding and things like that I
 
03:23:33.290 --> 03:23:33.300 align:start position:0%
was not aware of that but I also you
 
03:23:34.790 --> 03:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
know I'm not aware of any cases where
 
03:23:36.530 --> 03:23:36.540 align:start position:0%
this has been an issue
 
03:23:40.010 --> 03:23:40.020 align:start position:0%
thank you does anyone have any questions
 
03:23:43.550 --> 03:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:46.190 --> 03:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
so also to put a finer Point thank you
 
03:23:47.690 --> 03:23:47.700 align:start position:0%
bye-bye thanks for taking my question
 
03:23:51.110 --> 03:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
you're saying that you don't see any and
 
03:23:52.550 --> 03:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
I know that you're speaking sort of um
 
03:23:54.410 --> 03:23:54.420 align:start position:0%
casually because you haven't had a ton
 
03:23:56.570 --> 03:23:56.580 align:start position:0%
of time to prepare but you're saying
 
03:23:57.889 --> 03:23:57.899 align:start position:0%
that you don't see any potential
 
03:24:00.349 --> 03:24:00.359 align:start position:0%
negative consequences of the basically
 
03:24:02.450 --> 03:24:02.460 align:start position:0%
passing this bill is written I mean I I
 
03:24:04.910 --> 03:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
read the bill as it as it's written
 
03:24:06.950 --> 03:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
um thinking outside the trying to think
 
03:24:09.650 --> 03:24:09.660 align:start position:0%
outside the box to see if there were
 
03:24:11.929 --> 03:24:11.939 align:start position:0%
potentially any unintended consequences
 
03:24:14.510 --> 03:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
from what the Bill's intention was at
 
03:24:16.790 --> 03:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
the moment I personally do not don't see
 
03:24:16.800 --> 03:24:17.870 align:start position:0%
the moment I personally do not don't see
any

03:24:17.870 --> 03:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
any
 
03:24:17.880 --> 03:24:18.590 align:start position:0%
any
um

03:24:18.590 --> 03:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:21.469 --> 03:24:21.479 align:start position:0%
but I'll just leave it at that if I can
 
03:24:21.479 --> 03:24:24.170 align:start position:0%
but I'll just leave it at that if I can
yeah

03:24:24.170 --> 03:24:24.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:27.229 --> 03:24:27.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for um stepping up
 
03:24:27.239 --> 03:24:29.389 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for um stepping up
um

03:24:29.389 --> 03:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:31.190 --> 03:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
you have a you you wanted to say
 
03:24:31.200 --> 03:24:36.190 align:start position:0%
you have a you you wanted to say
something

03:24:36.190 --> 03:24:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:38.450 --> 03:24:38.460 align:start position:0%
yeah sure just go ahead and read it so
 
03:24:40.010 --> 03:24:40.020 align:start position:0%
everyone can take it down if you want to
 
03:24:41.870 --> 03:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
take a note
 
03:24:44.630 --> 03:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
again Frank Eco of New Hampshire
 
03:24:46.370 --> 03:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
um so under
 
03:24:50.750 --> 03:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:52.670 --> 03:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
um it says A person shall be guilty of a
 
03:24:55.130 --> 03:24:55.140 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor who dot dot dot delivers
 
03:24:56.990 --> 03:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
possesses with the intent to deliver any
 
03:24:58.790 --> 03:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
drug paraphernalia
 
03:25:00.710 --> 03:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
and so under the definition of drug
 
03:25:02.330 --> 03:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia New Hampshire testing
 
03:25:04.729 --> 03:25:04.739 align:start position:0%
falls under that so it's a unclassified
 
03:25:06.950 --> 03:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor to distribute so it'd be
 
03:25:08.570 --> 03:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
like the harm reduction Coalition is
 
03:25:10.309 --> 03:25:10.319 align:start position:0%
protected but if I gave it to someone
 
03:25:10.319 --> 03:25:11.690 align:start position:0%
protected but if I gave it to someone
else

03:25:11.690 --> 03:25:11.700 align:start position:0%
