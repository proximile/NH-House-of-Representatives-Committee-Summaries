00:10:31.459 --> 00:10:33.070 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:33.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
whole harmless is five years and the
 
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:40.980 align:start position:0%
full transition to 95 from 70 is 10
 
00:10:44.569 --> 00:10:44.579 align:start position:0%
years that's the way it's written
 
00:10:46.009 --> 00:10:46.019 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
you know you put the pieces of the
 
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
puzzle together and
 
00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:52.980 align:start position:0%
um in those first five years
 
00:10:55.069 --> 00:10:55.079 align:start position:0%
um communities will be protected
 
00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
although less and less because the
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
transition grants can be phasing out too
 
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
so you really have to look at how it
 
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
plays out municipality by municipality
 
00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
to see
 
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:10.500 align:start position:0%
to see and understand it's important
 
00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:13.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:18.180 align:start position:0%
so the transition money goes maybe you
 
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
notice Gambino transition money is going
 
00:11:24.829 --> 00:11:24.839 align:start position:0%
to communities that now keep the exit
 
00:11:24.839 --> 00:11:26.150 align:start position:0%
to communities that now keep the exit
swept

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
swept
 
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh I believe I I believe that's right oh
 
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:38.829 align:start position:0%
uh I believe I I believe that's right oh
yeah

00:11:38.829 --> 00:11:38.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
the other way around
 
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:45.180 align:start position:0%
starting at 70.
 
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
it's 70 percent of the of the new new
 
00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:57.660 align:start position:0%
calculated Foundation Opportunity Grant
 
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
is what they'll get at the beginning and
 
00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
a excess swept
 
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
town that under the new calculations
 
00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:11.060 align:start position:0%
would still get more money from swept
 
00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
than it would get from this grant would
 
00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:21.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
Jefferson Woodcock did you have your
 
00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:30.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:34.329 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:12:34.329 --> 00:12:34.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:41.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:45.060 align:start position:0%
so the grant that coming in
 
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
and assuming through the new
 
00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:49.380 align:start position:0%
autonomics here
 
00:12:52.129 --> 00:12:52.139 align:start position:0%
during the five year period is that
 
00:12:53.949 --> 00:12:53.959 align:start position:0%
where they are right now
 
00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
and they'll always need to apply me that
 
00:12:58.610 --> 00:12:58.620 align:start position:0%
finding a great at that level five
 
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
minutes remind me to do whatever the new
 
00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:03.959 align:start position:0%
level is well the actual the
 
00:13:08.329 --> 00:13:08.339 align:start position:0%
transitional Grant phases out so it's a
 
00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
hundred percent in the first year of the
 
00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
Gap okay and then 80 of the Gap and 60
 
00:13:22.009 --> 00:13:22.019 align:start position:0%
and so on and the Gap is is changing too
 
00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:25.519 align:start position:0%
because you're also having a sloping up
 
00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
of the grant
 
00:13:29.389 --> 00:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
you got to put the two together and see
 
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
are there questions of Representative
 
00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:40.860 align:start position:0%
Ames no no but you're welcome to sit
 
00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
there because I'm sure there will be
 
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:51.380 align:start position:0%
before we made a decision to
 
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:53.720 align:start position:0%
infrastructure yeah
 
00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:56.100 align:start position:0%
Jay gave us
 
00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:07.490 align:start position:0%
Jay gave us
suggestions

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
that's what I was hoping that when we
 
00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:12.620 align:start position:0%
have Dave next that we can do that
 
00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:14.940 align:start position:0%
that's why I think we need one more
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
meeting I had suggestions that I'm I'm
 
00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:22.500 align:start position:0%
not quite agreeable to the weighted
 
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:23.829 align:start position:0%
not quite agreeable to the weighted
formula

00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:23.839 align:start position:0%
formula
 
00:14:26.509 --> 00:14:26.519 align:start position:0%
for this special education
 
00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
when we're having a weighted Formula
 
00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
Four Point
 
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
something I think four point let's call
 
00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:35.940 align:start position:0%
4.1 of that and still called the base
 
00:14:37.129 --> 00:14:37.139 align:start position:0%
but that amount which they're
 
00:14:38.509 --> 00:14:38.519 align:start position:0%
multiplying by
 
00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
for all 13 categories
 
00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.069 align:start position:0%
for all 13 categories
um

00:14:43.069 --> 00:14:43.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
well that was part of the the amendment
 
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
we had for the extraordinary needs which
 
00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:55.980 align:start position:0%
was at that time it was Senator
 
00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
Kennedy's Hennessey's bill
 
00:15:00.889 --> 00:15:00.899 align:start position:0%
and I was trying to get a better handle
 
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:06.829 --> 00:15:06.839 align:start position:0%
it well it was unanimous in our
 
00:15:06.839 --> 00:15:08.090 align:start position:0%
it well it was unanimous in our
committee

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:08.100 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
passed the house on consent
 
00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:13.740 align:start position:0%
went and that was stripped in house
 
00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:14.930 align:start position:0%
went and that was stripped in house
finance

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:14.940 align:start position:0%
finance
 
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
that Amendment
 
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
although house finance chair did say to
 
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
me now the chair of Finance she agrees
 
00:15:28.189 --> 00:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
that a weighted factor is something that
 
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
I would say over half the states use
 
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
right now uh to you know be able to
 
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
allocate that appropriation out to
 
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
schools for various categories you know
 
00:15:41.449 --> 00:15:41.459 align:start position:0%
and I know that they're categories which
 
00:15:41.459 --> 00:15:42.230 align:start position:0%
and I know that they're categories which
are

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:45.300 align:start position:0%
are require a lot more
 
00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:46.009 align:start position:0%
are require a lot more
um

00:15:46.009 --> 00:15:46.019 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:49.260 align:start position:0%
assistance uh throughout the day you
 
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
know support to the child and and uh and
 
00:15:55.129 --> 00:15:55.139 align:start position:0%
expertise which is above and beyond
 
00:15:58.129 --> 00:15:58.139 align:start position:0%
reading and language uh in in
 
00:15:58.139 --> 00:16:00.069 align:start position:0%
reading and language uh in in
mathematics

00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
mathematics
 
00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:02.820 align:start position:0%
they're really some of
 
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
relation along with the other health
 
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
impaired we're seeing right now which
 
00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with uh I don't want to
 
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
call them Behavior because behavior is
 
00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
something is learned and it's not
 
00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:14.100 align:start position:0%
necessarily always been an IEP category
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
however emotional issues and all which
 
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
have been developed are now
 
00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:22.380 align:start position:0%
significant in causing disruptions where
 
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
chairs are flying around some of the
 
00:16:25.389 --> 00:16:25.399 align:start position:0%
classrooms and
 
00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
you have to evacuate the classroom and
 
00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:30.060 align:start position:0%
before you can get a good handle on it
 
00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:32.820 align:start position:0%
that's certainly disrupting things
 
00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:34.069 align:start position:0%
that's certainly disrupting things
yes

00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:16:37.069 --> 00:16:37.079 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I just I just I I passed out to
 
00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
the committee this uh
 
00:16:41.389 --> 00:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
article called The Tale of uh two
 
00:16:41.399 --> 00:16:42.769 align:start position:0%
article called The Tale of uh two
schools

00:16:42.769 --> 00:16:42.779 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
and I just happened to find this article
 
00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
as I was rummaging through stuff
 
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
this is an article that appeared in a
 
00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:54.180 align:start position:0%
conquered monitor March 1984.
 
00:16:56.569 --> 00:16:56.579 align:start position:0%
38 years ago
 
00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
and it compares
 
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton High School
 
00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
with Pittsfield High School
 
00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:06.660 align:start position:0%
now you'll note the lovely young lady
 
00:17:09.049 --> 00:17:09.059 align:start position:0%
that's sitting in the lower part just
 
00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:11.240 align:start position:0%
happens to be my daughter
 
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
but I I read this article and I was
 
00:17:17.449 --> 00:17:17.459 align:start position:0%
saying to myself whoa not much has
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
changed in 38 years
 
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact if you were to
 
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
compare pittsfield's high school and
 
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton high school today
 
00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:30.980 align:start position:0%
the situation would be worse than it was
 
00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:34.220 align:start position:0%
38 years ago
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
and so that's just one point the other
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
point I wanted to make too Rick was uh
 
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
when we had the uh education oversight
 
00:17:47.289 --> 00:17:47.299 align:start position:0%
committee meeting last week
 
00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
we had uh representatives from the
 
00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
Department there
 
00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:56.700 align:start position:0%
and they uh basically reviewed their is
 
00:17:58.730 --> 00:17:58.740 align:start position:0%
it called what's it called I platform
 
00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:01.740 align:start position:0%
yeah their eye platform
 
00:18:06.169 --> 00:18:06.179 align:start position:0%
and they have populated that with all
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
kinds of data
 
00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:10.500 align:start position:0%
much of the same data that we use in the
 
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
commission actually
 
00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:16.140 align:start position:0%
and I went up I went up to uh Dr Green
 
00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:17.750 align:start position:0%
and I went up I went up to uh Dr Green
afterwards

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
afterwards
 
00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
and asked him if he if the basically the
 
00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:23.039 align:start position:0%
data came from the the form 25 that the
 
00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:24.660 align:start position:0%
school district submit
 
00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:26.700 align:start position:0%
and in fact it does
 
00:18:30.289 --> 00:18:30.299 align:start position:0%
and my point is is that if you look to
 
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
see where we are today
 
00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:35.340 align:start position:0%
with the information that's available
 
00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
the data that's available
 
00:18:37.679 --> 00:18:39.049 align:start position:0%
the data that's available
the

00:18:39.049 --> 00:18:39.059 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
um the the progress of students data
 
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
that's available
 
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
if none of that was none of that was was
 
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
there when the original input model was
 
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
created years ago
 
00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
like 38 years ago
 
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
and it just seems to me that we now have
 
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
an opportunity
 
00:19:06.169 --> 00:19:06.179 align:start position:0%
to take that significant data dump that
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
they've got
 
00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
to begin to look at a different way of
 
00:19:12.049 --> 00:19:12.059 align:start position:0%
funding schools
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the at least as a
 
00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
commission has suggested
 
00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:19.140 align:start position:0%
that the current funding that we have
 
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
available for schools from the state
 
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
that it then be allocated in a different
 
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.810 align:start position:0%
that it then be allocated in a different
format

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:26.820 align:start position:0%
format
 
00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
than just the one size fits all that we
 
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
have right now
 
00:19:33.049 --> 00:19:33.059 align:start position:0%
and I'm not trying to be critical of the
 
00:19:33.059 --> 00:19:34.250 align:start position:0%
and I'm not trying to be critical of the
original

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:34.260 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:35.820 align:start position:0%
structure that was created because
 
00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
that's what we had
 
00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
I mean that's all we had was how many
 
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:40.980 align:start position:0%
deaths do you have what's the average
 
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
teacher salary what's the benefit
 
00:19:45.169 --> 00:19:45.179 align:start position:0%
package what's the how many nurses yet I
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
mean all that stuff was the only thing
 
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
we had at the time that we created the
 
00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
current system
 
00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.070 align:start position:0%
current system
now

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
we have a full plethora
 
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
of data that's available
 
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
that can be used in a much more I
 
00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
believe and much more significant way to
 
00:20:06.529 --> 00:20:06.539 align:start position:0%
begin to really look at student
 
00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:07.850 align:start position:0%
begin to really look at student
achievement

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:07.860 align:start position:0%
achievement
 
00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
all schools are doing
 
00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:12.660 align:start position:0%
um and the other thing that I think
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
that's implicit in this bill
 
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
is a much higher accountability
 
00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:22.140 align:start position:0%
of how the money is being spent
 
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
you don't have much accountability when
 
00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
you get four thousand dollars per kid
 
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
across the board
 
00:20:31.549 --> 00:20:31.559 align:start position:0%
you don't know what happens to that
 
00:20:31.559 --> 00:20:33.110 align:start position:0%
you don't know what happens to that
money

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:20:36.289 --> 00:20:36.299 align:start position:0%
with the concept of this provides a much
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
greater detailed accountability
 
00:20:42.049 --> 00:20:42.059 align:start position:0%
of how the money is being spent and
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
where there are problems
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
it's incumbent upon the school district
 
00:20:50.029 --> 00:20:50.039 align:start position:0%
then to create a plan upon which to deal
 
00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
with those students that's student
 
00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.049 align:start position:0%
with those students that's student
population

00:20:54.049 --> 00:20:54.059 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:56.820 align:start position:0%
that needs to become more competitive
 
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
and they have greater outcomes Etc
 
00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
so um I would just my comment was I took
 
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
from our meeting that we had last week
 
00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:08.220 align:start position:0%
just the data that's available now that
 
00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:10.140 align:start position:0%
that was just wasn't there before that
 
00:21:12.409 --> 00:21:12.419 align:start position:0%
that we should be able to use
 
00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:16.260 align:start position:0%
to provide a much more robust
 
00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
manual with which we basically create a
 
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
funding system
 
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you well just to tag in on that
 
00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.529 align:start position:0%
thank you well just to tag in on that
Mel

00:21:24.529 --> 00:21:24.539 align:start position:0%
Mel
 
00:21:24.539 --> 00:21:25.430 align:start position:0%
Mel
um

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:26.940 align:start position:0%
from that meeting we have with the
 
00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee for
 
00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
those here we were looking at one of the
 
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
issues which we brought up was we know
 
00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:35.940 align:start position:0%
that over the last
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
14 years that I've been here
 
00:21:42.649 --> 00:21:42.659 align:start position:0%
um that we've seen a slide
 
00:21:42.659 --> 00:21:44.529 align:start position:0%
um that we've seen a slide
in

00:21:44.529 --> 00:21:44.539 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:47.340 align:start position:0%
mathematics achievement
 
00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:49.919 align:start position:0%
at the middle school level
 
00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
and we've also seen that occur
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
even more rapidly since the pandemic and
 
00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
we know all the issues with the pandemic
 
00:22:00.409 --> 00:22:00.419 align:start position:0%
my concern that I brought up was we know
 
00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919 align:start position:0%
what the minimum standards for public
 
00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:04.140 align:start position:0%
school approval are how many on this
 
00:22:06.529 --> 00:22:06.539 align:start position:0%
committee have actually seen the
 
00:22:09.649 --> 00:22:09.659 align:start position:0%
academic standards that this state has
 
00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:13.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:16.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:20.029 --> 00:22:20.039 align:start position:0%
Fred that's okay there there you go the
 
00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
Frameworks are not to be considered that
 
00:22:24.289 --> 00:22:24.299 align:start position:0%
the Frameworks are basically guidelines
 
00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
and we no longer have Frameworks nor do
 
00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:29.100 align:start position:0%
we have those guidelines my concern is
 
00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.350 align:start position:0%
we have those guidelines my concern is
that

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
when we were looking for accountability
 
00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:35.720 align:start position:0%
we're using and I'm I'm a Believer in
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
statistics and and state assessments or
 
00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
assessing to determine there's a lot of
 
00:22:43.789 --> 00:22:43.799 align:start position:0%
different ways of doing it some schooly
 
00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
districts do it with their own locally
 
00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
developed diagnostic instruments like
 
00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
the star math or the nwea or some other
 
00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:52.620 align:start position:0%
type of instrument for assessment and
 
00:22:54.289 --> 00:22:54.299 align:start position:0%
they do that periodically through the
 
00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
school year
 
00:22:58.130 --> 00:22:58.140 align:start position:0%
they are measuring
 
00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:00.900 align:start position:0%
with an instrument that they feel most
 
00:23:03.409 --> 00:23:03.419 align:start position:0%
closely reflects what their curriculum
 
00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:05.820 align:start position:0%
is and what their instruction is in
 
00:23:08.029 --> 00:23:08.039 align:start position:0%
terms of the sequence that that
 
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
instruction occurs within that high
 
00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:11.340 align:start position:0%
school or that middle school or
 
00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
Elementary School
 
00:23:15.409 --> 00:23:15.419 align:start position:0%
we are assessing what the Statewide
 
00:23:15.419 --> 00:23:16.850 align:start position:0%
we are assessing what the Statewide
assessment

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:16.860 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
and we know we have that assessment
 
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
supposed to be built around our
 
00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.870 align:start position:0%
supposed to be built around our
standards

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
and but curriculum is a local
 
00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.190 align:start position:0%
and but curriculum is a local
responsibility

00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
00:23:30.409 --> 00:23:30.419 align:start position:0%
and when you teach it this year or the
 
00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:32.700 align:start position:0%
following year so we don't know if
 
00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily that those local curriculums
 
00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:38.460 align:start position:0%
are aligned with this instrument we're
 
00:23:41.149 --> 00:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
using to assess with many districts and
 
00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
in fact I was just working with a group
 
00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
in a school district this last week they
 
00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:47.220 align:start position:0%
they prefer to use their own assessment
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
they have to use the Statewide but they
 
00:23:50.029 --> 00:23:50.039 align:start position:0%
have their own assessments because they
 
00:23:51.409 --> 00:23:51.419 align:start position:0%
know that's measuring what they are in
 
00:23:52.909 --> 00:23:52.919 align:start position:0%
fact are teaching
 
00:23:55.549 --> 00:23:55.559 align:start position:0%
so I think there's a to a degree there's
 
00:23:59.090 --> 00:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
a disconnect in in the information we're
 
00:24:00.409 --> 00:24:00.419 align:start position:0%
getting back
 
00:24:03.529 --> 00:24:03.539 align:start position:0%
and when we do get it back how engaged
 
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
are we in working with those school
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
districts to try and show those places
 
00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:11.580 align:start position:0%
we need to to gain and I don't know if
 
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:30.780 align:start position:0%
standardized tests didn't necessarily
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
measure what children will learn in
 
00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:38.220 align:start position:0%
school and I got involved in the state
 
00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:59.570 align:start position:0%
school and I got involved in the state
foreign

00:24:59.570 --> 00:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:02.029 --> 00:25:02.039 align:start position:0%
so if a teacher was spending all her
 
00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
time in second grade teaching the
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
children about tents and and adding with
 
00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
making kids all those questions on the
 
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
stuff that they basically teach would be
 
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
eliminated because too many kids Library
 
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
it was today was taken as being too easy
 
00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:29.820 align:start position:0%
and too many kids because too many kids
 
00:25:33.049 --> 00:25:33.059 align:start position:0%
got right which left the testing and the
 
00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
questions to be all the kinds of things
 
00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
that we didn't spend a long time it's in
 
00:25:42.289 --> 00:25:42.299 align:start position:0%
second grade for example teaching so it
 
00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:44.940 align:start position:0%
has always been that Gap even with the
 
00:25:48.169 --> 00:25:48.179 align:start position:0%
tests that the state uses
 
00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
there has to be a better way of
 
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
assessing how a job is learning and
 
00:25:54.049 --> 00:25:54.059 align:start position:0%
whether the child is they've got
 
00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:56.940 align:start position:0%
cheating at the maximum level for that
 
00:25:59.330 --> 00:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
Child Benefits
 
00:26:03.169 --> 00:26:03.179 align:start position:0%
or something that's one size fits all
 
00:26:06.049 --> 00:26:06.059 align:start position:0%
but once you have different tests
 
00:26:07.789 --> 00:26:07.799 align:start position:0%
different methods being used in
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
different districts then you lose in
 
00:26:14.289 --> 00:26:14.299 align:start position:0%
your ability to compare you know
 
00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
so it's really important
 
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
okay that's 22 in my opinion so I would
 
00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:23.700 align:start position:0%
really love to see it
 
00:26:27.169 --> 00:26:27.179 align:start position:0%
measuring the results of school other
 
00:26:27.179 --> 00:26:28.669 align:start position:0%
measuring the results of school other
than

00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:26:28.679 --> 00:26:30.430 align:start position:0%
than
just

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:30.440 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:34.380 align:start position:0%
my little lunch for today
 
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
yeah we could talk forever on testing we
 
00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.330 align:start position:0%
yeah we could talk forever on testing we
could

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:38.340 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:50.590 align:start position:0%
could
um

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:54.289 --> 00:26:54.299 align:start position:0%
why people have chosen
 
00:26:58.909 --> 00:26:58.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
well I think that accountability when we
 
00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:02.820 align:start position:0%
say accountability is the strength of
 
00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:03.710 align:start position:0%
say accountability is the strength of
this

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
I'd like to ask the questions exactly
 
00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:08.940 align:start position:0%
how are you going to hold these
 
00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
districts accountable
 
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
what's the process and what's the
 
00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:14.220 align:start position:0%
process to make sure they're coming out
 
00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
with that performance outcome that we're
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
seeking based upon
 
00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:21.900 align:start position:0%
the fact that snapshots always does well
 
00:27:24.409 --> 00:27:24.419 align:start position:0%
in comparison to the rest of the states
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
and using the norm reference test that
 
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
we use
 
00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
but how do we you know how do we you
 
00:27:32.159 --> 00:27:33.470 align:start position:0%
but how do we you know how do we you
know

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:37.140 align:start position:0%
understand that the results
 
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
are reflecting the curriculum that's
 
00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
being taught I don't know in terms of
 
00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
that's a local decision and do we have
 
00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:47.580 align:start position:0%
the oversight from doe to ensure that
 
00:27:49.549 --> 00:27:49.559 align:start position:0%
you are teaching the curriculum the
 
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
academic standards that we set for the
 
00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.890 align:start position:0%
academic standards that we set for the
state

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
must have prevent a teacher from closing
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
the door and saying I'm going to do my
 
00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:03.649 align:start position:0%
the door and saying I'm going to do my
thing

00:28:03.649 --> 00:28:03.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
I don't know if we ever get to that
 
00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
accountability we're looking for in the
 
00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
dollars this is just basically
 
00:28:12.529 --> 00:28:12.539 align:start position:0%
we're looking at averages here
 
00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:15.240 align:start position:0%
we're not looking at individuals
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.909 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:21.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
what happens in the future
 
00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:28.140 align:start position:0%
I think I talked about that a while ago
 
00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:31.500 align:start position:0%
when what happens from the kids we the
 
00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:34.750 align:start position:0%
when what happens from the kids we the
system

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:39.409 --> 00:28:39.419 align:start position:0%
and that's what in my opinion up smooth
 
00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:41.700 align:start position:0%
Sports to make sure that we have
 
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
students going out into the world or
 
00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:47.460 align:start position:0%
preparing for and also appear to be
 
00:28:49.789 --> 00:28:49.799 align:start position:0%
citibully those are the most of our
 
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
calls came back and rocks you know
 
00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
anybody gets education so they can move
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
up to the ladder and everybody learns
 
00:28:58.490 --> 00:28:58.500 align:start position:0%
how system works so they don't get Swept
 
00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
Away by another one
 
00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.909 align:start position:0%
Away by another one
and

00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:01.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:04.620 align:start position:0%
but we don't do that what we do to a
 
00:29:07.549 --> 00:29:07.559 align:start position:0%
degree don't we we we have the
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
performance indicators that are reported
 
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
at the end of the year annually dealing
 
00:29:15.529 --> 00:29:15.539 align:start position:0%
with discipline with the ASVAB how they
 
00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
test out in the military I'm going to go
 
00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:18.140 align:start position:0%
on the post-secondary education
 
00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:20.700 align:start position:0%
disciplinary issues
 
00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:23.340 align:start position:0%
um all there there must be a good 13 of
 
00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:25.620 align:start position:0%
those indicators that we we measure
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
along with the Statewide achievement
 
00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.230 align:start position:0%
along with the Statewide achievement
tests

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
tests
 
00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
no we have it every year when we get
 
00:29:39.649 --> 00:29:39.659 align:start position:0%
well we have it based upon yeah our
 
00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:41.820 align:start position:0%
graduation those are a graduation but we
 
00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
also have grades three through eight and
 
00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:01.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
I'm not consistent across the state in
 
00:30:06.649 --> 00:30:06.659 align:start position:0%
terms of when the instruction of being
 
00:30:09.769 --> 00:30:09.779 align:start position:0%
except for the youngster so the state go
 
00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
on to test is still going to show you
 
00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:14.340 align:start position:0%
how he did but they may not receive that
 
00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
information again
 
00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:19.260 align:start position:0%
so which becomes then timing with the
 
00:30:21.289 --> 00:30:21.299 align:start position:0%
German level of accountability that
 
00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
representative miles talking about that
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
that has affected by the results of the
 
00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:28.260 align:start position:0%
academic testing is the Baseline
 
00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:30.200 align:start position:0%
academic testing is not going to
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
situation yeah they're trying to do it
 
00:30:35.149 --> 00:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
that way but that's not raise the
 
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:41.340 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:44.100 align:start position:0%
you're not we have multiple purpose then
 
00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:47.100 align:start position:0%
then you can use you can use a state
 
00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:55.740 align:start position:0%
more funding or less money based on
 
00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:58.789 align:start position:0%
more funding or less money based on
Halloween

00:30:58.789 --> 00:30:58.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:01.549 --> 00:31:01.559 align:start position:0%
if those local curriculums
 
00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't know if they do right now
 
00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
or not that's that how will we ever
 
00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:14.700 align:start position:0%
determine and learn that
 
00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:24.950 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:28.130 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:28.140 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:31:32.029 --> 00:31:32.039 align:start position:0%
but when when I was doing this studying
 
00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:34.799 align:start position:0%
studying about this when we talk about
 
00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:37.500 align:start position:0%
the national tests and the international
 
00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:40.260 align:start position:0%
tests I would always support So formally
 
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
in mathematics it was pointed out yeah
 
00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:47.580 align:start position:0%
if the test was given say in eighth
 
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
grade then our students scored below the
 
00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:53.700 align:start position:0%
kids from Finland it's because the kids
 
00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:56.820 align:start position:0%
can Finland and already had algebra and
 
00:31:59.210 --> 00:31:59.220 align:start position:0%
our kids didn't get until next year so
 
00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:01.140 align:start position:0%
it was that that same kind of thing that
 
00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
Steve was talking about when it was
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
taught wasn't that our kids
 
00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:09.240 align:start position:0%
were not cheating they just weren't
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
cheating in a subject that they hadn't
 
00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:13.860 align:start position:0%
learned yet
 
00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
um you know I remember the social
 
00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
studies and the tests that they had in
 
00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
the 11th grade
 
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:37.990 align:start position:0%
the 11th grade
um

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:40.740 align:start position:0%
that's that's exactly why
 
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
a number of years ago we took the
 
00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:46.260 align:start position:0%
responsibility for assessing social
 
00:32:49.549 --> 00:32:49.559 align:start position:0%
studies away from the state and handed
 
00:32:51.769 --> 00:32:51.779 align:start position:0%
it down to the local districts to have
 
00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:53.460 align:start position:0%
an assessment done that's in statute
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:32:57.889 --> 00:32:57.899 align:start position:0%
but you know in terms of
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
trying to to
 
00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
target funds to help those groups and
 
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
those areas which need that support I
 
00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
can remember we had a program called
 
00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
math learning communities
 
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
and that program was one which was
 
00:33:15.289 --> 00:33:15.299 align:start position:0%
initiated through bathorian over at the
 
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
community college system over nhdi
 
00:33:21.169 --> 00:33:21.179 align:start position:0%
and at the end of the 10th grade
 
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
or towards the end we would
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
have the um what do they call it then
 
00:33:29.529 --> 00:33:29.539 align:start position:0%
the accuplacer the Next Generation
 
00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:32.460 align:start position:0%
accuplacer which was was done at that
 
00:33:34.009 --> 00:33:34.019 align:start position:0%
time for going all over the
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education through the
 
00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:37.740 align:start position:0%
community college level we were also
 
00:33:39.769 --> 00:33:39.779 align:start position:0%
administering it for under this grant
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
program to students coming out of
 
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
Algebra 1 in the 10th grade
 
00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
those that scored a 63 or lower were
 
00:33:53.649 --> 00:33:53.659 align:start position:0%
seen by the teacher by parent and by the
 
00:33:56.509 --> 00:33:56.519 align:start position:0%
others in the school as probably going
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
to have a difficult time going into
 
00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
algebra 2. so then the option was
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
available to go to either course one
 
00:34:06.529 --> 00:34:06.539 align:start position:0%
which was an advanced mathematics which
 
00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
was built on learning style and and and
 
00:34:13.129 --> 00:34:13.139 align:start position:0%
teaching style and more of a Hands-On
 
00:34:15.169 --> 00:34:15.179 align:start position:0%
and and it brought all a different way
 
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:17.820 align:start position:0%
of teaching in and then there was if
 
00:34:19.849 --> 00:34:19.859 align:start position:0%
they had a 63 or lower they went into
 
00:34:22.849 --> 00:34:22.859 align:start position:0%
that if they had a score which is
 
00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:24.780 align:start position:0%
similar a little bit higher they they
 
00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:26.220 align:start position:0%
could go into what they called
 
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
quantitative math later on in the fourth
 
00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:33.060 align:start position:0%
year which was the course two which they
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
would get the credit for the
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
post-secondary math requirement
 
00:34:40.669 --> 00:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
um we had about 35 high schools involved
 
00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:42.780 align:start position:0%
in with that the funding has now stopped
 
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
and the program even though it's on the
 
00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
books and statute is no longer used and
 
00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
I talked to Beth this morning following
 
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
our meeting
 
00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
I said why why are we not doing it she
 
00:34:55.369 --> 00:34:55.379 align:start position:0%
said it's all about funding we made a
 
00:34:57.890 --> 00:34:57.900 align:start position:0%
lot of progress and we were seeing an
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
increase of pure or a decrease of
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
remedial students coming in the
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education which at that
 
00:35:06.349 --> 00:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
time we had 60 percent that needed
 
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
remedial mathematics and post-secondary
 
00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:12.420 align:start position:0%
in the associates degree and of that of
 
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
that 60 percent 50 percent never got the
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
associate's degree but spent money
 
00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:20.700 align:start position:0%
trying and so it was lost time lost
 
00:35:23.569 --> 00:35:23.579 align:start position:0%
effort lost money and so there's a
 
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
program which was obviously doing
 
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
something that
 
00:35:30.109 --> 00:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
when the grant stopped there was no
 
00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
money available for teacher training
 
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
there was no money for materials and
 
00:35:37.069 --> 00:35:37.079 align:start position:0%
it's kind of dissolved even though it's
 
00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
on the books and stats right now I think
 
00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:41.220 align:start position:0%
it's 194 colon
 
00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
I I think
 
00:35:46.609 --> 00:35:46.619 align:start position:0%
there's a small title there which
 
00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:49.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:52.980 align:start position:0%
so back to funding that's also funding
 
00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
I I'd like to have if if we could have
 
00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:07.740 align:start position:0%
Dave give some more feedback to us how
 
00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:09.780 align:start position:0%
this hat works for the Swap and how this
 
00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:12.780 align:start position:0%
transition really unfolds
 
00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:15.300 align:start position:0%
see so we can see we had a spreadsheet I
 
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
don't have mine with me today yeah we
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
did have one but to take us through that
 
00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
I got at the house so I I can look at it
 
00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
but I was hoping that we could go
 
00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:35.300 align:start position:0%
no there was a spreadsheet that he had
 
00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:38.220 align:start position:0%
which showed how this impacted
 
00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
everywhere in the state all districts
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
feels very pretty
 
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
the other other part of the equation
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
which I wrote when I was on the study
 
00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
commission with you representative Myler
 
00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:00.900 align:start position:0%
was how do we measure the effectiveness
 
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
of leadership in the building
 
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
I'm a strong proponent that strong
 
00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:07.849 align:start position:0%
I'm a strong proponent that strong
leadership

00:37:07.849 --> 00:37:07.859 align:start position:0%
leadership
 
00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:10.740 align:start position:0%
is necessary to have strong growth in
 
00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:12.349 align:start position:0%
is necessary to have strong growth in
achievement

00:37:12.349 --> 00:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
achievement
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
from the student side
 
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
how do you measure that how do we know
 
00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:19.980 align:start position:0%
that the the the schools you may have
 
00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:22.140 align:start position:0%
some schools which are
 
00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:26.460 align:start position:0%
getting decent funding Lisa doe 25 form
 
00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:29.220 align:start position:0%
reflects it but their scores are not
 
00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:30.829 align:start position:0%
reflects it but their scores are not
there

00:37:30.829 --> 00:37:30.839 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:37:30.839 --> 00:37:32.870 align:start position:0%
there
why

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:35.640 align:start position:0%
is that one of those non-tangibles
 
00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:38.460 align:start position:0%
aspiration of the community
 
00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:47.220 align:start position:0%
it's interesting I was talking to a
 
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
friend of mine a young teacher
 
00:37:52.609 --> 00:37:52.619 align:start position:0%
and he has a new principle this year
 
00:37:55.849 --> 00:37:55.859 align:start position:0%
and he just was excited I mean he was he
 
00:37:58.430 --> 00:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
was visibly excited
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
about what she was doing how she was
 
00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
doing it not not the one that he retired
 
00:38:06.349 --> 00:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
was bad at all he was good too but it
 
00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:08.940 align:start position:0%
was just nice I can't see
 
00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:11.700 align:start position:0%
a teacher who was just excited about
 
00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
what he was saying and experiencing and
 
00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:14.810 align:start position:0%
what he was saying and experiencing and
feeling

00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:14.820 align:start position:0%
feeling
 
00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:17.880 align:start position:0%
with this new administrator that he had
 
00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:21.060 align:start position:0%
and um you're right I don't know how you
 
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
measure it other than
 
00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:25.380 align:start position:0%
you know you have to measure I would
 
00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:26.820 align:start position:0%
think you have to look to see how the
 
00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:29.220 align:start position:0%
kids do old I think that the ultimate
 
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
the ultimate test to me is how the kids
 
00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
are performing
 
00:38:37.609 --> 00:38:37.619 align:start position:0%
and uh how do we provide the support in
 
00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:39.900 align:start position:0%
those areas that they're not before and
 
00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
I think that's that's been my concern
 
00:38:43.609 --> 00:38:43.619 align:start position:0%
since I've been on this committee and
 
00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
that is how do you help school districts
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
that need additional resources whether
 
00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
it be
 
00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:53.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal standpoint or from the Personnel
 
00:38:56.810 --> 00:38:56.820 align:start position:0%
standpoint or the actual curriculum that
 
00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:03.420 align:start position:0%
that's that's a concern that I have
 
00:39:06.109 --> 00:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
and I and I think frankly what we're
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
talking about here in 1680
 
00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
can get to that because right now I I
 
00:39:14.569 --> 00:39:14.579 align:start position:0%
just don't see I don't see the
 
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
accountability there for how we fund
 
00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:18.300 align:start position:0%
schools I mean
 
00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:21.060 align:start position:0%
everybody gets the same amount of money
 
00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
that's it you get the check that's it
 
00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:24.540 align:start position:0%
how do we
 
00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:26.700 align:start position:0%
how do we provide some incentives for
 
00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:28.140 align:start position:0%
people to
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
to perform and give kids
 
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
an equal opportunity across the state
 
00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:45.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:56.460 align:start position:0%
about the weather
 
00:39:59.450 --> 00:39:59.460 align:start position:0%
what he told me was the constitution of
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
the state requires all children
 
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
receive a saint it's the Constitution
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
says they have to voluntary evil
 
00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:10.980 align:start position:0%
and that was the reason why when they
 
00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:12.660 align:start position:0%
were talking about
 
00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:13.609 align:start position:0%
were talking about
um

00:40:13.609 --> 00:40:13.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
formulas he was in women why it ended up
 
00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:18.780 align:start position:0%
with everybody with the same it's
 
00:40:20.089 --> 00:40:20.099 align:start position:0%
because you couldn't
 
00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:23.220 align:start position:0%
you couldn't we give more to one
 
00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:26.540 align:start position:0%
Community than to another because it was
 
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional student
 
00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:31.820 align:start position:0%
does anybody know anything about that
 
00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:34.140 align:start position:0%
does that ever come up with any of the
 
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
discussions or was it just a private
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
conversation in the United
 
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
it comes out of the Londonderry and
 
00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
Claremont cases that's where all evolved
 
00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:44.690 align:start position:0%
Claremont cases that's where all evolved
from

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:44.700 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:46.740 align:start position:0%
and you cannot
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh discriminate in your funding due to
 
00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:50.630 align:start position:0%
uh discriminate in your funding due to
the

00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:53.700 align:start position:0%
the wealth of a community their poverty
 
00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:57.060 align:start position:0%
or that you've got the they all deserve
 
00:40:59.810 --> 00:40:59.820 align:start position:0%
the same base amount
 
00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:02.460 align:start position:0%
and then it's made up differently and
 
00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
that formula came out in 2000 eight
 
00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
had physical capacity just variate when
 
00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
in it and that's where they use
 
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
something likened to the equalized
 
00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
property valuation and the medium family
 
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
income to whether a municipality
 
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
qualified for additional money outside
 
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
of the basic adequacy which was what
 
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
three thousand
 
00:41:29.329 --> 00:41:29.339 align:start position:0%
456 something like that and and
 
00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:32.700 align:start position:0%
differentiated a that's your adequacy
 
00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:35.700 align:start position:0%
amount right there everything
 
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:42.900 align:start position:0%
and that money's not it's sent to the
 
00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:45.980 align:start position:0%
school district and it's not targeted
 
00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:48.420 align:start position:0%
otherwise differentiated aid for special
 
00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:51.300 align:start position:0%
education within that differentiated Aid
 
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
it can be used Any Which Way
 
00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
um along with the English language
 
00:41:59.630 --> 00:41:59.640 align:start position:0%
learner and the special education there
 
00:42:01.609 --> 00:42:01.619 align:start position:0%
was a category for special education
 
00:42:04.849 --> 00:42:04.859 align:start position:0%
issue recall on that based on poverty
 
00:42:08.329 --> 00:42:08.339 align:start position:0%
and when it got up to 48 or a higher
 
00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:10.200 align:start position:0%
poverty in your school you got another
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
whole base amount on top of that for
 
00:42:17.329 --> 00:42:17.339 align:start position:0%
each child in that school
 
00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:21.180 align:start position:0%
that formula in itself was I thought a
 
00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:22.740 align:start position:0%
very good formula we never funded it
 
00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:28.790 align:start position:0%
very good formula we never funded it
properly

00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
in fact that's the formula I was who was
 
00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:33.660 align:start position:0%
the senator at that time that was did
 
00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
that um I wasn't here I was in Alaska at
 
00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
the time but
 
00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:39.660 align:start position:0%
um I felt during the commission study
 
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
she was on the the commission
 
00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:45.170 align:start position:0%
she was on the the commission
yeah

00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:45.180 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:42:47.089 --> 00:42:47.099 align:start position:0%
no not Nancy
 
00:42:47.099 --> 00:42:48.670 align:start position:0%
no not Nancy
now

00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:51.420 align:start position:0%
yeah start with an s
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
likes but
 
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:54.770 align:start position:0%
likes but
um

00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:54.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
I'll think of it but uh I thought that
 
00:42:59.569 --> 00:42:59.579 align:start position:0%
that you know when I was in a commission
 
00:43:02.089 --> 00:43:02.099 align:start position:0%
study I would like to see us really just
 
00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
along with the organ book formula if we
 
00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:06.540 align:start position:0%
funded things properly all along we
 
00:43:18.309 --> 00:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:20.940 align:start position:0%
parents who are well educated from New
 
00:43:23.329 --> 00:43:23.339 align:start position:0%
York have come up to walk to New
 
00:43:26.589 --> 00:43:26.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to live a slight in the 19th
 
00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:35.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:37.609 --> 00:43:37.619 align:start position:0%
my mother-in-law wrote
 
00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:40.140 align:start position:0%
talking about the importance of funding
 
00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
education to get the state of New
 
00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:45.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in 1951
 
00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:48.300 align:start position:0%
it's the same problem
 
00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:50.460 align:start position:0%
yeah if you need another one down for
 
00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
represent Hall
 
00:43:55.849 --> 00:43:55.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:58.370 --> 00:43:58.380 align:start position:0%
I think that today we can you know there
 
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
are certain things we can agree upon
 
00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:03.180 align:start position:0%
um I some of the funding mechanisms and
 
00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
I have some problems with but one thing
 
00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
I can agree upon is this is the data
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
report that I put together back when we
 
00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:13.140 align:start position:0%
were doing the subsequent study with uh
 
00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
representative umberger where I try to
 
00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:17.930 align:start position:0%
representative umberger where I try to
identify

00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:17.940 align:start position:0%
identify
 
00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:21.180 align:start position:0%
by quartiles here on the Equis property
 
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
valuation per pupil and you can see
 
00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:28.740 align:start position:0%
there on on group number one there where
 
00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
they have less than 660 000 per pupil
 
00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
there were a total of 26 uh
 
00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:38.460 align:start position:0%
municipalities in that quartile
 
00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:41.460 align:start position:0%
and or in that group and you can see
 
00:44:44.809 --> 00:44:44.819 align:start position:0%
that in quartile 1 and quartile 2
 
00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
you had and that's as we look at the one
 
00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:50.700 align:start position:0%
two three and four one and two are below
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
proficiency on our Statewide assessment
 
00:44:55.490 --> 00:44:55.500 align:start position:0%
now so one and two on this are also but
 
00:44:58.370 --> 00:44:58.380 align:start position:0%
the quartile wise so it
 
00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
um you can see that there's 85 percent
 
00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
of the students in those 85 percent of
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
those districts the students were in
 
00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
quartiles one and two
 
00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:12.900 align:start position:0%
when associated with dollars if you go
 
00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
all the way up to group four
 
00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:18.660 align:start position:0%
and you look at those which have one
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
million dollars plus per pupil on
 
00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:23.220 align:start position:0%
equalized property valuation
 
00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:28.740 align:start position:0%
you can see that there are 73 percent or
 
00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:31.740 align:start position:0%
excuse me that no there's there's uh 70
 
00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
60 percent
 
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
of the students are in Courthouse three
 
00:45:37.609 --> 00:45:37.619 align:start position:0%
and four
 
00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
so it shows that there is is
 
00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:41.690 align:start position:0%
so it shows that there is is
relationship

00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:41.700 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:44.700 align:start position:0%
and these this was taken out of our old
 
00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:46.200 align:start position:0%
achievement test which we have the
 
00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
Statewide hasn't changed a lot that it
 
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
shows that there's a relationship
 
00:45:57.069 --> 00:45:57.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:59.210 --> 00:45:59.220 align:start position:0%
that's something we went into the whole
 
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
study knowing that
 
00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:03.780 align:start position:0%
and I I don't think there's any denying
 
00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:04.550 align:start position:0%
and I I don't think there's any denying
that

00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of other variables but
 
00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
this is one of the outcomes right here
 
00:46:09.359 --> 00:46:16.510 align:start position:0%
this is one of the outcomes right here
yeah

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
that's a separate category I I pull them
 
00:46:22.569 --> 00:46:22.579 align:start position:0%
out and you can see that
 
00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:26.940 align:start position:0%
in of the 13 cities 11 of them are in
 
00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:28.980 align:start position:0%
quartiles one and two
 
00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
and there were what two cities in three
 
00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:48.609 --> 00:46:48.619 align:start position:0%
Incorporated Manchester National

Franklin Berlin
 
00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:54.309 align:start position:0%
Franklin Berlin
yeah

00:46:54.309 --> 00:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:46:57.650 --> 00:46:57.660 align:start position:0%
significance yeah and population
 
00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
the two cities the two cities in the
 
00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:11.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
lebanon's way up
 
00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:19.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
it says a group of information in the
 
00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:31.020 align:start position:0%
case that cities are more likely to have
 
00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
high numbers of low performing students
 
00:47:35.569 --> 00:47:35.579 align:start position:0%
regardless equalized valuation Keen
 
00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:37.260 align:start position:0%
enforcements being the exception
 
00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:39.720 align:start position:0%
according to this data
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
those were the two at that time which
 
00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
were just not reflecting what the other
 
00:47:46.849 --> 00:47:46.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:46.859 --> 00:47:53.150 align:start position:0%
 
2018.

00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:55.400 align:start position:0%
and we used it in that study back then
 
00:47:58.250 --> 00:47:58.260 align:start position:0%
to come up with recommendations and this
 
00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:00.420 align:start position:0%
was also shared during the commission
 
00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:01.550 align:start position:0%
was also shared during the commission
study

00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
and it kind of echoed what air
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:15.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
invest more than students
 
00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
be more of their investment
 
00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
moving forward
 
00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:24.589 align:start position:0%
moving forward
successfully

00:48:24.589 --> 00:48:24.599 align:start position:0%
successfully
 
00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
that's what appears to with crows and
 
00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:36.170 align:start position:0%
that's what appears to with crows and
achievement

00:48:36.170 --> 00:48:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:38.720 align:start position:0%
you have to invest more
 
00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:42.300 align:start position:0%
to bring those folks in quadrupt wanting
 
00:48:44.569 --> 00:48:44.579 align:start position:0%
to up
 
00:48:48.589 --> 00:48:48.599 align:start position:0%
and I think I think so quite a while on
 
00:48:50.569 --> 00:48:50.579 align:start position:0%
that point Steve what the commission was
 
00:48:50.579 --> 00:48:51.470 align:start position:0%
that point Steve what the commission was
doing

00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
was taking the current amount of money
 
00:48:59.089 --> 00:48:59.099 align:start position:0%
that has been allocated to fund schools
 
00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:01.740 align:start position:0%
and but allocating it in a different
 
00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
format to deal with exactly what you're
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
talking about and those areas that had
 
00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
greater need
 
00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
that that's where some more funds need
 
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
to go in there with with the
 
00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:15.660 align:start position:0%
accountability function in there I think
 
00:49:16.849 --> 00:49:16.859 align:start position:0%
it was what
 
00:49:19.370 --> 00:49:19.380 align:start position:0%
five years there was a five-year time
 
00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:20.450 align:start position:0%
five years there was a five-year time
frame

00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:20.460 align:start position:0%
frame
 
00:49:23.690 --> 00:49:23.700 align:start position:0%
for schools that were low performing
 
00:49:25.309 --> 00:49:25.319 align:start position:0%
to begin to turn around because you
 
00:49:27.050 --> 00:49:27.060 align:start position:0%
can't turn around schools just overnight
 
00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
I mean it takes time
 
00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
but it deals with the leadership it
 
00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
deals with the funding and that's what
 
00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:34.980 align:start position:0%
the commission was talking to us how do
 
00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:36.780 align:start position:0%
you take that current amount of money
 
00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:39.780 align:start position:0%
not additional money in the pool you
 
00:49:41.809 --> 00:49:41.819 align:start position:0%
take that pool of money
 
00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:44.220 align:start position:0%
and you basically allocate it in a
 
00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:45.420 align:start position:0%
different kind of a way than what we're
 
00:49:48.410 --> 00:49:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:50.569 --> 00:49:50.579 align:start position:0%
well it's also imperative that you're
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
you're measuring what you're teaching
 
00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:54.770 align:start position:0%
you're measuring what you're teaching
foreign

00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:54.780 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:50:02.809 --> 00:50:02.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
no but there's there's a lot of
 
00:50:07.370 --> 00:50:07.380 align:start position:0%
contributors to what we're doing and
 
00:50:09.770 --> 00:50:09.780 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to fund and I I
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
believe that any any kind of
 
00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation I would offer is a
 
00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:18.540 align:start position:0%
supplement to up or down to the up I
 
00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:21.300 align:start position:0%
would also say that there's
 
00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:23.700 align:start position:0%
like the academic standards how do we
 
00:50:26.210 --> 00:50:26.220 align:start position:0%
ensure that the the tests we're using is
 
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:28.020 align:start position:0%
measuring the academic standards as
 
00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
taught in that particular school we do
 
00:50:32.569 --> 00:50:32.579 align:start position:0%
not have control over instruction and
 
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
curriculum and so you Mr principal would
 
00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:38.940 align:start position:0%
be teaching something U.S history at a
 
00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
different grade level than what this
 
00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
instrument would be measuring so your
 
00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
kids would never show it but it doesn't
 
00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:46.260 align:start position:0%
mean they're not walking out the door at
 
00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:54.170 --> 00:50:54.180 align:start position:0%
but see I don't want to be funding
 
00:50:57.770 --> 00:50:57.780 align:start position:0%
though a lot of money based upon some
 
00:50:59.510 --> 00:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
data we're getting which is not
 
00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:01.260 align:start position:0%
reflective of the quality of teaching
 
00:51:02.930 --> 00:51:02.940 align:start position:0%
you've just mentioned representative
 
00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:06.780 align:start position:0%
Miler that that there was a change in
 
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
leadership princip in the school and
 
00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:11.640 align:start position:0%
kids are excited teachers are excited
 
00:51:14.089 --> 00:51:14.099 align:start position:0%
that's exactly the same occurrence
 
00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
that's occurring in Woodsville high
 
00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:17.220 align:start position:0%
school right now we have a young man
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
that came in from across the from
 
00:51:23.230 --> 00:51:23.240 align:start position:0%
Vermont and and has just turned the page
 
00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:25.980 align:start position:0%
on that school as far as attitude and
 
00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:28.500 align:start position:0%
aspiration of students involvement of
 
00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:30.660 align:start position:0%
parents involvement of the staff in the
 
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
schools there's ownership in what
 
00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
they're doing
 
00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:37.140 align:start position:0%
it's not status quo and that's something
 
00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:39.240 align:start position:0%
I don't think you can that that's not
 
00:51:40.609 --> 00:51:40.619 align:start position:0%
something that money necessarily is
 
00:51:42.650 --> 00:51:42.660 align:start position:0%
going to pay if this guy came from the
 
00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:49.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
Leadership School attitude and teacher
 
00:51:55.549 --> 00:51:55.559 align:start position:0%
attitude and all those things are
 
00:52:10.450 --> 00:52:10.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:14.530 --> 00:52:14.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
it might be but today the high Works in
 
00:52:23.329 --> 00:52:23.339 align:start position:0%
here worldwide right right what he is
 
00:52:25.309 --> 00:52:25.319 align:start position:0%
then we have
 
00:52:30.069 --> 00:52:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
the thing we have in our philosophy is
 
00:52:36.349 --> 00:52:36.359 align:start position:0%
it makes no sense to me to continue to
 
00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
keep on doing the same thing over and
 
00:52:40.609 --> 00:52:40.619 align:start position:0%
over and over and over again
 
00:52:43.849 --> 00:52:43.859 align:start position:0%
and extracted results I mean there's so
 
00:52:43.859 --> 00:52:45.970 align:start position:0%
and extracted results I mean there's so
much

00:52:45.970 --> 00:52:45.980 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
I mean it just doesn't make any sense to
 
00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:51.660 align:start position:0%
do that but we now it's time to move and
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
then at least we have a plan to try
 
00:52:56.329 --> 00:52:56.339 align:start position:0%
something to improve it if we go back
 
00:52:58.430 --> 00:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
and say well we have to worry about how
 
00:52:59.750 --> 00:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
the principal is going to the
 
00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:06.300 align:start position:0%
I think we have to take a step and say
 
00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:07.260 align:start position:0%
you know what
 
00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:09.720 align:start position:0%
we have to move because what we're doing
 
00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:11.640 align:start position:0%
we know is not working it's not working
 
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
to make audiences in New Hampshire
 
00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
educated and want to stay in New
 
00:53:23.569 --> 00:53:23.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:26.089 --> 00:53:26.099 align:start position:0%
helps me more than anything because the
 
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
fact that we need to make sure that New
 
00:53:31.790 --> 00:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire improves and that this this
 
00:53:34.549 --> 00:53:34.559 align:start position:0%
current method of this like this current
 
00:53:37.309 --> 00:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
method does not work but that work when
 
00:53:39.069 --> 00:53:39.079 align:start position:0%
we did this
 
00:53:42.430 --> 00:53:42.440 align:start position:0%
but we've gone past that series
 
00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:54.309 align:start position:0%
but we've gone past that series
[Music]

00:53:54.309 --> 00:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:58.430 --> 00:53:58.440 align:start position:0%
but we can't hold this up way for the
 
00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
social emotional types of variables
 
00:54:03.650 --> 00:54:03.660 align:start position:0%
and Leadership and goes back to
 
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
effective typical things
 
00:54:08.890 --> 00:54:08.900 align:start position:0%
like this
 
00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
they stopped potatoes we go back to
 
00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
college you know quit until we stopped I
 
00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:15.589 align:start position:0%
college you know quit until we stopped I
mean

00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:54:19.490 --> 00:54:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:22.990 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:54:22.990 --> 00:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
but you know what we would use to
 
00:54:30.049 --> 00:54:30.059 align:start position:0%
determine whether a school or students
 
00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:32.460 align:start position:0%
were being successful or not
 
00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:33.170 align:start position:0%
were being successful or not
um

00:54:33.170 --> 00:54:33.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:35.450 --> 00:54:35.460 align:start position:0%
and it is struggling we've talked about
 
00:54:37.609 --> 00:54:37.619 align:start position:0%
the adhdi
 
00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
with Beth Norm uh in that 63 percent off
 
00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
they used on the activist where the
 
00:54:46.849 --> 00:54:46.859 align:start position:0%
students come in most of the students
 
00:54:48.410 --> 00:54:48.420 align:start position:0%
going into the community college system
 
00:54:53.710 --> 00:54:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:58.430 --> 00:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
who were below 63 they know exactly what
 
00:55:02.569 --> 00:55:02.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:09.010 --> 00:55:09.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:11.930 --> 00:55:11.940 align:start position:0%
13 of the kids going into the community
 
00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:15.780 align:start position:0%
college system are testing to below 63
 
00:55:18.530 --> 00:55:18.540 align:start position:0%
or even lower and then the issue becomes
 
00:55:20.809 --> 00:55:20.819 align:start position:0%
okay what's and that's not an issue what
 
00:55:23.890 --> 00:55:23.900 align:start position:0%
did we teach out for the ninth graders
 
00:55:27.410 --> 00:55:27.420 align:start position:0%
that is those those are people who met
 
00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:29.640 align:start position:0%
the whatever the full range was that
 
00:55:32.329 --> 00:55:32.339 align:start position:0%
they could yeah in high school and
 
00:55:34.970 --> 00:55:34.980 align:start position:0%
that's good
 
00:55:40.250 --> 00:55:40.260 align:start position:0%
CBS the the agriculture nhti
 
00:55:42.730 --> 00:55:42.740 align:start position:0%
they don't store it become
 
00:55:45.170 --> 00:55:45.180 align:start position:0%
smaller Partners but they're ways of
 
00:55:46.490 --> 00:55:46.500 align:start position:0%
figuring out
 
00:55:48.650 --> 00:55:48.660 align:start position:0%
you know starting I think starting to
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
get into what what are specifics of high
 
00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:53.640 align:start position:0%
school my schools in this case didn't
 
00:55:55.309 --> 00:55:55.319 align:start position:0%
need to be looked at and that's just
 
00:55:57.650 --> 00:55:57.660 align:start position:0%
just the math that's just the math let's
 
00:55:58.970 --> 00:55:58.980 align:start position:0%
just look here
 
00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:02.460 align:start position:0%
thank you I think that um where you're
 
00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:04.260 align:start position:0%
hitting on this issue of accountability
 
00:56:07.549 --> 00:56:07.559 align:start position:0%
and using the data we have that should
 
00:56:09.890 --> 00:56:09.900 align:start position:0%
be something that when we look at and
 
00:56:11.690 --> 00:56:11.700 align:start position:0%
hear that the strength of this bill is
 
00:56:13.730 --> 00:56:13.740 align:start position:0%
that these performance outcomes and then
 
00:56:16.250 --> 00:56:16.260 align:start position:0%
there will be accountability I I think
 
00:56:18.650 --> 00:56:18.660 align:start position:0%
the question has to be always asked what
 
00:56:19.730 --> 00:56:19.740 align:start position:0%
how are you going to get that
 
00:56:21.410 --> 00:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
accountability what how are you going to
 
00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
discern it is it going to be based on
 
00:56:25.069 --> 00:56:25.079 align:start position:0%
the data that's submitted every year to
 
00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:27.240 align:start position:0%
doe which shows the number of kids in
 
00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
this category this category in this
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
category or is there going to are we
 
00:56:32.329 --> 00:56:32.339 align:start position:0%
going to actually take something like
 
00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
bathorian had a community college system
 
00:56:38.569 --> 00:56:38.579 align:start position:0%
and go back and find out okay these are
 
00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
the places these students are coming
 
00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
from and I wouldn't be surprised that if
 
00:56:45.770 --> 00:56:45.780 align:start position:0%
you had some schools which had kids
 
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
coming like that that came out of
 
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
schools which have the dollars to
 
00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:53.640 align:start position:0%
deliver a a pretty good education
 
00:56:55.609 --> 00:56:55.619 align:start position:0%
otherwise it wouldn't be just all poor
 
00:56:55.619 --> 00:56:56.569 align:start position:0%
otherwise it wouldn't be just all poor
communities

00:56:56.569 --> 00:56:56.579 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:56:59.210 --> 00:56:59.220 align:start position:0%
if if 60 of the kids arrive in the
 
00:57:01.250 --> 00:57:01.260 align:start position:0%
community college system we're we're not
 
00:57:03.829 --> 00:57:03.839 align:start position:0%
proficient in mathematics that's a
 
00:57:07.010 --> 00:57:07.020 align:start position:0%
deeper deeper issue and by throwing
 
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
money at something do we always repair
 
00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:09.770 align:start position:0%
money at something do we always repair
it

00:57:09.770 --> 00:57:09.780 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:57:12.410 --> 00:57:12.420 align:start position:0%
not always you know we want to get to
 
00:57:14.809 --> 00:57:14.819 align:start position:0%
those efficiencies and good use of our
 
00:57:18.530 --> 00:57:18.540 align:start position:0%
dollars and see the student achieve I
 
00:57:20.589 --> 00:57:20.599 align:start position:0%
think there are some
 
00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
non-dollar issues which highly
 
00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
contribute to Performance of students
 
00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:27.720 align:start position:0%
and we can't negate that
 
00:57:29.690 --> 00:57:29.700 align:start position:0%
and don't think that this is going to be
 
00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:31.740 align:start position:0%
the fix to it all I don't think it's
 
00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
going to be the fix to it all
 
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
right president Porter had her hand up
 
00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:49.130 align:start position:0%
right president Porter had her hand up
first

00:57:49.130 --> 00:57:49.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:52.980 align:start position:0%
most likely students coming from
 
00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:56.850 align:start position:0%

00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
would be not all over the place but
 
00:58:09.530 --> 00:58:09.540 align:start position:0%
someone who has issues paying for
 
00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:10.609 align:start position:0%
someone who has issues paying for

college
 
00:58:13.010 --> 00:58:13.020 align:start position:0%
because they're
 
00:58:15.770 --> 00:58:15.780 align:start position:0%
you know I'm standing
 
00:58:18.770 --> 00:58:18.780 align:start position:0%
would not be like me
 
00:58:21.530 --> 00:58:21.540 align:start position:0%
to choose to go someplace they can't
 
00:58:23.690 --> 00:58:23.700 align:start position:0%
afford blockages get out of high school
 
00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
and go to community clubs
 
00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
and would that be an indicator there's a
 
00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
lot of kids that are not performing
 
00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
mathematically like they should at the
 
00:58:37.370 --> 00:58:37.380 align:start position:0%
community college level
 
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
a function of the high school not a
 
00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:42.130 align:start position:0%
a function of the high school not a
paranormal

00:58:42.130 --> 00:58:42.140 align:start position:0%

00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:44.520 align:start position:0%

00:58:49.250 --> 00:58:49.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:51.589 --> 00:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
the rich the Egyptian organ work and
 
00:58:51.599 --> 00:58:52.670 align:start position:0%
the rich the Egyptian organ work and
attitude

00:58:52.670 --> 00:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
attitude
 
00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
yeah but these communities don't have a
 
00:58:58.089 --> 00:58:58.099 align:start position:0%
lot of money to spend in the schools
 
00:59:01.490 --> 00:59:01.500 align:start position:0%
in college and so
 
00:59:03.650 --> 00:59:03.660 align:start position:0%
I guess they're not making sense here oh
 
00:59:05.329 --> 00:59:05.339 align:start position:0%
you you are but if you were to look at
 
00:59:05.339 --> 00:59:13.630 align:start position:0%
you you are but if you were to look at
yeah

00:59:13.630 --> 00:59:13.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:17.390 --> 00:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
of how while the schools joint bars and
 
00:59:18.910 --> 00:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
the indicator of college
 
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
money their parents have well I think
 
00:59:23.450 --> 00:59:23.460 align:start position:0%
that a lot of kids going to the
 
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
community college system now you notice
 
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
those coming out of vocational education
 
00:59:30.490 --> 00:59:30.500 align:start position:0%
CTE program as mentioned this morning
 
00:59:34.250 --> 00:59:34.260 align:start position:0%
that they're coming out with uh
 
00:59:37.010 --> 00:59:37.020 align:start position:0%
75 percent of the kids are going on to
 
00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
college from the CTE programs their
 
00:59:43.370 --> 00:59:43.380 align:start position:0%
scores are five percentage points higher
 
00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
than the scores coming out of high
 
00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
schools they're also coming out 100
 
00:59:51.730 --> 00:59:51.740 align:start position:0%
percent with skills and job opportunity
 
00:59:54.530 --> 00:59:54.540 align:start position:0%
in terms of the foundations you spoke
 
00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:56.089 align:start position:0%
in terms of the foundations you spoke
about

00:59:56.089 --> 00:59:56.099 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:59:57.770 --> 00:59:57.780 align:start position:0%
um when I met with a group of teachers
 
01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:00.180 align:start position:0%
this last week and we were talking about
 
01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:03.240 align:start position:0%
um preparation and what's going on in
 
01:00:05.450 --> 01:00:05.460 align:start position:0%
mathematics to high school it turns out
 
01:00:07.789 --> 01:00:07.799 align:start position:0%
that after the talking with these Math
 
01:00:09.770 --> 01:00:09.780 align:start position:0%
teachers from the middle and there's one
 
01:00:11.329 --> 01:00:11.339 align:start position:0%
two three four five of them there
 
01:00:14.450 --> 01:00:14.460 align:start position:0%
through high school that
 
01:00:18.170 --> 01:00:18.180 align:start position:0%
the foundation wasn't really what they
 
01:00:19.370 --> 01:00:19.380 align:start position:0%
wanted to see coming out of the
 
01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
elementary schools
 
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
so it's not necessarily we see the
 
01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:25.020 align:start position:0%
waterfall effect at the sixth grade
 
01:00:26.569 --> 01:00:26.579 align:start position:0%
seventh grade where the scores start
 
01:00:26.579 --> 01:00:28.250 align:start position:0%
seventh grade where the scores start
dropping

01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:28.260 align:start position:0%
dropping
 
01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
but it's is that where we have to start
 
01:00:39.829 --> 01:00:39.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:39.839 --> 01:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:46.690 align:start position:0%

it's a lack of Communications in the

01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:07.609 --> 01:01:07.619 align:start position:0%
we got to ensure the academic standards
 
01:01:10.370 --> 01:01:10.380 align:start position:0%
set for the third grade by the state are
 
01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:13.260 align:start position:0%
being taught in the third grade
 
01:01:16.609 --> 01:01:16.619 align:start position:0%
or in accordance with competencies they
 
01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
may and where the child is it may be a
 
01:01:22.069 --> 01:01:22.079 align:start position:0%
spectrum in all blocks along the way but
 
01:01:23.950 --> 01:01:23.960 align:start position:0%
this go ahead

01:01:41.809 --> 01:01:41.819 align:start position:0%
the kids came in not knowing their
 
01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
colors because they're coming in from a
 
01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:45.309 align:start position:0%
colors because they're coming in from a
totally

01:01:45.309 --> 01:01:45.319 align:start position:0%
totally

01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:49.380 align:start position:0%
thinking about where are we getting
 
01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
tonight's dinner uh or where are we
 
01:01:54.170 --> 01:01:54.180 align:start position:0%
sleeping tonight because there's couch
 
01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:58.849 align:start position:0%

coming in
 
01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:04.260 align:start position:0%
the garden of Glory knows how to read or
 
01:02:05.329 --> 01:02:05.339 align:start position:0%
do you
 
01:02:07.789 --> 01:02:07.799 align:start position:0%
have advanced programs well this school
 
01:02:10.849 --> 01:02:10.859 align:start position:0%
is having to deal with well listen
 
01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:25.380 align:start position:0%
so back to 1680 here
 
01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:28.260 align:start position:0%
but you know no the discussion's a good
 
01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:33.650 align:start position:0%
but you know no the discussion's a good
discussion

01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:38.650 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:02:38.650 --> 01:02:38.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:41.289 --> 01:02:41.299 align:start position:0%
I think kids
 
01:02:44.329 --> 01:02:44.339 align:start position:0%
may be concerned some of the curriculum
 
01:02:48.170 --> 01:02:48.180 align:start position:0%
Community College are so strong so well
 
01:02:50.530 --> 01:02:50.540 align:start position:0%
founded kids look to go to that program
 
01:02:52.970 --> 01:02:52.980 align:start position:0%
uh not even
 
01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:59.470 align:start position:0%
uh not even
um

01:02:59.470 --> 01:02:59.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:11.230 --> 01:03:11.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:14.450 --> 01:03:14.460 align:start position:0%
see when that when that sequence was
 
01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
supposed to have been taught by whom it
 
01:03:18.849 --> 01:03:18.859 align:start position:0%
was supposed
 
01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:22.559 align:start position:0%
to talk
 
01:03:22.559 --> 01:03:23.829 align:start position:0%
to talk
um

01:03:23.829 --> 01:03:23.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:27.109 --> 01:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
they have no receipt where it was missed
 
01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
from them
 
01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
um I'm not particularly trying to
 
01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
explain to people where was it myth in
 
01:03:32.930 --> 01:03:32.940 align:start position:0%
the curriculum but we're through with
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
the remediation so you still can do that
 
01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
um and that can be a complicated but now
 
01:03:40.370 --> 01:03:40.380 align:start position:0%
you look at you're talking about the
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
vehicle look at the often you were
 
01:03:43.849 --> 01:03:43.859 align:start position:0%
talking about the amount of remediation
 
01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:45.839 align:start position:0%
needed at the four-year institution okay
 
01:03:47.569 --> 01:03:47.579 align:start position:0%
so these are portfolio causes
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
accumulation and it was like what
 
01:03:51.410 --> 01:03:51.420 align:start position:0%
station would that be answering come
 
01:03:54.770 --> 01:03:54.780 align:start position:0%
from he's missing skill X Y and Z and
 
01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
it's not to look at that way that those
 
01:03:58.910 --> 01:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
school systems need help now I go to
 
01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
school that perhaps the only expensive
 
01:04:03.410 --> 01:04:03.420 align:start position:0%
their analysis but equal to the college
 
01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
really tight when you look at the real
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
enrollment remedial of course they
 
01:04:09.730 --> 01:04:09.740 align:start position:0%
require and then you look at what school
 
01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:11.349 align:start position:0%
require and then you look at what school
on

01:04:11.349 --> 01:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
leonson's Campground but that does give
 
01:04:15.890 --> 01:04:15.900 align:start position:0%
us a space that's the base if these kids
 
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
are not prepared
 
01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
and then that's the schools that need
 
01:04:22.010 --> 01:04:22.020 align:start position:0%
additional help so it is one level
 
01:04:25.130 --> 01:04:25.140 align:start position:0%
accountability enough
 
01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
and so we decided like doe and other
 
01:04:29.049 --> 01:04:29.059 align:start position:0%
people have
 
01:04:29.059 --> 01:04:30.670 align:start position:0%
people have
instructions

01:04:30.670 --> 01:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
instructions
 
01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
thinking it's got aligned with things to
 
01:04:36.370 --> 01:04:36.380 align:start position:0%
do if you want to have to stand up uh
 
01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
and that's fine but we can't find food
 
01:04:42.289 --> 01:04:42.299 align:start position:0%
that's optimistic so they're basically
 
01:04:45.470 --> 01:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
yes it comes into Driving School school
 
01:04:48.829 --> 01:04:48.839 align:start position:0%
and they don't have it right away that
 
01:04:50.270 --> 01:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
school needs additional support maybe
 
01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
create a Pre-K
 
01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:53.700 align:start position:0%
um along the way that's not telling you
 
01:04:55.569 --> 01:04:55.579 align:start position:0%
as many different than the data problems
 
01:04:57.890 --> 01:04:57.900 align:start position:0%
so the Manchester United need more
 
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
support more resource
 
01:05:01.549 --> 01:05:01.559 align:start position:0%
um so it's a little way to bring my
 
01:05:05.089 --> 01:05:05.099 align:start position:0%
stuff down but I think we should become
 
01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:08.940 align:start position:0%
lost in the goal of this uh
 
01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
CA which is the move forward through the
 
01:05:14.990 --> 01:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
scientific resources done because
 
01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
there's no reason to be no risks being
 
01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative on that on that point one
 
01:05:25.069 --> 01:05:25.079 align:start position:0%
of the things I think you'll find in
 
01:05:26.270 --> 01:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
other states
 
01:05:28.910 --> 01:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
that have greater that have greater
 
01:05:33.170 --> 01:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
funding for schools is that they have a
 
01:05:35.690 --> 01:05:35.700 align:start position:0%
greater Hammer yeah I'd use that term
 
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
but have greater resources and greater
 
01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:40.760 align:start position:0%
Hammers and greater
 
01:05:43.370 --> 01:05:43.380 align:start position:0%
resources available to schools that need
 
01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:44.390 align:start position:0%
resources available to schools that need
help

01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
help
 
01:05:46.970 --> 01:05:46.980 align:start position:0%
and I think what 1680 is trying to do is
 
01:05:49.970 --> 01:05:49.980 align:start position:0%
to try to take again the current amount
 
01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
of money that we have
 
01:05:53.930 --> 01:05:53.940 align:start position:0%
and how do we allocate that and Target
 
01:05:55.309 --> 01:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
it more
 
01:05:57.650 --> 01:05:57.660 align:start position:0%
so that in those districts that need the
 
01:05:59.569 --> 01:05:59.579 align:start position:0%
additional help they can get the
 
01:05:59.579 --> 01:06:00.589 align:start position:0%
additional help they can get the
additional

01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
additional
 
01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
I mean the handovers and the hopkintons
 
01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
and the Portsmouth they're going to go
 
01:06:05.930 --> 01:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
on they're going to be okay
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
but when you begin I mean we use this
 
01:06:11.650 --> 01:06:11.660 align:start position:0%
when we were dealing with the uh in 2018
 
01:06:15.490 --> 01:06:15.500 align:start position:0%
on the uh the uh funding uh
 
01:06:18.170 --> 01:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
Commissioners Rick and I were on one of
 
01:06:20.030 --> 01:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
the things we discovered was that a
 
01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
place like Claremont for example
 
01:06:24.309 --> 01:06:24.319 align:start position:0%
Claremont had five different
 
01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:27.780 align:start position:0%
superintendents in six years
 
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
now there is no leadership there at that
 
01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
point in time
 
01:06:35.809 --> 01:06:35.819 align:start position:0%
principals no no who who to turn to
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
school boards have a problem with that
 
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:40.799 align:start position:0%
and that all goes back to the issue of
 
01:06:42.349 --> 01:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
where the front where the funding is
 
01:06:45.170 --> 01:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
there and so I think as it as we look
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
it's a systemic kind of a look that we
 
01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
needed to review here and I think that's
 
01:06:52.250 --> 01:06:52.260 align:start position:0%
what 1680 is trying to do is trying to
 
01:06:53.930 --> 01:06:53.940 align:start position:0%
look at it from a systemic step whether
 
01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
to provide greater resources Mr chair to
 
01:06:58.069 --> 01:06:58.079 align:start position:0%
make sure that there's an equal
 
01:06:59.569 --> 01:06:59.579 align:start position:0%
educational opportunity for
 
01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
representative Ames yeah I just uh I
 
01:07:03.650 --> 01:07:03.660 align:start position:0%
don't want to get out of my depth here
 
01:07:06.890 --> 01:07:06.900 align:start position:0%
and you guys are way over my head
 
01:07:10.970 --> 01:07:10.980 align:start position:0%
um but there are two sections in 1680
 
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
that seem to be very relevant to this
 
01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
discussion and one is 11.
 
01:07:20.930 --> 01:07:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:22.370 --> 01:07:22.380 align:start position:0%
um page
 
01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
10. it's the first one so the first one
 
01:07:30.309 --> 01:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
is about underperforming schools
 
01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
and there's a there's a process called
 
01:07:37.970 --> 01:07:37.980 align:start position:0%
for in this uh in this uh bill
 
01:07:40.549 --> 01:07:40.559 align:start position:0%
um that would look at uh that would
 
01:07:42.109 --> 01:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
require the Board of Education
 
01:07:45.589 --> 01:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Education to have a
 
01:07:47.870 --> 01:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
system that would be developed that
 
01:07:50.329 --> 01:07:50.339 align:start position:0%
would use student performance data and
 
01:07:54.410 --> 01:07:54.420 align:start position:0%
their is not just one piece of data one
 
01:07:57.410 --> 01:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
measure of performance that's across a
 
01:08:01.970 --> 01:08:01.980 align:start position:0%
range that would be selected and to to
 
01:08:04.010 --> 01:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
determine if there are one or more
 
01:08:05.569 --> 01:08:05.579 align:start position:0%
schools out there and of course there
 
01:08:05.579 --> 01:08:06.950 align:start position:0%
schools out there and of course there
aren't

01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
aren't
 
01:08:10.370 --> 01:08:10.380 align:start position:0%
um that are quote underperforming and
 
01:08:12.349 --> 01:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
then it requires a process to adjust
 
01:08:14.510 --> 01:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
that so that's the first thing I wanted
 
01:08:19.450 --> 01:08:19.460 align:start position:0%
to point out and then section 13
 
01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
section 12 is basically responding to
 
01:08:25.809 --> 01:08:25.819 align:start position:0%
that underperforming school situation
 
01:08:29.930 --> 01:08:29.940 align:start position:0%
section 13 is persistent disparities
 
01:08:33.249 --> 01:08:33.259 align:start position:0%
and this relates more to groups of kids
 
01:08:38.229 --> 01:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
student subgroups that are persistently
 
01:08:40.269 --> 01:08:40.279 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the
 
01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
new uh system for allocating funds uh
 
01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
not doing so well
 
01:08:48.729 --> 01:08:48.739 align:start position:0%
um so persistent disparities and again
 
01:08:51.970 --> 01:08:51.980 align:start position:0%
uh there's this identification process
 
01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
using measures that are sophisticated
 
01:08:57.410 --> 01:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
that are not just outcomes on a
 
01:08:59.570 --> 01:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
particular test but across the range of
 
01:09:02.209 --> 01:09:02.219 align:start position:0%
of measures
 
01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
um and identifying that there are these
 
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
persistent disparities and and
 
01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
developing a plan I think there's a
 
01:09:12.610 --> 01:09:12.620 align:start position:0%
three-year Plan called for in the bill
 
01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
to address
 
01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
um the persistent disparities so I just
 
01:09:19.630 --> 01:09:19.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to throw that out there without
 
01:09:22.669 --> 01:09:22.679 align:start position:0%
uh getting into the weeds of it because
 
01:09:28.189 --> 01:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
I can't handle that but this is a a bill
 
01:09:31.849 --> 01:09:31.859 align:start position:0%
that is not simple it's it understands
 
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
and addresses and calls for people to
 
01:09:37.309 --> 01:09:37.319 align:start position:0%
address the complexities of of children
 
01:09:40.130 --> 01:09:40.140 align:start position:0%
in our society and I'm bringing that to
 
01:09:43.329 --> 01:09:43.339 align:start position:0%
them an education that's going to be
 
01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
adequate and sufficient to enable each
 
01:09:49.010 --> 01:09:49.020 align:start position:0%
of those children at least have the
 
01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:52.799 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come through the whole
 
01:09:52.799 --> 01:09:54.850 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come through the whole
thing

01:09:54.850 --> 01:09:54.860 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:10:03.790 --> 01:10:03.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
1680 is a Reformation
 
01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
it's a Reformation of how we fund
 
01:10:13.010 --> 01:10:13.020 align:start position:0%
schools in the past when we were on the
 
01:10:15.370 --> 01:10:15.380 align:start position:0%
study committee on 2018
 
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
we tweaked it on the site I had a little
 
01:10:20.570 --> 01:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
bit here a little bit there
 
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
this is a reformation and it has to have
 
01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
a very serious look
 
01:10:29.149 --> 01:10:29.159 align:start position:0%
because it can it can create a whole
 
01:10:31.729 --> 01:10:31.739 align:start position:0%
different way of funding schools that
 
01:10:36.169 --> 01:10:36.179 align:start position:0%
will take us in the in the 2030.
 
01:10:38.810 --> 01:10:38.820 align:start position:0%
I I don't want to minimize this because
 
01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
this is not a tweaking of the system
 
01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
this is changing the system and that's
 
01:10:46.010 --> 01:10:46.020 align:start position:0%
why the serious study of this is so
 
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
important because if we are going to try
 
01:10:52.610 --> 01:10:52.620 align:start position:0%
to maximize the current funding system
 
01:10:56.209 --> 01:10:56.219 align:start position:0%
that we have in a different way it does
 
01:10:58.610 --> 01:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
take deep thought
 
01:11:01.610 --> 01:11:01.620 align:start position:0%
and deep consideration as we move
 
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
forward rather than just continue to do
 
01:11:06.290 --> 01:11:06.300 align:start position:0%
exactly what we've done in the past
 
01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:08.580 align:start position:0%
do you feel comfortable
 
01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:09.229 align:start position:0%
do you feel comfortable
um

01:11:09.229 --> 01:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:11.149 --> 01:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
with the amount of money that we're
 
01:11:13.250 --> 01:11:13.260 align:start position:0%
allocating in this
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
and towards that performance outcome
 
01:11:18.169 --> 01:11:18.179 align:start position:0%
based upon
 
01:11:20.750 --> 01:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
the data that we've been able to extract
 
01:11:26.930 --> 01:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
from the doe 2820 form yeah I think so I
 
01:11:29.689 --> 01:11:29.699 align:start position:0%
mean I I think that the now granted
 
01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
there are there are uh gradual increases
 
01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
that are going to take place as there
 
01:11:37.010 --> 01:11:37.020 align:start position:0%
would be in anything but as a matter of
 
01:11:39.530 --> 01:11:39.540 align:start position:0%
size you look at that pool
 
01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
how do you allocate that pool
 
01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:42.470 align:start position:0%
how do you allocate that pool
differently

01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
differently
 
01:11:46.010 --> 01:11:46.020 align:start position:0%
and that's what so I as as air which is
 
01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
the outside group remember this is the
 
01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
outside group the first outside group
 
01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
since Ogden blue
 
01:11:55.070 --> 01:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
and Ogden Blick was in what mid 80s so
 
01:11:57.169 --> 01:11:57.179 align:start position:0%
over 40 years is the first time we've
 
01:11:59.149 --> 01:11:59.159 align:start position:0%
had an outside group come in look at our
 
01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
information look at our data
 
01:12:03.770 --> 01:12:03.780 align:start position:0%
and basically say here's how you can
 
01:12:05.810 --> 01:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
take that current data
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
and deal with it in a different kind of
 
01:12:09.530 --> 01:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
a way than what we've done in the past
 
01:12:11.630 --> 01:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
and so that's kind of why I'm excited
 
01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
about this because I think I mean little
 
01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:16.260 align:start position:0%
did I realize when I proposed this thing
 
01:12:18.290 --> 01:12:18.300 align:start position:0%
on the floor of the house that I would
 
01:12:20.330 --> 01:12:20.340 align:start position:0%
get to where it is right now because it
 
01:12:22.910 --> 01:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
has created the conversation that's what
 
01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
we try to do here Rick is to create this
 
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
kind of conversation about where do we
 
01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
want this funding of schools to go in a
 
01:12:33.169 --> 01:12:33.179 align:start position:0%
deeper kind of way than just tweaking a
 
01:12:35.030 --> 01:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
little bit here I will say that that
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
representative umberger I think she did
 
01:12:39.950 --> 01:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
a very good job in in the in the group
 
01:12:42.350 --> 01:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
that that we worked on Ricks we had a
 
01:12:44.750 --> 01:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
lot of data that came in and a lot of
 
01:12:47.870 --> 01:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
people bring stuff in but in the end
 
01:12:50.149 --> 01:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't take that step
 
01:12:54.050 --> 01:12:54.060 align:start position:0%
we said no little here little here which
 
01:12:56.090 --> 01:12:56.100 align:start position:0%
is exactly what we've been doing since
 
01:12:57.770 --> 01:12:57.780 align:start position:0%
Claremont won
 
01:13:00.290 --> 01:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
I mean the the courts have told us to
 
01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
fix this damn thing
 
01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
and there and the legislature has been
 
01:13:06.410 --> 01:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
has refused
 
01:13:08.570 --> 01:13:08.580 align:start position:0%
to take what this courts have said to us
 
01:13:11.390 --> 01:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
and and create a different system well I
 
01:13:13.010 --> 01:13:13.020 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't go that far and say the
 
01:13:14.630 --> 01:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
legislatures refused well I get a little
 
01:13:16.669 --> 01:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
excited yeah okay well what I'd like to
 
01:13:20.030 --> 01:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
do is ask you a question does the doe 25
 
01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:21.709 align:start position:0%
do is ask you a question does the doe 25
form

01:13:21.709 --> 01:13:21.719 align:start position:0%
form
 
01:13:23.770 --> 01:13:23.780 align:start position:0%
the results we get
 
01:13:27.290 --> 01:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
disaggregate the costs associated with
 
01:13:29.410 --> 01:13:29.420 align:start position:0%
the adequacy
 
01:13:33.350 --> 01:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
adequate adequate education from other
 
01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
costs which are not necessary for an
 
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
adequate education or are you relying on
 
01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
the total average of the doe 25 form
 
01:13:45.410 --> 01:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
tuition cost which it appears to me we
 
01:13:48.649 --> 01:13:48.659 align:start position:0%
are doing that we didn't disaggregate
 
01:13:52.189 --> 01:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
all those components that contribute to
 
01:13:55.370 --> 01:13:55.380 align:start position:0%
an adequate education referencing 193e I
 
01:13:56.570 --> 01:13:56.580 align:start position:0%
think that's one I think that's one of
 
01:13:57.770 --> 01:13:57.780 align:start position:0%
the things you need to look at I mean
 
01:13:59.810 --> 01:13:59.820 align:start position:0%
for example because having a swimming
 
01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:00.590 align:start position:0%
for example because having a swimming
pool

01:14:00.590 --> 01:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
pool
 
01:14:02.930 --> 01:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
add to your education I mean I don't
 
01:14:05.330 --> 01:14:05.340 align:start position:0%
know how that would fit into the
 
01:14:09.410 --> 01:14:09.420 align:start position:0%
form 25 but I think that the air has
 
01:14:10.970 --> 01:14:10.980 align:start position:0%
looked at some of that stuff and we can
 
01:14:12.649 --> 01:14:12.659 align:start position:0%
get them back in here and look at it
 
01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
again that the uh the department upgrade
 
01:14:19.250 --> 01:14:19.260 align:start position:0%
updates their data every time they have
 
01:14:22.010 --> 01:14:22.020 align:start position:0%
those forms that do come in so my sense
 
01:14:23.930 --> 01:14:23.940 align:start position:0%
is that we should be able to look at
 
01:14:25.970 --> 01:14:25.980 align:start position:0%
yeah I I would think that's a necessary
 
01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
component we need to do however I don't
 
01:14:30.890 --> 01:14:30.900 align:start position:0%
know if doe has that the the when this
 
01:14:32.630 --> 01:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
information comes in
 
01:14:35.209 --> 01:14:35.219 align:start position:0%
it takes their assets it takes their
 
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
revenues it takes their expenses that's
 
01:14:41.149 --> 01:14:41.159 align:start position:0%
the doe 25 form and it has like you say
 
01:14:42.890 --> 01:14:42.900 align:start position:0%
the swimming pool program in there as a
 
01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
football program in there which are not
 
01:14:46.729 --> 01:14:46.739 align:start position:0%
related to
 
01:14:48.830 --> 01:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
well they're they're related in a long
 
01:14:50.870 --> 01:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
distance way because I'm I'm always been
 
01:14:52.910 --> 01:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
a proponent of co-curricular activity
 
01:14:55.610 --> 01:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
but it's not necessarily going to
 
01:14:58.250 --> 01:14:58.260 align:start position:0%
contribute to the the results that we
 
01:15:00.590 --> 01:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
see on the Statewide assessment of
 
01:15:03.890 --> 01:15:03.900 align:start position:0%
language arts reading and Mathematics or
 
01:15:06.410 --> 01:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
to the results we get on the SAT or the
 
01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:08.630 align:start position:0%
to the results we get on the SAT or the
ACT

01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:09.590 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
so I I think that that's an area that
 
01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
you know anything that moves forward I
 
01:15:17.330 --> 01:15:17.340 align:start position:0%
think we got the concepts many of them
 
01:15:19.310 --> 01:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
sprinkled through here are Concepts
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
which I think we can all latch on to the
 
01:15:25.010 --> 01:15:25.020 align:start position:0%
the data that we're getting is the day
 
01:15:28.430 --> 01:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
only data available at doe so that's
 
01:15:31.490 --> 01:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
what we've got to use and
 
01:15:35.330 --> 01:15:35.340 align:start position:0%
um I'm not so sure that you know um I
 
01:15:36.590 --> 01:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable
 
01:15:39.050 --> 01:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
with you know jacking the cost of an
 
01:15:41.330 --> 01:15:41.340 align:start position:0%
adequate education up based upon
 
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
something which is not related to an
 
01:15:45.970 --> 01:15:45.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:49.610 --> 01:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
yes representative welcome
 
01:15:51.709 --> 01:15:51.719 align:start position:0%
sorry I was over in the other room
 
01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
waiting for you guys and working on this
 
01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
and fell asleep and I'm like where is
 
01:15:59.810 --> 01:15:59.820 align:start position:0%
everybody but
 
01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
um I the section that he was calling our
 
01:16:05.090 --> 01:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
attention to section
 
01:16:10.370 --> 01:16:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
um I can see that as being useful for
 
01:16:15.950 --> 01:16:15.960 align:start position:0%
every single School
 
01:16:18.169 --> 01:16:18.179 align:start position:0%
why do we have to wait for a school to
 
01:16:19.850 --> 01:16:19.860 align:start position:0%
fail three years in a row or whatever
 
01:16:22.490 --> 01:16:22.500 align:start position:0%
before we start doing that that's the
 
01:16:25.250 --> 01:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff we need now is what are
 
01:16:28.130 --> 01:16:28.140 align:start position:0%
you spending your money on what plans do
 
01:16:30.410 --> 01:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
you have how are you using it how is
 
01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
this affecting the education all that
 
01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff I could I mean I would
 
01:16:39.050 --> 01:16:39.060 align:start position:0%
love to that section in there just put
 
01:16:41.450 --> 01:16:41.460 align:start position:0%
it in and require all schools to do it I
 
01:16:44.149 --> 01:16:44.159 align:start position:0%
think it would be excellent
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
what are the comments from the committee
 
01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:47.870 align:start position:0%
what are the comments from the committee
today

01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
what for the comments yeah
 
01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:55.020 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you
 
01:16:55.020 --> 01:16:55.729 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you
um

01:16:55.729 --> 01:16:55.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:58.010 --> 01:16:58.020 align:start position:0%
what what we have is the next date for
 
01:17:00.110 --> 01:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
this subcommittee to meet
 
01:17:03.530 --> 01:17:03.540 align:start position:0%
was is going to be immediately following
 
01:17:06.530 --> 01:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
the co-op bills which are heard at on
 
01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
the 12th which is a Wednesday at 9 30 so
 
01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
we will tie it in so I would say
 
01:17:13.970 --> 01:17:13.980 align:start position:0%
probably the co-op bill should go fairly
 
01:17:16.130 --> 01:17:16.140 align:start position:0%
quickly I think we're almost there with
 
01:17:19.250 --> 01:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
those so I would say by 10 30 we ought
 
01:17:20.770 --> 01:17:20.780 align:start position:0%
to be ready to
 
01:17:23.810 --> 01:17:23.820 align:start position:0%
take 1680 this will be the last
 
01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of 1680. we will be making
 
01:17:28.850 --> 01:17:28.860 align:start position:0%
recommendations for to the full
 
01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
committee for action and that full
 
01:17:32.990 --> 01:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
committee has been scheduled for the
 
01:17:35.390 --> 01:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
24th of October seeing later that week
 
01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
all reports have to be done for further
 
01:17:40.729 --> 01:17:40.739 align:start position:0%
for the calendar and what's the date
 
01:17:45.470 --> 01:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
pardon me date for which one the 24th
 
01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
the 24th of March no the one you were
 
01:17:49.370 --> 01:17:49.380 align:start position:0%
talking about the co-op bills and then
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
at 10. yeah that's on the 12th of
 
01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:55.149 align:start position:0%
at 10. yeah that's on the 12th of
October

01:17:55.149 --> 01:17:55.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:58.250 --> 01:17:58.260 align:start position:0%
yeah you said Wednesday but I didn't two
 
01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
days after Columbus Day yeah
 
01:18:02.209 --> 01:18:02.219 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:18:04.850 --> 01:18:04.860 align:start position:0%
it's it's already in the calendar the
 
01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
24th in the calendar right this dates I
 
01:18:10.010 --> 01:18:10.020 align:start position:0%
don't think in the calendar the 12th for
 
01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
the 1680 oh I got that in there great
 
01:18:14.630 --> 01:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
okay if there's nothing else thank you
 
01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
