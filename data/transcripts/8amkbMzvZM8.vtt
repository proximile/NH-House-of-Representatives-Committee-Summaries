um
 
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:49.260 align:start position:0%
in the 1800s the common schools concept
 
00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:51.060 align:start position:0%
was started by horse man in
 
00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.370 align:start position:0%
was started by horse man in
Massachusetts

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:52.380 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:55.320 align:start position:0%
and his thought was in order for there
 
00:08:58.269 --> 00:08:58.279 align:start position:0%
to be a civil society there needed to be
 
00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:02.220 align:start position:0%
civil and religious education for all
 
00:09:03.889 --> 00:09:03.899 align:start position:0%
since our nation at that point was
 
00:09:06.889 --> 00:09:06.899 align:start position:0%
primarily Protestant all the schools
 
00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:09.180 align:start position:0%
would be no different in religion and
 
00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:11.700 align:start position:0%
reading from Bibles were part of the
 
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
common school education
 
00:09:17.449 --> 00:09:17.459 align:start position:0%
but problems arose in the mid-1800s with
 
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:19.260 align:start position:0%
the immigration of Catholics from
 
00:09:22.009 --> 00:09:22.019 align:start position:0%
several countries including Ireland
 
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
these immigrants arrived here and found
 
00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:26.300 align:start position:0%
the schools
 
00:09:29.329 --> 00:09:29.339 align:start position:0%
being having students taught from a
 
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
Protestant Bible which was contrary to
 
00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
their Concepts and this led to
 
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
discrimination and violence
 
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
it was in this period that then U.S
 
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.889 align:start position:0%
it was in this period that then U.S
President

00:09:42.889 --> 00:09:42.899 align:start position:0%
President
 
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
Ulysses S Grant gave a speech calling
 
00:09:47.449 --> 00:09:47.459 align:start position:0%
for a constitutional amendment to forbid
 
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
States from providing public funds to
 
00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:54.440 align:start position:0%
any school that taught sectarian AKA
 
00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
Catholic tenants
 
00:09:59.389 --> 00:09:59.399 align:start position:0%
James Blaine of Maine was the speaker of
 
00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:01.380 align:start position:0%
the U.S House of Representatives and a
 
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:02.820 align:start position:0%
friend of Grant
 
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
Blaine envisioned himself to be the
 
00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:09.420 align:start position:0%
successor as President Grant he
 
00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:11.220 align:start position:0%
introduced a constitutional amendment
 
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
that provided for no State funds to go
 
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
to any original religious sect
 
00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:20.220 align:start position:0%
the amendment passed the U.S house and
 
00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
came Within
 
00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:25.980 align:start position:0%
one vote of passing the Senate
 
00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:28.620 align:start position:0%
but the anti-catholic movement did not
 
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
end there our state was not exempt from
 
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:32.949 align:start position:0%
end there our state was not exempt from
that

00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:32.959 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
hardly had the first Catholic parish
 
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:37.620 align:start position:0%
been established in Dover then there
 
00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:39.839 align:start position:0%
were attempts made to burn it down in
 
00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
both 1830 and 1831.
 
00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:45.300 align:start position:0%
in the 1850s there were anti-catholic
 
00:10:47.449 --> 00:10:47.459 align:start position:0%
incidents in Peterborough Newmarket
 
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
Manchester Dover Portsmouth in
 
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
Greenville attempts were made to burn
 
00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:54.140 align:start position:0%
down Saint
 
00:10:57.889 --> 00:10:57.899 align:start position:0%
Anne's in Manchester and its Convent in
 
00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:01.620 align:start position:0%
both 1858 and 1859.
 
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
states began to adopt these many Blaine
 
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:08.940 align:start position:0%
amendments or no Aid blame amendments
 
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:13.980 align:start position:0%
after the failure of the U.S Amendment
 
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.650 align:start position:0%
after the failure of the U.S Amendment
uh

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:15.660 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:18.180 align:start position:0%
we added a Blaine Amendment which is
 
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
part two articles 83 in our Constitution
 
00:11:26.509 --> 00:11:26.519 align:start position:0%
and it was clearly modeled after the U.S
 
00:11:29.569 --> 00:11:29.579 align:start position:0%
uh attempted Amendment
 
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
why should this relic of anti-religious
 
00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:35.220 align:start position:0%
period be removed from our constitution
 
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
two reasons first it's a relic of
 
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
anti-religious bigotry and a following
 
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:45.660 align:start position:0%
uh representative we'll discuss that in
 
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:48.660 align:start position:0%
more detail second is unconstitutional
 
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
and I'll bring up four recent U.S
 
00:11:55.009 --> 00:11:55.019 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decisions the first in
 
00:11:59.110 --> 00:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
2002 was zelman versus Simmons Harris
 
00:12:02.509 --> 00:12:02.519 align:start position:0%
this was in Ohio where the state had
 
00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
assumed control of the Cleveland schools
 
00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
and instituted a scholarship program
 
00:12:11.329 --> 00:12:11.339 align:start position:0%
under that program tuition assistance
 
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
was provided to low-income students so
 
00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:16.260 align:start position:0%
that they could attend a private or
 
00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
public school of their choice including
 
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
religious schools a group of taxpayers
 
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
filed suit claiming that it violated The
 
00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
Establishment Clause and went to the
 
00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
United States Supreme Court and in a 5-4
 
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:33.800 align:start position:0%
decision the majority of ruled
 
00:12:38.569 --> 00:12:38.579 align:start position:0%
for the plaintiffs and Justice rehnquist
 
00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:41.700 align:start position:0%
stated the Ohio program permits such
 
00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:44.220 align:start position:0%
individuals to exercise genuine Choice
 
00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
among options for public and private
 
00:12:50.449 --> 00:12:50.459 align:start position:0%
secular and religious the program is
 
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
therefore a program of true private
 
00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.230 align:start position:0%
therefore a program of true private
choice

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
choice
 
00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
in 2012 there was the Trinity Lutheran
 
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
case in Missouri and this was about a
 
00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
state grants to provide playground
 
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.090 align:start position:0%
state grants to provide playground
materials

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:05.100 align:start position:0%
materials
 
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
the state said that the Trinity Lutheran
 
00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
Church could not get a grant
 
00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
for these playground materials for their
 
00:13:17.569 --> 00:13:17.579 align:start position:0%
school playground because of their blame
 
00:13:17.579 --> 00:13:18.710 align:start position:0%
school playground because of their blame
Amendment

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
again went to the Supreme Court chief
 
00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:24.839 align:start position:0%
justice Roberts stated but the exclusion
 
00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:26.700 align:start position:0%
of Trinity Lutheran from a public
 
00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
benefit for which it is otherwise
 
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
qualified solely because it is a church
 
00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:34.980 align:start position:0%
is odious to our constitution all the
 
00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:37.740 align:start position:0%
same and cannot stand
 
00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
now even more recent
 
00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:44.459 align:start position:0%
in 2002 there was the Espinoza versus
 
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
Montana Department of Revenue case
 
00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
and the Supreme Court issued a landmark
 
00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
decision for Mrs Espinoza and Montana
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
Montana families who wanted to use tax
 
00:13:59.569 --> 00:13:59.579 align:start position:0%
credit scholarship money to go to
 
00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:01.980 align:start position:0%
religious schools the Department of
 
00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:03.980 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration
 
00:14:07.009 --> 00:14:07.019 align:start position:0%
ruled that because they had a blind
 
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:10.860 align:start position:0%
Amendment they could not do that
 
00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.550 align:start position:0%
Amendment they could not do that
um

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
and I'll just point out that Blaine
 
00:14:17.629 --> 00:14:17.639 align:start position:0%
amendment in Montana was quite similar
 
00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
to our blame Amendment
 
00:14:23.329 --> 00:14:23.339 align:start position:0%
a Supreme Court ruled for Ms Espinoza
 
00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:25.620 align:start position:0%
and the other families and Justice Alito
 
00:14:27.769 --> 00:14:27.779 align:start position:0%
wrote that if a state decides to fund
 
00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
private education institutes it cannot
 
00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:32.940 align:start position:0%
discriminate discriminate against
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
parents who choose to send their
 
00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:37.980 align:start position:0%
children to religious schools
 
00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:41.940 align:start position:0%
one more Supreme K court case
 
00:14:45.889 --> 00:14:45.899 align:start position:0%
um was settled just this past June and
 
00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:48.300 align:start position:0%
this was a school tuitioning case in
 
00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:49.269 align:start position:0%
this was a school tuitioning case in
Maine

00:14:49.269 --> 00:14:49.279 align:start position:0%
Maine
 
00:14:53.689 --> 00:14:53.699 align:start position:0%
Maine began town tuitioning like we have
 
00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:57.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
so that if children don't have a grade
 
00:15:03.129 --> 00:15:03.139 align:start position:0%
level in their own town they can go to
 
00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:06.180 align:start position:0%
a school Elsewhere based on town
 
00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:07.550 align:start position:0%
a school Elsewhere based on town
tuitioning

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
tuitioning
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
but in 1981 Maine changed the law to
 
00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:15.560 align:start position:0%
restrict tuition to non-sectarian
 
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
non-religious schools
 
00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
in 2018 two families filed suit
 
00:15:25.009 --> 00:15:25.019 align:start position:0%
that because they wanted to send their
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
kids to religious schools where it had
 
00:15:29.889 --> 00:15:29.899 align:start position:0%
been allowed prior to
 
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
1981. the Carson versus Macon case went
 
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
to the Supreme Court and in the majority
 
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:39.660 align:start position:0%
opinion chief justice Roberts wrote as
 
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
noted a neutral benefit program in which
 
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
Public public funds float to religious
 
00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
organizations through independent
 
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:51.300 align:start position:0%
choices of private benefit recipients
 
00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:55.220 align:start position:0%
does not offend The Establishment Clause
 
00:15:58.370 --> 00:15:58.380 align:start position:0%
and even more recent
 
00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:01.380 align:start position:0%
um Maine has the oldest town tuitioning
 
00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:03.069 align:start position:0%
um Maine has the oldest town tuitioning
program

00:16:03.069 --> 00:16:03.079 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
in 2020 five families sued in Vermont
 
00:16:09.949 --> 00:16:09.959 align:start position:0%
wanting to send their children to
 
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
religious schools
 
00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:16.260 align:start position:0%
based on that Carson versus Macon Maine
 
00:16:19.129 --> 00:16:19.139 align:start position:0%
decision the Vermont education secretary
 
00:16:20.889 --> 00:16:20.899 align:start position:0%
sent a letter to all the state
 
00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:23.940 align:start position:0%
superintendents this is just last
 
00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:25.269 align:start position:0%
superintendents this is just last
September

00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
September
 
00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:27.240 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
school districts and I quote may not
 
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
deny tuition payments to religious
 
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
approved Independent Schools that meet
 
00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:37.380 align:start position:0%
educational quality standards under that
 
00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:39.350 align:start position:0%
educational quality standards under that
announcement

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
announcement
 
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
Vermont settled with the five families
 
00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:47.940 align:start position:0%
and provided them funding for going to
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
religious schools
 
00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:53.820 align:start position:0%
I believe that New Hampshire needs now
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
to repeal this unconstitutional
 
00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.470 align:start position:0%
to repeal this unconstitutional
Amendment

00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:17:00.769 --> 00:17:00.779 align:start position:0%
we've heard four U.S Supreme Court
 
00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:04.020 align:start position:0%
decisions that basically invalidate the
 
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
blame amendments
 
00:17:08.809 --> 00:17:08.819 align:start position:0%
John Blaine of Maine is dead and the New
 
00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:10.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Blaine Amendment needs to
 
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
deserve the same fate
 
00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:16.500 align:start position:0%
there can be no excuse not to repeal
 
00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:18.900 align:start position:0%
this remnant of anti-religious bigotry
 
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
the U.S Supreme Court has spoken and
 
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:24.780 align:start position:0%
it's now time for us to speak
 
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
by repealing this amendment and sending
 
00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:30.900 align:start position:0%
it to the voters of New Hampshire
 
00:17:33.409 --> 00:17:33.419 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much uh do you
 
00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:34.980 align:start position:0%
have a copy of your testimony that I do
 
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
and I owe provides the clerk into the
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
record are there questions from the
 
00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
committee for representative cordelli
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
yes representative Noble
 
00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:44.700 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you representative
 
00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:46.980 align:start position:0%
cordelli for taking my question
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
if the blame Amendment were to remain in
 
00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
our constitution someone could file suit
 
00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:56.220 align:start position:0%
to block funds going to New Hampshire
 
00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:03.409 --> 00:18:03.419 align:start position:0%
um that is correct yeah um it's uh open
 
00:18:06.289 --> 00:18:06.299 align:start position:0%
for additional lawsuits
 
00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:08.220 align:start position:0%
um I don't think it would be very wise
 
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
based on the U.S Supreme Court decisions
 
00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
um but if someone wants to do it I say
 
00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:15.900 align:start position:0%
Bring It On
 
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:21.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:25.980 align:start position:0%
um nullification occurs when a state
 
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
decides it's simply going to ignore
 
00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:31.260 align:start position:0%
federal law so given that the Supreme
 
00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
Court has already ruled that this is an
 
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional law if we refuse to
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
remove this and repeal this could that
 
00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
um I I wasn't going to go there but if
 
00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:49.140 align:start position:0%
you think it is I'll
 
00:18:52.909 --> 00:18:52.919 align:start position:0%
I'll accept your opinion of you
 
00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:18:58.909 --> 00:18:58.919 align:start position:0%
yes representative right
 
00:19:00.789 --> 00:19:00.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:05.700 align:start position:0%
representative uh I'm looking at the the
 
00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:09.780 align:start position:0%
section in the State Constitution and it
 
00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
says the amendment was added a lot later
 
00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
than the original Constitution so my
 
00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
question is we we lasted a long time
 
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:22.380 align:start position:0%
without this is that correct
 
00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:25.620 align:start position:0%
um uh yes the um Blaine amendment was
 
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
added to our constitution in 1877 and
 
00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:31.500 align:start position:0%
I'll just note that when the voters
 
00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:33.780 align:start position:0%
decided uh to add that to the
 
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
Constitution they also voted to remove
 
00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:41.100 align:start position:0%
Provisions from our Constitution that
 
00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:19:51.409 --> 00:19:51.419 align:start position:0%

00:19:53.039 --> 00:19:59.570 align:start position:0%
I'd like to recognize Representative Bob
Lin

00:19:59.570 --> 00:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:01.140 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of
 
00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
committee um thank you for permitting me
 
00:20:06.409 --> 00:20:06.419 align:start position:0%
to testify here I'm Bob Wynn I'm a state
 
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative from Windham and I appear
 
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
in support of uh cacr7
 
00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:15.660 align:start position:0%
um I I you know I agree with uh I was
 
00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:16.860 align:start position:0%
here for most of Representative
 
00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
cordelli's testimony and I think I agree
 
00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
with all of it in terms of he gave a
 
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
very thorough recitation of the
 
00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:24.660 align:start position:0%
background of this
 
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
um and I it it seems to me as a
 
00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:30.780 align:start position:0%
practical matter this amendment the the
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
language in the Constitution now that
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
the the that incorporates the Blaine
 
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
amendment is really uh it's no longer
 
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
effective I mean it's it would it could
 
00:20:43.789 --> 00:20:43.799 align:start position:0%
not be enforced because it's blatantly
 
00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:45.660 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional under the U.S
 
00:20:48.409 --> 00:20:48.419 align:start position:0%
Constitution and there's no real reason
 
00:20:51.169 --> 00:20:51.179 align:start position:0%
to keep it in the state constitution it
 
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
it does it does have the you know the
 
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
sort of Sting of of the religious
 
00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
bigotry that it was based upon uh from
 
00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:03.900 align:start position:0%
uh from the you know the the fear that
 
00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
the other you know too many Southern
 
00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:08.220 align:start position:0%
Europeans too many too many Irish
 
00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
Catholics and Italian Catholics and
 
00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.330 align:start position:0%
Catholics and Italian Catholics and
whatever

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:11.340 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:16.380 align:start position:0%
um are are uh are you know uh coming and
 
00:21:18.529 --> 00:21:18.539 align:start position:0%
my my God they you know they if they
 
00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:19.980 align:start position:0%
send their kids to school they might
 
00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
that might uh into uh religious schools
 
00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
they might uh uh you know that that will
 
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
further their education and my God they
 
00:21:28.669 --> 00:21:28.679 align:start position:0%
might get elected to A legislature
 
00:21:30.649 --> 00:21:30.659 align:start position:0%
sometime and what will my God how would
 
00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
that happen if uh that would be so awful
 
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
if we didn't have only you know white
 
00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
male Protestants uh uh running the
 
00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:41.460 align:start position:0%
running the country and so they took
 
00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
some action to uh to further that
 
00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:47.700 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me that we've gotten way
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
beyond that now and that the sensible
 
00:21:54.409 --> 00:21:54.419 align:start position:0%
thing to do would be to remove uh to
 
00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
remove this from the Constitution and
 
00:21:58.490 --> 00:21:58.500 align:start position:0%
that's that's really about about all I
 
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
all I have to say I'm happy to answer
 
00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you very much
 
00:22:01.919 --> 00:22:08.149 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you very much
representative

00:22:08.149 --> 00:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:10.909 --> 00:22:10.919 align:start position:0%
and we actually follow through with the
 
00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:13.980 align:start position:0%
amendment and deny somebody
 
00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:16.260 align:start position:0%
um public funds for a religious
 
00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:18.169 align:start position:0%
um public funds for a religious
Institution

00:22:18.169 --> 00:22:18.179 align:start position:0%
Institution
 
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
are we going to be given the various
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
court cases already are we going to be
 
00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
facing a pretty stiff penalty
 
00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:30.740 align:start position:0%
well you know I I
 
00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:33.900 align:start position:0%
think the answer to that would be I get
 
00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
I I it I suppose it depends I mean I I
 
00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
and maybe it depends to some extent on
 
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
how creative some lawyer can be maybe
 
00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:43.980 align:start position:0%
there are you know there are really
 
00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:46.860 align:start position:0%
creative lawyers in Washington with some
 
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
interest group or other that could try
 
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
to say well you know the language of New
 
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's amendment is somehow not
 
00:22:57.049 --> 00:22:57.059 align:start position:0%
covered uh by the earlier Supreme Court
 
00:22:58.970 --> 00:22:58.980 align:start position:0%
decisions it seems to me that that would
 
00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
be a real stretch to try to do that and
 
00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
so I guess I would say I think your your
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
point is well taken that honestly it
 
00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
there would I would think that somebody
 
00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:12.620 align:start position:0%
that would bring a lawsuit
 
00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
based upon the state constitution in
 
00:23:17.649 --> 00:23:17.659 align:start position:0%
light of the U.S Supreme Court decisions
 
00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:20.280 align:start position:0%
would face the real possibility that
 
00:23:21.649 --> 00:23:21.659 align:start position:0%
they're going to be sanctioned for
 
00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:23.820 align:start position:0%
bringing a frivolous lawsuit
 
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:25.039 align:start position:0%
um that would be my impression
 
00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
 
00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:29.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:30.500 align:start position:0%
being here
 
00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:35.220 align:start position:0%
uh if you look at some of these uh U.S
 
00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:37.740 align:start position:0%
uh Supreme Court decisions
 
00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
uh in the Lutheran bill is basically
 
00:23:42.529 --> 00:23:42.539 align:start position:0%
dealing with playgrounds
 
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:45.780 align:start position:0%
in Espinoza it was dealing with tax
 
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
credits and in this state we've heard in
 
00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
this committee that tax credits really
 
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
aren't tax money as it would relate to
 
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
out of the uh education trust fund
 
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
in Maine it was a very narrow decision
 
00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:02.820 align:start position:0%
that basically said in rural rural
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
school districts where there is no
 
00:24:07.549 --> 00:24:07.559 align:start position:0%
school district or school for that child
 
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
going to a middle school or high school
 
00:24:12.049 --> 00:24:12.059 align:start position:0%
that they could use public money to go
 
00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:13.740 align:start position:0%
to religious schools so those are very
 
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
narrow kinds of decisions
 
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
I'm asking this particularly of because
 
00:24:21.049 --> 00:24:21.059 align:start position:0%
of your background representative on the
 
00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:22.260 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court
 
00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:26.820 align:start position:0%
am I wrong in saying that as I I was
 
00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
trying to find it in the Constitution
 
00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
here but my reading of the Constitution
 
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
the original constitution of this state
 
00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:38.460 align:start position:0%
has a provision in it that says no tax
 
00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
money shall go for religious purposes
 
00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:43.919 align:start position:0%
but not notwithstanding the blame
 
00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:46.860 align:start position:0%
amendment I can contr
 
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
I can agree with the issue of the blame
 
00:24:51.409 --> 00:24:51.419 align:start position:0%
Amendment but the original Constitution
 
00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't it have a piece in there that
 
00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:56.340 align:start position:0%
says no taxes no taxation money will go
 
00:24:58.370 --> 00:24:58.380 align:start position:0%
to religious schools for religion I
 
00:24:59.870 --> 00:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
don't know if it says religious schools
 
00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:01.740 align:start position:0%
I thought it uh
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
um if you have the I know there I think
 
00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:04.559 align:start position:0%
you're right that there is another
 
00:25:06.649 --> 00:25:06.659 align:start position:0%
provision is the original constitution
 
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
in the original Constitution that does I
 
00:25:10.909 --> 00:25:10.919 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure about the religious schools
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
part I don't think I thought it had
 
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
something to do with just more more
 
00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
broadly religion I think I I think that
 
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
might be right thank you very much
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
further discussion yes representative
 
00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:23.090 align:start position:0%
further discussion yes representative
Howard

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:23.100 align:start position:0%
Howard
 
00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:24.900 align:start position:0%
well uh thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh based on your
 
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
testimony do you believe that our state
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
education system is failing to educate
 
00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:32.940 align:start position:0%
anyone other than white Protestants
 
00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:35.100 align:start position:0%
do I believe that it is failing to
 
00:25:36.649 --> 00:25:36.659 align:start position:0%
educate anyone other than white
 
00:25:38.269 --> 00:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
Protestants now do you mean do I think
 
00:25:40.669 --> 00:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
that there's some kind of uh
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
discrimination against no I do not I do
 
00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:46.200 align:start position:0%
not if if you're asking is there some
 
00:25:48.769 --> 00:25:48.779 align:start position:0%
you know is there somewhere in the state
 
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
where some School District or some
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
individual that's an official of a
 
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
school district is discriminating
 
00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:56.100 align:start position:0%
against someone that's not white
 
00:25:58.490 --> 00:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
possibly but if you're asking is there
 
00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:00.260 align:start position:0%
some kind of you know systematic
 
00:26:02.269 --> 00:26:02.279 align:start position:0%
discrimination against people that are
 
00:26:03.769 --> 00:26:03.779 align:start position:0%
not white no I don't I don't think
 
00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
that's true at all
 
00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:08.220 align:start position:0%
represent Luna
 
00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and and
 
00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
thanks for joining us um uh this morning
 
00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
and bringing your uh your experience to
 
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
bear in this area
 
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
um I want to go to the the back of the
 
00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:21.919 align:start position:0%
back page of um of
 
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
CR7 that that contains the the voter's
 
00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:29.220 align:start position:0%
guide information and I want to direct
 
00:26:33.769 --> 00:26:33.779 align:start position:0%
your attention down to the um the uh the
 
00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:35.220 align:start position:0%
final sentence
 
00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
um in the paragraph that begins on line
 
00:26:39.769 --> 00:26:39.779 align:start position:0%
one at the present time okay and it goes
 
00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
it reads the United States Supreme Court
 
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
has ruled that if any money raised by
 
00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:46.740 align:start position:0%
taxation is granted to any private
 
00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:49.380 align:start position:0%
school it would be unconstitutional to
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
exclude any school of a religious sector
 
00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
denomination I was wondering if you
 
00:26:58.490 --> 00:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
could speak to whether or not any money
 
00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:01.140 align:start position:0%
raised by taxation is currently being
 
00:27:03.409 --> 00:27:03.419 align:start position:0%
granted to a private school in New
 
00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:05.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is any money raised by
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
taxation is being granted to a public
 
00:27:10.909 --> 00:27:10.919 align:start position:0%
School in New Hampshire right well I
 
00:27:15.049 --> 00:27:15.059 align:start position:0%
suppose uh if you if you're I mean if
 
00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:16.260 align:start position:0%
you're referring to the education
 
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts yeah I mean and
 
00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:20.940 align:start position:0%
actually if we if we want to put the put
 
00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:23.820 align:start position:0%
the efas aside okay um just for now so
 
00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:25.500 align:start position:0%
that we're not mixing that into the
 
00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:29.240 align:start position:0%
argument but just just looking at at um
 
00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:31.740 align:start position:0%
you know obviously school districts
 
00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
right you know have have taxing
 
00:27:36.169 --> 00:27:36.179 align:start position:0%
Authority in New Hampshire so they're
 
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
raising public money do school districts
 
00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:40.919 align:start position:0%
via their school boards which is the
 
00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:43.380 align:start position:0%
governing body of a school district
 
00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:44.210 align:start position:0%
governing body of a school district
um

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:44.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
um uh Grant any of those publicly raised
 
00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:51.179 align:start position:0%
tax dollars to private schools you know
 
00:27:53.149 --> 00:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure about that but it may be
 
00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:56.360 align:start position:0%
are aren't there some
 
00:27:59.350 --> 00:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
smaller districts where they where
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
there's not enough I thought I remember
 
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
all I know about this really is sort of
 
00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:04.980 align:start position:0%
what I've read in the paper to be honest
 
00:28:06.409 --> 00:28:06.419 align:start position:0%
but I thought that there were some
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
smaller districts where they didn't have
 
00:28:12.649 --> 00:28:12.659 align:start position:0%
for so for one reason or another there
 
00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:16.260 align:start position:0%
was not a public school available for
 
00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:17.700 align:start position:0%
the student for students in the district
 
00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
to go to and that at least in some
 
00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
instance some of those children may have
 
00:28:24.529 --> 00:28:24.539 align:start position:0%
gone to religious schools so I suppose
 
00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:26.940 align:start position:0%
that you know pay for pay for it by the
 
00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
state right right have you ever paid for
 
00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:29.940 align:start position:0%
it by the district by the district so
 
00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
follow up on that and what where I'm
 
00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
where I'm going with this and let's just
 
00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:35.940 align:start position:0%
take that as a generic scenario right
 
00:28:39.409 --> 00:28:39.419 align:start position:0%
now that that small town a that does not
 
00:28:42.049 --> 00:28:42.059 align:start position:0%
offer their own Public Schools or let me
 
00:28:42.059 --> 00:28:42.950 align:start position:0%
offer their own Public Schools or let me
say

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:28:45.049 --> 00:28:45.059 align:start position:0%
um small school district a that does not
 
00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:47.460 align:start position:0%
offer that does not run their own Public
 
00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:50.220 align:start position:0%
Schools contracts with with a private
 
00:28:53.649 --> 00:28:53.659 align:start position:0%
school to provide their their
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
constitutional requirement to educate
 
00:28:58.610 --> 00:28:58.620 align:start position:0%
all the children in that in that
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
District does that does that private
 
00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:07.140 align:start position:0%
school have to comply with our state's
 
00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:10.500 align:start position:0%
requirements for public schools
 
00:29:12.649 --> 00:29:12.659 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question that I
 
00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
don't Proclaim to have any expertise on
 
00:29:16.909 --> 00:29:16.919 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm not I'm not sure what the
 
00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
answer to that would be I I guess
 
00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:22.860 align:start position:0%
my requirement for special education my
 
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
services or accessibility or something
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
like that well I mean for example I I
 
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
assume that that that let's let's take
 
00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:31.020 align:start position:0%
the example that we're just both talking
 
00:29:33.409 --> 00:29:33.419 align:start position:0%
about I assume that if if the student
 
00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:35.820 align:start position:0%
that we were talking about that the that
 
00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:38.100 align:start position:0%
the uh the school district for one
 
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
reason or another couldn't educate in it
 
00:29:42.049 --> 00:29:42.059 align:start position:0%
in its Public Schools or it didn't have
 
00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:44.460 align:start position:0%
a public school whatever if that was a
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
special education student that was
 
00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:47.580 align:start position:0%
disabled in some way
 
00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:49.140 align:start position:0%
you know I would assume they could not
 
00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:52.380 align:start position:0%
it would be it would not it would be a
 
00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
violation of the of of the disabilities
 
00:29:57.049 --> 00:29:57.059 align:start position:0%
the federal disability statute for this
 
00:29:59.690 --> 00:29:59.700 align:start position:0%
school to send that person to a school
 
00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:01.860 align:start position:0%
district to a school that could not
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
accommodate the the students disability
 
00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:08.340 align:start position:0%
right that so so so in that case that
 
00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:11.100 align:start position:0%
private school contractoring with with
 
00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:14.220 align:start position:0%
small District a to provide Public
 
00:30:17.149 --> 00:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
School uh to provide education for all
 
00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
of its children
 
00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:22.860 align:start position:0%
um is is providing the role as being the
 
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
public school
 
00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
um for that school district and and has
 
00:30:30.529 --> 00:30:30.539 align:start position:0%
to be compliant with with
 
00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
um uh with our Public School laws in the
 
00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:37.020 align:start position:0%
in the in the state so
 
00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
so so the the where I'm where I'm going
 
00:30:43.029 --> 00:30:43.039 align:start position:0%
we need yeah where I'm going with this
 
00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:46.980 align:start position:0%
uh with that with that private school
 
00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
that's under contract to provide
 
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
Education Service for all the children
 
00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
in in small school district a
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
um be considered a private school that
 
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
um you know where where where you know
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
parents place their kids in private
 
00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:04.740 align:start position:0%
schools all the time or would it be
 
00:31:06.889 --> 00:31:06.899 align:start position:0%
considered in the role that they're
 
00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:09.480 align:start position:0%
providing would it be considered to be a
 
00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:11.460 align:start position:0%
public school that's an interesting one
 
00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I know the answer to that I
 
00:31:15.409 --> 00:31:15.419 align:start position:0%
mean I I guess I would say that maybe
 
00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
there's a difference in the situation of
 
00:31:22.669 --> 00:31:22.679 align:start position:0%
where the school district as opposed to
 
00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:25.500 align:start position:0%
the parents have determined that this is
 
00:31:27.529 --> 00:31:27.539 align:start position:0%
the school where that person has to go
 
00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:29.700 align:start position:0%
to right as opposed to the parents
 
00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:31.260 align:start position:0%
making the choice maybe that maybe that
 
00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:32.820 align:start position:0%
makes a difference in terms of what the
 
00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:34.860 align:start position:0%
school you know the school's obligations
 
00:31:36.889 --> 00:31:36.899 align:start position:0%
are I I'm just not sure about that I'd
 
00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:38.340 align:start position:0%
want to think about it all right thank
 
00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:40.260 align:start position:0%
you very much judge this is a point of
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
clarification under the tuition program
 
00:31:44.029 --> 00:31:44.039 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
a local board makes that decision to
 
00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
approve the receiving school be it the
 
00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
Montessori school or be it uh Newport
 
00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:53.720 align:start position:0%
High School
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
and the locals district has
 
00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility to ensure that the child
 
00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:02.460 align:start position:0%
that's being tuitioned out receives an
 
00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:05.220 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an adequate education it
 
00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:08.700 align:start position:0%
may be through to a tuition School A and
 
00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
B may not provide all those services but
 
00:32:13.549 --> 00:32:13.559 align:start position:0%
the school districts living up to its
 
00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
obligation by ensuring that the student
 
00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
can go to school a uh we we see that
 
00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
happening often in our tuition contracts
 
00:32:23.389 --> 00:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
in this state
 
00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
let's go on to the next question is
 
00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
there another question sure represent
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
drying I I have to get up to HHS
 
00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:32.460 align:start position:0%
oversight I just had one minute can I
 
00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:34.740 align:start position:0%
can I say my piece Yeah well yeah you
 
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
know yes because I want to listen to him
 
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
but I I just said you want to listen to
 
00:32:40.909 --> 00:32:40.919 align:start position:0%
the judge you know well not you know
 
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
what but you know what here you can I
 
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
here's what I I don't in any way want to
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
be disrespectful to this committee but
 
00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
I'm subbing today in criminal justice
 
00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
and they're and they're expecting me to
 
00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:53.940 align:start position:0%
be over there too so uh uh I so I'm
 
00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
sorry no no I I appreciate it I guess so
 
00:32:58.610 --> 00:32:58.620 align:start position:0%
I guess what I would so you want to hold
 
00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
up for another person or I mean I wonder
 
00:33:03.649 --> 00:33:03.659 align:start position:0%
if I I wonder if you know I do you have
 
00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:05.580 align:start position:0%
just any interest of time 30 seconds for
 
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
this sure yes absolutely what is the
 
00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
blame amendment in our constitution
 
00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
because it says that it was amended to
 
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
prohibit tax monies to schools of
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
religious things in 1877 so I assumed
 
00:33:21.049 --> 00:33:21.059 align:start position:0%
that that section in 83 is the blade
 
00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
Amendment right it's the one in section
 
00:33:26.029 --> 00:33:26.039 align:start position:0%
1983 but as was pointed out before there
 
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:27.720 align:start position:0%
is another section and I don't remember
 
00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:29.940 align:start position:0%
where but there is another section that
 
00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:31.620 align:start position:0%
was in the original Constitution that
 
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
makes some reference to religion thank
 
00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:36.360 align:start position:0%
you we're going to let that yeah thank
 
00:33:38.029 --> 00:33:38.039 align:start position:0%
you very much absolutely and have fun in
 
00:33:39.669 --> 00:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
the next committee thank you very much
 
00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:51.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr chair uh I'm
 
00:33:56.389 --> 00:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
representative Jess Edwards representing
 
00:33:59.630 --> 00:33:59.640 align:start position:0%
District 31 uh that's Chester Auburn
 
00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:04.380 align:start position:0%
Candia and Deerfield and uh I'm I'm not
 
00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
an attorney I'm somebody who's been
 
00:34:09.649 --> 00:34:09.659 align:start position:0%
fascinated in this section of all around
 
00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
blame amendments so I've been following
 
00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:14.580 align:start position:0%
it uh as a as a constitutional
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
conservative and I have entered into a
 
00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:20.940 align:start position:0%
number of conversations on Facebook and
 
00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:23.820 align:start position:0%
in other forms and one of the things
 
00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:25.820 align:start position:0%
that comes back to me
 
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
regularly when I talk about the removal
 
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
of overt religious discrimination from
 
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
our constitution is the the warning as
 
00:34:39.649 --> 00:34:39.659 align:start position:0%
though I should be afraid of it that
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
this will open up
 
00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
um kids going to Muslim schools madrasas
 
00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
and as somebody who spent time in
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan training Muslims how to you
 
00:34:56.329 --> 00:34:56.339 align:start position:0%
know fight and defend their Nation I I
 
00:34:58.070 --> 00:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
needed to read a lot of cultural
 
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
background and I would say that to those
 
00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:05.580 align:start position:0%
that may Harbor that concern that this
 
00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:08.580 align:start position:0%
would open it up to madrasas as well I
 
00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:11.220 align:start position:0%
I'm fine with that I think we're a
 
00:35:13.069 --> 00:35:13.079 align:start position:0%
pluralistic nation that doesn't
 
00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:15.180 align:start position:0%
discriminate on the basis of religion
 
00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
and it would be perfectly acceptable for
 
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
us to be comfortable with parents
 
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
choosing the school of their choice so
 
00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
so my only comment was if you're hearing
 
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
from your constituents that we need to
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
be afraid that if we get rid of this
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
that it'll open the door to madrasas I'd
 
00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:37.980 align:start position:0%
say that's okay but that's my testimony
 
00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:39.540 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative are
 
00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:41.400 align:start position:0%

um

00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
the first New Hampshire constitution of
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
1792 and it said the people of this
 
00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:57.720 align:start position:0%
state have a right to empower and do
 
00:37:00.829 --> 00:37:00.839 align:start position:0%
hereby fully empower the legislature to
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
authorize from time to time the several
 
00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
towns parishes bodies corporate or
 
00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
religious societies within the state to
 
00:37:10.609 --> 00:37:10.619 align:start position:0%
make adequate provision at their own
 
00:37:12.589 --> 00:37:12.599 align:start position:0%
expense for the support and maintenance
 
00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:14.940 align:start position:0%
of public Protestant teachers of piety
 
00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:17.940 align:start position:0%
religion and morality
 
00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:19.970 align:start position:0%
religion and morality
so

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:19.980 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
um I'm speaking today as a co-sponsor of
 
00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:26.220 align:start position:0%
cacr7 if this bill wasn't an attempt to
 
00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
amend the New Hampshire Constitution I
 
00:37:30.829 --> 00:37:30.839 align:start position:0%
might consider it a housekeeping bill
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
the description of this bill is
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
misleading there's no fiscal note and
 
00:37:36.589 --> 00:37:36.599 align:start position:0%
there's no request to actually fund
 
00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:39.420 align:start position:0%
sectarian or religious schools
 
00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
this bill is simply a request to right
 
00:37:44.569 --> 00:37:44.579 align:start position:0%
or wrong a request to remove an
 
00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
Amendment added out of bigotry and
 
00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
hatred for Catholics back in the middle
 
00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
of the 19th century it comes from a time
 
00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
when the population of New Hampshire was
 
00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:54.660 align:start position:0%
rapidly changing
 
00:37:56.990 --> 00:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
immigration was exploding in incoming
 
00:37:59.450 --> 00:37:59.460 align:start position:0%
Catholics were seen as a threat to the
 
00:38:02.329 --> 00:38:02.339 align:start position:0%
then generally Protestant state in fact
 
00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
in spite of this amendment Catholics
 
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
continued to work with the state for the
 
00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
betterment betterment of Education
 
00:38:11.569 --> 00:38:11.579 align:start position:0%
all New Hampshire Public Schools were
 
00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
originally religious in nature because
 
00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
they were created to provide the basis
 
00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:19.500 align:start position:0%
for a religious life that to Protestants
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
required reading and understanding the
 
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
Bible and devotional texts many who
 
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
learn to read as children lost the skill
 
00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:28.740 align:start position:0%
unless it was maintained for religious
 
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
reasons an initial problem with
 
00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
sectarian schools was the debate over
 
00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:36.300 align:start position:0%
which Bible to teach or if the Bible was
 
00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
even actually read by Catholics
 
00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:41.820 align:start position:0%
Catholics were also seen as having views
 
00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:43.500 align:start position:0%
that were incompatible with the
 
00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:45.300 align:start position:0%
individual Independence and personal
 
00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:47.880 align:start position:0%

identity
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
there wasn't always animosity however in
 
00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:55.260 align:start position:0%
1861 the city of Manchester actually
 
00:38:57.410 --> 00:38:57.420 align:start position:0%
gave Catholics the use of a vacant
 
00:38:59.150 --> 00:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
school which was known as the Park
 
00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:00.420 align:start position:0%
Street School
 
00:39:02.569 --> 00:39:02.579 align:start position:0%
it was controlled by the local school
 
00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
board and salaries were even paid by the
 
00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
board until 1868.
 
00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
at that time the local press
 
00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:12.540 align:start position:0%
printed an editorial that attempted to
 
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
prove that Catholic schools were
 
00:39:17.089 --> 00:39:17.099 align:start position:0%
contrary to the Constitution and laws of
 
00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:18.500 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
one city in New Hampshire seems to have
 
00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:22.980 align:start position:0%
been somewhat immune from the bigotry of
 
00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:24.140 align:start position:0%
the time
 
00:39:26.569 --> 00:39:26.579 align:start position:0%
non-catholics contributed as generously
 
00:39:28.370 --> 00:39:28.380 align:start position:0%
as Catholics to the building of Saint
 
00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
Joseph's Church a proof that the storm
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
of religious persecution which swept
 
00:39:35.329 --> 00:39:35.339 align:start position:0%
over many places in the state never
 
00:39:37.609 --> 00:39:37.619 align:start position:0%
reached Laconia
 
00:39:40.069 --> 00:39:40.079 align:start position:0%
Catholic schools grew independently of
 
00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:42.060 align:start position:0%
public schools until the United States
 
00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
began to firmly americanize
 
00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:47.940 align:start position:0%
their education and the use of English
 
00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:50.700 align:start position:0%
became mandatory in Daily instruction so
 
00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:54.660 align:start position:0%
a lot of our education laws were created
 
00:39:57.170 --> 00:39:57.180 align:start position:0%
in order to make sure that we spoke a
 
00:39:58.910 --> 00:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
unified language
 
00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
the Catholic or parochial schools were
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
then recognized by the New Hampshire
 
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education
 
00:40:07.609 --> 00:40:07.619 align:start position:0%
with the passing of the law of 1919
 
00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
establishing education standards for the
 
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
state parochial schools began working
 
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire school board
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
to bring private schools in line with
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
public schools in fact the untiring
 
00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
efforts of Bishop guertin in the 1920s
 
00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:25.260 align:start position:0%
culminated in the most amicable
 
00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:27.540 align:start position:0%
relations between public and parochial
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
school authorities
 
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
all school all schools public and
 
00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:35.220 align:start position:0%
private grew so well in the period
 
00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
following the educational reforms of
 
00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:42.180 align:start position:0%
1919 that by 1955 to alleviate the
 
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
educational problems common to both
 
00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:46.380 align:start position:0%
systems the New Hampshire legislature
 
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
has been asked to pass legislation
 
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
enabling private educational
 
00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:53.820 align:start position:0%
institutions to obtain loans not funds
 
00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:56.700 align:start position:0%
at a low rate of interest for expansion
 
00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
and renovation of physical plants
 
00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
without private parochial schools the
 
00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
state would not have been able to
 
00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
educate the growing number of students
 
00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:07.140 align:start position:0%
at that time
 
00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:09.839 align:start position:0%
in the words of Wilfred J Lessard a
 
00:41:11.329 --> 00:41:11.339 align:start position:0%
member of the State Board of Education
 
00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:14.460 align:start position:0%
from 1919 to 1932
 
00:41:17.089 --> 00:41:17.099 align:start position:0%
no parochial school is a foreign school
 
00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
or a school for foreigners it is an
 
00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:22.079 align:start position:0%
American School in which the language of
 
00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:23.820 align:start position:0%
the Constitution of the country and
 
00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
state is the basic language for
 
00:41:28.609 --> 00:41:28.619 align:start position:0%
instruction and administration while
 
00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:31.260 align:start position:0%
retaining its own characteristics
 
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
for a while in a concert the various
 
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
instruments Take A Part in the rendition
 
00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
of the same Melody
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
each musical instrument must be held and
 
00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:40.980 align:start position:0%
played according to the rules which are
 
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
peculiar to it
 
00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:44.820 align:start position:0%
so and the educational Melody of New
 
00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:47.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the parochial schools shall
 
00:41:50.569 --> 00:41:50.579 align:start position:0%
sound religious and patriotic notes and
 
00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
always harmonious with the great task
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
which confronts us the betterment of all
 
00:41:58.609 --> 00:41:58.619 align:start position:0%
the schools in New Hampshire
 
00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
considering the role that Catholic and
 
00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
Christian Schools play in educating this
 
00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:05.220 align:start position:0%
of the State of New Hampshire and
 
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
considering that they are not recipients
 
00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
of state tax dollars it is the duty of
 
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire to amend our
 
00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:13.730 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire to amend our
constitution

00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:13.740 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:16.740 align:start position:0%
by removing the bigoted line in article
 
00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:18.290 align:start position:0%
by removing the bigoted line in article

00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:18.300 align:start position:0%

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:30.900 align:start position:0%
um I had hoped to get this question to
 
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
the judge but I believe you may be able
 
00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:34.740 align:start position:0%
to answer it also
 
00:42:37.609 --> 00:42:37.619 align:start position:0%
we had heard a pointed argument about
 
00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
another portion of the New Hampshire
 
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
Constitution that would be cited to
 
00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
prohibit uh Public Funding for Religious
 
00:42:45.359 --> 00:42:47.870 align:start position:0%
prohibit uh Public Funding for Religious

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:49.130 align:start position:0%

however

00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:49.140 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
in 1961 the Supreme Court in torcasso
 
00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:55.380 align:start position:0%
versus Watkins ruled secular humanism
 
00:42:57.589 --> 00:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
has afforded religious protections as a
 
00:42:57.599 --> 00:42:58.510 align:start position:0%
has afforded religious protections as a

00:42:58.510 --> 00:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
faith
 
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
faith-based our item
 
00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:02.510 align:start position:0%
faith-based our item
therefore

00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:05.460 align:start position:0%
if we were to interpret this to say that
 
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
these public funds cannot be used to go
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
to a religious school could not the same
 
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
argument be made that funding public
 
00:43:15.829 --> 00:43:15.839 align:start position:0%
secular schools falls under the same
 
00:43:15.839 --> 00:43:23.050 align:start position:0%
secular schools falls under the same

00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:23.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
possibly but if we were to apply the
 
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution to the original purpose of
 
00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:30.420 align:start position:0%
our public education we wouldn't be
 
00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:33.780 align:start position:0%
funding public education at all thank
 
00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:35.210 align:start position:0%
funding public education at all thank
you

00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:35.220 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:37.980 align:start position:0%
for the questions represent luno
 
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you very
 
00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
much representative for for taking my
 
00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:43.130 align:start position:0%
much representative for for taking my
question

00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:43.140 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:46.020 align:start position:0%
um so I want to sort of go to the uh to
 
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
what the what the intent is behind the
 
00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
uh cacr7 and I was wondering if you
 
00:43:54.609 --> 00:43:54.619 align:start position:0%
could talk um with us a little bit about
 
00:43:58.190 --> 00:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
how the New Hampshire Constitution uh
 
00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:00.540 align:start position:0%
how how it is right now the New
 
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Customs is preventing well you
 
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
know what is the I guess what is the New
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution preventing from
 
00:44:11.650 --> 00:44:11.660 align:start position:0%
happening today
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
that um that is the motivation for for
 
00:44:17.569 --> 00:44:17.579 align:start position:0%
this um proposed Constitutional
 
00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
asking about
 
00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
um funding different schools and what
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
the state does to fund different schools
 
00:44:31.130 --> 00:44:31.140 align:start position:0%
and whether or not I'm really getting
 
00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:33.800 align:start position:0%
out what's what what's
 
00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:36.680 align:start position:0%
being prevented from happening today
 
00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
that that requires this change
 
00:44:44.089 --> 00:44:44.099 align:start position:0%
to the Constitution there's actually
 
00:44:48.170 --> 00:44:48.180 align:start position:0%
nothing in fact we've never funded these
 
00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
schools they they grew independently
 
00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:54.420 align:start position:0%
of the public schools they actually just
 
00:44:58.130 --> 00:44:58.140 align:start position:0%
coordinated courses of study in order to
 
00:44:59.750 --> 00:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that all of the students of
 
00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
the state were educated in a similar
 
00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
manner to become good citizens and a
 
00:45:08.410 --> 00:45:08.420 align:start position:0%
prime example being that all of the
 
00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:11.700 align:start position:0%
sectarian schools in the early 1900s
 
00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:14.700 align:start position:0%
were being instructed constructed solely
 
00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
in the English as the primary language
 
00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
so what's the amendment trying to do
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
it's just trying to remove a bigoted
 
00:45:25.970 --> 00:45:25.980 align:start position:0%
outdated statement it's happened nothing
 
00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
just keeping things the same as they are
 
00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:31.380 align:start position:0%
we don't fund non-public schools with
 
00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
state tax dollars it's just removing a
 
00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:36.300 align:start position:0%
bigoted purposeless statement that's why
 
00:45:38.329 --> 00:45:38.339 align:start position:0%
I said it's like a housekeeping it's
 
00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:40.020 align:start position:0%
just taking
 
00:45:41.809 --> 00:45:41.819 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:44.700 align:start position:0%
not doesn't belong in the Constitution
 
00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
it's a bigoted statement it doesn't
 
00:45:49.309 --> 00:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
change anything we don't fund non-public
 
00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
schools and if you look at the doe
 
00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:53.390 align:start position:0%
schools and if you look at the doe
website

00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
website
 
00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:56.220 align:start position:0%
Christian and Catholic schools are lit
 
00:45:59.690 --> 00:45:59.700 align:start position:0%
or parochial schools are listed with in
 
00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
the conglomeration of all non-public
 
00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
schools none of them receive state
 
00:46:07.609 --> 00:46:07.619 align:start position:0%
funding so it's not really changing
 
00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:13.849 --> 00:46:13.859 align:start position:0%
a bad line from the Constitution that
 
00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:15.060 align:start position:0%
never should have been in there in the
 
00:46:17.210 --> 00:46:17.220 align:start position:0%
per in the first place because the state
 
00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
never had the intention of
 
00:46:21.349 --> 00:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
funding these schools
 
00:46:24.349 --> 00:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there are there
 
00:46:27.370 --> 00:46:27.380 align:start position:0%
well do you want further questions
 
00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you very much
 
00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
no but that's later on in a different
 
00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:36.410 align:start position:0%
no but that's later on in a different
place

00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:38.940 align:start position:0%
so with that I'm going to close this
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
hearing down I have no other cards in
 
00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:45.660 align:start position:0%
front of us so uh cacr7 hearing is
 
00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:47.150 align:start position:0%
front of us so uh cacr7 hearing is
closed

00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
closed
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
um we'll take five minutes and then
 
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to start executing some of
 
00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
our bills we can't exact any bills until
 
00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:54.180 align:start position:0%
10 30.
 
00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
now that's when it shows up in the
 
00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:58.490 align:start position:0%
now that's when it shows up in the
calendar

00:46:58.490 --> 00:46:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:05.329 --> 00:47:05.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:05.339 --> 00:47:15.550 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:47:15.550 --> 00:47:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:19.069 --> 00:47:19.079 align:start position:0%
yeah you would cross that name out and
 
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:19.370 --> 00:49:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:19.380 --> 01:02:18.190 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:02:18.190 --> 01:02:18.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:21.839 align:start position:0%
turn on my mic here we're opening up the
 
01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
executive session and uh the first bill
 
01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
in executive session I'd like to take up
 
01:02:30.109 --> 01:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
is a continuation of the bill which we
 
01:02:33.609 --> 01:02:33.619 align:start position:0%
had discussed earlier but uh it was
 
01:02:37.549 --> 01:02:37.559 align:start position:0%
hb170 the the way that tracked out for
 
01:02:41.210 --> 01:02:41.220 align:start position:0%
everybody uh we had a motion of OTP
 
01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:42.710 align:start position:0%
everybody uh we had a motion of OTP
initially

01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
initially
 
01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
then we had an amendment Prince
 
01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:47.940 align:start position:0%
presented that Amendment also passed
 
01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
with 19-1 then we voted on that and the
 
01:02:56.030 --> 01:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
motion Was Defeated or not recommended
 
01:02:58.609 --> 01:02:58.619 align:start position:0%
with a 1010 type vote and the next
 
01:03:01.730 --> 01:03:01.740 align:start position:0%
motion which was popped up was itl and
 
01:03:03.829 --> 01:03:03.839 align:start position:0%
that's where we remain right now with
 
01:03:06.890 --> 01:03:06.900 align:start position:0%
that itl motion so what I'm going to do
 
01:03:11.089 --> 01:03:11.099 align:start position:0%
is that I'm going to open up that itl we
 
01:03:13.309 --> 01:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
we've had that motion made
 
01:03:16.490 --> 01:03:16.500 align:start position:0%
and that motion was seconded I believe
 
01:03:18.730 --> 01:03:18.740 align:start position:0%
it was seconded
 
01:03:21.170 --> 01:03:21.180 align:start position:0%
then we are going to have a little
 
01:03:25.250 --> 01:03:25.260 align:start position:0%
discussion right now on 170 and as
 
01:03:28.309 --> 01:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
agreed with uh the the ranking uh
 
01:03:30.049 --> 01:03:30.059 align:start position:0%
representative here we've got a little
 
01:03:34.970 --> 01:03:34.980 align:start position:0%
bit of discussion on the possible uh uh
 
01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
comments and suggestions presented by
 
01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
representative leckis
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
um and then we will uh but remember
 
01:03:47.089 --> 01:03:47.099 align:start position:0%
we're still on a motion of itl so in
 
01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
order to
 
01:03:51.049 --> 01:03:51.059 align:start position:0%
take up any action or anything that's
 
01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
being offered to US during this
 
01:03:55.490 --> 01:03:55.500 align:start position:0%
discussion the itl had been would have
 
01:03:57.470 --> 01:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
to be taken back
 
01:03:59.770 --> 01:03:59.780 align:start position:0%
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
 
01:04:02.569 --> 01:04:02.579 align:start position:0%
recognize uh represent like us for
 
01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
okay originally
 
01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
um we had talked
 
01:04:18.170 --> 01:04:18.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:19.849 --> 01:04:19.859 align:start position:0%
there's already a motion on the table
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
there's already emotional okay this is a
 
01:04:23.210 --> 01:04:23.220 align:start position:0%
continuation of an executive session
 
01:04:27.710 --> 01:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
which we closed down right weeks ago
 
01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
does everybody have the amendment
 
01:04:34.250 --> 01:04:34.260 align:start position:0%
what's the number it's uh number zero
 
01:04:37.549 --> 01:04:37.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:40.370 --> 01:04:40.380 align:start position:0%
and the amendment came about because
 
01:04:43.250 --> 01:04:43.260 align:start position:0%
originally we had
 
01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
talked about just adding that
 
01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
excellent uh line that says that the
 
01:04:52.549 --> 01:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
requirement may be accommodated modified
 
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
or waived in accordance with a student's
 
01:04:59.770 --> 01:04:59.780 align:start position:0%
individual with their IEP or 504 plan
 
01:05:02.930 --> 01:05:02.940 align:start position:0%
and that was to the original bill which
 
01:05:05.930 --> 01:05:05.940 align:start position:0%
only changed encouraged to require
 
01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:07.430 align:start position:0%
only changed encouraged to require
so

01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
um when it came back from OLS that's not
 
01:05:13.030 --> 01:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
quite the way it was written and the
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
memorization part of multiplication
 
01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
tables was not in there and we had
 
01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:21.349 align:start position:0%
tables was not in there and we had
agreed

01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
agreed
 
01:05:24.289 --> 01:05:24.299 align:start position:0%
most of us had it we had agreed that we
 
01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
were going to do the original plus that
 
01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:27.710 align:start position:0%
were going to do the original plus that
line

01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
so when it was noticed that it wasn't in
 
01:05:32.569 --> 01:05:32.579 align:start position:0%
there I went and got this amendment but
 
01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
what I didn't get unfortunately was the
 
01:05:40.010 --> 01:05:40.020 align:start position:0%
um when it had to be done by
 
01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:43.079 align:start position:0%
so this is this is what I got and it
 
01:05:43.079 --> 01:05:44.930 align:start position:0%
so this is this is what I got and it
basically

01:05:44.930 --> 01:05:44.940 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
um leaves the bill as it was and adds
 
01:05:50.450 --> 01:05:50.460 align:start position:0%

01:09:14.269 --> 01:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:15.890 --> 01:09:15.900 align:start position:0%

01:09:20.150 --> 01:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
yes I would like to move that this bill
 
01:09:22.970 --> 01:09:22.980 align:start position:0%
be retained
 
01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
01:09:26.709 --> 01:09:26.719 align:start position:0%

01:09:26.719 --> 01:09:28.749 align:start position:0%
I'll second that
representative

01:09:28.749 --> 01:09:28.759 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:09:31.189 --> 01:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
uh represent cordelli would you like to
 
01:09:33.829 --> 01:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
 
01:09:37.450 --> 01:09:37.460 align:start position:0%
um thank you I I think that um
 
01:09:41.689 --> 01:09:41.699 align:start position:0%
there are some uh interesting aspects uh
 
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
to this in terms of the chairmanship of
 
01:09:50.689 --> 01:09:50.699 align:start position:0%
uh Co-op district and the
 
01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
um idea of moving meetings between
 
01:09:54.719 --> 01:09:56.930 align:start position:0%
um idea of moving meetings between
locations

01:09:56.930 --> 01:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
locations
 
01:09:59.150 --> 01:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
um I think it uh
 
01:10:01.610 --> 01:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
could possibly use some more work
 
01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
however and that's why I think it should
 
01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
be retained
 
01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
01:10:10.490 --> 01:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
analogy you made the second you have
 
01:10:12.410 --> 01:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
anything yet is there any further
 
01:10:15.530 --> 01:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
discussion on the motion to retain
 
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
represent Luna sure thanks thanks very
 
01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
much for sure
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
um yeah I mean this this is a uh I I
 
01:10:26.590 --> 01:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
just I you know I I think we heard
 
01:10:29.870 --> 01:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
during last session that uh that there's
 
01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
probably a lot of work that needs to be
 
01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
done with respect to co-op um um school
 
01:10:36.890 --> 01:10:36.900 align:start position:0%
districts and maybe this could be part
 
01:10:40.010 --> 01:10:40.020 align:start position:0%
of that uh that work and and looking at
 
01:10:42.649 --> 01:10:42.659 align:start position:0%
that but I think as it uh as it stands
 
01:10:44.270 --> 01:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
here I don't think this is worth
 
01:10:47.450 --> 01:10:47.460 align:start position:0%
retaining and uh and I I you know I
 
01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
think it should be itl'd
 
01:10:54.470 --> 01:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:58.250 --> 01:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you um on the
 
01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
retained motion is that any priority I
 
01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
just listen you know and IPL or this
 
01:11:05.709 --> 01:11:05.719 align:start position:0%
take one at a time just modification
 
01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:08.340 align:start position:0%
well he was indicating through his
 
01:11:11.149 --> 01:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
discussion that he didn't see the Merit
 
01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
in retaining and that to itl I I that's
 
01:11:17.209 --> 01:11:17.219 align:start position:0%
okay but there's nothing no hierarchy
 
01:11:19.550 --> 01:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
there's no no okay no thank you no thank
 
01:11:22.130 --> 01:11:22.140 align:start position:0%
you chair thank you
 
01:11:26.510 --> 01:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
is there a further discussion from the
 
01:11:28.970 --> 01:11:28.980 align:start position:0%
yes representative McDonald thank you Mr
 
01:11:31.189 --> 01:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
chair there are some concerns brought
 
01:11:33.709 --> 01:11:33.719 align:start position:0%
forward in the hearing that this could
 
01:11:35.450 --> 01:11:35.460 align:start position:0%
make meetings less successful to the
 
01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
public if it was in a town that had the
 
01:11:39.830 --> 01:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
Lesser population then people would have
 
01:11:41.570 --> 01:11:41.580 align:start position:0%
to drive further the majority of people
 
01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
and they'd be less likely for members of
 
01:11:45.709 --> 01:11:45.719 align:start position:0%
the public to come to their school board
 
01:11:45.719 --> 01:11:46.970 align:start position:0%
the public to come to their school board
meetings

01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:46.980 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
01:11:48.530 --> 01:11:48.540 align:start position:0%
and it just seemed to be more difficult
 
01:11:51.770 --> 01:11:51.780 align:start position:0%
for everyone so I see the Merit in
 
01:11:53.570 --> 01:11:53.580 align:start position:0%
retaining the bill because it could work
 
01:11:56.330 --> 01:11:56.340 align:start position:0%
on Cooperative school boards together
 
01:11:59.510 --> 01:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
however this bill in particular
 
01:12:01.490 --> 01:12:01.500 align:start position:0%
there was just a lot of testimony in the
 
01:12:04.250 --> 01:12:04.260 align:start position:0%
contrary so I understand that an itl
 
01:12:05.689 --> 01:12:05.699 align:start position:0%
motion might be in order
 
01:12:07.610 --> 01:12:07.620 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:09.229 --> 01:12:09.239 align:start position:0%

um you know there we obviously I think
 
01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
we all received substantial opposition
 
01:19:04.010 --> 01:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
to this bill from um was it Department
 
01:19:06.770 --> 01:19:06.780 align:start position:0%
of Safety uh department of insurance I
 
01:19:10.010 --> 01:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
think was Department of Safety uh and uh
 
01:19:13.490 --> 01:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
and and I think it raised a lot of a lot
 
01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
of concerns but I would support the the
 
01:19:18.590 --> 01:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
retaining the bill to see if those
 
01:19:20.149 --> 01:19:20.159 align:start position:0%

some opportunity uh where this

01:22:09.470 --> 01:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
second uh for those that we have uh here
 
01:22:12.649 --> 01:22:12.659 align:start position:0%
with us that are not here earlier to
 
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
hear any of the presentation on the
 
01:22:19.250 --> 01:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
hearing 654 was the one bill that was
 
01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
given the uh the right to be entered
 
01:22:25.370 --> 01:22:25.380 align:start position:0%
late after the filing date
 
01:22:28.010 --> 01:22:28.020 align:start position:0%
and it's a bill that's part of where
 
01:22:29.630 --> 01:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
we're going how we're trying to deal
 
01:22:31.490 --> 01:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
with teacher shortage in our state this
 
01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
is just one small option available to
 
01:22:37.610 --> 01:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
help that uh sort this whole issue out
 
01:22:39.410 --> 01:22:39.420 align:start position:0%
where we're short with science teacher
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
science math teachers technology special
 
01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:44.090 align:start position:0%
science math teachers technology special
education

01:22:44.090 --> 01:22:44.100 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is that we have on
 
01:22:51.410 --> 01:22:51.420 align:start position:0%
the books right now 189 39b which is
 
01:22:53.630 --> 01:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
part of legislation states that a
 
01:22:56.090 --> 01:22:56.100 align:start position:0%
one-year Certificate of Eligibility can
 
01:23:00.590 --> 01:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
be provided by the local superintendent
 
01:23:04.310 --> 01:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
based upon criterial CN lines 12 through
 
01:23:07.790 --> 01:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
14 in this bill those are the three
 
01:23:11.870 --> 01:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
areas which are in effect currently
 
01:23:14.330 --> 01:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
and this bill does nothing that changed
 
01:23:16.850 --> 01:23:16.860 align:start position:0%
that what this change does though it
 
01:23:19.610 --> 01:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
changes the definition well it says
 
01:23:21.890 --> 01:23:21.900 align:start position:0%
where it's a teaching credential license
 
01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
or other teaching certificate and
 
01:23:29.090 --> 01:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
educator credential and it's by changing
 
01:23:32.390 --> 01:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
teacher to educator we're allowing all
 
01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
those that are working within the school
 
01:23:36.649 --> 01:23:36.659 align:start position:0%
district the opportunity to the
 
01:23:39.350 --> 01:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
superintendents to find a a person in
 
01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
the area of Technology that's perhaps
 
01:23:43.729 --> 01:23:43.739 align:start position:0%
certified but not necessarily called a
 
01:23:46.610 --> 01:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
teacher or a librarian media specialist
 
01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:47.470 align:start position:0%
teacher or a librarian media specialist
Etc

01:23:47.470 --> 01:23:47.480 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
01:23:50.209 --> 01:23:50.219 align:start position:0%
what this does and this bill has been
 
01:23:54.910 --> 01:23:54.920 align:start position:0%
supported widely by folks in the field
 
01:23:57.470 --> 01:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
we encourage everybody to have
 
01:23:59.689 --> 01:23:59.699 align:start position:0%
certification and meet the standards we
 
01:24:01.490 --> 01:24:01.500 align:start position:0%
have for certification
 
01:24:04.430 --> 01:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
and we have those that can come in based
 
01:24:07.209 --> 01:24:07.219 align:start position:0%
upon those Criterion lines 12 through 14
 
01:24:11.950 --> 01:24:11.960 align:start position:0%
and that have a bachelor's degree in
 
01:24:15.229 --> 01:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
experience or education relevant to that
 
01:24:17.450 --> 01:24:17.460 align:start position:0%
particular job and they pass the
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
criminal background check
 
01:24:22.729 --> 01:24:22.739 align:start position:0%
and uh they're seen as a person that can
 
01:24:24.890 --> 01:24:24.900 align:start position:0%
walk in and do the job by the
 
01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
superintendent hiring and and and and
 
01:24:30.890 --> 01:24:30.900 align:start position:0%
and and and and they oftentimes are
 
01:24:32.870 --> 01:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
given that one-year ticket
 
01:24:35.090 --> 01:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
which they may come in in November so
 
01:24:37.310 --> 01:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
that ticket's good November to November
 
01:24:40.610 --> 01:24:40.620 align:start position:0%
or whatever month it may be and we're
 
01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:42.420 align:start position:0%
finding that during this time there's
 
01:24:44.930 --> 01:24:44.940 align:start position:0%
some that would like to continue on and
 
01:24:46.490 --> 01:24:46.500 align:start position:0%
and are working towards their
 
01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
certification but are unable to do it in
 
01:24:52.070 --> 01:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
that one short period of one year
 
01:24:54.770 --> 01:24:54.780 align:start position:0%
and what this does is it allows this to
 
01:24:57.530 --> 01:24:57.540 align:start position:0%
continue for two years and this is very
 
01:24:59.390 --> 01:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
apropos for this time when we have a
 
01:25:02.090 --> 01:25:02.100 align:start position:0%
teacher shortage so what this basically
 
01:25:03.890 --> 01:25:03.900 align:start position:0%
does the bill changed it's the word
 
01:25:07.189 --> 01:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
teaching to educator I'll also note that
 
01:25:09.050 --> 01:25:09.060 align:start position:0%
there has been question in the past
 
01:25:10.970 --> 01:25:10.980 align:start position:0%
whether the person that's taking this
 
01:25:12.590 --> 01:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility is bound by the
 
01:25:15.169 --> 01:25:15.179 align:start position:0%
professional code of conduct
 
01:25:18.410 --> 01:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
and ethics yes they are and this
 
01:25:20.570 --> 01:25:20.580 align:start position:0%
definitely clarifies that position it's
 
01:25:22.970 --> 01:25:22.980 align:start position:0%
in law here even though according to
 
01:25:25.610 --> 01:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
director Appleby they already had this
 
01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility to file the code but this
 
01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:30.719 align:start position:0%
just ensures it so
 
01:25:33.350 --> 01:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
um this is why I put this forward as an
 
01:25:36.290 --> 01:25:36.300 align:start position:0%
effort to try to help us during this
 
01:25:38.570 --> 01:25:38.580 align:start position:0%
time when we see there is a need to
 
01:25:41.330 --> 01:25:41.340 align:start position:0%
sometimes extend this it's also noted in
 
01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
the bill that
 
01:25:45.050 --> 01:25:45.060 align:start position:0%
we extend for one year but the year
 
01:25:46.970 --> 01:25:46.980 align:start position:0%
you're extending to has to be a budding
 
01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
that first year it can't be you have one
 
01:25:51.649 --> 01:25:51.659 align:start position:0%
year you skip two years you want to come
 
01:25:53.450 --> 01:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
back and finish the other no they have
 
01:25:56.390 --> 01:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
to be consecutive abutting years so I
 
01:25:57.709 --> 01:25:57.719 align:start position:0%
won't discuss any further I hope that
 
01:25:59.450 --> 01:25:59.460 align:start position:0%
explains for those that are new to the
 
01:25:59.460 --> 01:26:01.610 align:start position:0%
explains for those that are new to the
committee

01:26:01.610 --> 01:26:01.620 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:26:03.890 --> 01:26:03.900 align:start position:0%
uh further discussion representative
 
01:26:06.530 --> 01:26:06.540 align:start position:0%
cascadden thank you I would encourage
 
01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
everyone to approve the um to vote in
 
01:26:11.570 --> 01:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
the positive for OTP
 
01:26:15.530 --> 01:26:15.540 align:start position:0%
what this also does is allow for say a
 
01:26:17.090 --> 01:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
candidate that works in the school
 
01:26:19.070 --> 01:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
district as a paraprofessional or
 
01:26:21.709 --> 01:26:21.719 align:start position:0%
teacher aide or an interventionist
 
01:26:23.629 --> 01:26:23.639 align:start position:0%
who has potential and never had the
 
01:26:25.310 --> 01:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go to go away to college
 
01:26:28.910 --> 01:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
for four years but has some education
 
01:26:32.030 --> 01:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
base and then must take a certain number
 
01:26:34.970 --> 01:26:34.980 align:start position:0%
of courses to get certified and I have
 
01:26:38.030 --> 01:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
to pay for that out of pocket
 
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:26:43.930 --> 01:26:43.940 align:start position:0%
um so this allows them that excuse me
 
01:26:46.669 --> 01:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
that extra year
 
01:26:48.709 --> 01:26:48.719 align:start position:0%
um to be able to get through to the
 
01:26:55.310 --> 01:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:57.709 --> 01:26:57.719 align:start position:0%
I'm representative Ford
 
01:27:01.070 --> 01:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair
 
01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:01.729 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair
um

01:27:01.729 --> 01:27:01.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:05.629 --> 01:27:05.639 align:start position:0%
I would like also to note that there are
 
01:27:09.250 --> 01:27:09.260 align:start position:0%
several programs underway already
 
01:27:12.649 --> 01:27:12.659 align:start position:0%
attempting to advance Paris and others
 
01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
to move into a teacher preparation uh
 
01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
program and they're organized proposals
 
01:27:22.490 --> 01:27:22.500 align:start position:0%
including one funded with a grant from
 
01:27:25.070 --> 01:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor to provide
 
01:27:27.350 --> 01:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
health care for these people because
 
01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
they often cannot afford to go to school
 
01:27:33.290 --> 01:27:33.300 align:start position:0%
to become fully certified as a teacher
 
01:27:35.390 --> 01:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
because they can't give up their health
 
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
care for their families and so they now
 
01:27:41.330 --> 01:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
can get to with some help from others
 
01:27:44.270 --> 01:27:44.280 align:start position:0%
get grants to provide health care and
 
01:27:46.729 --> 01:27:46.739 align:start position:0%
other necessary supports so I would
 
01:27:51.770 --> 01:27:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:53.520 align:start position:0%

as well as some
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
legislation that is passed since uh the
 
01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
EFA programs were implemented
 
01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to highlight uh where
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
those changes are if I might
 
01:33:09.290 --> 01:33:09.300 align:start position:0%
um on the first page on line two
 
01:33:12.050 --> 01:33:12.060 align:start position:0%
um we added under the age of 22 for
 
01:33:15.169 --> 01:33:15.179 align:start position:0%
eligible students to accommodate the
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
special needs children who now can get

Services until that age
 
01:33:25.390 --> 01:33:25.400 align:start position:0%
on lines 11 and 12 we clarified that
 
01:33:28.430 --> 01:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
there can be multiple
 
01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
scholarship organizations
 
01:33:35.990 --> 01:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
contracted to provide scholarships that
 
01:33:39.530 --> 01:33:39.540 align:start position:0%
was not really clear in the current
 
01:33:39.540 --> 01:33:42.910 align:start position:0%
was not really clear in the current
statute

01:33:42.910 --> 01:33:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:48.290 --> 01:33:48.300 align:start position:0%
we added on line 14 the references to
 
01:33:50.830 --> 01:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
current rsas
 
01:33:54.169 --> 01:33:54.179 align:start position:0%
related to the
 
01:33:54.179 --> 01:33:55.550 align:start position:0%
related to the
um

01:33:55.550 --> 01:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:00.470 --> 01:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
town tuitioning at our payment for
 
01:34:02.629 --> 01:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
tuitions at a private school not Town
 
01:34:04.990 --> 01:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
tuition excuse me
 
01:34:07.790 --> 01:34:07.800 align:start position:0%
lines 18 and 19
 
01:34:12.350 --> 01:34:12.360 align:start position:0%
uh wanted to clarify that um if uh an
 
01:34:15.910 --> 01:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
EFA student was attending
 
01:34:19.510 --> 01:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
a public school and taking classes there
 
01:34:23.090 --> 01:34:23.100 align:start position:0%
that that would be uh paid for from
 
01:34:26.330 --> 01:34:26.340 align:start position:0%
their uh EFA account and that the
 
01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
department would not provide any
 
01:34:32.270 --> 01:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
adequacy uh Grant or payment to that
 
01:34:34.910 --> 01:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
school for those uh activities for the
 
01:34:37.330 --> 01:34:37.340 align:start position:0%
EFA student
 
01:34:41.090 --> 01:34:41.100 align:start position:0%
over to page two
 
01:34:44.890 --> 01:34:44.900 align:start position:0%
on on lines 18 through 20.
 
01:34:49.370 --> 01:34:49.380 align:start position:0%
we further uh clarified that a letter
 
01:34:51.709 --> 01:34:51.719 align:start position:0%
from the teacher who was doing a review
 
01:34:55.270 --> 01:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
of the portfolio as one of the options
 
01:35:00.229 --> 01:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
for accountability for the the EFA
 
01:35:02.750 --> 01:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
student that there would be a letter
 
01:35:04.490 --> 01:35:04.500 align:start position:0%
that was provided to the scholarship
 
01:35:07.310 --> 01:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
organization and then the scholarship
 
01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
organization would make aggregate data
 
01:35:15.110 --> 01:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
available to the department on student
 
01:35:19.310 --> 01:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:22.490 --> 01:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
aggregate data so that student privacy
 
01:35:25.850 --> 01:35:25.860 align:start position:0%
is maintained as well as the privacy of
 
01:35:28.189 --> 01:35:28.199 align:start position:0%
the evaluator
 
01:35:31.550 --> 01:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:34.310 --> 01:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
um we wanted to clarify that
 
01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:35.350 align:start position:0%
um we wanted to clarify that
um

01:35:35.350 --> 01:35:35.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:40.189 --> 01:35:40.199 align:start position:0%
an EFA student who enrolled full-time in
 
01:35:43.189 --> 01:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
a different education option under the
 
01:35:45.070 --> 01:35:45.080 align:start position:0%
compulsory Edge
 
01:35:47.169 --> 01:35:47.179 align:start position:0%
attendance laws
 
01:35:47.179 --> 01:35:48.729 align:start position:0%
attendance laws
would

01:35:48.729 --> 01:35:48.739 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:35:53.950 --> 01:35:53.960 align:start position:0%
have to withdraw from the EFA program
 
01:35:57.430 --> 01:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
they couldn't be in multiple
 
01:36:00.350 --> 01:36:00.360 align:start position:0%
compulsory attendance categories at the
 
01:36:01.970 --> 01:36:01.980 align:start position:0%
same time
 
01:36:04.189 --> 01:36:04.199 align:start position:0%
on line 28
 
01:36:04.199 --> 01:36:05.149 align:start position:0%
on line 28
um

01:36:05.149 --> 01:36:05.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:08.770 --> 01:36:08.780 align:start position:0%
we added intentional and substantial
 
01:36:13.810 --> 01:36:13.820 align:start position:0%
has had been in our original
 
01:36:16.910 --> 01:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
EFA language on the house side
 
01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
on line 30 this has been discussed on
 
01:36:22.030 --> 01:36:22.040 align:start position:0%
multiple occasions
 
01:36:24.669 --> 01:36:24.679 align:start position:0%
that scholarship
 
01:36:29.229 --> 01:36:29.239 align:start position:0%
organization shall refer suspected cases
 
01:36:32.629 --> 01:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
it had been May in the statute and I
 
01:36:34.370 --> 01:36:34.380 align:start position:0%
think everyone was in agreement that it
 
01:36:37.310 --> 01:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
should be shall and that the department
 
01:36:42.350 --> 01:36:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
um and then on the final change I
 
01:36:47.390 --> 01:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
believe is on line 35
 
01:36:49.850 --> 01:36:49.860 align:start position:0%
um where the current law had said the
 
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
department shall adopt rules but it's
 
01:36:54.169 --> 01:36:54.179 align:start position:0%
really the State Board of Education that
 
01:36:57.890 --> 01:36:57.900 align:start position:0%
adopts rules so this is uh primarily
 
01:37:00.050 --> 01:37:00.060 align:start position:0%
housekeeping I believe
 
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
um and trying to make sure that uh
 
01:37:07.250 --> 01:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
statute and rules are uh in sync
 
01:37:10.250 --> 01:37:10.260 align:start position:0%
and that's really the intent of this
 
01:37:10.260 --> 01:37:12.229 align:start position:0%
and that's really the intent of this
bill

01:37:12.229 --> 01:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:37:14.330 --> 01:37:14.340 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
representative Miley
 
01:37:19.010 --> 01:37:19.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
bringing this to our attention this is I
 
01:37:22.790 --> 01:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
qualify this is
 
01:37:24.410 --> 01:37:24.420 align:start position:0%
one of the guard rails that you're
 
01:37:27.229 --> 01:37:27.239 align:start position:0%
talking about as far as making sure that
 
01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
there are some
 
01:37:31.250 --> 01:37:31.260 align:start position:0%
rules here and this is good
 
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
two questions
 
01:37:35.930 --> 01:37:35.940 align:start position:0%
uh how how do you perceive
 
01:37:38.270 --> 01:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
is there multiple scholarship
 
01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:40.490 align:start position:0%
is there multiple scholarship
organizations

01:37:40.490 --> 01:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
01:37:43.250 --> 01:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
how might that how's that going to be
 
01:37:44.930 --> 01:37:44.940 align:start position:0%
administered I mean it's easier if you
 
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
have just one extended so that's my
 
01:37:47.930 --> 01:37:47.940 align:start position:0%
first question
 
01:37:49.910 --> 01:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
the second question is you did not
 
01:37:53.750 --> 01:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
mention on line 28 of the first page
 
01:37:57.169 --> 01:37:57.179 align:start position:0%
or you added an intentional and
 
01:37:59.629 --> 01:37:59.639 align:start position:0%
substantial so if you could
 
01:38:02.090 --> 01:38:02.100 align:start position:0%
um talk about what that means as far as
 
01:38:04.610 --> 01:38:04.620 align:start position:0%
intentional and also the multiple thank
 
01:38:04.620 --> 01:38:05.890 align:start position:0%
intentional and also the multiple thank
you

01:38:05.890 --> 01:38:05.900 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:38:12.590 --> 01:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
remind me of the first one again it's
 
01:38:14.990 --> 01:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
kind of like the multiple organizations
 
01:38:17.149 --> 01:38:17.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:38:17.159 --> 01:38:18.530 align:start position:0%
thank you
yeah

01:38:18.530 --> 01:38:18.540 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:38:18.540 --> 01:38:19.250 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

01:38:19.250 --> 01:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:22.010 --> 01:38:22.020 align:start position:0%
right now we only have basically the one
 
01:38:24.229 --> 01:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization approved by the
 
01:38:26.450 --> 01:38:26.460 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration but
 
01:38:28.689 --> 01:38:28.699 align:start position:0%
I think all was
 
01:38:32.030 --> 01:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
under the tax credit scholarship program
 
01:38:34.209 --> 01:38:34.219 align:start position:0%
which started out
 
01:38:37.189 --> 01:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
establishing a non-profit approved by
 
01:38:38.810 --> 01:38:38.820 align:start position:0%
the Department of Revenue Administration
 
01:38:41.390 --> 01:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
to administer the tax credit scholarship
 
01:38:43.610 --> 01:38:43.620 align:start position:0%
fund that there was also always the
 
01:38:45.169 --> 01:38:45.179 align:start position:0%
intention that there could be multiple
 
01:38:47.990 --> 01:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
and in in fact there I think there is a
 
01:38:50.870 --> 01:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
second but it is managed by the
 
01:38:53.930 --> 01:38:53.940 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund also
 
01:38:58.490 --> 01:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
um so I think the intention was that any
 
01:39:00.490 --> 01:39:00.500 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization
 
01:39:07.010 --> 01:39:07.020 align:start position:0%
approved by a dra under RSA 77g could
 
01:39:07.020 --> 01:39:08.330 align:start position:0%
approved by a dra under RSA 77g could
also

01:39:08.330 --> 01:39:08.340 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:39:08.340 --> 01:39:10.250 align:start position:0%
also
um

01:39:10.250 --> 01:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:13.850 --> 01:39:13.860 align:start position:0%
provide for the EFA accounts and so I
 
01:39:16.669 --> 01:39:16.679 align:start position:0%
think it would be the option of the
 
01:39:19.129 --> 01:39:19.139 align:start position:0%
parent as to which company that they
 
01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to work with and I know in
 
01:39:24.550 --> 01:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
talking with the Department
 
01:39:27.590 --> 01:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
that for the initial implementation
 
01:39:30.890 --> 01:39:30.900 align:start position:0%
there was really only one non-profit
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
approved by dra they went with the sole
 
01:39:35.990 --> 01:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
source contract for that but the
 
01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
intention has been to do a an RFP in the
 
01:39:43.209 --> 01:39:43.219 align:start position:0%
future for
 
01:39:54.550 --> 01:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:57.410 --> 01:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
as you pointed out in line 29 on the
 
01:40:00.649 --> 01:40:00.659 align:start position:0%
first page and also 28 on the second
 
01:40:00.659 --> 01:40:02.149 align:start position:0%
first page and also 28 on the second
page

01:40:02.149 --> 01:40:02.159 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:40:02.159 --> 01:40:03.070 align:start position:0%
page
um

01:40:03.070 --> 01:40:03.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:04.850 --> 01:40:04.860 align:start position:0%
in our
 
01:40:07.070 --> 01:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
there were two
 
01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
um EFA bills there was this uh house and
 
01:40:13.310 --> 01:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
a Senate Bill the house bill
 
01:40:15.110 --> 01:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
um included the words intentional and
 
01:40:18.649 --> 01:40:18.659 align:start position:0%
substantial the Senate bill which got
 
01:40:21.770 --> 01:40:21.780 align:start position:0%
um now put into law included just
 
01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:23.390 align:start position:0%
um now put into law included just
substantial

01:40:23.390 --> 01:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
substantial
 
01:40:25.850 --> 01:40:25.860 align:start position:0%
um I think that we wanted to include
 
01:40:28.970 --> 01:40:28.980 align:start position:0%
intentional in there so that
 
01:40:33.050 --> 01:40:33.060 align:start position:0%
um it was both uh not a mistake on the
 
01:40:36.290 --> 01:40:36.300 align:start position:0%
part of an invertent mistake a provision
 
01:40:38.689 --> 01:40:38.699 align:start position:0%
let's say of a receipt
 
01:40:42.410 --> 01:40:42.420 align:start position:0%
um for uh reimbursement to the
 
01:40:44.510 --> 01:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund that had to be
 
01:40:46.430 --> 01:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
something intentional that they were
 
01:40:49.610 --> 01:40:49.620 align:start position:0%
trying to misuse funds
 
01:40:52.450 --> 01:40:52.460 align:start position:0%
um their
 
01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
examples of uh we certainly want to
 
01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
provide for uh uh making sure that there
 
01:41:03.169 --> 01:41:03.179 align:start position:0%
is no misuse of funds but we want to
 
01:41:06.290 --> 01:41:06.300 align:start position:0%
make sure that it's intentional misuse
 
01:41:08.830 --> 01:41:08.840 align:start position:0%
of funds not just the mistake and
 
01:41:11.470 --> 01:41:11.480 align:start position:0%
receipt that's being submitted
 
01:41:14.570 --> 01:41:14.580 align:start position:0%
inadvertently as a maybe a package of
 
01:41:16.550 --> 01:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
receipts to the scholarship fund for
 
01:41:20.030 --> 01:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
reimbursement it could be for for
 
01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:21.430 align:start position:0%
reimbursement it could be for for
instance

01:41:21.430 --> 01:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
instance
 
01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
a set of books or set a new second set
 
01:41:27.950 --> 01:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
of curriculum for instance
 
01:41:31.030 --> 01:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
um and it it could be
 
01:41:33.550 --> 01:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
several sets of curriculum for instance
 
01:41:36.530 --> 01:41:36.540 align:start position:0%
but only one set of curriculum for the
 
01:41:38.750 --> 01:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
EFA student and another set of
 
01:41:41.390 --> 01:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
curriculum for another student in the
 
01:41:45.169 --> 01:41:45.179 align:start position:0%
household I know for example just a
 
01:41:48.910 --> 01:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
simple example the scholarship fund has
 
01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:50.470 align:start position:0%
simple example the scholarship fund has
denied

01:41:50.470 --> 01:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
denied
 
01:41:53.450 --> 01:41:53.460 align:start position:0%
book purchases because they looked up
 
01:41:56.410 --> 01:41:56.420 align:start position:0%
the book and it was not age appropriate
 
01:42:00.109 --> 01:42:00.119 align:start position:0%
for the student who was recipient of the
 
01:42:03.530 --> 01:42:03.540 align:start position:0%
EFA account but age-appropriate maybe
 
01:42:05.950 --> 01:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
for another child in the household
 
01:42:08.270 --> 01:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
so we want to make sure that this is
 
01:42:12.169 --> 01:42:12.179 align:start position:0%
something that is an intentional act on
 
01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:14.639 align:start position:0%
the part of the parent and not an
 
01:42:17.510 --> 01:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
inadvertent Act
 
01:42:19.609 --> 01:42:19.619 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
01:42:21.950 --> 01:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald thank you Mr
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Mr Vice chair for taking
 
01:42:27.350 --> 01:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
my question I'm looking at line two on
 
01:42:30.350 --> 01:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
the first page this says under the age
 
01:42:34.370 --> 01:42:34.380 align:start position:0%
of 22. I'm curious as to why it's worded
 
01:42:36.530 --> 01:42:36.540 align:start position:0%
that way when there's other bills before
 
01:42:39.890 --> 01:42:39.900 align:start position:0%
us to say 21 inclusive just because to
 
01:42:41.570 --> 01:42:41.580 align:start position:0%
keep it in line with federal statute I
 
01:42:43.370 --> 01:42:43.380 align:start position:0%
know there's no technical change just
 
01:42:47.149 --> 01:42:47.159 align:start position:0%
the wording I guess was it an oversight
 
01:42:47.159 --> 01:42:48.050 align:start position:0%
the wording I guess was it an oversight
um

01:42:48.050 --> 01:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:50.530 --> 01:42:50.540 align:start position:0%
I I think that
 
01:42:53.090 --> 01:42:53.100 align:start position:0%
there are several places as you point
 
01:42:55.729 --> 01:42:55.739 align:start position:0%
out where it says 21 inclusive I think
 
01:42:57.649 --> 01:42:57.659 align:start position:0%
there was one place where it did say
 
01:43:01.250 --> 01:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
under 20. age 22
 
01:43:05.030 --> 01:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
um and so we just went with age uh
 
01:43:08.810 --> 01:43:08.820 align:start position:0%
um 22 in this instance
 
01:43:11.330 --> 01:43:11.340 align:start position:0%
um but uh I think I'd be fine with
 
01:43:13.970 --> 01:43:13.980 align:start position:0%
either at this point all right thank you
 
01:43:16.189 --> 01:43:16.199 align:start position:0%
yes representative Hall thank you Mr
 
01:43:17.570 --> 01:43:17.580 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
is there an amount of money that
 
01:43:22.790 --> 01:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
identified that matches with substantial
 
01:43:24.770 --> 01:43:24.780 align:start position:0%
what is substantial you know and also
 
01:43:26.209 --> 01:43:26.219 align:start position:0%
obviously what is intentional but
 
01:43:28.729 --> 01:43:28.739 align:start position:0%
substantial is there a dollar amount uh
 
01:43:30.830 --> 01:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
there is no dollar amount
 
01:43:33.530 --> 01:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
um I I think that uh
 
01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:34.250 align:start position:0%
um I I think that uh
um

01:43:34.250 --> 01:43:34.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:38.090 --> 01:43:38.100 align:start position:0%
various places in statute we use the
 
01:43:43.310 --> 01:43:43.320 align:start position:0%
term substantial and so it's uh left for
 
01:43:48.350 --> 01:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
some uh discretion in that regard
 
01:43:51.410 --> 01:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
um but uh also if if we set a dollar
 
01:43:53.450 --> 01:43:53.460 align:start position:0%
amount right now
 
01:43:55.609 --> 01:43:55.619 align:start position:0%
um you know five years now five years
 
01:43:57.050 --> 01:43:57.060 align:start position:0%
from now
 
01:43:59.270 --> 01:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
um you know we could have a different uh
 
01:44:01.790 --> 01:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
opinion on what substantial is so I
 
01:44:04.310 --> 01:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
think uh just for
 
01:44:06.169 --> 01:44:06.179 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:44:08.350 --> 01:44:08.360 align:start position:0%
for the sake of
 
01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:10.510 align:start position:0%
for the sake of
future

01:44:10.510 --> 01:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:44:13.390 --> 01:44:13.400 align:start position:0%
legislation and for
 
01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
some discretion being exercised for
 
01:44:19.010 --> 01:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
instance my book example I don't think
 
01:44:22.250 --> 01:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
that that would be a substantial but uh
 
01:44:25.990 --> 01:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
maybe a a playground set
 
01:44:29.629 --> 01:44:29.639 align:start position:0%
for a child with special needs
 
01:44:29.639 --> 01:44:30.350 align:start position:0%
for a child with special needs
um

01:44:30.350 --> 01:44:30.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:33.649 --> 01:44:33.659 align:start position:0%
versus a playground set for other child
 
01:44:36.050 --> 01:44:36.060 align:start position:0%
in the household uh you know that might
 
01:44:38.810 --> 01:44:38.820 align:start position:0%
be looked at it substantial
 
01:44:40.790 --> 01:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you further question
 
01:44:42.410 --> 01:44:42.420 align:start position:0%
represent Luna
 
01:44:45.350 --> 01:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and um and
 
01:44:47.030 --> 01:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
and thanks for bringing this in I think
 
01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
there's some some interesting pieces of
 
01:44:51.950 --> 01:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
this for sure as representative Miler
 
01:44:55.070 --> 01:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
um but I want to sort of focus on on
 
01:44:57.109 --> 01:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
page one
 
01:45:00.410 --> 01:45:00.420 align:start position:0%
um uh towards the middle lines a line 16
 
01:45:00.420 --> 01:45:02.109 align:start position:0%
um uh towards the middle lines a line 16
through

01:45:02.109 --> 01:45:02.119 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:45:07.149 --> 01:45:07.159 align:start position:0%
19. so basically section four and uh
 
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
and you know it's hard to it's hard to
 
01:45:12.950 --> 01:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
read section four when you don't sort of
 
01:45:14.209 --> 01:45:14.219 align:start position:0%
see it
 
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
um as part of all of 194 F and uh
 
01:45:22.010 --> 01:45:22.020 align:start position:0%
and where particularly you've got in the
 
01:45:24.050 --> 01:45:24.060 align:start position:0%
the new language the department shall
 
01:45:26.030 --> 01:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
make no State out of fee Grant payment
 
01:45:28.189 --> 01:45:28.199 align:start position:0%
to the school for curricular activities
 
01:45:31.070 --> 01:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
and programs for the EFA student and I
 
01:45:32.990 --> 01:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
understand your your um your testimony
 
01:45:34.609 --> 01:45:34.619 align:start position:0%
when you said this is for a student who
 
01:45:36.169 --> 01:45:36.179 align:start position:0%
can take you know they're they're
 
01:45:38.510 --> 01:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
spending up to uh well no no this is
 
01:45:40.250 --> 01:45:40.260 align:start position:0%
actually contracted services so this
 
01:45:43.609 --> 01:45:43.619 align:start position:0%
isn't this is this is not a public
 
01:45:46.790 --> 01:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
school where a student is enrolled up to
 
01:45:48.290 --> 01:45:48.300 align:start position:0%
50 percent
 
01:45:51.609 --> 01:45:51.619 align:start position:0%
as a part-time student is that correct
 
01:45:56.209 --> 01:45:56.219 align:start position:0%
uh correct there are any classes that
 
01:45:58.729 --> 01:45:58.739 align:start position:0%
this EFA student signs up for a science
 
01:46:01.189 --> 01:46:01.199 align:start position:0%
lab or whatnot at their local
 
01:46:03.050 --> 01:46:03.060 align:start position:0%
um public school or charter school or
 
01:46:05.450 --> 01:46:05.460 align:start position:0%
any any public school or Charter School
 
01:46:07.669 --> 01:46:07.679 align:start position:0%
correct so this is not necessarily their
 
01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
resident School District this could be
 
01:46:14.090 --> 01:46:14.100 align:start position:0%
somewhere else and um right except for
 
01:46:17.209 --> 01:46:17.219 align:start position:0%
full time okay that would be a step I
 
01:46:19.550 --> 01:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
know this is sort of discussion
 
01:46:24.290 --> 01:46:24.300 align:start position:0%
um but but would would the school that
 
01:46:26.810 --> 01:46:26.820 align:start position:0%
is contracted for the public the
 
01:46:28.790 --> 01:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
district Public School contracted for
 
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
under Section d in part four would they
 
01:46:37.490 --> 01:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
also be required to provide
 
01:46:40.609 --> 01:46:40.619 align:start position:0%
um special education services for uh for
 
01:46:42.890 --> 01:46:42.900 align:start position:0%
a student no they would not be okay
 
01:46:45.709 --> 01:46:45.719 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further further
 
01:46:49.490 --> 01:46:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:53.209 --> 01:46:53.219 align:start position:0%
thank you um I have a couple questions
 
01:46:57.590 --> 01:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
um one I'm looking at lines 10 11 and 12
 
01:46:59.590 --> 01:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
to describe
 
01:47:02.930 --> 01:47:02.940 align:start position:0%
the opportunity the opening for multiple
 
01:47:06.290 --> 01:47:06.300 align:start position:0%
scholarships would you consider changing
 
01:47:08.390 --> 01:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
that area to having the New Hampshire
 
01:47:10.609 --> 01:47:10.619 align:start position:0%
Department of Education oversee the
 
01:47:13.010 --> 01:47:13.020 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts
 
01:47:15.410 --> 01:47:15.420 align:start position:0%
no okay I think that's a separate piece
 
01:47:16.609 --> 01:47:16.619 align:start position:0%
of legislation that we're dealing with
 
01:47:18.649 --> 01:47:18.659 align:start position:0%
it is yes I just wanted to check that
 
01:47:23.709 --> 01:47:23.719 align:start position:0%
and um one more question is on page two
 
01:47:27.470 --> 01:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
lines seven eight nine and ten
 
01:47:29.890 --> 01:47:29.900 align:start position:0%
um the areas of discipline
 
01:47:34.370 --> 01:47:34.380 align:start position:0%
that must be provided is it the intent
 
01:47:37.010 --> 01:47:37.020 align:start position:0%
that this would satisfy the competencies
 
01:47:39.470 --> 01:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
or credits for earning a high school
 
01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:43.189 align:start position:0%
or credits for earning a high school
diploma

01:47:43.189 --> 01:47:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:43.199 --> 01:47:43.970 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:47:43.970 --> 01:47:43.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:46.729 --> 01:47:46.739 align:start position:0%
uh no it did
 
01:47:46.739 --> 01:47:48.350 align:start position:0%
uh no it did
um basically

01:47:48.350 --> 01:47:48.360 align:start position:0%
um basically
 
01:47:52.129 --> 01:47:52.139 align:start position:0%
um I think this section of 194 f
 
01:47:53.950 --> 01:47:53.960 align:start position:0%
um just
 
01:48:00.010 --> 01:48:00.020 align:start position:0%
states that child who gets an EFA
 
01:48:00.020 --> 01:48:01.810 align:start position:0%
states that child who gets an EFA
account

01:48:01.810 --> 01:48:01.820 align:start position:0%
account
 
01:48:05.149 --> 01:48:05.159 align:start position:0%
should receive education in these areas
 
01:48:07.550 --> 01:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
I think these areas already spelled out
 
01:48:11.209 --> 01:48:11.219 align:start position:0%
in other sections of statutes for public
 
01:48:13.550 --> 01:48:13.560 align:start position:0%
school students so I think that this is
 
01:48:15.890 --> 01:48:15.900 align:start position:0%
trying to be consistent with what our
 
01:48:18.970 --> 01:48:18.980 align:start position:0%
children should know whether they are in
 
01:48:22.609 --> 01:48:22.619 align:start position:0%
a public school or getting education via
 
01:48:26.750 --> 01:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
an EFA account okay thank you I
 
01:48:28.729 --> 01:48:28.739 align:start position:0%
I do have one more I just thought of
 
01:48:28.739 --> 01:48:29.689 align:start position:0%
I do have one more I just thought of
something

01:48:29.689 --> 01:48:29.699 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:48:32.149 --> 01:48:32.159 align:start position:0%
go ahead it's quick all right so going
 
01:48:35.629 --> 01:48:35.639 align:start position:0%
back to the line on um
 
01:48:37.669 --> 01:48:37.679 align:start position:0%
the representative aluminum was just
 
01:48:39.530 --> 01:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
talking about that talks about programs
 
01:48:41.689 --> 01:48:41.699 align:start position:0%
it would not fund oh curricular
 
01:48:44.930 --> 01:48:44.940 align:start position:0%
activities and programs so line 19 so it
 
01:48:46.810 --> 01:48:46.820 align:start position:0%
made me think of
 
01:48:46.820 --> 01:48:48.770 align:start position:0%
made me think of
programs

01:48:48.770 --> 01:48:48.780 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:48:51.709 --> 01:48:51.719 align:start position:0%
but yet there's some retail
 
01:48:51.719 --> 01:48:53.510 align:start position:0%
but yet there's some retail
providers

01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
providers
 
01:48:58.310 --> 01:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
that EFA recipients can use for programs
 
01:49:00.850 --> 01:49:00.860 align:start position:0%
so would that negate that list of
 
01:49:03.530 --> 01:49:03.540 align:start position:0%
providers that are on the approved list
 
01:49:05.870 --> 01:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
such as I don't know art lessons music
 
01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
lessons uh Judo whatever program or
 
01:49:12.350 --> 01:49:12.360 align:start position:0%
right I don't believe so I think that
 
01:49:14.629 --> 01:49:14.639 align:start position:0%
this is specific for
 
01:49:14.639 --> 01:49:15.530 align:start position:0%
this is specific for
um

01:49:15.530 --> 01:49:15.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:19.010 --> 01:49:19.020 align:start position:0%
um those areas in which the department
 
01:49:23.169 --> 01:49:23.179 align:start position:0%
would provide if funds were available
 
01:49:26.990 --> 01:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
the adequacy grant of what is it 0.15 I
 
01:49:28.729 --> 01:49:28.739 align:start position:0%
think for taking a course at a public
 
01:49:31.910 --> 01:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
school for instance it's targeted for
 
01:49:34.790 --> 01:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
that area just to make sure that
 
01:49:37.609 --> 01:49:37.619 align:start position:0%
um the EFA student is paying for those
 
01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:44.990 --> 01:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
and so I I got a question for you so
 
01:49:48.350 --> 01:49:48.360 align:start position:0%
that and trying to stay on that topic we
 
01:49:50.810 --> 01:49:50.820 align:start position:0%
know that a homeschooler can come in and
 
01:49:52.729 --> 01:49:52.739 align:start position:0%
take a course in a school and the school
 
01:49:55.550 --> 01:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
gets 0.15 right of a student in
 
01:49:57.410 --> 01:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
reimbursement costs if money is
 
01:49:57.420 --> 01:49:59.090 align:start position:0%
reimbursement costs if money is
available

01:49:59.090 --> 01:49:59.100 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:50:02.870 --> 01:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
um so what are are you trying to this to
 
01:50:05.870 --> 01:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
say that if an EFA student comes in they
 
01:50:08.090 --> 01:50:08.100 align:start position:0%
got to use their EFA Monies to pay for
 
01:50:09.950 --> 01:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
that course that they're taking exactly
 
01:50:15.490 --> 01:50:15.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:19.729 --> 01:50:19.739 align:start position:0%
I want to raise a favorite question that
 
01:50:22.729 --> 01:50:22.739 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd usually asked and
 
01:50:25.790 --> 01:50:25.800 align:start position:0%
that is if I have a daughter who is an
 
01:50:28.070 --> 01:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
EFA program
 
01:50:30.649 --> 01:50:30.659 align:start position:0%
and she is an outstanding softball
 
01:50:30.659 --> 01:50:32.330 align:start position:0%
and she is an outstanding softball
player

01:50:32.330 --> 01:50:32.340 align:start position:0%
player
 
01:50:36.050 --> 01:50:36.060 align:start position:0%
and she wants to travel to two districts
 
01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
Beyond her resident
 
01:50:40.310 --> 01:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
to participate in the championship
 
01:50:42.950 --> 01:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
program of that school
 
01:50:47.330 --> 01:50:47.340 align:start position:0%
and there happens to be a fee a a sports
 
01:50:49.370 --> 01:50:49.380 align:start position:0%
fee to participate
 
01:50:51.950 --> 01:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
this would then cover this would mean
 
01:50:55.550 --> 01:50:55.560 align:start position:0%
that the EFA account would pay for that
 
01:50:57.770 --> 01:50:57.780 align:start position:0%
fee to participate in that outstanding
 
01:51:04.030 --> 01:51:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:06.290 --> 01:51:06.300 align:start position:0%
yes right
 
01:51:08.450 --> 01:51:08.460 align:start position:0%
um I'd have to go back and look at the
 
01:51:13.490 --> 01:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
uh the full language in in 194 f
 
01:51:16.250 --> 01:51:16.260 align:start position:0%
um but I think it's uh primarily
 
01:51:16.260 --> 01:51:17.689 align:start position:0%
um but I think it's uh primarily
intended

01:51:17.689 --> 01:51:17.699 align:start position:0%
intended
 
01:51:19.669 --> 01:51:19.679 align:start position:0%
um as with the home school students that
 
01:51:22.790 --> 01:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
it would be their their local school
 
01:51:24.550 --> 01:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
um I don't I don't know if there's
 
01:51:27.890 --> 01:51:27.900 align:start position:0%
anything in current statute for
 
01:51:30.709 --> 01:51:30.719 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers or for EFA students or
 
01:51:34.430 --> 01:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
anyone to say it has to be it can't be
 
01:51:37.010 --> 01:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
you know two two districts over or it
 
01:51:39.290 --> 01:51:39.300 align:start position:0%
has to be your local let me cut in here
 
01:51:40.910 --> 01:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
a little bit because we're now getting
 
01:51:42.550 --> 01:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
an nhia
 
01:51:45.950 --> 01:51:45.960 align:start position:0%
and uh you have to be a resident in that
 
01:51:47.570 --> 01:51:47.580 align:start position:0%
District if not we're going to have
 
01:51:50.030 --> 01:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
Semi-Pro teams all over the place here
 
01:51:51.830 --> 01:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
and that's direction we don't want to go
 
01:51:53.390 --> 01:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
so I think that's on the same page as
 
01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
you're coming from as well
 
01:51:55.440 --> 01:51:58.010 align:start position:0%
you're coming from as well
reps

01:51:58.010 --> 01:51:58.020 align:start position:0%
reps
 
01:52:00.109 --> 01:52:00.119 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you thank you Mr chair and
 
01:52:02.330 --> 01:52:02.340 align:start position:0%
thanks again representing Cordell I'm
 
01:52:06.129 --> 01:52:06.139 align:start position:0%
still stuck on um on section four uh
 
01:52:10.189 --> 01:52:10.199 align:start position:0%
because it and I don't know if this is a
 
01:52:13.370 --> 01:52:13.380 align:start position:0%
scenario that would ever develop but um
 
01:52:17.990 --> 01:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
but if if a student is is a resident of
 
01:52:24.470 --> 01:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
District a and then uh and then leaves
 
01:52:26.890 --> 01:52:26.900 align:start position:0%
um what's what would be the term uh
 
01:52:29.209 --> 01:52:29.219 align:start position:0%
unenrolls as a full-time student in
 
01:52:33.350 --> 01:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
District a establishes an EFA
 
01:52:37.629 --> 01:52:37.639 align:start position:0%
goes back to District a for 50 percent
 
01:52:40.010 --> 01:52:40.020 align:start position:0%
could they use
 
01:52:44.510 --> 01:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
either their their EFA
 
01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:47.390 align:start position:0%
either their their EFA
to

01:52:47.390 --> 01:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:50.209 --> 01:52:50.219 align:start position:0%
to pay for additional classes beyond
 
01:52:53.709 --> 01:52:53.719 align:start position:0%
their 50 enrollment in into District a
 
01:52:58.790 --> 01:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
and would they be entitled to District a
 
01:53:02.810 --> 01:53:02.820 align:start position:0%
diploma at some point down the road and
 
01:53:05.229 --> 01:53:05.239 align:start position:0%
would District a have received any
 
01:53:07.729 --> 01:53:07.739 align:start position:0%
adequacy grants from the state and what
 
01:53:10.370 --> 01:53:10.380 align:start position:0%
responsibilities would District a have
 
01:53:13.250 --> 01:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
for any special needs of that student
 
01:53:15.890 --> 01:53:15.900 align:start position:0%
given you've got a hybrid situation here
 
01:53:19.910 --> 01:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
where District a is is obligated to
 
01:53:22.790 --> 01:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
serve as their public school for up to
 
01:53:25.129 --> 01:53:25.139 align:start position:0%
50 percent and then is essentially
 
01:53:27.770 --> 01:53:27.780 align:start position:0%
serving as a private placement for the
 
01:53:30.530 --> 01:53:30.540 align:start position:0%
rest of the 50 percent
 
01:53:32.510 --> 01:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
01:53:32.520 --> 01:53:34.390 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
um

01:53:34.390 --> 01:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:35.990 align:start position:0%
um
if

01:53:35.990 --> 01:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:53:38.510 --> 01:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
um I think elsewhere in statute it
 
01:53:41.530 --> 01:53:41.540 align:start position:0%
defines that um
 
01:53:45.229 --> 01:53:45.239 align:start position:0%
full-time is greater than 50 percent
 
01:53:48.169 --> 01:53:48.179 align:start position:0%
um if they're going for part-time
 
01:53:50.149 --> 01:53:50.159 align:start position:0%
um taking a couple of classes this
 
01:53:51.770 --> 01:53:51.780 align:start position:0%
semester a couple of classes next
 
01:53:51.780 --> 01:53:53.330 align:start position:0%
semester a couple of classes next
semester

01:53:53.330 --> 01:53:53.340 align:start position:0%
semester
 
01:53:55.310 --> 01:53:55.320 align:start position:0%
um they have to pay for that there's no
 
01:53:58.129 --> 01:53:58.139 align:start position:0%
and that's what the intent here is in
 
01:53:59.810 --> 01:53:59.820 align:start position:0%
lines 18 and 19 to make sure the
 
01:54:01.550 --> 01:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
department isn't paying for those
 
01:54:04.310 --> 01:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
classes it's all coming out of the EFA
 
01:54:07.010 --> 01:54:07.020 align:start position:0%
students account
 
01:54:10.430 --> 01:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
um so that they can't mix and match and
 
01:54:14.810 --> 01:54:14.820 align:start position:0%
have you know say I'm a part-time EFA
 
01:54:19.310 --> 01:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
and part-time uh ADM student
 
01:54:21.950 --> 01:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
um to get State reimbursement for the
 
01:54:25.129 --> 01:54:25.139 align:start position:0%
other half it's it's one or that one or
 
01:54:26.450 --> 01:54:26.460 align:start position:0%
the other they're they're either
 
01:54:29.149 --> 01:54:29.159 align:start position:0%
part-time EFA student or they're
 
01:54:30.950 --> 01:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
enrolling full-time back in their
 
01:54:32.629 --> 01:54:32.639 align:start position:0%
resident District so I'm going to follow
 
01:54:34.370 --> 01:54:34.380 align:start position:0%
up on that so where do what what would
 
01:54:37.430 --> 01:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
prevent that from from happening I I
 
01:54:39.950 --> 01:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
think that the earlier definition of
 
01:54:42.350 --> 01:54:42.360 align:start position:0%
full-time student is greater than 50 I
 
01:54:44.510 --> 01:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
think that that would
 
01:54:48.950 --> 01:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
um so let's say they're 49. 49 I mean
 
01:54:50.870 --> 01:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
this is just a I think an interesting
 
01:54:53.689 --> 01:54:53.699 align:start position:0%
it's it's not I'm not ongoing dialogue
 
01:54:56.149 --> 01:54:56.159 align:start position:0%
no I understand let's keep it the
 
01:54:57.470 --> 01:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
questions I I mean I think you
 
01:54:59.270 --> 01:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
understand what I'm what I'm what I'm
 
01:55:01.669 --> 01:55:01.679 align:start position:0%
what I'm what I'm going after here and
 
01:55:05.090 --> 01:55:05.100 align:start position:0%
what do what do we have any um is there
 
01:55:06.470 --> 01:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
somebody from the Department that might
 
01:55:08.990 --> 01:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
be able to explain what what the
 
01:55:12.290 --> 01:55:12.300 align:start position:0%
resident District's obligation is to uh
 
01:55:13.850 --> 01:55:13.860 align:start position:0%
to a student
 
01:55:16.490 --> 01:55:16.500 align:start position:0%
um that may also have an EFA the
 
01:55:18.410 --> 01:55:18.420 align:start position:0%
resident district has nothing to do with
 
01:55:20.830 --> 01:55:20.840 align:start position:0%
an EFA because it's a step separate
 
01:55:23.629 --> 01:55:23.639 align:start position:0%
compulsory attendance area that we have
 
01:55:26.689 --> 01:55:26.699 align:start position:0%
established in law right so they can pay
 
01:55:28.490 --> 01:55:28.500 align:start position:0%
for the courses but they're never going
 
01:55:31.030 --> 01:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
to be an enrolled student in that school
 
01:55:33.109 --> 01:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
so that they're not going to get a
 
01:55:34.490 --> 01:55:34.500 align:start position:0%
diploma they're going to have to take
 
01:55:36.530 --> 01:55:36.540 align:start position:0%
the high set or something else if they
 
01:55:40.070 --> 01:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
want to get a high school graduation uh
 
01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:41.090 align:start position:0%
want to get a high school graduation uh
diploma

01:55:41.090 --> 01:55:41.100 align:start position:0%
diploma
 
01:55:41.100 --> 01:55:42.290 align:start position:0%
diploma
uh

01:55:42.290 --> 01:55:42.300 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:55:42.300 --> 01:55:43.669 align:start position:0%
uh
so

01:55:43.669 --> 01:55:43.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:55:46.129 --> 01:55:46.139 align:start position:0%
represent cascadden
 
01:55:48.770 --> 01:55:48.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:55:50.689 --> 01:55:50.699 align:start position:0%
um representative I'm having a difficult
 
01:55:52.750 --> 01:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
time trying to distinguish
 
01:55:55.790 --> 01:55:55.800 align:start position:0%
programs because in my mind I'm not sure
 
01:55:57.770 --> 01:55:57.780 align:start position:0%
if you're thinking of after-school clubs
 
01:56:01.669 --> 01:56:01.679 align:start position:0%
but again on the service providers for
 
01:56:03.970 --> 01:56:03.980 align:start position:0%
efas that is approved by the state
 
01:56:06.350 --> 01:56:06.360 align:start position:0%
there's a number of Summer education
 
01:56:09.669 --> 01:56:09.679 align:start position:0%
programs specialized education programs
 
01:56:14.629 --> 01:56:14.639 align:start position:0%
and at least uh 35 virtual programs
 
01:56:17.330 --> 01:56:17.340 align:start position:0%
so your bill in this line would
 
01:56:20.330 --> 01:56:20.340 align:start position:0%
eliminate all that if I understand the
 
01:56:23.330 --> 01:56:23.340 align:start position:0%
term of programs because they vary from
 
01:56:25.669 --> 01:56:25.679 align:start position:0%
you know a house home schooling program
 
01:56:29.149 --> 01:56:29.159 align:start position:0%
to a play date to a I mean a very very
 
01:56:32.149 --> 01:56:32.159 align:start position:0%
gymnastics and whatnot religion
 
01:56:35.930 --> 01:56:35.940 align:start position:0%
but how how do you interpret programs in
 
01:56:37.790 --> 01:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
your language because I I'm trying to
 
01:56:40.609 --> 01:56:40.619 align:start position:0%
separate that the two
 
01:56:40.619 --> 01:56:42.290 align:start position:0%
separate that the two
um

01:56:42.290 --> 01:56:42.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:45.410 --> 01:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
I I think curricular activities and
 
01:56:48.470 --> 01:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
programs is already in the statute and
 
01:56:51.169 --> 01:56:51.179 align:start position:0%
so I just it was repeated
 
01:56:53.689 --> 01:56:53.699 align:start position:0%
um in lines 18 and 19.
 
01:56:55.850 --> 01:56:55.860 align:start position:0%
um because it's already in in statute on
 
01:56:57.770 --> 01:56:57.780 align:start position:0%
line 18.
 
01:56:59.930 --> 01:56:59.940 align:start position:0%
um in terms of individual classes and
 
01:57:02.169 --> 01:57:02.179 align:start position:0%
curricular activities and programs
 
01:57:05.750 --> 01:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
programs I think we've heard discussions
 
01:57:10.129 --> 01:57:10.139 align:start position:0%
in the past that if EFA student wanted
 
01:57:13.070 --> 01:57:13.080 align:start position:0%
to take part in a summer program for
 
01:57:15.169 --> 01:57:15.179 align:start position:0%
instance that that would be and there
 
01:57:16.729 --> 01:57:16.739 align:start position:0%
was a fee for it that that would be paid
 
01:57:20.689 --> 01:57:20.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:24.410 --> 01:57:24.420 align:start position:0%
okay and this does not negate Apparent
 
01:57:24.420 --> 01:57:25.729 align:start position:0%
okay and this does not negate Apparent
from

01:57:25.729 --> 01:57:25.739 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:57:28.729 --> 01:57:28.739 align:start position:0%
participating in all of these programs
 
01:57:32.209 --> 01:57:32.219 align:start position:0%
well I do not believe so okay
 
01:57:34.010 --> 01:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
there's certainly it's hard to
 
01:57:36.530 --> 01:57:36.540 align:start position:0%
understand thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:57:38.629 --> 01:57:38.639 align:start position:0%
Mr Price here
 
01:57:41.450 --> 01:57:41.460 align:start position:0%
um I will apologize in advance I spent
 
01:57:45.050 --> 01:57:45.060 align:start position:0%
42 years as a lawyer so my my questions
 
01:57:47.990 --> 01:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
are around the intentional piece the
 
01:57:50.209 --> 01:57:50.219 align:start position:0%
intentional and substantial misuse
 
01:57:52.970 --> 01:57:52.980 align:start position:0%
because intent is a really hard thing to
 
01:57:54.709 --> 01:57:54.719 align:start position:0%
prove even in court
 
01:57:58.490 --> 01:57:58.500 align:start position:0%
so you have
 
01:58:01.070 --> 01:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
is and also you could have well that's
 
01:58:04.490 --> 01:58:04.500 align:start position:0%
one question so how do you intend how
 
01:58:07.850 --> 01:58:07.860 align:start position:0%
what's guidance or what you're asking an
 
01:58:09.589 --> 01:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
organization a non-profit organization
 
01:58:13.250 --> 01:58:13.260 align:start position:0%
to make that determination and
 
01:58:15.290 --> 01:58:15.300 align:start position:0%
um it's a really hard Concept in in the
 
01:58:17.390 --> 01:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
court to prove so how do you
 
01:58:21.490 --> 01:58:21.500 align:start position:0%
it's it's really hard to prove right uh
 
01:58:26.629 --> 01:58:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:28.850 --> 01:58:28.860 align:start position:0%
you probably don't want to spend any
 
01:58:31.089 --> 01:58:31.099 align:start position:0%
time as a lawyer most people have them
 
01:58:34.310 --> 01:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh the term in intentional and
 
01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:35.570 align:start position:0%
uh the term in intentional and
substantial

01:58:35.570 --> 01:58:35.580 align:start position:0%
substantial
 
01:58:38.750 --> 01:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
um I think has been recommended To Us by
 
01:58:41.870 --> 01:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
lawyers and is uh similar terminology
 
01:58:43.850 --> 01:58:43.860 align:start position:0%
that is used in
 
01:58:48.290 --> 01:58:48.300 align:start position:0%
um many of the states that have uh Esa
 
01:58:50.510 --> 01:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
education savings account types and
 
01:58:50.520 --> 01:58:52.250 align:start position:0%
education savings account types and
programs

01:58:52.250 --> 01:58:52.260 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:58:52.260 --> 01:58:54.350 align:start position:0%
programs
um

01:58:54.350 --> 01:58:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:57.709 --> 01:58:57.719 align:start position:0%
you know I'll leave the the arguing
 
01:58:59.270 --> 01:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
between lawyers
 
01:59:02.270 --> 01:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
um to others on on the mean of
 
01:59:02.280 --> 01:59:03.589 align:start position:0%
um to others on on the mean of
intentional

01:59:03.589 --> 01:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
intentional
 
01:59:05.209 --> 01:59:05.219 align:start position:0%
could I have a follow -up please yes you
 
01:59:07.990 --> 01:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
may so
 
01:59:10.729 --> 01:59:10.739 align:start position:0%
what would happen because you could have
 
01:59:14.350 --> 01:59:14.360 align:start position:0%
an unintentional substantial abuse
 
01:59:17.030 --> 01:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
those will never get reported under this
 
01:59:20.169 --> 01:59:20.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:20.179 --> 01:59:21.729 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:59:21.729 --> 01:59:21.739 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:59:24.530 --> 01:59:24.540 align:start position:0%
an unintentional substantial probably
 
01:59:28.370 --> 01:59:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:30.709 --> 01:59:30.719 align:start position:0%
but I'm sure
 
01:59:30.719 --> 01:59:32.470 align:start position:0%
but I'm sure
um

01:59:32.470 --> 01:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:34.970 --> 01:59:34.980 align:start position:0%
there's a very
 
01:59:39.530 --> 01:59:39.540 align:start position:0%
um close working relationship between
 
01:59:41.870 --> 01:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
the current scholarship fund and any
 
01:59:44.089 --> 01:59:44.099 align:start position:0%
future scholarship fund I believe
 
01:59:47.589 --> 01:59:47.599 align:start position:0%
working with the Department because of
 
01:59:51.350 --> 01:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
the process that's involved and I know
 
01:59:54.229 --> 01:59:54.239 align:start position:0%
that the department is also trying to
 
01:59:58.189 --> 01:59:58.199 align:start position:0%
hire as provided for in-law an EFA
 
02:00:01.550 --> 02:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
administrator to constantly work with
 
02:00:04.129 --> 02:00:04.139 align:start position:0%
the scholarship fund so I'm sure that
 
02:00:05.360 --> 02:00:05.370 align:start position:0%
there would be
 
02:00:05.370 --> 02:00:06.550 align:start position:0%
there would be
[Music]

02:00:06.550 --> 02:00:06.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:00:09.950 --> 02:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
discussions between the organizations if
 
02:00:12.830 --> 02:00:12.840 align:start position:0%
anything came up um where there was a
 
02:00:15.410 --> 02:00:15.420 align:start position:0%
substantial misuse of funds and a
 
02:00:20.510 --> 02:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
yes representative Woodcock then
 
02:00:24.109 --> 02:00:24.119 align:start position:0%
represent like us
 
02:00:25.370 --> 02:00:25.380 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
02:00:25.380 --> 02:00:26.689 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
um

02:00:26.689 --> 02:00:26.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:28.189 --> 02:00:28.199 align:start position:0%
I'm not trying to be redundant because
 
02:00:29.450 --> 02:00:29.460 align:start position:0%
I've actually written it down where it's
 
02:00:31.250 --> 02:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
not these two things but I'm going back
 
02:00:34.850 --> 02:00:34.860 align:start position:0%
to the the uh question 20 line 28 part
 
02:00:37.070 --> 02:00:37.080 align:start position:0%
two is my initial question is was
 
02:00:39.229 --> 02:00:39.239 align:start position:0%
representative Lanes
 
02:00:39.239 --> 02:00:40.430 align:start position:0%
representative Lanes
um

02:00:40.430 --> 02:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:42.609 --> 02:00:42.619 align:start position:0%
why would we why would we want
 
02:00:45.589 --> 02:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
intentional there if we want the
 
02:00:47.510 --> 02:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization to fall through
 
02:00:49.370 --> 02:00:49.380 align:start position:0%
in substantial misuse
 
02:00:51.589 --> 02:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
well it seems to me if you don't have if
 
02:00:53.030 --> 02:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
I if I read it right I think that's what
 
02:00:55.310 --> 02:00:55.320 align:start position:0%
she was trying to say or you said you
 
02:00:57.290 --> 02:00:57.300 align:start position:0%
have to have both ingredients both
 
02:01:01.070 --> 02:01:01.080 align:start position:0%
ingredients to be forwarded yes
 
02:01:02.990 --> 02:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
um uh I'll just
 
02:01:05.870 --> 02:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
um refer back also to
 
02:01:07.490 --> 02:01:07.500 align:start position:0%
um all the discussions with the
 
02:01:09.890 --> 02:01:09.900 align:start position:0%
administrative rules
 
02:01:12.109 --> 02:01:12.119 align:start position:0%
um and gel car and that whole process
 
02:01:16.070 --> 02:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
and um uh it seems to me in my reading
 
02:01:18.589 --> 02:01:18.599 align:start position:0%
of what went on with the development of
 
02:01:20.149 --> 02:01:20.159 align:start position:0%
the rules
 
02:01:24.169 --> 02:01:24.179 align:start position:0%
um that uh there was discussion
 
02:01:26.810 --> 02:01:26.820 align:start position:0%
um about uh the possible need for
 
02:01:26.820 --> 02:01:28.729 align:start position:0%
um about uh the possible need for
intentional

02:01:28.729 --> 02:01:28.739 align:start position:0%
intentional
 
02:01:31.629 --> 02:01:31.639 align:start position:0%
um by uh some of the
 
02:01:35.030 --> 02:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
lawyers involved working with
 
02:01:40.390 --> 02:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:42.830 --> 02:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas do you have a
 
02:01:46.129 --> 02:01:46.139 align:start position:0%
follow-up question I I do and that the
 
02:01:47.390 --> 02:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
answer confused is I was trying to
 
02:01:49.550 --> 02:01:49.560 align:start position:0%
process it um the other question why I'm
 
02:01:51.229 --> 02:01:51.239 align:start position:0%
trying to see everything burning up over
 
02:01:53.149 --> 02:01:53.159 align:start position:0%
there like I'm killing it over here
 
02:01:54.649 --> 02:01:54.659 align:start position:0%
thank you rather than what I'm sorry
 
02:01:56.330 --> 02:01:56.340 align:start position:0%
about my car that you made fun of in the
 
02:01:58.189 --> 02:01:58.199 align:start position:0%
last exact session
 
02:01:58.199 --> 02:02:00.169 align:start position:0%
last exact session
um

02:02:00.169 --> 02:02:00.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:02.149 --> 02:02:02.159 align:start position:0%
also Barb earlier and I'd written it
 
02:02:03.410 --> 02:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
down so I don't think I'm trying to
 
02:02:05.149 --> 02:02:05.159 align:start position:0%
cheat on somebody else's work
 
02:02:08.149 --> 02:02:08.159 align:start position:0%
um the doe uh bill they just went
 
02:02:09.589 --> 02:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
through the house
 
02:02:12.050 --> 02:02:12.060 align:start position:0%
uh was talking about doe takeover
 
02:02:16.310 --> 02:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
administration of the EFA accounts uh my
 
02:02:18.649 --> 02:02:18.659 align:start position:0%
question is a lot of the language that's
 
02:02:22.970 --> 02:02:22.980 align:start position:0%
relative here uh to scholarship
 
02:02:26.030 --> 02:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
organizations but that can be negated if
 
02:02:27.709 --> 02:02:27.719 align:start position:0%
the doe continues the process of taking
 
02:02:31.510 --> 02:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:35.890 --> 02:02:35.900 align:start position:0%
if uh if the doe takes over the
 
02:02:38.450 --> 02:02:38.460 align:start position:0%
operation of the program is that your
 
02:02:39.950 --> 02:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
question right
 
02:02:41.689 --> 02:02:41.699 align:start position:0%
um I think that there would have to be a
 
02:02:45.050 --> 02:02:45.060 align:start position:0%
lot of the statute Rewritten but um you
 
02:02:46.790 --> 02:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
know that's another piece of legislation
 
02:02:49.189 --> 02:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
that has already gone through
 
02:02:51.229 --> 02:02:51.239 align:start position:0%
no no no I don't think I don't think we
 
02:02:54.950 --> 02:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
voted on that okay yeah thank you thank
 
02:02:56.089 --> 02:02:56.099 align:start position:0%
them both
 
02:02:58.430 --> 02:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman you're welcome uh
 
02:03:01.010 --> 02:03:01.020 align:start position:0%
reps and leckis
 
02:03:03.470 --> 02:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
yes I was wondering
 
02:03:06.109 --> 02:03:06.119 align:start position:0%
um the report that the
 
02:03:08.510 --> 02:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization has to give to
 
02:03:12.229 --> 02:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
the doe is very involved and complex and
 
02:03:14.570 --> 02:03:14.580 align:start position:0%
has all kinds of information that's not
 
02:03:17.450 --> 02:03:17.460 align:start position:0%
in this other report and there will be
 
02:03:19.310 --> 02:03:19.320 align:start position:0%
multiple scholarship organizations
 
02:03:19.320 --> 02:03:21.350 align:start position:0%
multiple scholarship organizations
potentially

02:03:21.350 --> 02:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
02:03:25.790 --> 02:03:25.800 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering why you decided to have
 
02:03:28.430 --> 02:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization report to
 
02:03:33.050 --> 02:03:33.060 align:start position:0%
the legislature rather and Etc rather
 
02:03:36.169 --> 02:03:36.179 align:start position:0%
than the doe report to
 
02:03:41.930 --> 02:03:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:44.089 --> 02:03:44.099 align:start position:0%
have the scholarship organization report
 
02:03:47.689 --> 02:03:47.699 align:start position:0%
to the legislature
 
02:03:50.330 --> 02:03:50.340 align:start position:0%
but you you I forget what letter that
 
02:03:52.550 --> 02:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
was that what line that was on at this
 
02:03:55.490 --> 02:03:55.500 align:start position:0%
point I've looked at so many things
 
02:03:57.950 --> 02:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
um the reporting
 
02:04:00.169 --> 02:04:00.179 align:start position:0%
to the legislature and all you know the
 
02:04:02.870 --> 02:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
Senate all of the you know I was
 
02:04:04.609 --> 02:04:04.619 align:start position:0%
wondering why you have them report
 
02:04:08.089 --> 02:04:08.099 align:start position:0%
rather than the doe report since the doe
 
02:04:10.189 --> 02:04:10.199 align:start position:0%
already has from the scholarship
 
02:04:14.990 --> 02:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
organization a much greater report
 
02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:16.510 align:start position:0%
organization a much greater report
um

02:04:16.510 --> 02:04:16.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:20.089 --> 02:04:20.099 align:start position:0%
yeah I I had neglected to look at page
 
02:04:20.099 --> 02:04:21.410 align:start position:0%
yeah I I had neglected to look at page
three

02:04:21.410 --> 02:04:21.420 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:04:22.490 --> 02:04:22.500 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure that's where you're
 
02:04:25.390 --> 02:04:25.400 align:start position:0%
looking but page three actually is our
 
02:04:29.089 --> 02:04:29.099 align:start position:0%
new Provisions that are being required
 
02:04:32.570 --> 02:04:32.580 align:start position:0%
um of the scholarship organization right
 
02:04:32.580 --> 02:04:33.410 align:start position:0%
um of the scholarship organization right
um

02:04:33.410 --> 02:04:33.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:35.930 --> 02:04:35.940 align:start position:0%
and thank you for uh reminding me of
 
02:04:35.940 --> 02:04:37.310 align:start position:0%
and thank you for uh reminding me of
those

02:04:37.310 --> 02:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:04:40.490 --> 02:04:40.500 align:start position:0%
um now there are several new reports
 
02:04:43.070 --> 02:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
um that had been left out of the current
 
02:04:45.229 --> 02:04:45.239 align:start position:0%
Statute in terms of annual reports from
 
02:04:47.629 --> 02:04:47.639 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization
 
02:04:49.790 --> 02:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
02:04:53.810 --> 02:04:53.820 align:start position:0%
also a survey of parents and both of
 
02:04:53.820 --> 02:04:55.370 align:start position:0%
also a survey of parents and both of
these

02:04:55.370 --> 02:04:55.380 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:04:58.250 --> 02:04:58.260 align:start position:0%
um mimic what's required of the
 
02:05:00.470 --> 02:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization under the tax
 
02:05:04.129 --> 02:05:04.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:06.050 --> 02:05:06.060 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:05:08.390 --> 02:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
further questions representative um
 
02:05:10.970 --> 02:05:10.980 align:start position:0%
Balboni well thank you Mr chair and
 
02:05:12.410 --> 02:05:12.420 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
02:05:12.420 --> 02:05:13.609 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
question

02:05:13.609 --> 02:05:13.619 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:05:14.930 --> 02:05:14.940 align:start position:0%
um I'm just going to go a little bit
 
02:05:16.970 --> 02:05:16.980 align:start position:0%
different angle here on
 
02:05:16.980 --> 02:05:19.490 align:start position:0%
different angle here on
sorry

02:05:19.490 --> 02:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:05:24.910 --> 02:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
on page two uh line 17
 
02:05:29.510 --> 02:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
through 21 referring to the assessment
 
02:05:32.930 --> 02:05:32.940 align:start position:0%
piece and the portfolio you've added in
 
02:05:37.010 --> 02:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
with a letter from the teacher should be
 
02:05:39.709 --> 02:05:39.719 align:start position:0%
provided to the scholarship organization
 
02:05:44.209 --> 02:05:44.219 align:start position:0%
uh my question was refers to um it just
 
02:05:46.490 --> 02:05:46.500 align:start position:0%
States very generally what the students
 
02:05:48.830 --> 02:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
education progress and then it states
 
02:05:51.649 --> 02:05:51.659 align:start position:0%
that uh that there will be aggregate
 
02:05:55.129 --> 02:05:55.139 align:start position:0%
data made available I'm kind of curious
 
02:05:57.589 --> 02:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
about the aggregate data would look like
 
02:06:00.290 --> 02:06:00.300 align:start position:0%
because it's just a letter I mean is
 
02:06:02.330 --> 02:06:02.340 align:start position:0%
there a template I mean what kind of
 
02:06:04.070 --> 02:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
information would that
 
02:06:06.709 --> 02:06:06.719 align:start position:0%
teacher be assessing and to go along
 
02:06:09.290 --> 02:06:09.300 align:start position:0%
with that how do you know or who makes
 
02:06:12.410 --> 02:06:12.420 align:start position:0%
the determination at all whether the
 
02:06:15.050 --> 02:06:15.060 align:start position:0%
adequate progress has been made
 
02:06:17.870 --> 02:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
well I think the termination of adequate
 
02:06:17.880 --> 02:06:18.950 align:start position:0%
well I think the termination of adequate
progress

02:06:18.950 --> 02:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
progress
 
02:06:21.050 --> 02:06:21.060 align:start position:0%
um ultimately is the responsibility of
 
02:06:22.430 --> 02:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
the parent
 
02:06:25.250 --> 02:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
would be my response to that that
 
02:06:25.260 --> 02:06:26.750 align:start position:0%
would be my response to that that
portion

02:06:26.750 --> 02:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
portion
 
02:06:29.870 --> 02:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
um uh I I think that
 
02:06:29.880 --> 02:06:30.790 align:start position:0%
um uh I I think that
um

02:06:30.790 --> 02:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:33.589 --> 02:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
one we we don't want
 
02:06:33.599 --> 02:06:34.970 align:start position:0%
one we we don't want
um

02:06:34.970 --> 02:06:34.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:38.030 --> 02:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
these are EFA students
 
02:06:40.330 --> 02:06:40.340 align:start position:0%
um and I think we want to
 
02:06:43.669 --> 02:06:43.679 align:start position:0%
provide for their their privacy there
 
02:06:45.290 --> 02:06:45.300 align:start position:0%
could be multiple children in the
 
02:06:47.149 --> 02:06:47.159 align:start position:0%
household it could be just one who's
 
02:06:50.390 --> 02:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
receiving an EFA so we need to protect
 
02:06:52.129 --> 02:06:52.139 align:start position:0%
their privacy
 
02:06:52.139 --> 02:06:53.089 align:start position:0%
their privacy
um

02:06:53.089 --> 02:06:53.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:56.629 --> 02:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
but also to make sure that the profile
 
02:07:00.589 --> 02:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
has excuse me yeah the the profile
 
02:07:03.950 --> 02:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
um section c on line 13 that the profile
 
02:07:07.310 --> 02:07:07.320 align:start position:0%
has been uh done and has been reviewed
 
02:07:08.689 --> 02:07:08.699 align:start position:0%
um that's the reason for the letter
 
02:07:12.470 --> 02:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
going to the scholarship organization
 
02:07:15.169 --> 02:07:15.179 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes please
 
02:07:19.070 --> 02:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
um so this information just goes to the
 
02:07:22.070 --> 02:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization again I'm just
 
02:07:25.129 --> 02:07:25.139 align:start position:0%
still trying to understand uh
 
02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:32.750 --> 02:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
and it would be sent to the Department
 
02:07:34.729 --> 02:07:34.739 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education right yes
 
02:07:36.290 --> 02:07:36.300 align:start position:0%
okay yeah yeah
 
02:07:39.589 --> 02:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
um department is um used um I think a
 
02:07:41.689 --> 02:07:41.699 align:start position:0%
department is defined as the Department
 
02:07:45.609 --> 02:07:45.619 align:start position:0%
of Education in the in the chapter
 
02:07:47.689 --> 02:07:47.699 align:start position:0%
further questions of Representative
 
02:07:49.910 --> 02:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
Cardell yes representative luno
 
02:07:52.609 --> 02:07:52.619 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and and I
 
02:07:54.589 --> 02:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
know this is turning into a discussion
 
02:07:56.570 --> 02:07:56.580 align:start position:0%
on on these questions but I'm still
 
02:07:58.850 --> 02:07:58.860 align:start position:0%
stuck on section four and I'll try to
 
02:08:02.390 --> 02:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
keep it to um to a question but um where
 
02:08:04.910 --> 02:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
where the department where the the new
 
02:08:06.890 --> 02:08:06.900 align:start position:0%
language on lines 18 and 19 say
 
02:08:08.689 --> 02:08:08.699 align:start position:0%
basically the department shall not make
 
02:08:11.390 --> 02:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
a state adequacy Grant payment to the
 
02:08:14.030 --> 02:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
school so talk referring to the district
 
02:08:17.109 --> 02:08:17.119 align:start position:0%
public school and um
 
02:08:22.189 --> 02:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm concerned how that reads up
 
02:08:26.750 --> 02:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:29.990 --> 02:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
um which which are the the rules that um
 
02:08:32.089 --> 02:08:32.099 align:start position:0%
that are directed to the education
 
02:08:34.669 --> 02:08:34.679 align:start position:0%
Freedom account program and it says a
 
02:08:37.609 --> 02:08:37.619 align:start position:0%
child with a disability participating in
 
02:08:40.430 --> 02:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
an EFA program and enrolled in a public
 
02:08:45.589 --> 02:08:45.599 align:start position:0%
school Under RSA 194 F colon 2 Roman 2D
 
02:08:49.189 --> 02:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
which is exactly what's being amended on
 
02:08:51.470 --> 02:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
line 16.
 
02:08:56.030 --> 02:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
is entitled uh to a um uh a free and
 
02:08:58.010 --> 02:08:58.020 align:start position:0%
appropriate public education so I
 
02:08:59.990 --> 02:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
believe that means special education
 
02:09:02.209 --> 02:09:02.219 align:start position:0%
services and it goes on to say the
 
02:09:03.950 --> 02:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
school district in which the child with
 
02:09:06.649 --> 02:09:06.659 align:start position:0%
a disability participating in the EFA
 
02:09:09.169 --> 02:09:09.179 align:start position:0%
program enrolled a public school Under
 
02:09:14.089 --> 02:09:14.099 align:start position:0%
194 F2 Roman 2D resides is responsible
 
02:09:16.850 --> 02:09:16.860 align:start position:0%
for the provision of of those special
 
02:09:19.970 --> 02:09:19.980 align:start position:0%
education services so I'm wondering if
 
02:09:23.270 --> 02:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
if lines 18 and 19 are now further
 
02:09:25.490 --> 02:09:25.500 align:start position:0%
depriving their
 
02:09:28.609 --> 02:09:28.619 align:start position:0%
um the resident school district and or
 
02:09:31.430 --> 02:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
the the school district that is
 
02:09:34.089 --> 02:09:34.099 align:start position:0%
providing these the contracted services
 
02:09:41.149 --> 02:09:41.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:42.649 --> 02:09:42.659 align:start position:0%
um I don't think so there there is
 
02:09:46.729 --> 02:09:46.739 align:start position:0%
another uh section in 194 uh specific to
 
02:09:49.550 --> 02:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
special education and we also have
 
02:09:51.410 --> 02:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
um legislation
 
02:09:54.050 --> 02:09:54.060 align:start position:0%
um about that and then notification that
 
02:09:56.330 --> 02:09:56.340 align:start position:0%
has to be made to parents when they sign
 
02:10:00.169 --> 02:10:00.179 align:start position:0%
up for an EFA about their options
 
02:10:02.510 --> 02:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
um under idea
 
02:10:04.850 --> 02:10:04.860 align:start position:0%
um and I think that that will be
 
02:10:08.570 --> 02:10:08.580 align:start position:0%
um clarified with that legislation but
 
02:10:10.850 --> 02:10:10.860 align:start position:0%
also in terms of
 
02:10:13.790 --> 02:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
um this is this section was really
 
02:10:17.450 --> 02:10:17.460 align:start position:0%
targeted at the curricular activities
 
02:10:19.669 --> 02:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
um be it any one of the schools that
 
02:10:21.669 --> 02:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
would normally receive
 
02:10:25.010 --> 02:10:25.020 align:start position:0%
or could receive uh state adequacy
 
02:10:25.020 --> 02:10:26.229 align:start position:0%
or could receive uh state adequacy
grants

02:10:26.229 --> 02:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
grants
 
02:10:30.229 --> 02:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
if a special needs student
 
02:10:30.239 --> 02:10:30.890 align:start position:0%
if a special needs student
um

02:10:30.890 --> 02:10:30.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:32.930 --> 02:10:32.940 align:start position:0%
does enroll
 
02:10:36.890 --> 02:10:36.900 align:start position:0%
in a public school they can enroll in a
 
02:10:39.109 --> 02:10:39.119 align:start position:0%
out of District public school full-time
 
02:10:42.229 --> 02:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
and pay for it with their EFA account
 
02:10:45.109 --> 02:10:45.119 align:start position:0%
um and in those circumstances the
 
02:10:46.970 --> 02:10:46.980 align:start position:0%
residence School District would be
 
02:10:46.980 --> 02:10:48.530 align:start position:0%
residence School District would be
responsible

02:10:48.530 --> 02:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
02:10:51.890 --> 02:10:51.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:54.350 --> 02:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
um and and but that we'll get in I think
 
02:10:55.970 --> 02:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
we'll get into that more with that other
 
02:10:58.310 --> 02:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation because I I do have
 
02:11:01.750 --> 02:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
some information regarding that but
 
02:11:04.669 --> 02:11:04.679 align:start position:0%
yeah just to follow up sure is that
 
02:11:06.589 --> 02:11:06.599 align:start position:0%
another piece of legislation I thought
 
02:11:09.229 --> 02:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
we were done our hearings today
 
02:11:11.149 --> 02:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
um so is this somewhere else or coming
 
02:11:12.890 --> 02:11:12.900 align:start position:0%
in from somewhere
 
02:11:14.570 --> 02:11:14.580 align:start position:0%
um I guess we had the hearing on that
 
02:11:16.189 --> 02:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
piece it was a
 
02:11:18.169 --> 02:11:18.179 align:start position:0%
um representative Tanner's uh
 
02:11:20.629 --> 02:11:20.639 align:start position:0%
legislation uh next to me uh might have
 
02:11:21.830 --> 02:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
been representative Cornell's
 
02:11:24.890 --> 02:11:24.900 align:start position:0%
legislation no I remember that but no
 
02:11:26.930 --> 02:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about uh I'm talking about
 
02:11:30.530 --> 02:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
specific with respect to the the duty of
 
02:11:33.169 --> 02:11:33.179 align:start position:0%
the resident School District to pay be
 
02:11:35.990 --> 02:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
pay for right I I think that that I
 
02:11:38.930 --> 02:11:38.940 align:start position:0%
think that needs to be clarified
 
02:11:41.330 --> 02:11:41.340 align:start position:0%
um as part of that legislation
 
02:11:42.589 --> 02:11:42.599 align:start position:0%
um and I'm
 
02:11:44.629 --> 02:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
um looking at a possible amendment to
 
02:11:45.950 --> 02:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
bring forward
 
02:11:49.070 --> 02:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
um also uh at the exact session to try
 
02:11:50.629 --> 02:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
and help clarify that so there does
 
02:11:52.790 --> 02:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
appear to follow so there does appear to
 
02:11:55.370 --> 02:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
be an inconsistency between statute and
 
02:11:57.530 --> 02:11:57.540 align:start position:0%
rule in this area
 
02:11:59.570 --> 02:11:59.580 align:start position:0%
I I gotta I'd have to go back and look
 
02:12:01.970 --> 02:12:01.980 align:start position:0%
at the rule I'm sorry yeah thank you
 
02:12:04.550 --> 02:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
very much representative cascadden thank
 
02:12:06.649 --> 02:12:06.659 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
02:12:06.659 --> 02:12:08.149 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
question

02:12:08.149 --> 02:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:12:10.250 --> 02:12:10.260 align:start position:0%
um so historically if I was a
 
02:12:12.470 --> 02:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
participating agent for homeschool
 
02:12:15.890 --> 02:12:15.900 align:start position:0%
families they registered in the 2000 the
 
02:12:17.209 --> 02:12:17.219 align:start position:0%
law and then you had to follow up
 
02:12:20.149 --> 02:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
annually to get a progress and whatnot
 
02:12:23.750 --> 02:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
or to assist I'm sorry I'm not sure what
 
02:12:25.310 --> 02:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
you meant by agent I didn't understand
 
02:12:25.320 --> 02:12:27.050 align:start position:0%
you meant by agent I didn't understand
that

02:12:27.050 --> 02:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:12:30.290 --> 02:12:30.300 align:start position:0%
um well when when a family
 
02:12:33.350 --> 02:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
wishes to homeschool they must notify a
 
02:12:37.310 --> 02:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
participating agency which is normally
 
02:12:39.890 --> 02:12:39.900 align:start position:0%
more often than not I believe that the
 
02:12:41.990 --> 02:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
school's superintendent but it also
 
02:12:43.669 --> 02:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
could be
 
02:12:46.189 --> 02:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
you know what somebody else right could
 
02:12:47.750 --> 02:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
be or just a letter to the Department of
 
02:12:47.760 --> 02:12:48.729 align:start position:0%
be or just a letter to the Department of
Education

02:12:48.729 --> 02:12:48.739 align:start position:0%
Education
 
02:12:51.530 --> 02:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
but for the most part I mean I managed
 
02:12:53.390 --> 02:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
all those cases and then the 2000
 
02:12:56.750 --> 02:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
legislation came down that they did not
 
02:12:59.569 --> 02:12:59.579 align:start position:0%
need to provide any accountability in
 
02:13:02.830 --> 02:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
the law that you had to annually provide
 
02:13:07.430 --> 02:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
updates went away so once someone you
 
02:13:08.990 --> 02:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
know said they were going to homeschool
 
02:13:13.310 --> 02:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
that was the last that you may hear in
 
02:13:15.649 --> 02:13:15.659 align:start position:0%
some cases not all because there are
 
02:13:17.149 --> 02:13:17.159 align:start position:0%
there's some wonderful homeschool
 
02:13:19.790 --> 02:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
families that I've I've worked with but
 
02:13:24.410 --> 02:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
looking at lying uh well page two
 
02:13:28.609 --> 02:13:28.619 align:start position:0%
17 18 19 and 20 where a letter would be
 
02:13:31.490 --> 02:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
submitted on an annual basis
 
02:13:33.649 --> 02:13:33.659 align:start position:0%
for student progress
 
02:13:36.709 --> 02:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
do you do you believe that this would
 
02:13:39.229 --> 02:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
now change for homeschool parents to
 
02:13:41.089 --> 02:13:41.099 align:start position:0%
have an accountability no when they
 
02:13:44.149 --> 02:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
don't no this is strictly within the 194
 
02:13:48.890 --> 02:13:48.900 align:start position:0%
chapter for EFA okay program but I think
 
02:13:53.209 --> 02:13:53.219 align:start position:0%
all along in talking to when we first
 
02:13:56.450 --> 02:13:56.460 align:start position:0%
put the program in place we recognized
 
02:13:59.390 --> 02:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
everyone recognized that homeschooling
 
02:14:01.270 --> 02:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
was different
 
02:14:06.290 --> 02:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
than an EFA student homeschooling and
 
02:14:08.629 --> 02:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
that's why there are separate compulsory
 
02:14:10.970 --> 02:14:10.980 align:start position:0%
attendance categories now for the two
 
02:14:14.990 --> 02:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
okay and that's why some homeschool
 
02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:16.550 align:start position:0%
okay and that's why some homeschool
parents

02:14:16.550 --> 02:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
parents
 
02:14:18.729 --> 02:14:18.739 align:start position:0%
um elect not to
 
02:14:21.589 --> 02:14:21.599 align:start position:0%
take an EFA accounts because they don't
 
02:14:23.089 --> 02:14:23.099 align:start position:0%
want to
 
02:14:23.099 --> 02:14:24.890 align:start position:0%
want to
um

02:14:24.890 --> 02:14:24.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:27.050 --> 02:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
get involved with the government shall
 
02:14:28.550 --> 02:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
we say
 
02:14:31.669 --> 02:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
okay all right this is defined in the
 
02:14:33.470 --> 02:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
compulsory attendances four categories
 
02:14:34.609 --> 02:14:34.619 align:start position:0%
we're talking about private school
 
02:14:38.930 --> 02:14:38.940 align:start position:0%
public school efas and homeschooling and
 
02:14:40.910 --> 02:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
they're separate and apart from each
 
02:14:40.920 --> 02:14:44.530 align:start position:0%
they're separate and apart from each
other

02:14:44.530 --> 02:14:44.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:48.229 --> 02:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
uh further questions from the committee
 
02:14:50.330 --> 02:14:50.340 align:start position:0%
not seeing you're off the hook 45
 
02:14:51.550 --> 02:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
minutes later
 
02:14:54.709 --> 02:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
thank you I just had a wonderful time oh
 
02:14:56.569 --> 02:14:56.579 align:start position:0%
but you did
 
02:14:58.490 --> 02:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
02:14:58.500 --> 02:14:59.209 align:start position:0%
okay so
um

02:14:59.209 --> 02:14:59.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:02.750 --> 02:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
the next hearing we have scheduled is
 
02:15:04.370 --> 02:15:04.380 align:start position:0%
scheduled for
 
02:15:07.729 --> 02:15:07.739 align:start position:0%
um 12 45.
 
02:15:10.250 --> 02:15:10.260 align:start position:0%
so yeah we're closing this hearing yeah
 
02:15:12.350 --> 02:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
this hearing is closed
 
02:15:15.830 --> 02:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
and the next one is scheduled for 12 45
 
02:15:19.010 --> 02:15:19.020 align:start position:0%
that's about an hour from now so what we
 
02:15:20.629 --> 02:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
can do is we can take that hour lunch
 
02:15:22.790 --> 02:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
break right now where everybody has that
 
02:15:25.430 --> 02:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
time available to them and we'll come
 
02:15:32.589 --> 02:15:32.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:37.689 --> 02:15:37.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:37.699 --> 02:15:47.950 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:15:47.950 --> 02:15:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:51.589 --> 02:15:51.599 align:start position:0%
yeah I got it um we're gonna have to use
 
02:15:54.229 --> 02:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
every day so I'm going to start out with
 
02:15:56.510 --> 02:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
the Monday the reason for that is that
 
02:16:00.229 --> 02:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
from the 6th through half day on the
 
02:16:03.589 --> 02:16:03.599 align:start position:0%
16th there could be as many as four
 
02:16:06.410 --> 02:16:06.420 align:start position:0%
session days thrown in there so you
 
02:16:08.629 --> 02:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
subtract that out of the nine eight and
 
02:16:10.370 --> 02:16:10.380 align:start position:0%
a half eight quick Interruption could we
 
02:16:12.550 --> 02:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
exact 632 right now
 
02:16:16.930 --> 02:16:16.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:21.410 --> 02:16:21.420 align:start position:0%
if we're all on the same page Ito
 
02:16:24.950 --> 02:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
see I gotta find out where we are no we
 
02:16:27.470 --> 02:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
did want IPL on this bill but we wanted
 
02:16:30.649 --> 02:16:30.659 align:start position:0%
to retain on 394. I think they're
 
02:16:32.209 --> 02:16:32.219 align:start position:0%
they're looking to have some kind of
 
02:16:35.629 --> 02:16:35.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:35.639 --> 02:51:19.370 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:51:19.370 --> 02:51:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:19.380 --> 03:19:45.110 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:19:45.110 --> 03:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:48.349 --> 03:19:48.359 align:start position:0%
want it from anybody
 
03:19:50.870 --> 03:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative are you are you
 
03:19:53.570 --> 03:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
presenting we need a pink card
 
03:19:58.309 --> 03:19:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:58.319 --> 03:20:00.250 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:20:00.250 --> 03:20:00.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:03.230 --> 03:20:03.240 align:start position:0%
we have one you know we have one I was
 
03:20:04.550 --> 03:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
calling you did you want to try and do
 
03:20:07.969 --> 03:20:07.979 align:start position:0%
that okay is he here Greg is here yes
 
03:20:10.070 --> 03:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
but Allison's out
 
03:20:12.469 --> 03:20:12.479 align:start position:0%
so right after this bill we will exec
 
03:20:14.150 --> 03:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
and then those that because we have two
 
03:20:19.790 --> 03:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:19.800 --> 03:20:25.330 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:20:25.330 --> 03:20:25.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:28.010 --> 03:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
I don't think he's going to take too
 
03:20:30.710 --> 03:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
long no I know okay we're going to go
 
03:20:31.910 --> 03:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
ahead with the next hearing that's
 
03:20:34.929 --> 03:20:34.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:37.790 --> 03:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
hb181 181
 
03:20:40.309 --> 03:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
this is an act establishing a committee
 
03:20:42.469 --> 03:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
to study school meal programs in New
 
03:20:44.150 --> 03:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's public schools and
 
03:20:46.490 --> 03:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
non-sectarian schools that accept public
 
03:20:58.030 --> 03:20:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:01.010 --> 03:21:01.020 align:start position:0%
so I am a leader I'm representative
 
03:21:02.450 --> 03:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
Timothy Horgan for Stratford County
 
03:21:04.910 --> 03:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
District 10 which is now the uh just the
 
03:21:06.170 --> 03:21:06.180 align:start position:0%
town of Durham
 
03:21:09.290 --> 03:21:09.300 align:start position:0%
and this bill looks pretty familiar we
 
03:21:11.450 --> 03:21:11.460 align:start position:0%
it's been uh well we actually passed it
 
03:21:11.460 --> 03:21:12.469 align:start position:0%
it's been uh well we actually passed it
uh

03:21:12.469 --> 03:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:21:15.469 --> 03:21:15.479 align:start position:0%
last session and a committee met chaired
 
03:21:16.490 --> 03:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
by uh
 
03:21:18.469 --> 03:21:18.479 align:start position:0%
Sue Newman who sadly no longer remember
 
03:21:20.330 --> 03:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
this house um
 
03:21:23.210 --> 03:21:23.220 align:start position:0%
but but she's just taking a little uh
 
03:21:24.830 --> 03:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
still very much around it's not bad
 
03:21:27.349 --> 03:21:27.359 align:start position:0%
she's just uh doing other things and um
 
03:21:29.210 --> 03:21:29.220 align:start position:0%
so that committee I think was fairly
 
03:21:30.710 --> 03:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
successful and they learned a lot from
 
03:21:32.870 --> 03:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
it and I don't know
 
03:21:35.690 --> 03:21:35.700 align:start position:0%
uh probably probably won't be that
 
03:21:38.570 --> 03:21:38.580 align:start position:0%
successful it might be like uh it may
 
03:21:40.309 --> 03:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
not it made a lot to cover as much
 
03:21:42.349 --> 03:21:42.359 align:start position:0%
ground as it did when Reverend Newman
 
03:21:44.269 --> 03:21:44.279 align:start position:0%
was was uh running up I think it's still
 
03:21:47.269 --> 03:21:47.279 align:start position:0%
uh a good idea still valid enough so I
 
03:21:49.309 --> 03:21:49.319 align:start position:0%
would uh I presented this bill to you so
 
03:21:50.389 --> 03:21:50.399 align:start position:0%
you're uh
 
03:21:52.309 --> 03:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
free to either uh
 
03:21:54.590 --> 03:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
so I recommend that you pass it even if
 
03:21:56.450 --> 03:21:56.460 align:start position:0%
even if it's not quite as extensive as
 
03:21:59.330 --> 03:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
what uh president Newman uh Newman did
 
03:22:00.650 --> 03:22:00.660 align:start position:0%
it would still be a worthwhile exercise
 
03:22:02.630 --> 03:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
because there was a lot of uh
 
03:22:04.670 --> 03:22:04.680 align:start position:0%
interested in expanding and
 
03:22:07.130 --> 03:22:07.140 align:start position:0%
restructuring uh School Meal programs
 
03:22:09.110 --> 03:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
especially uh
 
03:22:10.790 --> 03:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
especially since during the pandemic
 
03:22:14.330 --> 03:22:14.340 align:start position:0%
years what rep honorable Sue Mullen
 
03:22:16.490 --> 03:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
Mullen did I say Newman yes yes it's
 
03:22:18.410 --> 03:22:18.420 align:start position:0%
Newman I humbly apologize especially
 
03:22:18.420 --> 03:22:20.830 align:start position:0%
Newman I humbly apologize especially
since

03:22:20.830 --> 03:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:24.110 --> 03:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
yeah she's very much in here yes mullet
 
03:22:24.120 --> 03:22:25.130 align:start position:0%
yeah she's very much in here yes mullet
Newman

03:22:25.130 --> 03:22:25.140 align:start position:0%
Newman
 
03:22:26.809 --> 03:22:26.819 align:start position:0%
thank you for correcting that I should
 
03:22:28.490 --> 03:22:28.500 align:start position:0%
have should have written my testimony in
 
03:22:30.050 --> 03:22:30.060 align:start position:0%
advance then but anyway Reverend Sue
 
03:22:31.849 --> 03:22:31.859 align:start position:0%
Mullen chaired it remnants who knew what
 
03:22:34.370 --> 03:22:34.380 align:start position:0%
I think also participated in it so
 
03:22:35.750 --> 03:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's um
 
03:22:37.610 --> 03:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
and especially especially of Interest
 
03:22:39.950 --> 03:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
since during the pandemic uh in both
 
03:22:41.210 --> 03:22:41.220 align:start position:0%
schools here in New Hampshire all the
 
03:22:43.190 --> 03:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
students got free meals and that was a
 
03:22:44.570 --> 03:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
very popular uh
 
03:22:46.250 --> 03:22:46.260 align:start position:0%
that's a very popular program that's
 
03:22:48.410 --> 03:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
obviously made possible just concerning
 
03:22:50.389 --> 03:22:50.399 align:start position:0%
things we're doing lots of unusual
 
03:22:51.769 --> 03:22:51.779 align:start position:0%
things during the pandemic and the
 
03:22:54.230 --> 03:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
funding was available but um
 
03:22:56.990 --> 03:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
it's still like a yeah I think there's I
 
03:22:58.910 --> 03:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
think we're the importance of school
 
03:23:01.550 --> 03:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
nutrition is uh being recognized
 
03:23:03.469 --> 03:23:03.479 align:start position:0%
more more and more this committee would
 
03:23:05.450 --> 03:23:05.460 align:start position:0%
be able to look uh look into a more
 
03:23:07.849 --> 03:23:07.859 align:start position:0%
Innovative and better ways to uh to
 
03:23:09.830 --> 03:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
reduce school school hunger to meet the
 
03:23:11.690 --> 03:23:11.700 align:start position:0%
nutritional needs of all students and I
 
03:23:14.030 --> 03:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
apologize for representative mother and
 
03:23:16.969 --> 03:23:16.979 align:start position:0%
representative Newman may be watching on
 
03:23:19.870 --> 03:23:19.880 align:start position:0%
YouTube for all I knows so
 
03:23:22.969 --> 03:23:22.979 align:start position:0%
yes I'll be in trouble next time I see
 
03:23:25.010 --> 03:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
her but she'll be nice about it so
 
03:23:27.769 --> 03:23:27.779 align:start position:0%
that's uh so I apologize for apologize
 
03:23:30.410 --> 03:23:30.420 align:start position:0%
for mixing up the names but uh I still
 
03:23:33.290 --> 03:23:33.300 align:start position:0%
think it's a good bill and uh advise you
 
03:23:35.150 --> 03:23:35.160 align:start position:0%
to pass it thank you looks like there's
 
03:23:36.710 --> 03:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
a question thank you very much are there
 
03:23:38.630 --> 03:23:38.640 align:start position:0%

03:23:42.479 --> 03:23:43.969 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
representative

03:23:43.969 --> 03:23:43.979 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:23:48.889 --> 03:23:48.899 align:start position:0%
um the previous uh committee that you
 
03:23:50.870 --> 03:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
um mentioned
 
03:23:54.530 --> 03:23:54.540 align:start position:0%
um was just last term I believe what new
 
03:23:57.250 --> 03:23:57.260 align:start position:0%
information do you expect
 
03:24:01.849 --> 03:24:01.859 align:start position:0%
this committee to come up with since
 
03:24:05.210 --> 03:24:05.220 align:start position:0%
it's the previous one was so recent well
 
03:24:06.889 --> 03:24:06.899 align:start position:0%
there's always new things to be found
 
03:24:09.950 --> 03:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
out I know like when we had uh the bill
 
03:24:12.190 --> 03:24:12.200 align:start position:0%
of this committee
 
03:24:14.809 --> 03:24:14.819 align:start position:0%
I learned that there were more schools
 
03:24:16.429 --> 03:24:16.439 align:start position:0%
and I thought that weren't part of this
 
03:24:18.170 --> 03:24:18.180 align:start position:0%
school lunch program or that there'd be
 
03:24:20.269 --> 03:24:20.279 align:start position:0%
startup costs and uh so that probably
 
03:24:22.010 --> 03:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
needs to be a
 
03:24:23.510 --> 03:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
that that's something that could be
 
03:24:25.250 --> 03:24:25.260 align:start position:0%
clarified how much those startup costs
 
03:24:27.469 --> 03:24:27.479 align:start position:0%
for and how to how to pay for them
 
03:24:30.889 --> 03:24:30.899 align:start position:0%
um and there's just probably this is a
 
03:24:33.830 --> 03:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh is it so they didn't they did a lot
 
03:24:35.330 --> 03:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
of work I don't think they exhausted the
 
03:24:37.370 --> 03:24:37.380 align:start position:0%
topic for all time or even for a few
 
03:24:40.070 --> 03:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
years so a fan of they can't think of
 
03:24:41.269 --> 03:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
anything either talk about they're
 
03:24:42.950 --> 03:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
always free to issue a very very brief
 
03:24:42.960 --> 03:24:43.849 align:start position:0%
always free to issue a very very brief
report

03:24:43.849 --> 03:24:43.859 align:start position:0%
report
 
03:24:45.830 --> 03:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
um and send it to us in November before
 
03:24:48.290 --> 03:24:48.300 align:start position:0%

03:24:48.300 --> 03:24:50.750 align:start position:0%

representative

03:24:50.750 --> 03:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:24:52.790 --> 03:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
03:24:54.710 --> 03:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
question I was on that committee yes I
 
03:24:56.389 --> 03:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
remember thank you
 
03:24:58.969 --> 03:24:58.979 align:start position:0%
and uh yes we did quite an extensive
 
03:25:01.130 --> 03:25:01.140 align:start position:0%
study and the committee report at the
 
03:25:04.670 --> 03:25:04.680 align:start position:0%
end was that the recommendation was not
 
03:25:07.010 --> 03:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
to have a further study committee
 
03:25:08.510 --> 03:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
because it was a study committee to
 
03:25:10.849 --> 03:25:10.859 align:start position:0%
study a study committee yes and we
 
03:25:12.830 --> 03:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
decided we were not going there was no
 
03:25:14.330 --> 03:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
need for further study because we'd
 
03:25:17.269 --> 03:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
already done it but out of it many of
 
03:25:19.309 --> 03:25:19.319 align:start position:0%
the bills that we've seen and heard and
 
03:25:21.950 --> 03:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
even voted on already this year came out
 
03:25:23.590 --> 03:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
of that study committee
 
03:25:27.530 --> 03:25:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:30.530 --> 03:25:30.540 align:start position:0%
curious as to why we need to do it again
 
03:25:32.809 --> 03:25:32.819 align:start position:0%
when we've learned a lot in that and the
 
03:25:33.830 --> 03:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
bills and
 
03:25:38.510 --> 03:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
well I just it's uh my co-spots and I
 
03:25:40.550 --> 03:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
was just about there was a need to that
 
03:25:42.710 --> 03:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
that at least give you considering
 
03:25:44.090 --> 03:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
whether you wanted to like study some
 
03:25:45.349 --> 03:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
more issues because I think there are
 
03:25:47.210 --> 03:25:47.220 align:start position:0%
still a few issues left even though like
 
03:25:50.750 --> 03:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
everything you said is like 125 correct
 
03:25:50.760 --> 03:25:52.250 align:start position:0%
everything you said is like 125 correct
so

03:25:52.250 --> 03:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:25:54.349 --> 03:25:54.359 align:start position:0%
the committee did you and the rest of
 
03:25:55.849 --> 03:25:55.859 align:start position:0%
you ready worked very hard and covered a
 
03:25:57.410 --> 03:25:57.420 align:start position:0%
lot of ground is extremely valuable
 
03:25:59.750 --> 03:25:59.760 align:start position:0%

introduce

03:42:15.110 --> 03:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:21.170 --> 03:59:21.180 align:start position:0%

we have here it's on 516
 
03:59:28.790 --> 03:59:28.800 align:start position:0%
HB 516 is relative to the freedom of
 
03:59:30.410 --> 03:59:30.420 align:start position:0%
speech and Association of public
 
03:59:32.990 --> 03:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
institutions of higher education
 
03:59:35.269 --> 03:59:35.279 align:start position:0%
I trust everybody's having fun this
 
03:59:38.210 --> 03:59:38.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:42.349 --> 03:59:42.359 align:start position:0%
okay represent Papa Popovich Mueller
 
03:59:47.150 --> 03:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:49.250 --> 03:59:49.260 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:59:51.950 --> 03:59:51.960 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh thank you to all the
 
03:59:54.950 --> 03:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I normally try
 
03:59:58.010 --> 03:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
to keep my remarks to committees to one
 
03:59:59.809 --> 03:59:59.819 align:start position:0%
to three minutes I'm gonna ask for a
 
04:00:01.910 --> 04:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
special dispensation for about five this
 
04:00:04.490 --> 04:00:04.500 align:start position:0%
time because this is the most important
 
04:00:07.070 --> 04:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
bill that I'll be talking about this
 
04:00:08.689 --> 04:00:08.699 align:start position:0%
year and I would appreciate your
 
04:00:08.699 --> 04:00:10.729 align:start position:0%
year and I would appreciate your
latitude

04:00:10.729 --> 04:00:10.739 align:start position:0%
latitude
 
04:00:12.889 --> 04:00:12.899 align:start position:0%
I need to start by saying that you know
 
04:00:14.210 --> 04:00:14.220 align:start position:0%
I was born and raised in a communist
 
04:00:16.670 --> 04:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
country I'm a naturalized citizen my
 
04:00:18.590 --> 04:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
mother was a lifelong elementary teacher
 
04:00:20.510 --> 04:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
she taught kids in first through fourth
 
04:00:23.269 --> 04:00:23.279 align:start position:0%
grade I thought were living myself for a
 
04:00:25.130 --> 04:00:25.140 align:start position:0%
decade I served on the Wyndham School
 
04:00:25.140 --> 04:00:25.910 align:start position:0%
decade I served on the Wyndham School
Board

04:00:25.910 --> 04:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
Board
 
04:00:28.130 --> 04:00:28.140 align:start position:0%
so I'm telling you these things so you
 
04:00:30.110 --> 04:00:30.120 align:start position:0%
understand both my commitment to free
 
04:00:31.729 --> 04:00:31.739 align:start position:0%
speech based on where I'm coming from
 
04:00:33.710 --> 04:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
and my commitment to education and my
 
04:00:36.349 --> 04:00:36.359 align:start position:0%
understanding of those issues
 
04:00:38.809 --> 04:00:38.819 align:start position:0%
but have been passed bills on this topic
 
04:00:41.750 --> 04:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
this is a very different bill it's a
 
04:00:43.910 --> 04:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
very clean language the concerns that
 
04:00:45.650 --> 04:00:45.660 align:start position:0%
were expressed in the previous years
 
04:00:48.050 --> 04:00:48.060 align:start position:0%
we've made every effort to address them
 
04:00:51.170 --> 04:00:51.180 align:start position:0%
it is also a bipartisan bill I don't
 
04:00:53.030 --> 04:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
consider such basic constitutional
 
04:00:55.429 --> 04:00:55.439 align:start position:0%
rights to be a partisan matter I think
 
04:00:57.590 --> 04:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
we all have an interest in freedom of
 
04:01:00.170 --> 04:01:00.180 align:start position:0%
speech and freedom of Association and I
 
04:01:02.030 --> 04:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
will continue to work on you know
 
04:01:04.990 --> 04:01:05.000 align:start position:0%
getting bipartisan support for this bill
 
04:01:08.030 --> 04:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
also for the record both of my bills
 
04:01:10.189 --> 04:01:10.199 align:start position:0%
that I introduced are bipartisan and if
 
04:01:11.870 --> 04:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
you look at all my other legislation I
 
04:01:15.170 --> 04:01:15.180 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor the other co-sponsors go for
 
04:01:16.969 --> 04:01:16.979 align:start position:0%
all Democrat to all Republican with
 
04:01:18.889 --> 04:01:18.899 align:start position:0%
everything in between I support good
 
04:01:20.630 --> 04:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
ideas regardless of who came up with
 
04:01:20.640 --> 04:01:22.150 align:start position:0%
ideas regardless of who came up with
them

04:01:22.150 --> 04:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:01:26.510 --> 04:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of support HB 516 continues to
 
04:01:28.490 --> 04:01:28.500 align:start position:0%
have support from fire AFP and a lot of
 
04:01:30.050 --> 04:01:30.060 align:start position:0%
other organizations some of which are
 
04:01:32.269 --> 04:01:32.279 align:start position:0%
present in the room but also for the
 
04:01:35.030 --> 04:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
first time the support of ACLU they were
 
04:01:37.070 --> 04:01:37.080 align:start position:0%
unable to commit to speaking here but
 
04:01:39.469 --> 04:01:39.479 align:start position:0%
they you know confirmed to me in writing
 
04:01:40.910 --> 04:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
they supported and they said they would
 
04:01:43.550 --> 04:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
be signed in favor of the bill and I
 
04:01:45.410 --> 04:01:45.420 align:start position:0%
think it's important to note the broad
 
04:01:48.050 --> 04:01:48.060 align:start position:0%
support for this bill from organizations
 
04:01:50.269 --> 04:01:50.279 align:start position:0%
all across the Spectrum
 
04:01:53.450 --> 04:01:53.460 align:start position:0%
in terms of legislation I believe that
 
04:01:55.969 --> 04:01:55.979 align:start position:0%
the best way to pass legislation that
 
04:01:58.010 --> 04:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
will work and serve all of us is to work
 
04:01:59.990 --> 04:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
on it in a Cooperative rather than an
 
04:02:02.570 --> 04:02:02.580 align:start position:0%
adversarial manner so the prime sponsor
 
04:02:04.550 --> 04:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
for the bill I spent a time and I
 
04:02:08.990 --> 04:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
engaged with the ccsnh and UNH and you
 
04:02:10.670 --> 04:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
know regardless of what the outcome of
 
04:02:12.650 --> 04:02:12.660 align:start position:0%
this particular bill is I will continue
 
04:02:14.510 --> 04:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
to stay in contact and be engaged with
 
04:02:16.370 --> 04:02:16.380 align:start position:0%
them on those matters because they are
 
04:02:16.380 --> 04:02:17.410 align:start position:0%
them on those matters because they are
important

04:02:17.410 --> 04:02:17.420 align:start position:0%
important
 
04:02:19.790 --> 04:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
and the good news is that during those
 
04:02:21.830 --> 04:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
meetings it was clear that we are all
 
04:02:23.630 --> 04:02:23.640 align:start position:0%
committed to respecting the freedom of
 
04:02:25.849 --> 04:02:25.859 align:start position:0%
speech and the freedom of Association on
 
04:02:28.729 --> 04:02:28.739 align:start position:0%
campuses and that the difference is that
 
04:02:31.189 --> 04:02:31.199 align:start position:0%
you know we may have tend to be over the
 
04:02:34.729 --> 04:02:34.739 align:start position:0%
bills impact on policies and operations
 
04:02:37.010 --> 04:02:37.020 align:start position:0%
and so on but we agree on the goals and
 
04:02:38.870 --> 04:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
that's a really big deal right you have
 
04:02:40.849 --> 04:02:40.859 align:start position:0%
a lot of legislation that is opposed
 
04:02:43.429 --> 04:02:43.439 align:start position:0%
because we don't agree with the goals in
 
04:02:45.530 --> 04:02:45.540 align:start position:0%
here we are in a better place
 
04:02:47.510 --> 04:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
one of the questions that was asked was
 
04:02:49.610 --> 04:02:49.620 align:start position:0%
exactly what does this bill do that is
 
04:02:51.769 --> 04:02:51.779 align:start position:0%
not already covered by our policies and
 
04:02:53.809 --> 04:02:53.819 align:start position:0%
our Federal Constitution and state
 
04:02:56.330 --> 04:02:56.340 align:start position:0%
constitution and so on a couple of
 
04:02:59.150 --> 04:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
answers but in a broad term in the
 
04:03:01.250 --> 04:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
absence of this proposed chapter you
 
04:03:03.590 --> 04:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
know 188j there is a lot of uncertainty
 
04:03:05.809 --> 04:03:05.819 align:start position:0%
over what the boundaries are around
 
04:03:07.910 --> 04:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
freedom of speech or Freedom Association
 
04:03:09.769 --> 04:03:09.779 align:start position:0%
and these bills attempts to describe
 
04:03:12.110 --> 04:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
them properly one clear area of
 
04:03:15.050 --> 04:03:15.060 align:start position:0%
uncertainty is whether Free Speech zones
 
04:03:17.809 --> 04:03:17.819 align:start position:0%
are acceptable as a policy
 
04:03:20.389 --> 04:03:20.399 align:start position:0%
I this bill will make it clear that they
 
04:03:22.370 --> 04:03:22.380 align:start position:0%
are not I do not believe that freedom of
 
04:03:24.410 --> 04:03:24.420 align:start position:0%
speech means anything if you can only
 
04:03:26.510 --> 04:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
exercise it in one corner of the campus
 
04:03:28.309 --> 04:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
but you cannot do so in the rest of the
 
04:03:28.319 --> 04:03:29.450 align:start position:0%
but you cannot do so in the rest of the
campus

04:03:29.450 --> 04:03:29.460 align:start position:0%
campus
 
04:03:31.790 --> 04:03:31.800 align:start position:0%
you know the other area of legal
 
04:03:33.590 --> 04:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
uncertainty addressed by this bill is
 
04:03:35.570 --> 04:03:35.580 align:start position:0%
what kind of restrictions can we put on
 
04:03:38.330 --> 04:03:38.340 align:start position:0%
student organizations in terms of
 
04:03:40.670 --> 04:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
what is that nature of their beliefs or
 
04:03:42.950 --> 04:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
can they require that members that join
 
04:03:45.170 --> 04:03:45.180 align:start position:0%
them agree to the organization beliefs
 
04:03:47.090 --> 04:03:47.100 align:start position:0%
complies with the organization code of
 
04:03:49.130 --> 04:03:49.140 align:start position:0%
conducts and whatnot the language
 
04:03:52.309 --> 04:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
proposed makes it clear that you know
 
04:03:54.830 --> 04:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
we have to allow them to control their
 
04:03:56.630 --> 04:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
membership we have to allow them to
 
04:03:59.090 --> 04:03:59.100 align:start position:0%
treat them evenly and offer the same you
 
04:04:00.530 --> 04:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
know support to all organizations
 
04:04:03.469 --> 04:04:03.479 align:start position:0%
regardless of you know their beliefs
 
04:04:07.130 --> 04:04:07.140 align:start position:0%
and I want to bring up something that I
 
04:04:08.510 --> 04:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
already brought up in one of those
 
04:04:11.090 --> 04:04:11.100 align:start position:0%
meetings there is a February 10
 
04:04:14.269 --> 04:04:14.279 align:start position:0%
Story by the NH by nhpr on uh you know
 
04:04:16.429 --> 04:04:16.439 align:start position:0%
somebody apparently creating secret
 
04:04:18.670 --> 04:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
recordings of a UNH law school meeting
 
04:04:20.990 --> 04:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
I'm bringing it up because obviously
 
04:04:23.269 --> 04:04:23.279 align:start position:0%
it's public record and you know whatever
 
04:04:26.290 --> 04:04:26.300 align:start position:0%
nhpr reported an HP are reported
 
04:04:28.849 --> 04:04:28.859 align:start position:0%
but it's an example of the pressure that
 
04:04:31.969 --> 04:04:31.979 align:start position:0%
colleges are under in the absence of a
 
04:04:34.729 --> 04:04:34.739 align:start position:0%
legislation you know like the proposed
 
04:04:34.739 --> 04:04:38.150 align:start position:0%
legislation you know like the proposed
statute

04:04:38.150 --> 04:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:41.389 --> 04:04:41.399 align:start position:0%
case an hbr states that the discussion
 
04:04:44.030 --> 04:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
on that meeting was around whether the
 
04:04:46.790 --> 04:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
UNH should adopt an old Commerce policy
 
04:04:49.309 --> 04:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
which I want to make very clear this
 
04:04:52.570 --> 04:04:52.580 align:start position:0%
particular bill would not allow
 
04:04:55.849 --> 04:04:55.859 align:start position:0%
think about it this way to use my town
 
04:04:58.969 --> 04:04:58.979 align:start position:0%
of Windham our Democratic and Republican
 
04:05:00.469 --> 04:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
Town committees restrict their
 
04:05:03.050 --> 04:05:03.060 align:start position:0%
membership to Residents registered to
 
04:05:04.610 --> 04:05:04.620 align:start position:0%
the respective parties
 
04:05:06.290 --> 04:05:06.300 align:start position:0%
would you suggest that their freedom of
 
04:05:08.330 --> 04:05:08.340 align:start position:0%
Association is expected if we would
 
04:05:10.670 --> 04:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
force them to adopt all an all-commerce
 
04:05:13.250 --> 04:05:13.260 align:start position:0%
policy and let anybody in would that be
 
04:05:15.290 --> 04:05:15.300 align:start position:0%
meaningful would that associations mean
 
04:05:17.630 --> 04:05:17.640 align:start position:0%
anything if they didn't have the choice
 
04:05:19.309 --> 04:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
to choose who they want to associate
 
04:05:22.309 --> 04:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
with same thing we have a very active
 
04:05:24.950 --> 04:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
climate change group in Windham should
 
04:05:27.530 --> 04:05:27.540 align:start position:0%
we allow them to accept anybody in their
 
04:05:29.090 --> 04:05:29.100 align:start position:0%
meetings regardless of whether those
 
04:05:31.670 --> 04:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
people take climate change seriously or
 
04:05:33.530 --> 04:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
they think it's a hoax
 
04:05:36.349 --> 04:05:36.359 align:start position:0%
you know should the American Legion we
 
04:05:39.290 --> 04:05:39.300 align:start position:0%
have them on 111 be allowed to you know
 
04:05:41.030 --> 04:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
that need people who are known draft
 
04:05:43.610 --> 04:05:43.620 align:start position:0%
evaders well I'm reaching back about 50
 
04:05:45.469 --> 04:05:45.479 align:start position:0%
years on that one but
 
04:05:48.110 --> 04:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
the point is that I believe that the
 
04:05:50.150 --> 04:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
freedom to associate is meaningless if
 
04:05:52.910 --> 04:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
we require every Association to admit
 
04:05:55.490 --> 04:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
anybody who applies regardless of what
 
04:05:57.229 --> 04:05:57.239 align:start position:0%
the beliefs of the organization are or
 
04:05:58.969 --> 04:05:58.979 align:start position:0%
whether they are you know really trying
 
04:06:01.670 --> 04:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
to be productive in that Association or
 
04:06:04.729 --> 04:06:04.739 align:start position:0%
not so
 
04:06:07.670 --> 04:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
consider how much time and effort and
 
04:06:10.070 --> 04:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
money has been spent on fighting these
 
04:06:11.990 --> 04:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
battles which
 
04:06:14.330 --> 04:06:14.340 align:start position:0%
presumably shouldn't be needed to be
 
04:06:16.550 --> 04:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
spent or fought if we have a clear
 
04:06:19.670 --> 04:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
statute where all the statute does is
 
04:06:22.370 --> 04:06:22.380 align:start position:0%
highlights you know the neutrality
 
04:06:25.250 --> 04:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
we don't want to be the Arbiters of this
 
04:06:28.130 --> 04:06:28.140 align:start position:0%
we want to treat everybody equally and
 
04:06:30.410 --> 04:06:30.420 align:start position:0%
look I want to protect the rights of the
 
04:06:32.750 --> 04:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
minorities of the groups that don't have
 
04:06:35.870 --> 04:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
you know the same protections as the you
 
04:06:38.450 --> 04:06:38.460 align:start position:0%
know mainstream groups Maybe
 
04:06:40.370 --> 04:06:40.380 align:start position:0%
those are the people who need the most
 
04:06:42.229 --> 04:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
protection you know regardless of
 
04:06:43.849 --> 04:06:43.859 align:start position:0%
whether they are on one side or the
 
04:06:46.250 --> 04:06:46.260 align:start position:0%
other of the political spectrum and one
 
04:06:47.510 --> 04:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
last point
 
04:06:49.849 --> 04:06:49.859 align:start position:0%
most students do not have the resources
 
04:06:52.969 --> 04:06:52.979 align:start position:0%
or the appetite for a legal challenge or
 
04:06:55.130 --> 04:06:55.140 align:start position:0%
you know to even make a formal complaint
 
04:06:58.429 --> 04:06:58.439 align:start position:0%
they are afraid of repercussions so we
 
04:07:01.130 --> 04:07:01.140 align:start position:0%
cannot really measure whether you know
 
04:07:03.769 --> 04:07:03.779 align:start position:0%
these uh
 
04:07:06.469 --> 04:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
issues are happening how how extensive
 
04:07:08.450 --> 04:07:08.460 align:start position:0%
those issues are just based on formal
 
04:07:10.849 --> 04:07:10.859 align:start position:0%
complaints or on lawsuits being filed
 
04:07:12.650 --> 04:07:12.660 align:start position:0%
there is a significant chilling effect
 
04:07:14.570 --> 04:07:14.580 align:start position:0%
going way beyond that
 
04:07:16.429 --> 04:07:16.439 align:start position:0%
and I want to make it very clear again
 
04:07:18.889 --> 04:07:18.899 align:start position:0%
that I trust the commitment of our
 
04:07:21.110 --> 04:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
public colleges and universities to
 
04:07:23.689 --> 04:07:23.699 align:start position:0%
these goals I know that they are trying
 
04:07:25.969 --> 04:07:25.979 align:start position:0%
to do their best I believe that this
 
04:07:28.849 --> 04:07:28.859 align:start position:0%
bill passing it will help ensure that
 
04:07:30.590 --> 04:07:30.600 align:start position:0%
they will be able to operate in the most
 
04:07:32.630 --> 04:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
effective way while respecting the
 
04:07:35.570 --> 04:07:35.580 align:start position:0%
freedoms of our students which you know
 
04:07:38.150 --> 04:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
it is their stated goal to so I'm asking
 
04:07:40.130 --> 04:07:40.140 align:start position:0%
for your support for this Bill thank you
 
04:07:41.870 --> 04:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
04:07:43.790 --> 04:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative McDonald
 
04:07:46.189 --> 04:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:07:48.229 --> 04:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward and I truly do
 
04:07:50.330 --> 04:07:50.340 align:start position:0%
mean that thank you there's a lot of
 
04:07:53.210 --> 04:07:53.220 align:start position:0%
parts in this bill that I understand and
 
04:07:56.150 --> 04:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
I see the value towards what I'm asking
 
04:07:57.889 --> 04:07:57.899 align:start position:0%
is a part that I am confused about
 
04:08:01.250 --> 04:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
personally it's on the last page and
 
04:08:04.130 --> 04:08:04.140 align:start position:0%
line 20 it's the bottom two sections the
 
04:08:05.689 --> 04:08:05.699 align:start position:0%
first is immunity and the next is
 
04:08:08.330 --> 04:08:08.340 align:start position:0%
severability yep and in regards to those
 
04:08:11.570 --> 04:08:11.580 align:start position:0%
sections do you know or are you aware of
 
04:08:13.490 --> 04:08:13.500 align:start position:0%
a precedent for other
 
04:08:16.670 --> 04:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
chapters within New Hampshire statutes
 
04:08:19.250 --> 04:08:19.260 align:start position:0%
that wave federal constitutional rights
 
04:08:22.490 --> 04:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:25.670 --> 04:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
are you aware of Prior precedence for
 
04:08:27.950 --> 04:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
this kind of language where it says to
 
04:08:30.530 --> 04:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
waive immunity under the 11th Amendment
 
04:08:33.170 --> 04:08:33.180 align:start position:0%
for example but any other
 
04:08:35.929 --> 04:08:35.939 align:start position:0%
chapters in our RSA that say this that I
 
04:08:37.370 --> 04:08:37.380 align:start position:0%
may not be aware of
 
04:08:39.710 --> 04:08:39.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of a particular essay that
 
04:08:41.450 --> 04:08:41.460 align:start position:0%
has it but I think the language is
 
04:08:44.689 --> 04:08:44.699 align:start position:0%
necessary because a lot of potential
 
04:08:47.330 --> 04:08:47.340 align:start position:0%
lawsuits would not be able to proceed
 
04:08:48.950 --> 04:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
because of the massive amount of
 
04:08:50.750 --> 04:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
immunity that the state has and by
 
04:08:52.670 --> 04:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
extension you know that extends to
 
04:08:56.750 --> 04:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
organizations run by the state so if we
 
04:08:58.790 --> 04:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
want to pass a statute that allows
 
04:09:00.650 --> 04:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
people to seek recourse it has to
 
04:09:03.670 --> 04:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
include their ability to you know
 
04:09:06.530 --> 04:09:06.540 align:start position:0%
have their day in court
 
04:09:08.870 --> 04:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
follow up please yes you may
 
04:09:12.830 --> 04:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
so do you see the sections that I just
 
04:09:16.370 --> 04:09:16.380 align:start position:0%
pointed out to as in any capacity being
 
04:09:20.389 --> 04:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
in violation of uh federal statute or
 
04:09:22.849 --> 04:09:22.859 align:start position:0%
federal constitutional rights or the
 
04:09:27.889 --> 04:09:27.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:30.769 --> 04:09:30.779 align:start position:0%
I believe that there is always the
 
04:09:32.870 --> 04:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
possibility that claims under this bill
 
04:09:35.450 --> 04:09:35.460 align:start position:0%
you know would not be you know be
 
04:09:38.090 --> 04:09:38.100 align:start position:0%
allowed to proceed if this language
 
04:09:41.210 --> 04:09:41.220 align:start position:0%
wasn't present so I I wouldn't have
 
04:09:45.050 --> 04:09:45.060 align:start position:0%
you know kept that language if you know
 
04:09:47.030 --> 04:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
I felt it was useless trust me just just
 
04:09:49.729 --> 04:09:49.739 align:start position:0%
for the record if you compare this with
 
04:09:51.349 --> 04:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
previous bills you'll notice how much
 
04:09:55.429 --> 04:09:55.439 align:start position:0%
Slimmer it is we really try to
 
04:09:57.950 --> 04:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
boil distill it to the essence of what's
 
04:10:00.950 --> 04:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
needed so okay again thank you thank you
 
04:10:03.110 --> 04:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee yes
 
04:10:05.990 --> 04:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative Luna thank you very much
 
04:10:08.090 --> 04:10:08.100 align:start position:0%
um could you tell us a little bit about
 
04:10:12.710 --> 04:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
how um 516 addresses the duty of care
 
04:10:16.130 --> 04:10:16.140 align:start position:0%
um with respect to um uh all individuals
 
04:10:20.450 --> 04:10:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:22.729 --> 04:10:22.739 align:start position:0%
um I would appreciate if it clarify the
 
04:10:25.250 --> 04:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
question because obviously the part of
 
04:10:27.910 --> 04:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
the duty of care that I would you know
 
04:10:30.950 --> 04:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
consider when talking about 5 16 is you
 
04:10:33.110 --> 04:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
know the duty of protecting the rights
 
04:10:35.630 --> 04:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
but I'm sure that there is something
 
04:10:37.309 --> 04:10:37.319 align:start position:0%
else that I'm missing in that question
 
04:10:40.490 --> 04:10:40.500 align:start position:0%
sure no happy to uh if I may Mr chair go
 
04:10:42.469 --> 04:10:42.479 align:start position:0%
ahead so I'm really talking about things
 
04:10:46.729 --> 04:10:46.739 align:start position:0%
like campus discourse and um and you
 
04:10:50.210 --> 04:10:50.220 align:start position:0%
know respect for um uh for for all
 
04:10:53.929 --> 04:10:53.939 align:start position:0%
persons on campus and uh obviously you
 
04:10:56.570 --> 04:10:56.580 align:start position:0%
know violence doesn't doesn't belong you
 
04:10:59.870 --> 04:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
know on campus in any situation so so uh
 
04:11:02.809 --> 04:11:02.819 align:start position:0%
you know I think um uh campus employee
 
04:11:04.610 --> 04:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
from my understanding is that we do have
 
04:11:05.750 --> 04:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
representatives from the University
 
04:11:09.469 --> 04:11:09.479 align:start position:0%
system here uh do have responsibility to
 
04:11:14.090 --> 04:11:14.100 align:start position:0%
uh to uh through a duty of care to um um
 
04:11:17.809 --> 04:11:17.819 align:start position:0%
to to you know make sure that um that
 
04:11:20.030 --> 04:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
people are respected that discourse
 
04:11:22.610 --> 04:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
that's that campus operations are not
 
04:11:25.070 --> 04:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
disrupted and certainly that violence
 
04:11:26.389 --> 04:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't break out
 
04:11:29.389 --> 04:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
so I really appreciate your
 
04:11:33.950 --> 04:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
clarification and I can very honestly
 
04:11:38.389 --> 04:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
answer that this protects the every
 
04:11:40.610 --> 04:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
legal possible right at the universities
 
04:11:43.550 --> 04:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
have to deliver that duty of care while
 
04:11:46.610 --> 04:11:46.620 align:start position:0%
at the same time making it clear where
 
04:11:49.250 --> 04:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
the enforcement does need to stop you
 
04:11:52.729 --> 04:11:52.739 align:start position:0%
know to be specific if you look at
 
04:11:52.739 --> 04:11:54.469 align:start position:0%
know to be specific if you look at
section

04:11:54.469 --> 04:11:54.479 align:start position:0%
section
 
04:11:54.479 --> 04:11:55.570 align:start position:0%
section
um

04:11:55.570 --> 04:11:55.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:01.490 --> 04:12:01.500 align:start position:0%
188 J2 station Roman numeral three
 
04:12:03.469 --> 04:12:03.479 align:start position:0%
and even in Roman numeral two if you
 
04:12:05.510 --> 04:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
look at the second part of Roman numeral
 
04:12:05.520 --> 04:12:07.130 align:start position:0%
look at the second part of Roman numeral
two

04:12:07.130 --> 04:12:07.140 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:12:08.510 --> 04:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
the public institution of higher
 
04:12:10.010 --> 04:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
education May maintain and enforce
 
04:12:11.630 --> 04:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
reasonable time place and manner
 
04:12:13.309 --> 04:12:13.319 align:start position:0%
restrictions applicable to traditional
 
04:12:15.530 --> 04:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
public forums provided those
 
04:12:17.389 --> 04:12:17.399 align:start position:0%
restrictions are narrowly tailored in
 
04:12:18.950 --> 04:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
serviceable significant institutional
 
04:12:20.450 --> 04:12:20.460 align:start position:0%
interest only
 
04:12:24.170 --> 04:12:24.180 align:start position:0%
right so all that this is saying is
 
04:12:26.630 --> 04:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
whatever rules you apply they should be
 
04:12:29.030 --> 04:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
applied to everybody and they have to be
 
04:12:30.590 --> 04:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
tailored so they are not overall
 
04:12:33.650 --> 04:12:33.660 align:start position:0%
suppressive of speech it also you refer
 
04:12:36.710 --> 04:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
to criminal activity there is
 
04:12:40.610 --> 04:12:40.620 align:start position:0%
language further down right in section
 
04:12:43.370 --> 04:12:43.380 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral three as long as the
 
04:12:46.429 --> 04:12:46.439 align:start position:0%
person's conduct is not unlawful and
 
04:12:48.410 --> 04:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
obviously you know you cannot be
 
04:12:50.870 --> 04:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
disturbing the peace you cannot do any
 
04:12:53.090 --> 04:12:53.100 align:start position:0%
kind of criminal activity absolutely
 
04:12:55.790 --> 04:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
look I would never want to disrupt any
 
04:12:57.410 --> 04:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
operations you know pass a law that
 
04:12:59.510 --> 04:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
disrupts the operations of a campus or
 
04:13:01.010 --> 04:13:01.020 align:start position:0%
prevents them from attending to the
 
04:13:01.020 --> 04:13:02.689 align:start position:0%
prevents them from attending to the
safety

04:13:02.689 --> 04:13:02.699 align:start position:0%
safety
 
04:13:05.809 --> 04:13:05.819 align:start position:0%
or just the main educational you know
 
04:13:07.370 --> 04:13:07.380 align:start position:0%
mission that they have as as
 
04:13:10.010 --> 04:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
universities this one specifically and
 
04:13:11.870 --> 04:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
explicitly protects their ability to do
 
04:13:13.309 --> 04:13:13.319 align:start position:0%
so we actually have positive language
 
04:13:15.189 --> 04:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
not just the absence of language
 
04:13:17.809 --> 04:13:17.819 align:start position:0%
restraining them we specifically say
 
04:13:19.550 --> 04:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
that they are absolutely allowed to do
 
04:13:22.729 --> 04:13:22.739 align:start position:0%
it to avoid any confusion and
 
04:13:25.070 --> 04:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
there is a second part of your question
 
04:13:27.050 --> 04:13:27.060 align:start position:0%
that I don't want to skirt around which
 
04:13:28.490 --> 04:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:13:30.590 --> 04:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
at some point
 
04:13:33.590 --> 04:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
when we talk about respecting others and
 
04:13:35.990 --> 04:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know language that may be offensive
 
04:13:37.429 --> 04:13:37.439 align:start position:0%
and I think that was part of what you
 
04:13:39.410 --> 04:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
are asking about
 
04:13:40.790 --> 04:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
that's where we get into clear
 
04:13:43.910 --> 04:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional issues where universities
 
04:13:46.910 --> 04:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
have consistently lost cases in which
 
04:13:48.889 --> 04:13:48.899 align:start position:0%
they tried to go too far down those
 
04:13:51.050 --> 04:13:51.060 align:start position:0%
paths so there are clear boundaries that
 
04:13:53.510 --> 04:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court you know has been
 
04:13:56.450 --> 04:13:56.460 align:start position:0%
ruling on and I believe those are the
 
04:13:58.670 --> 04:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
times when a university needs to focus
 
04:14:01.490 --> 04:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
more on their educational nature and
 
04:14:01.500 --> 04:14:03.050 align:start position:0%
more on their educational nature and
educate

04:14:03.050 --> 04:14:03.060 align:start position:0%
educate
 
04:14:05.929 --> 04:14:05.939 align:start position:0%
their students in what is acceptable and
 
04:14:08.269 --> 04:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
what not while understanding that not
 
04:14:11.630 --> 04:14:11.640 align:start position:0%
every disrespectful statement may be you
 
04:14:14.330 --> 04:14:14.340 align:start position:0%
know avoided please also note that this
 
04:14:14.340 --> 04:14:15.469 align:start position:0%
know avoided please also note that this
particular

04:14:15.469 --> 04:14:15.479 align:start position:0%
particular
 
04:14:17.929 --> 04:14:17.939 align:start position:0%
legislation pertains to the outdoor
 
04:14:20.269 --> 04:14:20.279 align:start position:0%
areas of the campuses we are not talking
 
04:14:21.710 --> 04:14:21.720 align:start position:0%
about anything that happens in the
 
04:14:23.150 --> 04:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
buildings we're just talking about the
 
04:14:25.309 --> 04:14:25.319 align:start position:0%
public forums outside where people
 
04:14:27.290 --> 04:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
traditionally you know hold signs and
 
04:14:29.750 --> 04:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
they hold you know demonstrate publicly
 
04:14:33.590 --> 04:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
we are not you know in any way going you
 
04:14:35.809 --> 04:14:35.819 align:start position:0%
know covering anything that happens
 
04:14:37.729 --> 04:14:37.739 align:start position:0%
inside the building in that freedom of
 
04:14:40.550 --> 04:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
speech work sorry the statute is about
 
04:14:42.650 --> 04:14:42.660 align:start position:0%
the outdoor areas on that now the
 
04:14:44.450 --> 04:14:44.460 align:start position:0%
freedom of Association
 
04:14:46.070 --> 04:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
that's a different topic and I don't
 
04:14:47.689 --> 04:14:47.699 align:start position:0%
know if your question when was meant to
 
04:14:49.490 --> 04:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
go there thank you
 
04:14:51.590 --> 04:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee yes
 
04:14:53.689 --> 04:14:53.699 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
04:14:55.490 --> 04:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:14:57.170 --> 04:14:57.180 align:start position:0%
taking my question firstly just to
 
04:14:59.630 --> 04:14:59.640 align:start position:0%
quickly clarify up on the immunity
 
04:15:01.910 --> 04:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
provision in here yes the 11th Amendment
 
04:15:04.189 --> 04:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
to the Constitution only would prohibit
 
04:15:06.889 --> 04:15:06.899 align:start position:0%
suits by non-citizens of the State of
 
04:15:08.030 --> 04:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so would you agree that
 
04:15:10.610 --> 04:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
it's really kind of a minor issue
 
04:15:13.610 --> 04:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
I would agree it's a minor issue but the
 
04:15:15.290 --> 04:15:15.300 align:start position:0%
language is still there because you know
 
04:15:17.510 --> 04:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
some students don't necessarily you know
 
04:15:19.849 --> 04:15:19.859 align:start position:0%
consider themselves to be a resident of
 
04:15:21.349 --> 04:15:21.359 align:start position:0%
the state and yet their rights should be
 
04:15:23.870 --> 04:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
protected so it's it's
 
04:15:26.030 --> 04:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
not a huge issue but it is an issue
 
04:15:27.650 --> 04:15:27.660 align:start position:0%
that's large enough that coordines the
 
04:15:29.330 --> 04:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
inclusion of the language thank you and
 
04:15:30.469 --> 04:15:30.479 align:start position:0%
I have one other question if that's all
 
04:15:30.479 --> 04:15:32.090 align:start position:0%
I have one other question if that's all
right

04:15:32.090 --> 04:15:32.100 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:15:33.670 --> 04:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
um when it comes to
 
04:15:36.110 --> 04:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
prohibitive behaviors and things that
 
04:15:40.070 --> 04:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
would be regulated by this bill I see
 
04:15:42.530 --> 04:15:42.540 align:start position:0%
that violence and fighting I also see
 
04:15:44.210 --> 04:15:44.220 align:start position:0%
that physically blocking is prohibited
 
04:15:48.469 --> 04:15:48.479 align:start position:0%
but if the university were to allow for
 
04:15:50.090 --> 04:15:50.100 align:start position:0%
instance a large number of students into
 
04:15:52.130 --> 04:15:52.140 align:start position:0%
an auditorium that has been reserved for
 
04:15:54.469 --> 04:15:54.479 align:start position:0%
a speaker and then they were further to
 
04:15:58.070 --> 04:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
allow those students to shout down a
 
04:15:58.080 --> 04:15:59.630 align:start position:0%
allow those students to shout down a
speaker

04:15:59.630 --> 04:15:59.640 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
04:16:01.429 --> 04:16:01.439 align:start position:0%
um is there any provisions in this bill
 
04:16:03.050 --> 04:16:03.060 align:start position:0%
that would hold them accountable under
 
04:16:06.229 --> 04:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:08.689 --> 04:16:08.699 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to think because the intent
 
04:16:10.610 --> 04:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
of the bill is to focus on the outdoor
 
04:16:13.309 --> 04:16:13.319 align:start position:0%
areas I will say though that
 
04:16:16.250 --> 04:16:16.260 align:start position:0%
you know what is in uh common terms
 
04:16:19.250 --> 04:16:19.260 align:start position:0%
referred as a heckler's veto has been
 
04:16:22.670 --> 04:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
consistently ruled to not be acceptable
 
04:16:25.610 --> 04:16:25.620 align:start position:0%
and to be a violation of free speech and
 
04:16:27.950 --> 04:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
I will also note that there is a large
 
04:16:30.290 --> 04:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
number of times when
 
04:16:32.929 --> 04:16:32.939 align:start position:0%
even law students and I'm not talking
 
04:16:34.610 --> 04:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
about New Hampshire I'm thinking about a
 
04:16:36.170 --> 04:16:36.180 align:start position:0%
case from another state but for the life
 
04:16:37.969 --> 04:16:37.979 align:start position:0%
of me I cannot remember the exact name
 
04:16:40.849 --> 04:16:40.859 align:start position:0%
of the University I can find the article
 
04:16:42.469 --> 04:16:42.479 align:start position:0%
and send it to the committee later if
 
04:16:44.870 --> 04:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
needed there was at least one case where
 
04:16:48.229 --> 04:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
the very prestigious out-of-state Law
 
04:16:48.239 --> 04:16:49.370 align:start position:0%
the very prestigious out-of-state Law
School

04:16:49.370 --> 04:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
School
 
04:16:51.889 --> 04:16:51.899 align:start position:0%
had a huge number of students who seem
 
04:16:53.870 --> 04:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
to believe that Hitler's Vita was
 
04:16:55.729 --> 04:16:55.739 align:start position:0%
protected somehow and they were not
 
04:16:58.370 --> 04:16:58.380 align:start position:0%
infringing on Free Speech but again the
 
04:17:00.590 --> 04:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
intent of this is to
 
04:17:04.130 --> 04:17:04.140 align:start position:0%
cover it as you know much as possible
 
04:17:04.140 --> 04:17:07.510 align:start position:0%
cover it as you know much as possible
but

04:17:07.510 --> 04:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:10.570 --> 04:17:10.580 align:start position:0%
most of the
 
04:17:15.830 --> 04:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
focuses again on outdoor areas thank you
 
04:17:17.870 --> 04:17:17.880 align:start position:0%

woodcock
 
04:17:22.370 --> 04:17:22.380 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman good afternoon thank
 
04:17:23.750 --> 04:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
you for uh
 
04:17:26.570 --> 04:17:26.580 align:start position:0%
getting some clarity for me I'm looking
 
04:17:29.990 --> 04:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
on the you know it was line 28 or the
 
04:17:32.929 --> 04:17:32.939 align:start position:0%
th2 it talks about any person who wishes
 
04:17:36.290 --> 04:17:36.300 align:start position:0%
so do you know I was trying to compare
 
04:17:38.150 --> 04:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
initially to the campus community that
 
04:17:40.250 --> 04:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
identified people on the campus
 
04:17:41.990 --> 04:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
administrators faculty staff those that
 
04:17:44.269 --> 04:17:44.279 align:start position:0%
are associated and they had invited
 
04:17:48.229 --> 04:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
guests but under 28 does this mean that
 
04:17:51.410 --> 04:17:51.420 align:start position:0%
any person walking off the street who's
 
04:17:53.510 --> 04:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
not affiliated with that institution of
 
04:17:57.769 --> 04:17:57.779 align:start position:0%
High Learning again hold a protest of
 
04:18:01.250 --> 04:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
some type on that campus
 
04:18:04.790 --> 04:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure yes thank you thank you
 
04:18:06.710 --> 04:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
chairman another question represent
 
04:18:06.720 --> 04:18:08.269 align:start position:0%
chairman another question represent
cordelli

04:18:08.269 --> 04:18:08.279 align:start position:0%
cordelli
 
04:18:09.710 --> 04:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for bringing this
 
04:18:12.769 --> 04:18:12.779 align:start position:0%
forward uh just to follow up on that I
 
04:18:14.990 --> 04:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
was also looking at sections two and
 
04:18:17.650 --> 04:18:17.660 align:start position:0%
three on page two Romans two and three
 
04:18:23.710 --> 04:18:23.720 align:start position:0%
in that um three seems to apply to a
 
04:18:28.070 --> 04:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
non-campus community person
 
04:18:30.889 --> 04:18:30.899 align:start position:0%
um but section two is for Camp the
 
04:18:34.070 --> 04:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
campus community and the
 
04:18:36.769 --> 04:18:36.779 align:start position:0%
um public institution is allowed to
 
04:18:39.110 --> 04:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
enforce reasonable time place and manner
 
04:18:39.120 --> 04:18:40.969 align:start position:0%
enforce reasonable time place and manner
restrictions

04:18:40.969 --> 04:18:40.979 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
04:18:44.630 --> 04:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
um but would the institution be allowed
 
04:18:47.870 --> 04:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
to uh enforce reasonable time place and
 
04:18:50.630 --> 04:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
manner restrictions also on a
 
04:18:53.269 --> 04:18:53.279 align:start position:0%
non-community member
 
04:18:55.610 --> 04:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
um on enrollment three
 
04:18:59.330 --> 04:18:59.340 align:start position:0%
I I would absolutely believe that all
 
04:19:01.670 --> 04:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
those restrictions apply equally to
 
04:19:03.889 --> 04:19:03.899 align:start position:0%
students or non-students I mean at the
 
04:19:06.110 --> 04:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
end of the day when you look at the
 
04:19:07.849 --> 04:19:07.859 align:start position:0%
language in Roman numeral two one eight
 
04:19:10.010 --> 04:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
one eighty eight you know line 17
 
04:19:13.309 --> 04:19:13.319 align:start position:0%
through 27 on page two
 
04:19:15.410 --> 04:19:15.420 align:start position:0%
it clearly says it may maintain those
 
04:19:16.910 --> 04:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
restrictions there is nothing in there
 
04:19:19.429 --> 04:19:19.439 align:start position:0%
that says it's only applicable to
 
04:19:21.410 --> 04:19:21.420 align:start position:0%
students who are applicable to anybody
 
04:19:24.110 --> 04:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
else those those restrictions apply to
 
04:19:26.689 --> 04:19:26.699 align:start position:0%
everybody the language in three is
 
04:19:29.510 --> 04:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
merely clarifying that those rights are
 
04:19:32.090 --> 04:19:32.100 align:start position:0%
not reserved to just registered students
 
04:19:34.550 --> 04:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
they apply to you know other community
 
04:19:39.590 --> 04:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
members but the restrictions would apply
 
04:19:42.229 --> 04:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
you know to everybody
 
04:19:44.030 --> 04:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
and that's part of what we were talking
 
04:19:46.250 --> 04:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
about in some of our discussions with
 
04:19:48.710 --> 04:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
the colleges that you know they require
 
04:19:50.809 --> 04:19:50.819 align:start position:0%
permits in certain situations and
 
04:19:54.710 --> 04:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
whatnot and again in my read this would
 
04:19:57.229 --> 04:19:57.239 align:start position:0%
be as long as the those restrictions
 
04:19:59.330 --> 04:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
meet the criteria they should be allowed
 
04:20:01.189 --> 04:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
to continue enforcing them because they
 
04:20:03.410 --> 04:20:03.420 align:start position:0%
are reasonable and you know
 
04:20:05.090 --> 04:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
in alignment with the mission of the
 
04:20:05.100 --> 04:20:07.010 align:start position:0%
in alignment with the mission of the
institution

04:20:07.010 --> 04:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
institution
 
04:20:08.809 --> 04:20:08.819 align:start position:0%
yes Paula
 
04:20:10.250 --> 04:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:20:13.130 --> 04:20:13.140 align:start position:0%
um looking over on page one
 
04:20:16.130 --> 04:20:16.140 align:start position:0%
um and the previous question about uh
 
04:20:18.889 --> 04:20:18.899 align:start position:0%
someone uh perhaps giving a talk in an
 
04:20:23.710 --> 04:20:23.720 align:start position:0%
auditorium or other campus Building in
 
04:20:26.750 --> 04:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
be under material materially and
 
04:20:29.150 --> 04:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
substantially disrupts
 
04:20:32.570 --> 04:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
um it says such protected conduct
 
04:20:36.349 --> 04:20:36.359 align:start position:0%
includes but is not limited to protests
 
04:20:39.590 --> 04:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
in outdoor areas so would this possibly
 
04:20:43.790 --> 04:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
cover uh some disruptive behavior inside
 
04:20:47.389 --> 04:20:47.399 align:start position:0%
a a campus Building for a speech of some
 
04:20:49.250 --> 04:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
sort I'm very grateful for the question
 
04:20:49.260 --> 04:20:50.630 align:start position:0%
sort I'm very grateful for the question
because

04:20:50.630 --> 04:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:20:52.429 --> 04:20:52.439 align:start position:0%
and I don't think you'll hear people say
 
04:20:55.849 --> 04:20:55.859 align:start position:0%
quite that quite often I realized as
 
04:20:57.349 --> 04:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
soon as I finished answering the
 
04:21:00.130 --> 04:21:00.140 align:start position:0%
representative belcher's question that I
 
04:21:02.630 --> 04:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
completely completely
 
04:21:05.830 --> 04:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
Miss under well I completely
 
04:21:07.969 --> 04:21:07.979 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted my own legislation how
 
04:21:10.490 --> 04:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
about that I apologize for that
 
04:21:10.500 --> 04:21:11.929 align:start position:0%
about that I apologize for that
while

04:21:11.929 --> 04:21:11.939 align:start position:0%
while
 
04:21:14.570 --> 04:21:14.580 align:start position:0%
the outdoor restrictions are necessary
 
04:21:15.950 --> 04:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we don't have
 
04:21:18.050 --> 04:21:18.060 align:start position:0%
three-speed zones or whatnot
 
04:21:20.269 --> 04:21:20.279 align:start position:0%
the correct answer to your question and
 
04:21:21.830 --> 04:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
to the correct answer to representative
 
04:21:24.290 --> 04:21:24.300 align:start position:0%
Corvallis question is that yes anybody
 
04:21:26.630 --> 04:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
trying to disrupt you know the
 
04:21:28.670 --> 04:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
pre-speech of people under those
 
04:21:30.710 --> 04:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
circumstances you know in a campus a
 
04:21:33.189 --> 04:21:33.199 align:start position:0%
space reserve for that for such activity
 
04:21:35.929 --> 04:21:35.939 align:start position:0%
would be a violation of the Free Speech
 
04:21:38.630 --> 04:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
rights of whoever is that he's trying to
 
04:21:42.349 --> 04:21:42.359 align:start position:0%
speak and again heckler's vetoes
 
04:21:45.170 --> 04:21:45.180 align:start position:0%
I come from a country where freedom of
 
04:21:48.830 --> 04:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
speech is not taken seriously and
 
04:21:52.189 --> 04:21:52.199 align:start position:0%
we are in such a much better place but
 
04:21:55.849 --> 04:21:55.859 align:start position:0%
it's still not okay to attempt to
 
04:21:58.370 --> 04:21:58.380 align:start position:0%
silence others whether it's by not
 
04:22:00.950 --> 04:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
allowing them to speak or by covering
 
04:22:02.750 --> 04:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
their speech with noises that are so
 
04:22:04.309 --> 04:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
loud that in effect you are doing the
 
04:22:06.349 --> 04:22:06.359 align:start position:0%
same thing so yes I do appreciate the
 
04:22:08.510 --> 04:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to clarify and to correct my
 
04:22:10.969 --> 04:22:10.979 align:start position:0%
previous misstatement and I'm grateful
 
04:22:12.610 --> 04:22:12.620 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity thank you
 
04:22:16.130 --> 04:22:16.140 align:start position:0%
representative a question for you I'm
 
04:22:18.229 --> 04:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
looking at page two
 
04:22:23.269 --> 04:22:23.279 align:start position:0%
line 26 and 27 where it reads nothing in
 
04:22:25.189 --> 04:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
this section shall be interpreted as
 
04:22:28.010 --> 04:22:28.020 align:start position:0%
limiting the right of student expression
 
04:22:30.889 --> 04:22:30.899 align:start position:0%
Elsewhere on campus so now I'm looking
 
04:22:34.010 --> 04:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
in the classroom itself
 
04:22:37.250 --> 04:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
does this apply to a for example a
 
04:22:39.710 --> 04:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
professor professor who is limiting
 
04:22:42.429 --> 04:22:42.439 align:start position:0%
discussion or open engagement
 
04:22:46.370 --> 04:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
open-minded discussion in the classroom
 
04:22:49.429 --> 04:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
the intent of that section is to talk
 
04:22:52.189 --> 04:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
about what is allowed in terms of
 
04:22:55.010 --> 04:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
restrictions on the outdoor areas and
 
04:22:57.710 --> 04:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
the last you know line the last well
 
04:22:59.510 --> 04:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
nothing in this sections will be
 
04:23:01.490 --> 04:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
interpreted that is just trying to
 
04:23:03.769 --> 04:23:03.779 align:start position:0%
clarify that the rules that we Define in
 
04:23:06.769 --> 04:23:06.779 align:start position:0%
paragraph in 188j2 are strictly
 
04:23:08.809 --> 04:23:08.819 align:start position:0%
applicable to the outside and we are not
 
04:23:10.849 --> 04:23:10.859 align:start position:0%
talking about those rules being
 
04:23:13.490 --> 04:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
applicable in the indoor parts of the
 
04:23:15.950 --> 04:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
campus I would say that that you know
 
04:23:18.769 --> 04:23:18.779 align:start position:0%
does not really
 
04:23:21.349 --> 04:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
add anything or remove anything from the
 
04:23:23.570 --> 04:23:23.580 align:start position:0%
ability of the university to you know it
 
04:23:25.370 --> 04:23:25.380 align:start position:0%
doesn't add anything to the ability it
 
04:23:27.590 --> 04:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
does not that language does not allow
 
04:23:29.229 --> 04:23:29.239 align:start position:0%
the university to
 
04:23:32.030 --> 04:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
regulate the indoor in a similar manner
 
04:23:34.790 --> 04:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
but in the past that has not really been
 
04:23:36.950 --> 04:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
a concern it's generally the outdoors
 
04:23:39.290 --> 04:23:39.300 align:start position:0%
that you know we've seen
 
04:23:41.570 --> 04:23:41.580 align:start position:0%
the potential situations of free speech
 
04:23:43.790 --> 04:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
zones that are concerning I'm not sure
 
04:23:45.650 --> 04:23:45.660 align:start position:0%
if I correctly understood your question
 
04:23:47.689 --> 04:23:47.699 align:start position:0%
could you clarify
 
04:23:49.969 --> 04:23:49.979 align:start position:0%
why I can try to clarify there is a
 
04:23:51.050 --> 04:23:51.060 align:start position:0%
recent article in the Wall Street
 
04:23:52.429 --> 04:23:52.439 align:start position:0%
Journal which dealt with the University
 
04:23:54.610 --> 04:23:54.620 align:start position:0%
of North Carolina North Carolina
 
04:23:58.250 --> 04:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
where there's issues in history class
 
04:24:00.650 --> 04:24:00.660 align:start position:0%
and other classes where now the trustees
 
04:24:02.809 --> 04:24:02.819 align:start position:0%
have identified they're going to make a
 
04:24:05.389 --> 04:24:05.399 align:start position:0%
new Department in which free speech is
 
04:24:05.399 --> 04:24:06.910 align:start position:0%
new Department in which free speech is
allowed

04:24:06.910 --> 04:24:06.920 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
04:24:09.590 --> 04:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
that is a concern to me that we have to
 
04:24:12.590 --> 04:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
go that far in higher ed to ensure that
 
04:24:16.010 --> 04:24:16.020 align:start position:0%
free speech is going to be a a primary
 
04:24:18.110 --> 04:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
goal of all of us in the classroom and I
 
04:24:19.969 --> 04:24:19.979 align:start position:0%
was just hoping that
 
04:24:22.250 --> 04:24:22.260 align:start position:0%
um that what you're putting in this bill
 
04:24:25.250 --> 04:24:25.260 align:start position:0%
here when you say Elsewhere on on campus
 
04:24:27.290 --> 04:24:27.300 align:start position:0%
of course buildings are Elsewhere on
 
04:24:27.300 --> 04:24:28.910 align:start position:0%
of course buildings are Elsewhere on
campus

04:24:28.910 --> 04:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
campus
 
04:24:31.370 --> 04:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
um is this applicable to a professor
 
04:24:34.610 --> 04:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
shutting down discussion in a classroom
 
04:24:36.710 --> 04:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
perhaps that discussion doesn't parallel
 
04:24:40.490 --> 04:24:40.500 align:start position:0%
out that professor's perspective
 
04:24:42.830 --> 04:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
it is not the intent of this paragraph
 
04:24:46.429 --> 04:24:46.439 align:start position:0%
to be applicable in that area I'm also
 
04:24:46.439 --> 04:24:48.349 align:start position:0%
to be applicable in that area I'm also
very

04:24:48.349 --> 04:24:48.359 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:24:50.870 --> 04:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
comfortable right now with the way the
 
04:24:52.849 --> 04:24:52.859 align:start position:0%
universities are handling those issues
 
04:24:54.889 --> 04:24:54.899 align:start position:0%
in the classroom if there are issues in
 
04:24:56.570 --> 04:24:56.580 align:start position:0%
the classroom that need to be addressed
 
04:24:59.990 --> 04:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not aware of them right now
 
04:25:02.929 --> 04:25:02.939 align:start position:0%
but no this is the
 
04:25:07.010 --> 04:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
language in 188j2 paragraph 2 is about
 
04:25:09.410 --> 04:25:09.420 align:start position:0%
what are the reasonable restrictions on
 
04:25:11.750 --> 04:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
the outdoor areas and it speaks just to
 
04:25:13.729 --> 04:25:13.739 align:start position:0%
that it does not speak to you know
 
04:25:16.969 --> 04:25:16.979 align:start position:0%
anything that happens indoors thank you
 
04:25:20.330 --> 04:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
represent Miler thank you Mr chair and
 
04:25:21.650 --> 04:25:21.660 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here
 
04:25:23.630 --> 04:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
this is not a new issue before this
 
04:25:23.640 --> 04:25:25.670 align:start position:0%
this is not a new issue before this
committee

04:25:25.670 --> 04:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:25:29.450 --> 04:25:29.460 align:start position:0%
as I recall four years ago a similar
 
04:25:32.090 --> 04:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
issue came before the committee and I
 
04:25:34.570 --> 04:25:34.580 align:start position:0%
believe the group by the name of fire
 
04:25:38.510 --> 04:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
was here and they basically uh indicated
 
04:25:41.689 --> 04:25:41.699 align:start position:0%
that there was a problem uh in our
 
04:25:43.790 --> 04:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
higher ed our state higher ed schools
 
04:25:44.990 --> 04:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
about this
 
04:25:48.469 --> 04:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
uh and the institution listened to what
 
04:25:49.790 --> 04:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
that was said
 
04:25:52.070 --> 04:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh the same issue came before us two
 
04:25:53.269 --> 04:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
04:25:56.269 --> 04:25:56.279 align:start position:0%
and fire was here to basically said the
 
04:25:59.090 --> 04:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
institutions have complied with their
 
04:25:59.100 --> 04:26:00.410 align:start position:0%
institutions have complied with their
concerns

04:26:00.410 --> 04:26:00.420 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
04:26:02.510 --> 04:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
so my question to you uh representative
 
04:26:05.570 --> 04:26:05.580 align:start position:0%
Popovich is what is your intent if you
 
04:26:08.210 --> 04:26:08.220 align:start position:0%
could summarize for this committee your
 
04:26:12.710 --> 04:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill please of course
 
04:26:15.530 --> 04:26:15.540 align:start position:0%
allow me if I may to quickly acknowledge
 
04:26:17.450 --> 04:26:17.460 align:start position:0%
the points that you made you are
 
04:26:19.689 --> 04:26:19.699 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct the
 
04:26:22.370 --> 04:26:22.380 align:start position:0%
overall respect for free speech and
 
04:26:24.590 --> 04:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
freedom of Association has
 
04:26:27.229 --> 04:26:27.239 align:start position:0%
been going in the right direction and I
 
04:26:29.090 --> 04:26:29.100 align:start position:0%
do trust the commitment of our public
 
04:26:31.910 --> 04:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities to you know
 
04:26:35.389 --> 04:26:35.399 align:start position:0%
continue to do that this being said the
 
04:26:40.729 --> 04:26:40.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:42.469 --> 04:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
if there is ever a time when
 
04:26:45.469 --> 04:26:45.479 align:start position:0%
institutions uh you know feel that it
 
04:26:47.030 --> 04:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate to reverse that
 
04:26:48.649 --> 04:26:48.659 align:start position:0%
Trend they are given very clear
 
04:26:50.870 --> 04:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
guidelines on what is and what is not
 
04:26:54.170 --> 04:26:54.180 align:start position:0%
acceptable and it is also intended to
 
04:26:57.950 --> 04:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
clarify for everybody on campus
 
04:27:00.349 --> 04:27:00.359 align:start position:0%
what the ground rules are in terms of
 
04:27:01.969 --> 04:27:01.979 align:start position:0%
spray speech
 
04:27:04.510 --> 04:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
04:27:07.250 --> 04:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
reasons why this is still a heated
 
04:27:11.330 --> 04:27:11.340 align:start position:0%
debate is that people can interpret the
 
04:27:13.969 --> 04:27:13.979 align:start position:0%
constitution in different ways certain
 
04:27:15.410 --> 04:27:15.420 align:start position:0%
things that may have been ruled
 
04:27:17.330 --> 04:27:17.340 align:start position:0%
constitutional by the courts are things
 
04:27:19.849 --> 04:27:19.859 align:start position:0%
that we don't think are a good idea and
 
04:27:22.849 --> 04:27:22.859 align:start position:0%
again I will offer the Free Speech Zone
 
04:27:25.910 --> 04:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
as a practice that has been documented
 
04:27:28.550 --> 04:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
in many places outside of you know New
 
04:27:31.010 --> 04:27:31.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that courts have ruled is
 
04:27:34.790 --> 04:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
constitutional so this is intended to
 
04:27:38.090 --> 04:27:38.100 align:start position:0%
clearly explain what the boundaries are
 
04:27:40.070 --> 04:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
on free speech and freedom of
 
04:27:42.830 --> 04:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
Association notwithstanding you know and
 
04:27:44.809 --> 04:27:44.819 align:start position:0%
this has nothing to do
 
04:27:47.870 --> 04:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
with you know doubting the commitment of
 
04:27:49.550 --> 04:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
the universities to do the best they can
 
04:27:52.070 --> 04:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
it's a recognition that we are all best
 
04:27:54.170 --> 04:27:54.180 align:start position:0%
off when this is clearly defined in
 
04:27:57.889 --> 04:27:57.899 align:start position:0%
statute and also by defining it into a
 
04:28:01.490 --> 04:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
statute a lot of these fighting
 
04:28:03.649 --> 04:28:03.659 align:start position:0%
will be decreased because there will be
 
04:28:05.750 --> 04:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
clear things that students cannot
 
04:28:07.729 --> 04:28:07.739 align:start position:0%
pressure the administration to fight for
 
04:28:09.469 --> 04:28:09.479 align:start position:0%
I mean this whole discussion about
 
04:28:11.450 --> 04:28:11.460 align:start position:0%
whether clubs should be you know open
 
04:28:14.990 --> 04:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
you know membership or not
 
04:28:17.090 --> 04:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
it's a gray area
 
04:28:19.189 --> 04:28:19.199 align:start position:0%
and we want to clarify that and make
 
04:28:21.889 --> 04:28:21.899 align:start position:0%
clear that that is not acceptable this
 
04:28:23.929 --> 04:28:23.939 align:start position:0%
will prevent you know hopefully student
 
04:28:26.030 --> 04:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
associations for asking for a stop that
 
04:28:27.889 --> 04:28:27.899 align:start position:0%
clearly virus established statute while
 
04:28:29.870 --> 04:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
right now because it is always set in
 
04:28:32.929 --> 04:28:32.939 align:start position:0%
policy a lot of groups are trying to
 
04:28:34.910 --> 04:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
pressure the universities to change
 
04:28:37.130 --> 04:28:37.140 align:start position:0%
those policies and all that time and
 
04:28:40.309 --> 04:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
effort frankly should be spent on better
 
04:28:43.849 --> 04:28:43.859 align:start position:0%
topics please yes you may uh just a
 
04:28:45.649 --> 04:28:45.659 align:start position:0%
follow-up are there any recent
 
04:28:45.659 --> 04:28:47.030 align:start position:0%
follow-up are there any recent
incidences

04:28:47.030 --> 04:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
incidences
 
04:28:49.189 --> 04:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
that caused you to bring this before
 
04:28:52.130 --> 04:28:52.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:54.710 --> 04:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
frankly given the number of uh people
 
04:28:55.790 --> 04:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
that are
 
04:28:58.250 --> 04:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
lined up behind me to testify I'm Gonna
 
04:29:00.530 --> 04:29:00.540 align:start position:0%
Leave the specific incidents to them
 
04:29:02.689 --> 04:29:02.699 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you are there
 
04:29:04.010 --> 04:29:04.020 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
04:29:06.290 --> 04:29:06.300 align:start position:0%
Roxanne Luna
 
04:29:09.349 --> 04:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair I'm just
 
04:29:12.290 --> 04:29:12.300 align:start position:0%
wondering if um if because you you
 
04:29:13.790 --> 04:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
talked a little bit about freedom of
 
04:29:16.130 --> 04:29:16.140 align:start position:0%
Association as you know earlier and I
 
04:29:18.050 --> 04:29:18.060 align:start position:0%
was wondering how you feel
 
04:29:19.969 --> 04:29:19.979 align:start position:0%
um about colleges
 
04:29:23.149 --> 04:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
um having uh you know a unique academic
 
04:29:25.670 --> 04:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
Mission and core values that may be
 
04:29:29.149 --> 04:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
distinct from uh from other institutions
 
04:29:30.889 --> 04:29:30.899 align:start position:0%
um and whether or not those uh that
 
04:29:32.929 --> 04:29:32.939 align:start position:0%
mission and core values those core
 
04:29:35.510 --> 04:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
values should be protected and I'm
 
04:29:38.269 --> 04:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
particularly asking this uh with
 
04:29:41.410 --> 04:29:41.420 align:start position:0%
reference to the bottom of page two
 
04:29:45.349 --> 04:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
spilling over to the top of Page Three
 
04:29:47.450 --> 04:29:47.460 align:start position:0%
um uh where you talk about
 
04:29:47.460 --> 04:29:48.349 align:start position:0%
um uh where you talk about
um

04:29:48.349 --> 04:29:48.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:50.809 --> 04:29:50.819 align:start position:0%
um Roman one two and three and I'm just
 
04:29:53.389 --> 04:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
looking at two you know while looking at
 
04:29:57.290 --> 04:29:57.300 align:start position:0%
one which is core values Mission and
 
04:30:00.110 --> 04:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
also number two and these are things
 
04:30:03.050 --> 04:30:03.060 align:start position:0%
where the organ the um the leaders would
 
04:30:06.110 --> 04:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
not be able to uh to protect uh
 
04:30:07.370 --> 04:30:07.380 align:start position:0%
compliance with an organization
 
04:30:10.189 --> 04:30:10.199 align:start position:0%
standards a con uh conduct or um core
 
04:30:10.199 --> 04:30:14.389 align:start position:0%
standards a con uh conduct or um core
values

04:30:14.389 --> 04:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:17.990 --> 04:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
there is a huge distinction between what
 
04:30:20.149 --> 04:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
the private entity can do and what a
 
04:30:21.889 --> 04:30:21.899 align:start position:0%
public entity can do
 
04:30:24.170 --> 04:30:24.180 align:start position:0%
and I believe that
 
04:30:26.510 --> 04:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
when we have a public College which is
 
04:30:29.210 --> 04:30:29.220 align:start position:0%
an extension of the state government
 
04:30:31.729 --> 04:30:31.739 align:start position:0%
we have a much higher burden on the
 
04:30:34.370 --> 04:30:34.380 align:start position:0%
institution to protect the
 
04:30:37.070 --> 04:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights of its students
 
04:30:40.010 --> 04:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
where private institutions which by the
 
04:30:41.990 --> 04:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
way are specifically left out of this
 
04:30:45.889 --> 04:30:45.899 align:start position:0%
may have much more freedom in saying we
 
04:30:48.769 --> 04:30:48.779 align:start position:0%
can enforce much tighter rules because
 
04:30:51.590 --> 04:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
we are you know a part of the government
 
04:30:54.649 --> 04:30:54.659 align:start position:0%
we have a much higher standard in you
 
04:30:57.469 --> 04:30:57.479 align:start position:0%
know being able to impose those kinds of
 
04:31:00.530 --> 04:31:00.540 align:start position:0%
restrictions so in a sense
 
04:31:03.229 --> 04:31:03.239 align:start position:0%
we have a higher burden and that may
 
04:31:05.870 --> 04:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
limit us from providing certain policies
 
04:31:08.389 --> 04:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
that privacy institutions may decide are
 
04:31:11.210 --> 04:31:11.220 align:start position:0%
applicable for them but because of who
 
04:31:12.349 --> 04:31:12.359 align:start position:0%
we are
 
04:31:14.630 --> 04:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
we have you know this level of
 
04:31:16.910 --> 04:31:16.920 align:start position:0%
commitment to freedom of speech and
 
04:31:20.090 --> 04:31:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:22.189 --> 04:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee Mr
 
04:31:24.170 --> 04:31:24.180 align:start position:0%
chair appreciates who when when the
 
04:31:25.910 --> 04:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
university system testifies that they
 
04:31:27.530 --> 04:31:27.540 align:start position:0%
can address some of those comments too
 
04:31:29.090 --> 04:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
thank you when they come up right
 
04:31:31.610 --> 04:31:31.620 align:start position:0%
terrific thank you for the questions of
 
04:31:33.710 --> 04:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
the representative thank you very much
 
04:31:35.990 --> 04:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome uh
 
04:31:41.510 --> 04:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:41.520 --> 04:31:44.149 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:31:44.149 --> 04:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:46.130 --> 04:31:46.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
04:31:48.830 --> 04:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
committee and I I promise I won't I
 
04:31:50.809 --> 04:31:50.819 align:start position:0%
won't try to bug out early this time I
 
04:31:50.819 --> 04:31:53.389 align:start position:0%
won't try to bug out early this time I
don't

04:31:53.389 --> 04:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:55.429 --> 04:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
um uh I I
 
04:31:56.929 --> 04:31:56.939 align:start position:0%
um my name is Bob Nguyen I'm a
 
04:31:58.910 --> 04:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
representative from Windham and I appear
 
04:32:03.410 --> 04:32:03.420 align:start position:0%
here in support of uh this legislation
 
04:32:06.830 --> 04:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
um I think I I guess I would like to say
 
04:32:08.090 --> 04:32:08.100 align:start position:0%
a couple things first of all I think
 
04:32:10.610 --> 04:32:10.620 align:start position:0%
representative papamichi Mueller uh you
 
04:32:13.010 --> 04:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
know he he I think he covered the the
 
04:32:14.990 --> 04:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
the area on the important things very
 
04:32:17.090 --> 04:32:17.100 align:start position:0%
well and I don't have a tremendous
 
04:32:19.670 --> 04:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
amount to add but what I what I would
 
04:32:22.969 --> 04:32:22.979 align:start position:0%
add is I think that
 
04:32:22.979 --> 04:32:23.750 align:start position:0%
add is I think that
um

04:32:23.750 --> 04:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:27.290 --> 04:32:27.300 align:start position:0%
unlike and I had some involvement last
 
04:32:30.889 --> 04:32:30.899 align:start position:0%
last uh last time in another bill that
 
04:32:32.750 --> 04:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
was sort of some like somewhere like
 
04:32:34.670 --> 04:32:34.680 align:start position:0%
this and to be honest with you I don't
 
04:32:37.189 --> 04:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
even remember what what uh what the uh
 
04:32:39.530 --> 04:32:39.540 align:start position:0%
what the result of that I mean it didn't
 
04:32:41.450 --> 04:32:41.460 align:start position:0%
obviously didn't pass but
 
04:32:44.809 --> 04:32:44.819 align:start position:0%
um there were I think that there were
 
04:32:46.910 --> 04:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
some concerns about the
 
04:32:48.889 --> 04:32:48.899 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of at least some parts
 
04:32:51.710 --> 04:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
of that earlier bill
 
04:32:53.990 --> 04:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
from my review of this I really don't
 
04:32:56.090 --> 04:32:56.100 align:start position:0%
think that there's a that there's a
 
04:32:58.130 --> 04:32:58.140 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue here with anything
 
04:32:59.870 --> 04:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
that's been proposed here I don't think
 
04:33:01.849 --> 04:33:01.859 align:start position:0%
anything in this would be
 
04:33:01.859 --> 04:33:04.369 align:start position:0%
anything in this would be
unconstitutional

04:33:04.369 --> 04:33:04.379 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
04:33:07.189 --> 04:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
um and I think it does add
 
04:33:11.949 --> 04:33:11.959 align:start position:0%
um the uh it it does
 
04:33:15.109 --> 04:33:15.119 align:start position:0%
supplement the Constitution by providing
 
04:33:17.449 --> 04:33:17.459 align:start position:0%
at least in some areas additional
 
04:33:19.390 --> 04:33:19.400 align:start position:0%
protection as representative
 
04:33:22.131 --> 04:33:22.141 align:start position:0%
Mueller's indicated there are you know
 
04:33:24.109 --> 04:33:24.119 align:start position:0%
there are apparently some cases around
 
04:33:26.810 --> 04:33:26.820 align:start position:0%
the country that say that you can have
 
04:33:31.250 --> 04:33:31.260 align:start position:0%
you know you can have a free speech Zone
 
04:33:33.830 --> 04:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
however limited somewhere on campus and
 
04:33:36.650 --> 04:33:36.660 align:start position:0%
that's that's so that's sufficient to uh
 
04:33:39.650 --> 04:33:39.660 align:start position:0%
to satisfy the requirement of of you
 
04:33:41.810 --> 04:33:41.820 align:start position:0%
know providing alternative places for
 
04:33:45.230 --> 04:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
speech it's uh you know you can't help
 
04:33:46.849 --> 04:33:46.859 align:start position:0%
thinking that that that's sort of like
 
04:33:50.510 --> 04:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
saying you know the the the dog pound is
 
04:33:52.849 --> 04:33:52.859 align:start position:0%
over here and and if you are one of the
 
04:33:54.830 --> 04:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
one of those disreputable people that
 
04:33:57.590 --> 04:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
wants to engage in free speech then you
 
04:33:59.510 --> 04:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
can go to the you can go to the dog
 
04:34:03.709 --> 04:34:03.719 align:start position:0%
pound this this says no you can't do
 
04:34:06.949 --> 04:34:06.959 align:start position:0%
um that kind of thing and so I think I
 
04:34:10.070 --> 04:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
think it I think it is it's it serves an
 
04:34:11.631 --> 04:34:11.641 align:start position:0%
important purpose
 
04:34:15.830 --> 04:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
um and I think it I um I think it is uh
 
04:34:18.289 --> 04:34:18.299 align:start position:0%
is a worthwhile bill and I just there
 
04:34:19.970 --> 04:34:19.980 align:start position:0%
was one point that I wanted to uh
 
04:34:23.209 --> 04:34:23.219 align:start position:0%
reference I think uh representative
 
04:34:24.949 --> 04:34:24.959 align:start position:0%
Belcher you had raised the question
 
04:34:28.910 --> 04:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
about the 11th Amendment immunity and
 
04:34:30.890 --> 04:34:30.900 align:start position:0%
you know it's true if you read the 11th
 
04:34:34.189 --> 04:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
Amendment it says it appears to say only
 
04:34:39.609 --> 04:34:39.619 align:start position:0%
that it bars suit in federal courts by
 
04:34:43.551 --> 04:34:43.561 align:start position:0%
citizens of one State against uh against
 
04:34:46.369 --> 04:34:46.379 align:start position:0%
another state but almost from the
 
04:34:48.230 --> 04:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
beginning after the 11th Amendment was
 
04:34:51.949 --> 04:34:51.959 align:start position:0%
was uh adopted the U.S Supreme Court has
 
04:34:53.810 --> 04:34:53.820 align:start position:0%
interpreted it to mean it's not just
 
04:34:56.570 --> 04:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
citizens of another state it's you can't
 
04:34:59.949 --> 04:34:59.959 align:start position:0%
sue your own state in federal court
 
04:35:02.150 --> 04:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
unless there's been some waiver of
 
04:35:07.429 --> 04:35:07.439 align:start position:0%
immunity so I think uh I I think
 
04:35:09.949 --> 04:35:09.959 align:start position:0%
you know do you absolutely have to have
 
04:35:12.349 --> 04:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
the 11th Amendment waiver in here no I
 
04:35:14.269 --> 04:35:14.279 align:start position:0%
suppose if you even without the 11th
 
04:35:15.590 --> 04:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment waiver
 
04:35:19.250 --> 04:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
the second sentence of section j6 which
 
04:35:21.650 --> 04:35:21.660 align:start position:0%
says a public institution of higher
 
04:35:23.410 --> 04:35:23.420 align:start position:0%
education that violates this chapter
 
04:35:26.029 --> 04:35:26.039 align:start position:0%
shall not be immune from suit or
 
04:35:29.449 --> 04:35:29.459 align:start position:0%
liability for the violation that by
 
04:35:31.490 --> 04:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
having that sentence alone if you took
 
04:35:34.070 --> 04:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
the first sentence out that would allow
 
04:35:37.369 --> 04:35:37.379 align:start position:0%
suit to be brought in State Court
 
04:35:39.170 --> 04:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
um against you know the University of
 
04:35:41.029 --> 04:35:41.039 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as an example
 
04:35:43.369 --> 04:35:43.379 align:start position:0%
um but I do think that having the first
 
04:35:45.470 --> 04:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
sentence in there serves a useful
 
04:35:48.709 --> 04:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
purpose because it basically says if
 
04:35:51.590 --> 04:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
someone wants to bring a suit in federal
 
04:35:51.600 --> 04:35:52.750 align:start position:0%
someone wants to bring a suit in federal
court

04:35:52.750 --> 04:35:52.760 align:start position:0%
court
 
04:35:56.689 --> 04:35:56.699 align:start position:0%
that would otherwise be be barred by the
 
04:35:59.449 --> 04:35:59.459 align:start position:0%
11th Amendment the the state of New
 
04:36:01.189 --> 04:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has waived the 11th Amendment
 
04:36:03.410 --> 04:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
for this for these for purposes of these
 
04:36:05.631 --> 04:36:05.641 align:start position:0%
suits and I think that serves a useful
 
04:36:05.641 --> 04:36:07.010 align:start position:0%
suits and I think that serves a useful
function

04:36:07.010 --> 04:36:07.020 align:start position:0%
function
 
04:36:08.929 --> 04:36:08.939 align:start position:0%
um so I I you know that's why I I
 
04:36:08.939 --> 04:36:10.131 align:start position:0%
um so I I you know that's why I I
support

04:36:10.131 --> 04:36:10.141 align:start position:0%
support
 
04:36:12.529 --> 04:36:12.539 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm happy to take questions I
 
04:36:14.150 --> 04:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
have one question for you maybe help me
 
04:36:15.769 --> 04:36:15.779 align:start position:0%
understand this
 
04:36:15.779 --> 04:36:16.369 align:start position:0%
understand this
um

04:36:16.369 --> 04:36:16.379 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:19.010 --> 04:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
at one point it gives us a definition in
 
04:36:23.631 --> 04:36:23.641 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:28.010 --> 04:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
then on the last page
 
04:36:31.189 --> 04:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
on line seven it says any person or
 
04:36:33.890 --> 04:36:33.900 align:start position:0%
Student Association agreed by a
 
04:36:37.429 --> 04:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
violation may do this this and this
 
04:36:40.070 --> 04:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
is Student Association and student
 
04:36:43.369 --> 04:36:43.379 align:start position:0%
organization the same thing
 
04:36:45.051 --> 04:36:45.061 align:start position:0%
you know that's that's really a good
 
04:36:48.590 --> 04:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
catch I would say yes that that it's
 
04:36:50.090 --> 04:36:50.100 align:start position:0%
meant but you know there's a principle
 
04:36:53.750 --> 04:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
in the law that says if if the
 
04:36:55.609 --> 04:36:55.619 align:start position:0%
legislature meant the same thing they
 
04:36:57.349 --> 04:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
would use the same word and if they
 
04:36:59.090 --> 04:36:59.100 align:start position:0%
didn't they must have meant something
 
04:37:01.429 --> 04:37:01.439 align:start position:0%
else so that might be you know it might
 
04:37:03.769 --> 04:37:03.779 align:start position:0%
be it might be worthwhile there for this
 
04:37:06.590 --> 04:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
Committee in its wisdom to change to
 
04:37:08.390 --> 04:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
change that so that the word is the same
 
04:37:10.609 --> 04:37:10.619 align:start position:0%
so that you use the same word in both
 
04:37:13.609 --> 04:37:13.619 align:start position:0%
places so that you prevent that argument
 
04:37:15.830 --> 04:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
from being made some you know if you
 
04:37:17.449 --> 04:37:17.459 align:start position:0%
don't make that's a really good catch if
 
04:37:19.090 --> 04:37:19.100 align:start position:0%
you don't make that kind of change
 
04:37:21.769 --> 04:37:21.779 align:start position:0%
somewhere down the road some lawyer will
 
04:37:23.990 --> 04:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
say oh no no no wait a minute they said
 
04:37:27.289 --> 04:37:27.299 align:start position:0%
organization on page two and Association
 
04:37:29.269 --> 04:37:29.279 align:start position:0%
on page three and there must be some
 
04:37:31.131 --> 04:37:31.141 align:start position:0%
some difference
 
04:37:33.590 --> 04:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
um so I you know I think that would make
 
04:37:37.010 --> 04:37:37.020 align:start position:0%
sense to uh to uh thank you to make
 
04:37:38.631 --> 04:37:38.641 align:start position:0%
those things consistent it's good to
 
04:37:41.269 --> 04:37:41.279 align:start position:0%
hear from a judge
 
04:37:43.250 --> 04:37:43.260 align:start position:0%
okay further questions represent
 
04:37:45.410 --> 04:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you Mr chair and thank
 
04:37:47.269 --> 04:37:47.279 align:start position:0%
you very much for clarifying my
 
04:37:49.189 --> 04:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
questions regarding the 11th Amendment
 
04:37:52.070 --> 04:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
and the waiver of immunity however I am
 
04:37:53.750 --> 04:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
still hung up on the part that comes
 
04:37:55.849 --> 04:37:55.859 align:start position:0%
after that could you tell me if I'm
 
04:37:58.490 --> 04:37:58.500 align:start position:0%
interpreting this correctly where it
 
04:38:02.990 --> 04:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:06.109 --> 04:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
if any provision is held Beyond
 
04:38:06.119 --> 04:38:08.330 align:start position:0%
if any provision is held Beyond
constitutional

04:38:08.330 --> 04:38:08.340 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
04:38:10.670 --> 04:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
the application of the provision to any
 
04:38:12.949 --> 04:38:12.959 align:start position:0%
other person or circumstance shall not
 
04:38:15.289 --> 04:38:15.299 align:start position:0%
be affected is that to mean that if
 
04:38:17.090 --> 04:38:17.100 align:start position:0%
something is found Beyond constitutional
 
04:38:19.849 --> 04:38:19.859 align:start position:0%
to one person but it's constitutional to
 
04:38:21.709 --> 04:38:21.719 align:start position:0%
the next person is
 
04:38:23.869 --> 04:38:23.879 align:start position:0%
saying yeah you know what this is this
 
04:38:26.750 --> 04:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
is language that has actually become
 
04:38:30.170 --> 04:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
somewhat standard in in legislation not
 
04:38:32.330 --> 04:38:32.340 align:start position:0%
just in New Hampshire but around the
 
04:38:34.730 --> 04:38:34.740 align:start position:0%
country and and the idea is
 
04:38:37.310 --> 04:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a Doctrine in the law
 
04:38:39.250 --> 04:38:39.260 align:start position:0%
that that
 
04:38:42.890 --> 04:38:42.900 align:start position:0%
sometimes a court if a court says
 
04:38:45.170 --> 04:38:45.180 align:start position:0%
the you know in some lawsuit this
 
04:38:47.869 --> 04:38:47.879 align:start position:0%
statute is unconstitutional
 
04:38:50.330 --> 04:38:50.340 align:start position:0%
depending on the circumstances they
 
04:38:53.449 --> 04:38:53.459 align:start position:0%
might they might say that it's
 
04:38:55.609 --> 04:38:55.619 align:start position:0%
sort of facial for lack of a better term
 
04:38:57.709 --> 04:38:57.719 align:start position:0%
facially Constitution unconstitutional
 
04:39:00.470 --> 04:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
it can never be applied as to anyone
 
04:39:03.170 --> 04:39:03.180 align:start position:0%
and as opposed to
 
04:39:05.090 --> 04:39:05.100 align:start position:0%
the court saying
 
04:39:07.551 --> 04:39:07.561 align:start position:0%
this statute is unconstitutional as
 
04:39:10.810 --> 04:39:10.820 align:start position:0%
applied to this plaintiff in this case
 
04:39:15.051 --> 04:39:15.061 align:start position:0%
but it's not you know we don't we we
 
04:39:16.369 --> 04:39:16.379 align:start position:0%
don't address whether it's
 
04:39:18.470 --> 04:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
constitutional anywhere else and what
 
04:39:20.449 --> 04:39:20.459 align:start position:0%
this is designed to what this is
 
04:39:22.670 --> 04:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
designed to say is to send a signal to
 
04:39:23.990 --> 04:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
the court
 
04:39:28.670 --> 04:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
the legislature intends you Court to
 
04:39:31.609 --> 04:39:31.619 align:start position:0%
apply this only to individual cases so
 
04:39:33.170 --> 04:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
if you think that in some particular
 
04:39:36.170 --> 04:39:36.180 align:start position:0%
case the statute's unconstitutional okay
 
04:39:37.730 --> 04:39:37.740 align:start position:0%
then then you rule that it's
 
04:39:40.610 --> 04:39:40.620 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional as to that case but our
 
04:39:44.390 --> 04:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
intent the legislature is to have it is
 
04:39:46.810 --> 04:39:46.820 align:start position:0%
to not have you say it's always
 
04:39:49.130 --> 04:39:49.140 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional it's basically say you
 
04:39:51.530 --> 04:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
know if there's another case that comes
 
04:39:54.410 --> 04:39:54.420 align:start position:0%
up you decide afresh whether it's
 
04:39:56.448 --> 04:39:56.458 align:start position:0%
constitutional in that context or not
 
04:39:58.430 --> 04:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
that that's kind of what it's designed
 
04:40:01.430 --> 04:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
to to do because sometimes the court
 
04:40:04.610 --> 04:40:04.620 align:start position:0%
will the courts have said well you know
 
04:40:06.650 --> 04:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
without this for example if this this
 
04:40:09.170 --> 04:40:09.180 align:start position:0%
language we're not in there well
 
04:40:11.330 --> 04:40:11.340 align:start position:0%
we think that you know the legislature
 
04:40:14.330 --> 04:40:14.340 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't have wanted if if the
 
04:40:15.890 --> 04:40:15.900 align:start position:0%
legislature had known that this statute
 
04:40:19.010 --> 04:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
was unconstitutional as to this case it
 
04:40:20.270 --> 04:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have wanted the statute to
 
04:40:22.130 --> 04:40:22.140 align:start position:0%
exist at all so we're going to say it's
 
04:40:25.010 --> 04:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional as to every case Okay
 
04:40:26.868 --> 04:40:26.878 align:start position:0%
this language is designed to say don't
 
04:40:28.910 --> 04:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
do that court all right I appreciate the
 
04:40:30.590 --> 04:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
clarification thank you thank you for
 
04:40:34.130 --> 04:40:34.140 align:start position:0%

um in a recent case in excuse me thank
you

04:40:43.970 --> 04:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:40:47.208 --> 04:40:47.218 align:start position:0%
in a recent case in Pennsylvania a
 
04:40:49.490 --> 04:40:49.500 align:start position:0%
faculty member is said now I was not
 
04:40:51.830 --> 04:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
there so I'm going on who's in personal
 
04:40:55.730 --> 04:40:55.740 align:start position:0%
accounts from former colleagues
 
04:40:58.310 --> 04:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
was alleged to have asserted in a
 
04:41:01.310 --> 04:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
classroom that there are only that are
 
04:41:04.788 --> 04:41:04.798 align:start position:0%
more than two genders of human beings
 
04:41:07.750 --> 04:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
a student objected to the statement
 
04:41:11.150 --> 04:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
based on religious grounds and other
 
04:41:13.550 --> 04:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
claims I don't know what they were
 
04:41:17.750 --> 04:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
and they're developed a dispute between
 
04:41:20.150 --> 04:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
the faculty member and the student in
 
04:41:20.160 --> 04:41:21.830 align:start position:0%
the faculty member and the student in
class

04:41:21.830 --> 04:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
class
 
04:41:25.190 --> 04:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
at some point the student was rejected
 
04:41:29.230 --> 04:41:29.240 align:start position:0%
from the class in some process protested
 
04:41:31.610 --> 04:41:31.620 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it was a class required
 
04:41:33.948 --> 04:41:33.958 align:start position:0%
for graduation which was the next
 
04:41:36.350 --> 04:41:36.360 align:start position:0%
semester and
 
04:41:39.650 --> 04:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
it became an entire dispute over
 
04:41:41.628 --> 04:41:41.638 align:start position:0%
Truth for one person and Truth for
 
04:41:43.490 --> 04:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
another person
 
04:41:46.970 --> 04:41:46.980 align:start position:0%
the student was ejected suspended from
 
04:41:49.190 --> 04:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
the school that position was then
 
04:41:51.708 --> 04:41:51.718 align:start position:0%
reversed later and the student was
 
04:41:54.590 --> 04:41:54.600 align:start position:0%
allowed to somehow graduate how would
 
04:41:57.830 --> 04:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
that kind of a case be addressed
 
04:42:01.010 --> 04:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
by this kind of a bill I'm not I don't
 
04:42:04.368 --> 04:42:04.378 align:start position:0%
think that this bill particularly I mean
 
04:42:06.708 --> 04:42:06.718 align:start position:0%
you know the the the issue and I think
 
04:42:08.750 --> 04:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
representative lad one of your questions
 
04:42:14.050 --> 04:42:14.060 align:start position:0%
to the representative kind of uh
 
04:42:16.368 --> 04:42:16.378 align:start position:0%
raised this issue too I think one of the
 
04:42:19.430 --> 04:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
things this this statute doesn't really
 
04:42:21.110 --> 04:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
deal with the issue and it's a
 
04:42:24.050 --> 04:42:24.060 align:start position:0%
complicated issue of
 
04:42:26.448 --> 04:42:26.458 align:start position:0%
the faculty member
 
04:42:29.448 --> 04:42:29.458 align:start position:0%
who is a state employee and what the
 
04:42:33.530 --> 04:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
faculty member can or cannot say
 
04:42:35.208 --> 04:42:35.218 align:start position:0%
um and you know what what what may
 
04:42:37.070 --> 04:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
result from what the faculty member says
 
04:42:40.070 --> 04:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
because on the one hand you do have a
 
04:42:42.350 --> 04:42:42.360 align:start position:0%
Doctrine you know of sort of academic
 
04:42:44.390 --> 04:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
freedom that the professor should be
 
04:42:47.090 --> 04:42:47.100 align:start position:0%
allowed to you know to explore and
 
04:42:49.850 --> 04:42:49.860 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be restricted
 
04:42:52.430 --> 04:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
um uh in you know or curtailed in like
 
04:42:54.350 --> 04:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
their academic Pursuits that you have
 
04:42:56.208 --> 04:42:56.218 align:start position:0%
that and that's and and the money and
 
04:42:58.070 --> 04:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
that's an important Doctrine on the
 
04:42:59.150 --> 04:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
other hand
 
04:43:01.550 --> 04:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
you have the fact that the that the
 
04:43:03.708 --> 04:43:03.718 align:start position:0%
professor is a state is an employee of
 
04:43:05.750 --> 04:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
the state is being paid by the state and
 
04:43:07.490 --> 04:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
just to give you an obvious example
 
04:43:10.070 --> 04:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
suppose a professor has hired you know
 
04:43:12.530 --> 04:43:12.540 align:start position:0%
to to teach in the math department
 
04:43:15.550 --> 04:43:15.560 align:start position:0%
I don't I think the state can properly
 
04:43:18.350 --> 04:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
say if the professor decides you know
 
04:43:20.448 --> 04:43:20.458 align:start position:0%
today I really want to talk about
 
04:43:22.430 --> 04:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
history we're gonna we're gonna I'm
 
04:43:23.810 --> 04:43:23.820 align:start position:0%
gonna give you you know we're gonna have
 
04:43:26.208 --> 04:43:26.218 align:start position:0%
a lecture on history that the state can
 
04:43:28.250 --> 04:43:28.260 align:start position:0%
say wait a minute you know we did that's
 
04:43:30.590 --> 04:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
not what we're paying you for you're you
 
04:43:32.150 --> 04:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
want to talk about history that do it on
 
04:43:34.250 --> 04:43:34.260 align:start position:0%
your own time get the students out you
 
04:43:35.570 --> 04:43:35.580 align:start position:0%
know after class or whatever talk about
 
04:43:37.670 --> 04:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
it but but we're paying you to be a math
 
04:43:39.590 --> 04:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
teacher you can't be a history teacher
 
04:43:43.010 --> 04:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
now you know that's at one extreme On
 
04:43:44.690 --> 04:43:44.700 align:start position:0%
The Other Extreme if the teacher is
 
04:43:48.530 --> 04:43:48.540 align:start position:0%
talking about history and is expressing
 
04:43:51.708 --> 04:43:51.718 align:start position:0%
um uh you know an offhand personal view
 
04:43:54.050 --> 04:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
on something is that
 
04:43:56.868 --> 04:43:56.878 align:start position:0%
um you know is that somehow a violation
 
04:44:00.230 --> 04:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
of the of the professor's uh of the
 
04:44:02.030 --> 04:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
professor's job description and that
 
04:44:04.788 --> 04:44:04.798 align:start position:0%
it's it becomes it can become very you
 
04:44:06.288 --> 04:44:06.298 align:start position:0%
know it can become very complicated
 
04:44:09.110 --> 04:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
depending on the circumstances
 
04:44:11.090 --> 04:44:11.100 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee yes
 
04:44:13.490 --> 04:44:13.500 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher thank you Mr chair and
 
04:44:15.650 --> 04:44:15.660 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
04:44:17.448 --> 04:44:17.458 align:start position:0%
um just to return to something I'd asked
 
04:44:20.690 --> 04:44:20.700 align:start position:0%
earlier do would you agree that this
 
04:44:22.430 --> 04:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
um the language in this creates a rate
 
04:44:26.150 --> 04:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
of action if a college were to allow a
 
04:44:28.788 --> 04:44:28.798 align:start position:0%
um a speaker to be shouted down and if
 
04:44:30.470 --> 04:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
so can you can you tell me where the
 
04:44:31.910 --> 04:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
language might be because I'm having a
 
04:44:33.890 --> 04:44:33.900 align:start position:0%
hard time finding specific language that
 
04:44:36.830 --> 04:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
would address a situation like that I
 
04:44:38.750 --> 04:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
think it I think it would I mean it
 
04:44:40.310 --> 04:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
would it would I guess it would sort of
 
04:44:42.410 --> 04:44:42.420 align:start position:0%
depend on the again on the particular
 
04:44:45.230 --> 04:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
circumstances but for example let's
 
04:44:47.868 --> 04:44:47.878 align:start position:0%
suppose you had a situation where
 
04:44:50.110 --> 04:44:50.120 align:start position:0%
you know the colleges
 
04:44:53.868 --> 04:44:53.878 align:start position:0%
routine practice was when
 
04:44:56.628 --> 04:44:56.638 align:start position:0%
whenever you know they that they did not
 
04:44:58.788 --> 04:44:58.798 align:start position:0%
they did not try to restrict you know
 
04:45:00.948 --> 04:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
controversial speechers speakers from
 
04:45:04.250 --> 04:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
coming on campus and they you know when
 
04:45:05.628 --> 04:45:05.638 align:start position:0%
they when they knew that something was
 
04:45:07.310 --> 04:45:07.320 align:start position:0%
likely to be controversial they'd make
 
04:45:08.990 --> 04:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
sure they had enough security people
 
04:45:11.510 --> 04:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
around but
 
04:45:14.530 --> 04:45:14.540 align:start position:0%
you know for this particular speaker
 
04:45:17.810 --> 04:45:17.820 align:start position:0%
uh uh of of a particular political
 
04:45:20.570 --> 04:45:20.580 align:start position:0%
political persuasion uh they didn't have
 
04:45:22.730 --> 04:45:22.740 align:start position:0%
any security that day you know they all
 
04:45:25.190 --> 04:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
all the campus police decided to take
 
04:45:27.708 --> 04:45:27.718 align:start position:0%
vacation that day or whatever
 
04:45:29.750 --> 04:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
um sure I think that and then if you
 
04:45:32.208 --> 04:45:32.218 align:start position:0%
know if they're developed as a result of
 
04:45:34.368 --> 04:45:34.378 align:start position:0%
that somebody couldn't speak or there
 
04:45:37.490 --> 04:45:37.500 align:start position:0%
turned out to be uh you know a riot in
 
04:45:40.550 --> 04:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
effect I think I think yes there might
 
04:45:42.948 --> 04:45:42.958 align:start position:0%
very well be a basis for liability thank
 
04:45:46.910 --> 04:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
you further questions representative
 
04:45:49.550 --> 04:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
Luna and then representative Lane thank
 
04:45:51.230 --> 04:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chair are you aware
 
04:45:54.110 --> 04:45:54.120 align:start position:0%
that um that that a lot that the
 
04:45:55.850 --> 04:45:55.860 align:start position:0%
language in here appears to be Alec
 
04:45:58.190 --> 04:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
model legislation I was not aware of
 
04:46:02.448 --> 04:46:02.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:04.190 --> 04:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative Lynn for
 
04:46:05.690 --> 04:46:05.700 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:46:07.128 --> 04:46:07.138 align:start position:0%
um and I probably should have asked this
 
04:46:09.288 --> 04:46:09.298 align:start position:0%
of the other speaker but
 
04:46:13.150 --> 04:46:13.160 align:start position:0%
um why is this only applicable to public
 
04:46:16.990 --> 04:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
schools and not private schools as well
 
04:46:21.288 --> 04:46:21.298 align:start position:0%
because the state the state action issue
 
04:46:24.368 --> 04:46:24.378 align:start position:0%
in other words you if the if something
 
04:46:28.190 --> 04:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
if something is not a a state
 
04:46:31.250 --> 04:46:31.260 align:start position:0%
institution I think there's a there's a
 
04:46:33.410 --> 04:46:33.420 align:start position:0%
a much bigger question about what's the
 
04:46:37.010 --> 04:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
legislators legislature's authority to
 
04:46:39.288 --> 04:46:39.298 align:start position:0%
regulate it I'm not saying I'm not
 
04:46:41.208 --> 04:46:41.218 align:start position:0%
saying that there that there isn't any
 
04:46:43.730 --> 04:46:43.740 align:start position:0%
but I'm just saying it becomes
 
04:46:46.910 --> 04:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
it becomes a more complicated issue and
 
04:46:49.250 --> 04:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
I just I think representative Mueller
 
04:46:51.050 --> 04:46:51.060 align:start position:0%
may have touched on this a little bit or
 
04:46:53.448 --> 04:46:53.458 align:start position:0%
but but I know in discussions I've had
 
04:46:55.910 --> 04:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
with him I mean one of the things that
 
04:46:57.830 --> 04:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
you know that that
 
04:47:00.890 --> 04:47:00.900 align:start position:0%
um we focus on is Let's uh we think this
 
04:47:03.050 --> 04:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
is important for protecting the first
 
04:47:05.930 --> 04:47:05.940 align:start position:0%
amendment is really important let's you
 
04:47:08.750 --> 04:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
know but let's not try to go into an
 
04:47:11.330 --> 04:47:11.340 align:start position:0%
area that that maybe is beyond what
 
04:47:13.070 --> 04:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
where or at least would raise questions
 
04:47:16.610 --> 04:47:16.620 align:start position:0%
as to the legislature the authority to
 
04:47:18.590 --> 04:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
do that and and I would you know I just
 
04:47:20.150 --> 04:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
give you an example in my in my
 
04:47:22.250 --> 04:47:22.260 align:start position:0%
committee we had the we had a proposal
 
04:47:26.990 --> 04:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
uh legislation was proposed for us to on
 
04:47:30.230 --> 04:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
a state level to regulate uh the con you
 
04:47:32.930 --> 04:47:32.940 align:start position:0%
know what what Google and uh Twitter and
 
04:47:35.270 --> 04:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
all that can do uh and there was a and
 
04:47:37.550 --> 04:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
there was a real question about the
 
04:47:40.550 --> 04:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
First Amendment implications of do we
 
04:47:42.650 --> 04:47:42.660 align:start position:0%
have the right to do that so I think
 
04:47:44.270 --> 04:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
that's the issue here with regard to
 
04:47:47.030 --> 04:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
private institutions
 
04:47:49.670 --> 04:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
representative balbooni
 
04:47:51.770 --> 04:47:51.780 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you for
 
04:47:53.390 --> 04:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:47:57.490 --> 04:47:57.500 align:start position:0%
um time on page two
 
04:48:03.010 --> 04:48:03.020 align:start position:0%
lines 34 and 35. it talks about
 
04:48:06.250 --> 04:48:06.260 align:start position:0%
ways that public institutions
 
04:48:10.910 --> 04:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
are not uh let me just read it here so
 
04:48:12.708 --> 04:48:12.718 align:start position:0%
nothing in the section shall be
 
04:48:14.090 --> 04:48:14.100 align:start position:0%
interpreted of preventing public
 
04:48:15.890 --> 04:48:15.900 align:start position:0%
institutions of higher education from
 
04:48:18.288 --> 04:48:18.298 align:start position:0%
prohibiting limiting or restricting
 
04:48:20.810 --> 04:48:20.820 align:start position:0%
expression that the First Amendment does
 
04:48:23.868 --> 04:48:23.878 align:start position:0%
not protect such as and these are the
 
04:48:26.810 --> 04:48:26.820 align:start position:0%
words true threats expression directed
 
04:48:29.628 --> 04:48:29.638 align:start position:0%
to provoke eminent
 
04:48:32.510 --> 04:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
of all those actions and likely to
 
04:48:33.610 --> 04:48:33.620 align:start position:0%
produce it
 
04:48:37.730 --> 04:48:37.740 align:start position:0%
those are those legal terms those how do
 
04:48:40.610 --> 04:48:40.620 align:start position:0%
you determine what is a true threat or
 
04:48:43.670 --> 04:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
the expression um up above he that the
 
04:48:46.310 --> 04:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
harassment is defined but those two are
 
04:48:46.320 --> 04:48:47.090 align:start position:0%
harassment is defined but those two are
not

04:48:47.090 --> 04:48:47.100 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:48:49.610 --> 04:48:49.620 align:start position:0%
you know it they yeah I think the short
 
04:48:52.910 --> 04:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
answer is yes they are I mean those are
 
04:48:55.390 --> 04:48:55.400 align:start position:0%
terms that are that have been used
 
04:48:57.708 --> 04:48:57.718 align:start position:0%
repeatedly in court cases including
 
04:49:00.170 --> 04:49:00.180 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court cases
 
04:49:03.708 --> 04:49:03.718 align:start position:0%
um this those those kinds of things
 
04:49:04.970 --> 04:49:04.980 align:start position:0%
um that you know that the First
 
04:49:07.010 --> 04:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
Amendment doesn't there are certain
 
04:49:08.750 --> 04:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
things the first amendment doesn't
 
04:49:10.550 --> 04:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
protect and you know the the classic
 
04:49:12.708 --> 04:49:12.718 align:start position:0%
example is you can't yell fire in a
 
04:49:14.628 --> 04:49:14.638 align:start position:0%
crowded theater if there's really no
 
04:49:16.610 --> 04:49:16.620 align:start position:0%
fire you just can't you you know just
 
04:49:18.708 --> 04:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
been starting to Stampede and there are
 
04:49:20.208 --> 04:49:20.218 align:start position:0%
other things obscenity is another
 
04:49:23.150 --> 04:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
another uh example
 
04:49:25.788 --> 04:49:25.798 align:start position:0%
um but but and I think so I think this
 
04:49:29.570 --> 04:49:29.580 align:start position:0%
tries to capture that and I think the it
 
04:49:32.510 --> 04:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
it it's it's important to Define
 
04:49:36.430 --> 04:49:36.440 align:start position:0%
harassment because I think
 
04:49:39.770 --> 04:49:39.780 align:start position:0%
one of the things that has been a real
 
04:49:41.868 --> 04:49:41.878 align:start position:0%
issue I think lately
 
04:49:41.878 --> 04:49:44.930 align:start position:0%
issue I think lately
is

04:49:44.930 --> 04:49:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:48.948 --> 04:49:48.958 align:start position:0%
you know the whole idea of sort of hate
 
04:49:52.310 --> 04:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
speech quote unquote hate speech
 
04:49:56.390 --> 04:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
um being in some circles that the the
 
04:49:58.190 --> 04:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
thought is that hate speech is not
 
04:50:00.110 --> 04:50:00.120 align:start position:0%
protected by the First Amendment which I
 
04:50:02.030 --> 04:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
think is really problematic because
 
04:50:04.610 --> 04:50:04.620 align:start position:0%
often what it really means is hate
 
04:50:07.070 --> 04:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
speech is when you say something that I
 
04:50:09.530 --> 04:50:09.540 align:start position:0%
disagree with really strongly that's
 
04:50:12.230 --> 04:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
hate speech and that's a real you know
 
04:50:15.650 --> 04:50:15.660 align:start position:0%
that's a real problem uh I I think a
 
04:50:18.470 --> 04:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
real problem to allow government to do
 
04:50:19.970 --> 04:50:19.980 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing I you know I think
 
04:50:21.890 --> 04:50:21.900 align:start position:0%
we've one of the things that I would
 
04:50:24.650 --> 04:50:24.660 align:start position:0%
remind you of is remember back not that
 
04:50:28.190 --> 04:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
long ago 1977 when the American Nazi
 
04:50:30.410 --> 04:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
party wanted to wanted to have a
 
04:50:32.810 --> 04:50:32.820 align:start position:0%
demonstration in Skokie Illinois
 
04:50:35.570 --> 04:50:35.580 align:start position:0%
and which is a you know heavily Jewish
 
04:50:38.208 --> 04:50:38.218 align:start position:0%
suburb of Chicago and the Supreme Court
 
04:50:41.868 --> 04:50:41.878 align:start position:0%
said yep they can and the ACLU the ACLU
 
04:50:43.310 --> 04:50:43.320 align:start position:0%
supported them I I think I happen to
 
04:50:44.510 --> 04:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
think that the Supreme Court made the
 
04:50:46.310 --> 04:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
right decision there even though you
 
04:50:48.288 --> 04:50:48.298 align:start position:0%
know the I the idea of a Nazi party
 
04:50:50.208 --> 04:50:50.218 align:start position:0%
turns my stomach and I'm sure it does
 
04:50:51.708 --> 04:50:51.718 align:start position:0%
all of yours
 
04:50:51.718 --> 04:50:52.310 align:start position:0%
all of yours
um

04:50:52.310 --> 04:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:56.448 --> 04:50:56.458 align:start position:0%
but I I think we have to be careful that
 
04:50:59.150 --> 04:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
we don't slip away from that however
 
04:51:02.448 --> 04:51:02.458 align:start position:0%
offensive we might think some particular
 
04:51:06.230 --> 04:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
view is that that doesn't make it you
 
04:51:08.150 --> 04:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
know violence
 
04:51:10.310 --> 04:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
um or the or the or the threat of
 
04:51:13.310 --> 04:51:13.320 align:start position:0%
violence there has to actually be some
 
04:51:16.310 --> 04:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
threat of violence to for something to
 
04:51:18.708 --> 04:51:18.718 align:start position:0%
become not not covered by the First
 
04:51:20.868 --> 04:51:20.878 align:start position:0%
Amendment and so I think the harassment
 
04:51:23.448 --> 04:51:23.458 align:start position:0%
definition which says it's not just
 
04:51:26.090 --> 04:51:26.100 align:start position:0%
somebody made some really offensive
 
04:51:28.190 --> 04:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
comment there's got to be it's got to be
 
04:51:30.590 --> 04:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
something that that really
 
04:51:32.750 --> 04:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
um meets the definition uh that the
 
04:51:35.150 --> 04:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
student you know it's uh subject it's uh
 
04:51:38.930 --> 04:51:38.940 align:start position:0%
so severe pervasive and subjectively and
 
04:51:40.490 --> 04:51:40.500 align:start position:0%
objectively offensive that the student
 
04:51:42.590 --> 04:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
is denied equal is denying equal access
 
04:51:45.470 --> 04:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
to uh to educational opportunities if
 
04:51:47.690 --> 04:51:47.700 align:start position:0%
it's something less than that
 
04:51:48.948 --> 04:51:48.958 align:start position:0%
um then it doesn't then it doesn't
 
04:51:51.470 --> 04:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
qualify and you can't stop it represent
 
04:51:54.470 --> 04:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
balbon if you have yeah just a follow-up
 
04:51:56.208 --> 04:51:56.218 align:start position:0%
um just back to what you're coming about
 
04:51:59.090 --> 04:51:59.100 align:start position:0%
the harassment who determines that I
 
04:52:01.368 --> 04:52:01.378 align:start position:0%
mean who is who is the final who makes
 
04:52:03.110 --> 04:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
the final decision on what constitutes
 
04:52:05.270 --> 04:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
harassment well I guess I mean if it was
 
04:52:06.650 --> 04:52:06.660 align:start position:0%
a lawsuit I think it would end up being
 
04:52:08.930 --> 04:52:08.940 align:start position:0%
the court that would decide the court
 
04:52:10.550 --> 04:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
that would decide that and if there were
 
04:52:12.410 --> 04:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
factual issues about what happened maybe
 
04:52:15.470 --> 04:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
a jury maybe a jury would decide but but
 
04:52:17.390 --> 04:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
uh you know if the facts were not in
 
04:52:18.890 --> 04:52:18.900 align:start position:0%
dispute then a court I think would
 
04:52:21.650 --> 04:52:21.660 align:start position:0%
ultimately have to decide
 
04:52:25.310 --> 04:52:25.320 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
04:52:27.708 --> 04:52:27.718 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you thanks
 
04:52:38.150 --> 04:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:49.330 --> 04:52:49.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:51.708 --> 04:52:51.718 align:start position:0%
and then thank you chair and Ladd by
 
04:52:53.030 --> 04:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
sharing cordelli and members of the
 
04:52:54.890 --> 04:52:54.900 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Greg Gonzalez and
 
04:52:56.690 --> 04:52:56.700 align:start position:0%
I'm a legislative Council for the
 
04:52:58.190 --> 04:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
foundation for individual rights and
 
04:53:01.010 --> 04:53:01.020 align:start position:0%
expression also known as fire fire is a
 
04:53:02.948 --> 04:53:02.958 align:start position:0%
non-partisan non-profit organization
 
04:53:05.150 --> 04:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
dedicated to protecting free speech and
 
04:53:07.128 --> 04:53:07.138 align:start position:0%
due process rights of students and
 
04:53:09.288 --> 04:53:09.298 align:start position:0%
faculty at our nation's institutions of
 
04:53:11.750 --> 04:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
higher education throughout its over 20
 
04:53:13.910 --> 04:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
year history buyers depends students and
 
04:53:15.708 --> 04:53:15.718 align:start position:0%
faculty on all parts of the political
 
04:53:18.110 --> 04:53:18.120 align:start position:0%
Spectrum we have also advocated for
 
04:53:20.270 --> 04:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
campus free speech legislation in state
 
04:53:22.430 --> 04:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
houses across the country
 
04:53:25.490 --> 04:53:25.500 align:start position:0%
I'm here I'm here in support of HB 516
 
04:53:27.650 --> 04:53:27.660 align:start position:0%
this bill guarantees crucial First
 
04:53:29.448 --> 04:53:29.458 align:start position:0%
Amendment protections at New Hampshire's
 
04:53:31.670 --> 04:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
institutions of higher education
 
04:53:34.128 --> 04:53:34.138 align:start position:0%
first the bill would designate outdoor
 
04:53:37.250 --> 04:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
areas of Campus as public forums this
 
04:53:39.110 --> 04:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
would effectively ban so-called Free
 
04:53:41.330 --> 04:53:41.340 align:start position:0%
Speech zones these are often small
 
04:53:43.190 --> 04:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
remote areas that impermissibly
 
04:53:45.470 --> 04:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
quarantine expressive activity to
 
04:53:47.930 --> 04:53:47.940 align:start position:0%
isolate corners of Campus
 
04:53:50.390 --> 04:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
over 20 states have already enacted laws
 
04:53:53.090 --> 04:53:53.100 align:start position:0%
to ban so-called Free Speech zones
 
04:53:55.788 --> 04:53:55.798 align:start position:0%
further the bill helpfully and carefully
 
04:53:58.250 --> 04:53:58.260 align:start position:0%
defines a line between constitutionally
 
04:54:00.410 --> 04:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
protected protests and unprotected
 
04:54:02.410 --> 04:54:02.420 align:start position:0%
heckler's vetoes
 
04:54:05.090 --> 04:54:05.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's public institutions of
 
04:54:06.410 --> 04:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
higher education have maintained
 
04:54:08.570 --> 04:54:08.580 align:start position:0%
policies in the past that have severely
 
04:54:11.030 --> 04:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
eliminated student speech rights for
 
04:54:12.590 --> 04:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
instance the University of New Hampshire
 
04:54:15.530 --> 04:54:15.540 align:start position:0%
had a policy in the past that requires
 
04:54:17.570 --> 04:54:17.580 align:start position:0%
two organizations to get their fire
 
04:54:19.850 --> 04:54:19.860 align:start position:0%
their flyers and pamphlets they sought
 
04:54:21.948 --> 04:54:21.958 align:start position:0%
to distribute pre-approved by the campus
 
04:54:23.990 --> 04:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
police chief that blatantly
 
04:54:25.910 --> 04:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional policy was on the books
 
04:54:28.368 --> 04:54:28.378 align:start position:0%
for some time thankfully after working
 
04:54:31.788 --> 04:54:31.798 align:start position:0%
with fire to revise such policies the
 
04:54:33.230 --> 04:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire now receives
 
04:54:35.750 --> 04:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
fire fires highest green light speech
 
04:54:38.150 --> 04:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
code rating me it has no speech codes
 
04:54:40.250 --> 04:54:40.260 align:start position:0%
that seriously imperil Free Speech
 
04:54:43.550 --> 04:54:43.560 align:start position:0%
rights I'm also happy to note that UNH
 
04:54:47.170 --> 04:54:47.180 align:start position:0%
ranked 16th of 203 colleges and fires
 
04:54:50.530 --> 04:54:50.540 align:start position:0%
2022 called free free speech rankings
 
04:54:53.510 --> 04:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
now is the time to statutorily lock in
 
04:54:56.690 --> 04:54:56.700 align:start position:0%
the speech protective policies
 
04:54:58.670 --> 04:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
the bill also attempts to protect
 
04:55:00.470 --> 04:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
students from over broad harassment
 
04:55:02.810 --> 04:55:02.820 align:start position:0%
codes which are the most common forms of
 
04:55:05.390 --> 04:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
speech restriction on college campuses
 
04:55:07.070 --> 04:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
Bill does this by adopting the speech

the administration agreed
 
04:59:19.128 --> 04:59:19.138 align:start position:0%
and may direct the SBA to recognize CLS
 
04:59:20.990 --> 04:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
which it did
 
04:59:22.670 --> 04:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
but CLS remains concerned that the
 
04:59:24.830 --> 04:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
Student Chapter May face similar tax
 
04:59:26.330 --> 04:59:26.340 align:start position:0%
next fall

when it reapplies for recognition
 
04:59:31.788 --> 04:59:31.798 align:start position:0%
if this bill with a law the Student

Chapter would not have to worry well
 
04:59:34.910 --> 04:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
I'll be clearer
 
04:59:36.948 --> 04:59:36.958 align:start position:0%
the regulation process shorter and less
 
04:59:40.250 --> 04:59:40.260 align:start position:0%
dramatic of course common sense and
 
04:59:41.868 --> 04:59:41.878 align:start position:0%
basic religious freedom
 
04:59:44.570 --> 04:59:44.580 align:start position:0%
for a religious Association to expect
 
04:59:46.550 --> 04:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
its leaders to agree with the
 
04:59:49.250 --> 04:59:49.260 align:start position:0%
association's religious beliefs
 
04:59:50.930 --> 04:59:50.940 align:start position:0%
it should be common ground that
 
04:59:52.788 --> 04:59:52.798 align:start position:0%
government officials including College
 
04:59:55.128 --> 04:59:55.138 align:start position:0%
administrators should not interfere with
 
04:59:57.230 --> 04:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
their religious beliefs practices
 
04:59:59.990 --> 05:00:00.000 align:start position:0%

religious associations
 
05:00:03.350 --> 05:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
that's basic separation of church and
 
05:00:03.360 --> 05:00:05.150 align:start position:0%
that's basic separation of church and
state

05:00:05.150 --> 05:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:00:06.650 --> 05:00:06.660 align:start position:0%
furthermore please note that the bill
 
05:00:09.050 --> 05:00:09.060 align:start position:0%
allows public colleges to adopt whatever
 
05:00:10.788 --> 05:00:10.798 align:start position:0%
policy they wish
 
05:00:13.430 --> 05:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
it only requires that their policies be
 
05:00:14.868 --> 05:00:14.878 align:start position:0%
applied in a way
 
05:00:16.368 --> 05:00:16.378 align:start position:0%
that ensures that religious student
 
05:00:18.470 --> 05:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
groups are not excluded from campus
 
05:00:21.350 --> 05:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
because their speech including a
 
05:00:22.970 --> 05:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
requirement their leaders should agree
 
05:00:25.010 --> 05:00:25.020 align:start position:0%
with their beliefs
 
05:00:27.650 --> 05:00:27.660 align:start position:0%
this bill also conserves scarce taxpayer
 
05:00:29.750 --> 05:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
dollars by preventing costly litigation
 
05:00:31.910 --> 05:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
as mentioned earlier the uncertainty in
 
05:00:33.708 --> 05:00:33.718 align:start position:0%
the law there's an example here from the
 
05:00:35.750 --> 05:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
University of Iowa what does it pay a
 
05:00:37.310 --> 05:00:37.320 align:start position:0%
half million dollars attorney's fees
 
05:00:40.070 --> 05:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
after a dispute in this area
 
05:00:41.930 --> 05:00:41.940 align:start position:0%
in the fellow Court of PLS found that
 
05:00:43.368 --> 05:00:43.378 align:start position:0%
University officials could be personally
 
05:00:46.250 --> 05:00:46.260 align:start position:0%
liable to students for damages as well
 
05:00:48.530 --> 05:00:48.540 align:start position:0%
so this bill protects College
 
05:00:50.570 --> 05:00:50.580 align:start position:0%
administrators as well as college
 
05:00:50.580 --> 05:00:51.590 align:start position:0%

05:00:53.570 --> 05:00:53.580 align:start position:0%
finally by passing this bill
 
05:00:55.070 --> 05:00:55.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire joined the experiment list
 
05:00:57.530 --> 05:00:57.540 align:start position:0%

case law decided under them these
 
05:02:11.390 --> 05:02:11.400 align:start position:0%

instance the UNH policy and outside

speakers which states that the basis
 
05:02:19.310 --> 05:02:19.320 align:start position:0%
underlying the policy is quote the Bill
 
05:02:20.330 --> 05:02:20.340 align:start position:0%
of Rights in the United States
 
05:02:22.430 --> 05:02:22.440 align:start position:0%

05:02:29.030 --> 05:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
I was just mentioned by an earlier uh
 
05:02:31.190 --> 05:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
commenter each of our institutions has
 
05:02:32.868 --> 05:02:32.878 align:start position:0%
earned a green light rating from the
 
05:02:34.310 --> 05:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
foundation for individual rights and
 
05:02:36.770 --> 05:02:36.780 align:start position:0%
education for free speech policies that
 
05:02:38.150 --> 05:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
appropriately balance the educational
 
05:02:40.070 --> 05:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
missions of our institutions with
 
05:02:41.448 --> 05:02:41.458 align:start position:0%
opportunities for the free and robust
 
05:02:45.230 --> 05:02:45.240 align:start position:0%
exchange of ideas of the 647 colleges
 
05:02:47.510 --> 05:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
and universities given a green yellow
 
05:02:49.910 --> 05:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
red or blue light reading by fire this
 
05:02:52.970 --> 05:02:52.980 align:start position:0%
year only 60 approximately one in ten
 
05:02:55.190 --> 05:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
were awarded a green light three of
 
05:02:57.050 --> 05:02:57.060 align:start position:0%
those institutions were UNH Durham
 
05:02:59.510 --> 05:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
Plymouth State and King state
 
05:03:01.970 --> 05:03:01.980 align:start position:0%
this demonstrates that HB 516 is not
 
05:03:03.410 --> 05:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
necessary because existing campus
 
05:03:05.150 --> 05:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
policies and practices already comply
 
05:03:07.070 --> 05:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
with the extensive body of fate of
 
05:03:08.628 --> 05:03:08.638 align:start position:0%
federal and state constitutional law on
 
05:03:10.910 --> 05:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
these issues enacting a new state law is
 
05:03:12.830 --> 05:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
likely to cause confusion and ambiguity
 
05:03:15.530 --> 05:03:15.540 align:start position:0%
and I'll depart from my prepared remarks
 
05:03:17.390 --> 05:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
here just to note I think we've already
 
05:03:19.730 --> 05:03:19.740 align:start position:0%
seen here today simple that confusion
 
05:03:22.070 --> 05:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
ambiguity about to the extent this bill
 
05:03:25.310 --> 05:03:25.320 align:start position:0%
would not apply to indoor events or
 
05:03:28.368 --> 05:03:28.378 align:start position:0%
classroom instruction or maybe most
 
05:03:29.750 --> 05:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
importantly how wood or would not change
 
05:03:32.090 --> 05:03:32.100 align:start position:0%
our ability to handle disruption caused
 
05:03:34.368 --> 05:03:34.378 align:start position:0%
by folks from outside our community and
 
05:03:36.650 --> 05:03:36.660 align:start position:0%
however much confusion or ambiguity
 
05:03:37.788 --> 05:03:37.798 align:start position:0%
you're looking for angles there aren't
 
05:03:39.288 --> 05:03:39.298 align:start position:0%
here I promise you that the plaintiff's
 
05:03:40.670 --> 05:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
bar is going to be even better at
 
05:03:42.350 --> 05:03:42.360 align:start position:0%
finding them
 
05:03:44.448 --> 05:03:44.458 align:start position:0%
um uh this new law would would replace
 
05:03:47.390 --> 05:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
that existing well-developed body of law
 
05:03:48.830 --> 05:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
which is rooted directly in the First
 
05:03:50.510 --> 05:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment with new language whose
 
05:03:51.708 --> 05:03:51.718 align:start position:0%
requirements and limits cannot be no
 
05:03:53.930 --> 05:03:53.940 align:start position:0%
uncertainty the ambiguity invariably
 
05:03:55.490 --> 05:03:55.500 align:start position:0%
leads to lawsuits and the waste of The
 
05:03:56.930 --> 05:03:56.940 align:start position:0%
Limited public resources appropriated
 
05:03:59.208 --> 05:03:59.218 align:start position:0%
for the provision of higher education in
 
05:04:00.708 --> 05:04:00.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
05:04:02.270 --> 05:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
permitting processes for outdoor
 
05:04:03.590 --> 05:04:03.600 align:start position:0%

05:04:05.750 --> 05:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
establish reasonable time place and Mana
 
05:04:07.250 --> 05:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
restrictions and are administered in a
 
05:04:09.230 --> 05:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint neutral way the processes work
 
05:04:10.788 --> 05:04:10.798 align:start position:0%
well and are responsive to the neat
 
05:04:12.050 --> 05:04:12.060 align:start position:0%
challenges of ensuring safety on each
 
05:04:14.208 --> 05:04:14.218 align:start position:0%
campus the historical lack of legal
 
05:04:15.350 --> 05:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
challenges to these outdoor event
 
05:04:17.030 --> 05:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
policies shows that the existing
 
05:04:18.650 --> 05:04:18.660 align:start position:0%
procedures work and are flexible enough
 
05:04:20.270 --> 05:04:20.280 align:start position:0%
to address the Myriad of events that
 
05:04:22.910 --> 05:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
occur on campuses as an example a UNH
 
05:04:24.770 --> 05:04:24.780 align:start position:0%
current policies allow for spontaneous
 
05:04:26.208 --> 05:04:26.218 align:start position:0%
student Gatherings of less than 25
 
05:04:28.190 --> 05:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
people without a permit provided the
 
05:04:30.230 --> 05:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
assembly event or assembly does not
 
05:04:32.150 --> 05:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
disrupt normal operations students are
 
05:04:33.410 --> 05:04:33.420 align:start position:0%
also allowed to distribute literature
 
05:04:34.970 --> 05:04:34.980 align:start position:0%
and or solicit contributions on an
 
05:04:37.010 --> 05:04:37.020 align:start position:0%
individual basis at any time without a
 
05:04:39.288 --> 05:04:39.298 align:start position:0%
permit the permitting process for larger
 
05:04:40.910 --> 05:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
events ensures that Public Safety and
 
05:04:42.770 --> 05:04:42.780 align:start position:0%
Facilities Management considerations can
 
05:04:44.750 --> 05:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
be addressed in advance and individuals
 
05:04:46.430 --> 05:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
or organizations can be held accountable
 
05:04:47.868 --> 05:04:47.878 align:start position:0%
for things like property damage and
 
05:04:50.090 --> 05:04:50.100 align:start position:0%
cleanup of litter the applications are
 
05:04:51.890 --> 05:04:51.900 align:start position:0%
evaluated based on specified criteria
 
05:04:53.270 --> 05:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
that are Viewpoint neutral and provide
 
05:04:55.310 --> 05:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
an appeal processing even of a denial
 
05:04:57.650 --> 05:04:57.660 align:start position:0%
HP 516 would impose additional financial
 
05:04:59.390 --> 05:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
and administrative burdens on U.S and
 
05:05:01.010 --> 05:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
age institutions particularly by
 
05:05:02.330 --> 05:05:02.340 align:start position:0%
increasing the need for campus safety
 
05:05:04.070 --> 05:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
officers at a time when every effort is
 
05:05:05.690 --> 05:05:05.700 align:start position:0%
being made to reduce overhead and costs
 
05:05:07.550 --> 05:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
in order to keep tuition down
 
05:05:10.128 --> 05:05:10.138 align:start position:0%
in addition HP 516 if passed will
 
05:05:11.448 --> 05:05:11.458 align:start position:0%
provide plaintiffs in their lawyers
 
05:05:13.550 --> 05:05:13.560 align:start position:0%
incentives in the form of both potential
 
05:05:15.050 --> 05:05:15.060 align:start position:0%
Financial penalties and the province of
 
05:05:17.570 --> 05:05:17.580 align:start position:0%
attorney's fees for suing us U.S NH
 
05:05:19.430 --> 05:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
institutions this would increase the
 
05:05:21.170 --> 05:05:21.180 align:start position:0%
costs incurred by U.S Nation defending
 
05:05:22.910 --> 05:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
litigation even though our policies are
 
05:05:24.170 --> 05:05:24.180 align:start position:0%
in full compliance with the First
 
05:05:26.208 --> 05:05:26.218 align:start position:0%
Amendment for these reasons U.S Nation
 
05:05:28.010 --> 05:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
respectfully urges the committee to vote
 
05:05:31.010 --> 05:05:31.020 align:start position:0%
HP 516 in Expedia to legislate thank you
 
05:05:32.390 --> 05:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to offer this
 
05:05:33.770 --> 05:05:33.780 align:start position:0%
testimony and I'm happy to answer any
 
05:05:35.448 --> 05:05:35.458 align:start position:0%
questions if folks happen thank you very
 
05:05:37.010 --> 05:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
much are the questions of the University
 
05:05:40.368 --> 05:05:40.378 align:start position:0%
system representative Myler thank you Mr
 
05:05:42.110 --> 05:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for being here I
 
05:05:43.690 --> 05:05:43.700 align:start position:0%
have two questions
 
05:05:46.190 --> 05:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
in the previous those testimony there
 
05:05:47.570 --> 05:05:47.580 align:start position:0%
was an indication that there was a
 
05:05:49.610 --> 05:05:49.620 align:start position:0%
problem at the UNH law
 
05:05:52.070 --> 05:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh with the Christian Community has that
 
05:05:55.070 --> 05:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
question one has that been resolved yes
 
05:05:56.690 --> 05:05:56.700 align:start position:0%
as I believe the speaker mentioned the
 
05:05:58.788 --> 05:05:58.798 align:start position:0%
administration noted the issue and the
 
05:06:01.490 --> 05:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
COS has been recognized secondly uh
 
05:06:04.250 --> 05:06:04.260 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn talked about a dog
 
05:06:04.260 --> 05:06:05.330 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn talked about a dog
pound

05:06:05.330 --> 05:06:05.340 align:start position:0%
pound
 
05:06:08.510 --> 05:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
uh for free speech zones do you have a
 
05:06:11.690 --> 05:06:11.700 align:start position:0%
dog pound at uh UNH and if so where is
 
05:06:14.150 --> 05:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
it uh not to my knowledge representative
 
05:06:17.330 --> 05:06:17.340 align:start position:0%
so you you don't have a designated place
 
05:06:19.788 --> 05:06:19.798 align:start position:0%
no so we don't have a dog pound no so
 
05:06:22.610 --> 05:06:22.620 align:start position:0%
UNH um the institutions differ slightly
 
05:06:23.570 --> 05:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
on this
 
05:06:26.690 --> 05:06:26.700 align:start position:0%
um the Campus Community is allowed uh as
 
05:06:28.550 --> 05:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
I mentioned here for UNH small
 
05:06:30.350 --> 05:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
Gatherings don't require any permit can
 
05:06:31.550 --> 05:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
take place essentially any place on
 
05:06:34.368 --> 05:06:34.378 align:start position:0%
campus already some of the campuses go
 
05:06:36.410 --> 05:06:36.420 align:start position:0%
above and beyond for people outside the
 
05:06:37.970 --> 05:06:37.980 align:start position:0%
community and establish areas where
 
05:06:39.350 --> 05:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
people from outside the community can
 
05:06:41.570 --> 05:06:41.580 align:start position:0%
cook and uh come and speak on manageable
 
05:06:43.550 --> 05:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
public importance they are centrally
 
05:06:45.230 --> 05:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
located at Keene State it's on Oya Hill
 
05:06:46.430 --> 05:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
which is the highest point on campus
 
05:06:48.470 --> 05:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
there are multiple such places at
 
05:06:49.910 --> 05:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
Plymouth State
 
05:06:51.530 --> 05:06:51.540 align:start position:0%
um and again so that that those are
 
05:06:53.090 --> 05:06:53.100 align:start position:0%
going above they all roll up what we're
 
05:06:54.470 --> 05:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
required to do in terms of allowing
 
05:06:56.090 --> 05:06:56.100 align:start position:0%
folks from outside the community to come
 
05:06:59.270 --> 05:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
and and speak without prior permitting
 
05:07:01.128 --> 05:07:01.138 align:start position:0%
thank you just one follow-up please yes
 
05:07:03.770 --> 05:07:03.780 align:start position:0%
uh has the university system had any
 
05:07:06.470 --> 05:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
complaints or legal issues brought
 
05:07:08.510 --> 05:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
before them as it relates to free speech
 
05:07:10.010 --> 05:07:10.020 align:start position:0%
in the last two years
 
05:07:12.310 --> 05:07:12.320 align:start position:0%
not to my knowledge thank you very much
 
05:07:15.288 --> 05:07:15.298 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Belcher
 
05:07:17.030 --> 05:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:07:18.770 --> 05:07:18.780 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:07:20.150 --> 05:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
um I see here and you've pointed to the
 
05:07:21.948 --> 05:07:21.958 align:start position:0%
fact that your institutions have
 
05:07:24.830 --> 05:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
improved to earning a green light rating
 
05:07:27.070 --> 05:07:27.080 align:start position:0%
from fire and certainly as commendable
 
05:07:30.890 --> 05:07:30.900 align:start position:0%
but in the time that that has improved
 
05:07:34.128 --> 05:07:34.138 align:start position:0%
there has not been to my belief a
 
05:07:36.110 --> 05:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
presidential election cycle
 
05:07:38.868 --> 05:07:38.878 align:start position:0%
impressed in past Cycles
 
05:07:42.050 --> 05:07:42.060 align:start position:0%
um such as the last one I had looked
 
05:07:44.868 --> 05:07:44.878 align:start position:0%
forward to hearing from a conservative
 
05:07:47.470 --> 05:07:47.480 align:start position:0%
commentator by the name of Dave Reuben
 
05:07:51.110 --> 05:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
at one of these um events
 
05:07:53.930 --> 05:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
and instead of hearing from him uh
 
05:07:55.868 --> 05:07:55.878 align:start position:0%
students were allowed to shout him down
 
05:07:58.910 --> 05:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
despite security presence the security
 
05:08:00.590 --> 05:08:00.600 align:start position:0%
was ordered not to do anything about
 
05:08:02.868 --> 05:08:02.878 align:start position:0%
this and the event wound up not being
 
05:08:05.868 --> 05:08:05.878 align:start position:0%
able to go forward so I'd ask without
 
05:08:08.270 --> 05:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
such something such as this on the books
 
05:08:11.090 --> 05:08:11.100 align:start position:0%
what assurances can we have that in the
 
05:08:13.190 --> 05:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
next presidential election cycle
 
05:08:16.788 --> 05:08:16.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:19.610 --> 05:08:19.620 align:start position:0%
so I I think the first my first response
 
05:08:21.650 --> 05:08:21.660 align:start position:0%
would be as noted earlier it's not
 
05:08:24.288 --> 05:08:24.298 align:start position:0%
entirely clear what effect this bill
 
05:08:27.470 --> 05:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
would have on an indoor event like such
 
05:08:29.330 --> 05:08:29.340 align:start position:0%
as the one I I think you're describing I
 
05:08:30.770 --> 05:08:30.780 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know what those indoors or
 
05:08:32.090 --> 05:08:32.100 align:start position:0%
Outdoors but I'm getting the sense that
 
05:08:34.550 --> 05:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
it was indoors so the answer very
 
05:08:36.230 --> 05:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
specifically to this bill is I don't
 
05:08:37.788 --> 05:08:37.798 align:start position:0%
know and you'll hear this a lot in my
 
05:08:39.770 --> 05:08:39.780 align:start position:0%
testimony is I'm not sure in a lot of
 
05:08:41.810 --> 05:08:41.820 align:start position:0%
instances what the effect of the passage
 
05:08:43.128 --> 05:08:43.138 align:start position:0%
of this bill would be around operations
 
05:08:45.050 --> 05:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
and that's the source of a lot of our
 
05:08:45.060 --> 05:08:47.090 align:start position:0%
and that's the source of a lot of our
concerns

05:08:47.090 --> 05:08:47.100 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
05:08:49.910 --> 05:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions represent
 
05:08:49.920 --> 05:08:51.350 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions represent
luno

05:08:51.350 --> 05:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
luno
 
05:08:53.570 --> 05:08:53.580 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr Sharon and thank
 
05:08:56.330 --> 05:08:56.340 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr pimental for joining us
 
05:08:58.190 --> 05:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
this afternoon could you talk a little
 
05:08:59.330 --> 05:08:59.340 align:start position:0%
bit about
 
05:09:01.970 --> 05:09:01.980 align:start position:0%
um UNH unh's policies or maybe
 
05:09:05.750 --> 05:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
University Systems policies as it um as
 
05:09:09.470 --> 05:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
it relates to um to uh events that might
 
05:09:11.868 --> 05:09:11.878 align:start position:0%
be designed to intimidate or disrespect
 
05:09:15.550 --> 05:09:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:19.910 --> 05:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
so uh each of our campuses has cancer
 
05:09:22.788 --> 05:09:22.798 align:start position:0%
discrimination policies the extent to
 
05:09:25.310 --> 05:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
which a given event does or does not
 
05:09:27.708 --> 05:09:27.718 align:start position:0%
violate those policies is very fact
 
05:09:29.570 --> 05:09:29.580 align:start position:0%
specific and so it's difficult to speak
 
05:09:31.610 --> 05:09:31.620 align:start position:0%
in the abstract
 
05:09:34.250 --> 05:09:34.260 align:start position:0%
um I think one of the the the real
 
05:09:36.230 --> 05:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
foremost challenge is facing not just us
 
05:09:38.510 --> 05:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
and H but all higher ed institutions
 
05:09:41.390 --> 05:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
right now certainly public ones
 
05:09:43.448 --> 05:09:43.458 align:start position:0%
um is the push and pull between
 
05:09:46.730 --> 05:09:46.740 align:start position:0%
respecting the need for free speech and
 
05:09:50.090 --> 05:09:50.100 align:start position:0%
the value of free speech and trying to
 
05:09:52.730 --> 05:09:52.740 align:start position:0%
foster a campus client climate where
 
05:09:55.670 --> 05:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
everyone feels comfortable volunteering
 
05:09:58.190 --> 05:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
their opinion and I don't know that any
 
05:09:59.990 --> 05:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
institution has gotten it exactly right
 
05:10:00.000 --> 05:10:01.208 align:start position:0%
institution has gotten it exactly right
yet

05:10:01.208 --> 05:10:01.218 align:start position:0%
yet
 
05:10:04.250 --> 05:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
we are pleased with the way that we are
 
05:10:07.250 --> 05:10:07.260 align:start position:0%
striking that balance right now and any
 
05:10:09.470 --> 05:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
additional change that might come
 
05:10:11.690 --> 05:10:11.700 align:start position:0%
legislatively that could affect that
 
05:10:14.448 --> 05:10:14.458 align:start position:0%
balance is we find it difficult to
 
05:10:15.708 --> 05:10:15.718 align:start position:0%
predict the effect that would have on
 
05:10:17.170 --> 05:10:17.180 align:start position:0%
our campuses
 
05:10:21.470 --> 05:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair and um uh is
 
05:10:23.448 --> 05:10:23.458 align:start position:0%
there a potential conflict I guess
 
05:10:23.458 --> 05:10:24.708 align:start position:0%
there a potential conflict I guess
between

05:10:24.708 --> 05:10:24.718 align:start position:0%
between
 
05:10:27.530 --> 05:10:27.540 align:start position:0%
um uh what you have as those current
 
05:10:30.830 --> 05:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
policies uh those current um uh
 
05:10:32.690 --> 05:10:32.700 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination non-discrimination
 
05:10:36.350 --> 05:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
policies and um and maybe what the uh
 
05:10:38.330 --> 05:10:38.340 align:start position:0%
what some of the what what a consequence
 
05:10:40.670 --> 05:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
of some of the provisions in 5 16 I
 
05:10:42.110 --> 05:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
think we would have to go back
 
05:10:43.850 --> 05:10:43.860 align:start position:0%
institution by institution and review
 
05:10:45.948 --> 05:10:45.958 align:start position:0%
each policy against it in the event that
 
05:10:47.868 --> 05:10:47.878 align:start position:0%
this or something like it passed um
 
05:10:50.750 --> 05:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
again I I apologize for Circle back to
 
05:10:52.250 --> 05:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
this part of the answer is I just don't
 
05:10:54.288 --> 05:10:54.298 align:start position:0%
know because as was noted uh earlier in
 
05:10:56.410 --> 05:10:56.420 align:start position:0%
response to representative's question
 
05:10:58.190 --> 05:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
ultimately a lot of these questions
 
05:10:59.930 --> 05:10:59.940 align:start position:0%
would have to be answered by a court as
 
05:11:01.850 --> 05:11:01.860 align:start position:0%
to what sort of conduct Rose to the
 
05:11:04.070 --> 05:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
level of harassment and uh the
 
05:11:05.628 --> 05:11:05.638 align:start position:0%
university system would be forced to pay
 
05:11:07.190 --> 05:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
for the privilege of finding out in
 
05:11:10.670 --> 05:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
litigation okay thank you uh I do have a
 
05:11:10.680 --> 05:11:11.510 align:start position:0%
litigation okay thank you uh I do have a
question

05:11:11.510 --> 05:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:11:11.520 --> 05:11:12.590 align:start position:0%
question
um

05:11:12.590 --> 05:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:15.350 --> 05:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
this this bill carries a fiscal note or
 
05:11:18.170 --> 05:11:18.180 align:start position:0%
at least uh there's uh several Pages uh
 
05:11:20.990 --> 05:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with that and according to the
 
05:11:22.250 --> 05:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
community college system New Hampshire
 
05:11:23.628 --> 05:11:23.638 align:start position:0%
and the university system of New
 
05:11:26.050 --> 05:11:26.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you're unable to determine
 
05:11:28.930 --> 05:11:28.940 align:start position:0%
costs that might be associated with this
 
05:11:31.490 --> 05:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
since this has been filed has to been
 
05:11:35.448 --> 05:11:35.458 align:start position:0%
any uh more work done on this to try to
 
05:11:38.090 --> 05:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
determine what the cost might be
 
05:11:39.890 --> 05:11:39.900 align:start position:0%
there has been more work done but we
 
05:11:41.150 --> 05:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
aren't really any closer to having
 
05:11:44.390 --> 05:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
something we could present to the
 
05:11:46.190 --> 05:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
committee uh in sort of good faith
 
05:11:48.530 --> 05:11:48.540 align:start position:0%
because a lot of it will depend on the
 
05:11:50.590 --> 05:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
extent to which particularly outside
 
05:11:53.628 --> 05:11:53.638 align:start position:0%
folks come on to our campuses and have
 
05:11:56.570 --> 05:11:56.580 align:start position:0%
large uh demonstrations that will
 
05:11:58.190 --> 05:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
require additional campus safety
 
05:12:00.650 --> 05:12:00.660 align:start position:0%
response may require additional cleanup
 
05:12:03.650 --> 05:12:03.660 align:start position:0%
costs and that sort of thing so it's at
 
05:12:05.150 --> 05:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
the end of the day we are fully in
 
05:12:06.590 --> 05:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
control of what the cost would be
 
05:12:08.330 --> 05:12:08.340 align:start position:0%
because we are it would be responding to
 
05:12:10.368 --> 05:12:10.378 align:start position:0%
outside forces on that
 
05:12:13.368 --> 05:12:13.378 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
05:12:16.030 --> 05:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
yes represent woodcock
 
05:12:18.470 --> 05:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
good afternoon and thank everything my
 
05:12:20.150 --> 05:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
question uh you referred to
 
05:12:21.590 --> 05:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative miles question who's
 
05:12:23.030 --> 05:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
talking about the last two years of the
 
05:12:24.948 --> 05:12:24.958 align:start position:0%
history at the campus
 
05:12:27.530 --> 05:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
um and the green lights East uh my
 
05:12:29.810 --> 05:12:29.820 align:start position:0%
question is two parts uh this particular
 
05:12:31.850 --> 05:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation or proposed
 
05:12:33.770 --> 05:12:33.780 align:start position:0%
legislation deals with cannabis
 
05:12:36.350 --> 05:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
activities outside
 
05:12:38.270 --> 05:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
um my question to you then is one and
 
05:12:39.590 --> 05:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure the answer I wouldn't ask
 
05:12:41.810 --> 05:12:41.820 align:start position:0%
it I'll try to set you up here the green
 
05:12:44.270 --> 05:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
light involved inside and outside
 
05:12:46.730 --> 05:12:46.740 align:start position:0%
evaluations of facilities which is
 
05:12:50.390 --> 05:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
outside it's question one and okay the
 
05:12:52.430 --> 05:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
chairman shuts me off uh has there been
 
05:12:55.850 --> 05:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
any other any issues inside as relative
 
05:12:58.788 --> 05:12:58.798 align:start position:0%
to public free speech so so my
 
05:13:00.170 --> 05:13:00.180 align:start position:0%
understanding of the Green Light reading
 
05:13:02.990 --> 05:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
and if I misrepresent then I can maybe
 
05:13:04.368 --> 05:13:04.378 align:start position:0%
the fire deal more contact me on the
 
05:13:07.010 --> 05:13:07.020 align:start position:0%
back is that it is uh an overall rating
 
05:13:09.050 --> 05:13:09.060 align:start position:0%
of free speed of policies touching free
 
05:13:11.030 --> 05:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
space issues across different areas okay
 
05:13:13.550 --> 05:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
so one would be is your anti-harassment
 
05:13:15.288 --> 05:13:15.298 align:start position:0%
policy sufficiently specifically limited
 
05:13:18.530 --> 05:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
one would be what is your outside policy
 
05:13:20.208 --> 05:13:20.218 align:start position:0%
the outside speakers what is your policy
 
05:13:22.670 --> 05:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
on outside events and you average all
 
05:13:24.050 --> 05:13:24.060 align:start position:0%
those together and they generate a
 
05:13:25.970 --> 05:13:25.980 align:start position:0%
rating thank you and the second part
 
05:13:27.288 --> 05:13:27.298 align:start position:0%
about I mean
 
05:13:29.570 --> 05:13:29.580 align:start position:0%
quickly thank you sir the second part
 
05:13:32.270 --> 05:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
about has there been any incidents uh
 
05:13:33.830 --> 05:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
and the University Systems of the three
 
05:13:36.350 --> 05:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
there uh and inside the last two years
 
05:13:38.330 --> 05:13:38.340 align:start position:0%
of problems I'm not aware of anything
 
05:13:40.070 --> 05:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
that's reason the level of a lawsuit
 
05:13:41.930 --> 05:13:41.940 align:start position:0%
certainly I can't I there's active
 
05:13:43.128 --> 05:13:43.138 align:start position:0%
discussion about these issues all the
 
05:13:44.448 --> 05:13:44.458 align:start position:0%
time on campus so I hesitate to say
 
05:13:46.010 --> 05:13:46.020 align:start position:0%
there's never been a dispute but there's
 
05:13:47.990 --> 05:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
not been a filing that I'm aware of okay
 
05:13:49.368 --> 05:13:49.378 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thanks chairman
 
05:13:51.890 --> 05:13:51.900 align:start position:0%
you're welcome represent Belcher thank
 
05:13:53.090 --> 05:13:53.100 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I just wanted to follow
 
05:13:54.770 --> 05:13:54.780 align:start position:0%
up in your question as far as uh
 
05:13:56.690 --> 05:13:56.700 align:start position:0%
expenses are concerned with the
 
05:13:58.550 --> 05:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
insurance free speech access and whatnot
 
05:14:01.788 --> 05:14:01.798 align:start position:0%
and to that effect I wanted to ask do
 
05:14:03.110 --> 05:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
you know what the current state is of
 
05:14:04.670 --> 05:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
the endowment of the University of New
 
05:14:04.680 --> 05:14:05.510 align:start position:0%
the endowment of the University of New
Hampshire

05:14:05.510 --> 05:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:14:07.550 --> 05:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
yeah embarrassingly had to say that I
 
05:14:10.850 --> 05:14:10.860 align:start position:0%
don't that that's that's uh Beyond where
 
05:14:13.190 --> 05:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
we're going with this bill we can get
 
05:14:14.990 --> 05:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
that figure
 
05:14:15.000 --> 05:14:15.770 align:start position:0%
that figure
um

05:14:15.770 --> 05:14:15.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:18.050 --> 05:14:18.060 align:start position:0%
I'm a trustee of the University system I
 
05:14:19.788 --> 05:14:19.798 align:start position:0%
can get that figure for you but I don't
 
05:14:21.410 --> 05:14:21.420 align:start position:0%
see how it relates necessarily to this
 
05:14:25.190 --> 05:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
bill well just in terms of cost oh
 
05:14:27.470 --> 05:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
I I will say that the largest source of
 
05:14:30.410 --> 05:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
funding for the University system is the
 
05:14:33.948 --> 05:14:33.958 align:start position:0%
tuition dollars of our students yeah
 
05:14:35.810 --> 05:14:35.820 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
05:14:37.730 --> 05:14:37.740 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:14:39.948 --> 05:14:39.958 align:start position:0%
I'd like to invite Brian
 
05:14:42.350 --> 05:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
muh you
 
05:14:49.190 --> 05:14:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:50.930 --> 05:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me my name is uh
 
05:14:52.788 --> 05:14:52.798 align:start position:0%
Brian mu I grew up in New Hampshire in
 
05:14:54.830 --> 05:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
Littleton New Hampshire uh went to the
 
05:14:56.690 --> 05:14:56.700 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire and married
 
05:14:58.430 --> 05:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
a girl from New Hampshire and everyone
 
05:15:00.170 --> 05:15:00.180 align:start position:0%
knew that we would wind up back in New
 
05:15:01.550 --> 05:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire before I wound up back in
 
05:15:01.560 --> 05:15:03.010 align:start position:0%
Hampshire before I wound up back in
Pennsylvania

05:15:03.010 --> 05:15:03.020 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania
 
05:15:06.470 --> 05:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
but I'm back now uh and I'm a campus
 
05:15:07.850 --> 05:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
staff minister with intervarsity
 
05:15:09.288 --> 05:15:09.298 align:start position:0%
Christian fellowship at the University
 
05:15:12.288 --> 05:15:12.298 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire uh the section of this
 
05:15:14.628 --> 05:15:14.638 align:start position:0%
bill that particularly applies
 
05:15:17.448 --> 05:15:17.458 align:start position:0%
um to the students that we work with is
 
05:15:21.530 --> 05:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
188 j3 and as you heard the story of the
 
05:15:23.510 --> 05:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
Christian legal Society
 
05:15:27.410 --> 05:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
um that is also uh a concern for us so
 
05:15:29.448 --> 05:15:29.458 align:start position:0%
one of the things that student religious
 
05:15:32.208 --> 05:15:32.218 align:start position:0%
groups do is they offer a place on
 
05:15:35.628 --> 05:15:35.638 align:start position:0%
campus for people who have that same
 
05:15:37.970 --> 05:15:37.980 align:start position:0%
religious tradition and so it's
 
05:15:39.770 --> 05:15:39.780 align:start position:0%
important that the leaders the student
 
05:15:42.128 --> 05:15:42.138 align:start position:0%
leaders of those organizations
 
05:15:47.868 --> 05:15:47.878 align:start position:0%
share those uh same values as well and
 
05:15:51.170 --> 05:15:51.180 align:start position:0%
so so yeah so so every year we we do go
 
05:15:54.110 --> 05:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
through a re-recognition process and so
 
05:15:55.190 --> 05:15:55.200 align:start position:0%
it is
 
05:15:58.128 --> 05:15:58.138 align:start position:0%
um yeah it's good for our organizations
 
05:16:00.230 --> 05:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
it's good for our students to be able to
 
05:16:03.350 --> 05:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
say yes we know that we can actually
 
05:16:06.830 --> 05:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
have students who are practicing our
 
05:16:09.650 --> 05:16:09.660 align:start position:0%
faith and that's true across any faith
 
05:16:10.550 --> 05:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
so we happen to be a Christian
 
05:16:13.430 --> 05:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
organization but the the same token you
 
05:16:14.448 --> 05:16:14.458 align:start position:0%
know to have
 
05:16:16.730 --> 05:16:16.740 align:start position:0%
um our Muslim student organizations say
 
05:16:19.430 --> 05:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
yes we want you to
 
05:16:22.690 --> 05:16:22.700 align:start position:0%
um to have a you know a Muslim faith
 
05:16:25.910 --> 05:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
Jewish organizations the same kind of
 
05:16:27.890 --> 05:16:27.900 align:start position:0%
thing if you have an atheist a humanist
 
05:16:30.470 --> 05:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh student organization you want them to
 
05:16:32.930 --> 05:16:32.940 align:start position:0%
also share those values as well
 
05:16:34.970 --> 05:16:34.980 align:start position:0%
uh and so
 
05:16:37.010 --> 05:16:37.020 align:start position:0%
um so that becomes our interests and
 
05:16:39.470 --> 05:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
that uh enables us to then serve the
 
05:16:41.208 --> 05:16:41.218 align:start position:0%
campus well we would love it if everyone
 
05:16:43.128 --> 05:16:43.138 align:start position:0%
would be a member
 
05:16:44.868 --> 05:16:44.878 align:start position:0%
um and so we have no membership
 
05:16:44.878 --> 05:16:46.850 align:start position:0%
um and so we have no membership
restrictions

05:16:46.850 --> 05:16:46.860 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
05:16:49.550 --> 05:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
um as uh in our constitution but we do
 
05:16:52.910 --> 05:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh want to see leaders be able to say
 
05:16:57.170 --> 05:16:57.180 align:start position:0%
yes I I subscribe to this
 
05:16:59.448 --> 05:16:59.458 align:start position:0%
um so thank you thank you very much are
 
05:17:00.610 --> 05:17:00.620 align:start position:0%
there questions from the committee
 
05:17:03.230 --> 05:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
representative Myler thank you Mr chair
 
05:17:05.750 --> 05:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
so the you heard the testimony before
 
05:17:08.448 --> 05:17:08.458 align:start position:0%
from the University regarding uh the
 
05:17:11.628 --> 05:17:11.638 align:start position:0%
ability to have 25 uh groups of 25
 
05:17:14.510 --> 05:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
Etc have you had any problems in your
 
05:17:17.390 --> 05:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
faith-based organization in uh being
 
05:17:19.730 --> 05:17:19.740 align:start position:0%
able to participate on campus
 
05:17:22.010 --> 05:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
we have not had any uh problems at the
 
05:17:23.030 --> 05:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
University assistant in New Hampshire
 
05:17:26.810 --> 05:17:26.820 align:start position:0%
now thank you very much rep San Luna
 
05:17:29.570 --> 05:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair do any of the um
 
05:17:31.910 --> 05:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
student religious associations at the
 
05:17:33.230 --> 05:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire receive
 
05:17:35.770 --> 05:17:35.780 align:start position:0%
funding from uh from the University
 
05:17:39.770 --> 05:17:39.780 align:start position:0%
in order to operate yes so um so as a
 
05:17:42.230 --> 05:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
student organization uh there is um
 
05:17:44.990 --> 05:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
equal access to a student organization
 
05:17:45.000 --> 05:17:46.610 align:start position:0%
equal access to a student organization
funding

05:17:46.610 --> 05:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
funding
 
05:17:49.788 --> 05:17:49.798 align:start position:0%
um and that is determined uh by the
 
05:17:52.330 --> 05:17:52.340 align:start position:0%
Student Activities Committee
 
05:17:55.850 --> 05:17:55.860 align:start position:0%
yeah so thank you and are any of them uh
 
05:17:59.090 --> 05:17:59.100 align:start position:0%
are are some of them not funded and if
 
05:18:01.970 --> 05:18:01.980 align:start position:0%
so what would be the reason for that
 
05:18:04.910 --> 05:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
so uh as part of being a recognized
 
05:18:07.070 --> 05:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
student organization recognize student
 
05:18:09.410 --> 05:18:09.420 align:start position:0%
organizations to have access to Student
 
05:18:12.350 --> 05:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
Activity fee funding so if you had an
 
05:18:15.170 --> 05:18:15.180 align:start position:0%
unrecognized student group they are not
 
05:18:18.410 --> 05:18:18.420 align:start position:0%
recognized and recognition is really
 
05:18:20.150 --> 05:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
um the idea that
 
05:18:23.570 --> 05:18:23.580 align:start position:0%
uh by having a um
 
05:18:26.390 --> 05:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
by having students uh by asking student
 
05:18:29.930 --> 05:18:29.940 align:start position:0%
leaders subscribe to uh to the faith
 
05:18:32.030 --> 05:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
represented by the student organization
 
05:18:35.030 --> 05:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
the mission of that student organization
 
05:18:35.040 --> 05:18:36.650 align:start position:0%
the mission of that student organization
um

05:18:36.650 --> 05:18:36.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:38.390 --> 05:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
the idea that you would then be
 
05:18:40.430 --> 05:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
unrecognized by having that requirement
 
05:18:40.440 --> 05:18:43.010 align:start position:0%
unrecognized by having that requirement
is

05:18:43.010 --> 05:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:18:44.930 --> 05:18:44.940 align:start position:0%
um that would be the challenge and that
 
05:18:47.930 --> 05:18:47.940 align:start position:0%
would limit access to uh to religious
 
05:18:52.070 --> 05:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
community on campus and with the yeah I
 
05:18:55.128 --> 05:18:55.138 align:start position:0%
think related to to this
 
05:18:58.910 --> 05:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
um with the with the bill on um very
 
05:19:01.250 --> 05:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
bottom of page two on top of Page Three
 
05:19:02.628 --> 05:19:02.638 align:start position:0%
I know you don't have it in front of you
 
05:19:05.288 --> 05:19:05.298 align:start position:0%
right now where it says um
 
05:19:08.390 --> 05:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
it basically says to the to the effect
 
05:19:10.670 --> 05:19:10.680 align:start position:0%
um no public and higher education shall
 
05:19:13.510 --> 05:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
deny religious political
 
05:19:16.070 --> 05:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
radiological student organization any
 
05:19:18.288 --> 05:19:18.298 align:start position:0%
benefit or privilege available to any
 
05:19:20.570 --> 05:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
other student organizations would that
 
05:19:24.170 --> 05:19:24.180 align:start position:0%
change the um the the would that be a
 
05:19:26.090 --> 05:19:26.100 align:start position:0%
change from the policy you just talked
 
05:19:29.750 --> 05:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
about so that would uh codify the
 
05:19:32.510 --> 05:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
current policies that are in place
 
05:19:35.690 --> 05:19:35.700 align:start position:0%
that you'd have to be a recognized yes
 
05:19:39.350 --> 05:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you further questions now see
 
05:19:41.750 --> 05:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'd like to invite
 
05:19:53.930 --> 05:19:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:56.570 --> 05:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:19:59.330 --> 05:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee uh
 
05:20:00.948 --> 05:20:00.958 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Owen Reed I
 
05:20:04.430 --> 05:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
represent Rockingham 10 new market and
 
05:20:06.650 --> 05:20:06.660 align:start position:0%
new fields and um
 
05:20:09.288 --> 05:20:09.298 align:start position:0%
I'm going to to speak very broadly
 
05:20:11.628 --> 05:20:11.638 align:start position:0%
because I'm not a lawyer nor am I an
 
05:20:13.970 --> 05:20:13.980 align:start position:0%
education expert although um I have
 
05:20:16.070 --> 05:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
adjunct taught for many semesters
 
05:20:17.270 --> 05:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
American government and Community
 
05:20:19.550 --> 05:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
College so that's kind of the level I'll
 
05:20:23.270 --> 05:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
I'll come to this end and um I guess I
 
05:20:25.510 --> 05:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
want to answer the question why a
 
05:20:28.970 --> 05:20:28.980 align:start position:0%
self-described far leftist agnostic
 
05:20:31.628 --> 05:20:31.638 align:start position:0%
atheist secular person such as myself
 
05:20:34.610 --> 05:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
might show up in support for something
 
05:20:37.788 --> 05:20:37.798 align:start position:0%
that I think probably unjustly may have
 
05:20:40.390 --> 05:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
gotten a reputation for being
 
05:20:44.448 --> 05:20:44.458 align:start position:0%
right meaning and that's because Free
 
05:20:49.090 --> 05:20:49.100 align:start position:0%
Speech isn't a right-leaning concept and
 
05:20:52.070 --> 05:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
historically in fact if you want to
 
05:20:54.948 --> 05:20:54.958 align:start position:0%
conjure images of students protesting
 
05:20:57.590 --> 05:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
the Vietnam War or fighting for women's
 
05:21:01.550 --> 05:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
rights or fighting for civil rights
 
05:21:05.330 --> 05:21:05.340 align:start position:0%
um it has been I think alternating left
 
05:21:07.788 --> 05:21:07.798 align:start position:0%
or right and that's because it's it's an
 
05:21:10.750 --> 05:21:10.760 align:start position:0%
issue of fairness it's an issue of
 
05:21:14.330 --> 05:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
making sure that one particular side
 
05:21:17.330 --> 05:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the power to suppress the
 
05:21:19.550 --> 05:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
other and I would also argue just on a
 
05:21:22.190 --> 05:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
personal level as someone who teaches
 
05:21:24.230 --> 05:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
American government that when our
 
05:21:27.470 --> 05:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
Founders put this in our the first set
 
05:21:29.510 --> 05:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
of amendments and what was the Bill of
 
05:21:31.910 --> 05:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
Rights that it was radically leftist
 
05:21:33.948 --> 05:21:33.958 align:start position:0%
according to traditional lock-in
 
05:21:36.948 --> 05:21:36.958 align:start position:0%
definitions of what that is
 
05:21:38.930 --> 05:21:38.940 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:21:41.150 --> 05:21:41.160 align:start position:0%
the reason that this is super important
 
05:21:43.490 --> 05:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
is because if you have in place an
 
05:21:46.670 --> 05:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
ability to censor people then now it's
 
05:21:48.350 --> 05:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
up to the limbs of whoever happens to
 
05:21:49.788 --> 05:21:49.798 align:start position:0%
get into power
 
05:21:52.430 --> 05:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
so it kind of I was going to wait and to
 
05:21:54.288 --> 05:21:54.298 align:start position:0%
address issues that were brought up but
 
05:21:56.330 --> 05:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
I wanted to bring up why why if there's
 
05:21:58.310 --> 05:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
no problems why do we do this
 
05:21:59.990 --> 05:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
I'm glad there's no problem super glad
 
05:22:02.270 --> 05:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
that there's no problems right now but
 
05:22:03.770 --> 05:22:03.780 align:start position:0%
if you wait until there are problems
 
05:22:05.150 --> 05:22:05.160 align:start position:0%
then it's too late
 
05:22:07.970 --> 05:22:07.980 align:start position:0%
because if the systems exist to allow
 
05:22:11.448 --> 05:22:11.458 align:start position:0%
suppression then whoever gets empowers
 
05:22:14.208 --> 05:22:14.218 align:start position:0%
are able to use those systems this is
 
05:22:16.910 --> 05:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
how I teach my my students I say that
 
05:22:19.550 --> 05:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
the constitution is like the rules in a
 
05:22:22.128 --> 05:22:22.138 align:start position:0%
in a box of Monopoly right you follow
 
05:22:24.050 --> 05:22:24.060 align:start position:0%
the rules and as long as we're following
 
05:22:26.510 --> 05:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
the rules people seem okay no matter who
 
05:22:28.670 --> 05:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
wins or loses because everybody played
 
05:22:30.708 --> 05:22:30.718 align:start position:0%
according to the rules but if somebody
 
05:22:32.750 --> 05:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
just overturns the game and just breaks
 
05:22:34.128 --> 05:22:34.138 align:start position:0%
all the rules then you're going to get
 
05:22:36.830 --> 05:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
anger right because I think that we
 
05:22:38.810 --> 05:22:38.820 align:start position:0%
we're experiencing so much divisiveness
 
05:22:41.330 --> 05:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
in our in our country and I think a lot
 
05:22:43.250 --> 05:22:43.260 align:start position:0%
of times people talk about well it's the
 
05:22:44.570 --> 05:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
right versus the left it's you know
 
05:22:46.670 --> 05:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
these ideas it's because they disagree I
 
05:22:48.230 --> 05:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
don't think it's because they that the
 
05:22:49.730 --> 05:22:49.740 align:start position:0%
sides disagree that we have so much
 
05:22:51.890 --> 05:22:51.900 align:start position:0%
bitterness the market of place of ideas
 
05:22:53.628 --> 05:22:53.638 align:start position:0%
is important which is why we need
 
05:22:56.390 --> 05:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
protection free speech I think it's the
 
05:22:58.730 --> 05:22:58.740 align:start position:0%
lack of good faith engagement the idea
 
05:23:00.350 --> 05:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
that we don't trust the other side to
 
05:23:02.350 --> 05:23:02.360 align:start position:0%
play by the rules to play by that
 
05:23:04.850 --> 05:23:04.860 align:start position:0%
Monopoly rule set that that came with
 
05:23:07.490 --> 05:23:07.500 align:start position:0%
our country right the Constitution we
 
05:23:08.990 --> 05:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
don't trust the other side we think
 
05:23:11.030 --> 05:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to cheat for lack of a
 
05:23:12.170 --> 05:23:12.180 align:start position:0%
better word
 
05:23:14.628 --> 05:23:14.638 align:start position:0%
and that's what causes the bitterness
 
05:23:16.610 --> 05:23:16.620 align:start position:0%
and so I think it's really important
 
05:23:19.610 --> 05:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
that I being on the other side of so
 
05:23:21.948 --> 05:23:21.958 align:start position:0%
many of the sponsors of this bill come
 
05:23:24.350 --> 05:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
forward in good faith to say yeah
 
05:23:26.208 --> 05:23:26.218 align:start position:0%
actually it's a good idea to protect
 
05:23:29.330 --> 05:23:29.340 align:start position:0%
Free Speech even if in this particular
 
05:23:31.610 --> 05:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
situation it might be impacting you more
 
05:23:34.430 --> 05:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
but that means later maybe you'll listen
 
05:23:38.448 --> 05:23:38.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:41.270 --> 05:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
I am a very strong believer on voting on
 
05:23:44.390 --> 05:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
issues voting on bills as a legislator
 
05:23:46.670 --> 05:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
based on the merits of the bill and not
 
05:23:50.570 --> 05:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
based on personality or party
 
05:23:53.330 --> 05:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
um but I'm not so naive to think that we
 
05:23:55.250 --> 05:23:55.260 align:start position:0%
are not flawed human beings that
 
05:23:57.368 --> 05:23:57.378 align:start position:0%
sometimes give into unconscious
 
05:24:00.830 --> 05:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
biases against people we see to be on
 
05:24:03.070 --> 05:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
the other side so I wanted to very
 
05:24:05.830 --> 05:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
expressly show my face here today
 
05:24:08.570 --> 05:24:08.580 align:start position:0%
because this is not a partisan issue
 
05:24:10.670 --> 05:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
it's a partisan issue in a particular
 
05:24:12.110 --> 05:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
moment but then it becomes the other
 
05:24:16.070 --> 05:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:20.270 --> 05:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
so let's see I think I'm about done
 
05:24:22.490 --> 05:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
um just a couple issues that were
 
05:24:25.368 --> 05:24:25.378 align:start position:0%
brought up so the outdoor versus indoor
 
05:24:31.490 --> 05:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
I want to point out again that the uh
 
05:24:34.430 --> 05:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
second page line 13 this is Roman number
 
05:24:37.910 --> 05:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
one that covers all areas including
 
05:24:40.070 --> 05:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
indoor in fact it says all forms
 
05:24:42.230 --> 05:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
including guest speakers and what have
 
05:24:44.510 --> 05:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
you so that that includes indoor section
 
05:24:46.850 --> 05:24:46.860 align:start position:0%
two is what specifically relates to
 
05:24:49.788 --> 05:24:49.798 align:start position:0%
Outdoors so indoor is covered there
 
05:24:52.628 --> 05:24:52.638 align:start position:0%
um the shouting down
 
05:24:56.510 --> 05:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
of a speaker that that is covered the
 
05:24:58.910 --> 05:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
the definition on the first page of uh
 
05:25:01.690 --> 05:25:01.700 align:start position:0%
three material Inception substitute
 
05:25:04.788 --> 05:25:04.798 align:start position:0%
substantially disrupts means when a
 
05:25:06.410 --> 05:25:06.420 align:start position:0%
person with the intent to or knowledge
 
05:25:07.670 --> 05:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
of doing so significantly hinders
 
05:25:09.050 --> 05:25:09.060 align:start position:0%
another person or groups expressive
 
05:25:10.368 --> 05:25:10.378 align:start position:0%
activity which occurs in the campus
 
05:25:12.288 --> 05:25:12.298 align:start position:0%
space reserve for such activity under
 
05:25:13.910 --> 05:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
the exclusive user control of that
 
05:25:16.190 --> 05:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
particular person or group prevents the
 
05:25:17.690 --> 05:25:17.700 align:start position:0%
communication of the message prevents a
 
05:25:19.070 --> 05:25:19.080 align:start position:0%

05:25:21.350 --> 05:25:21.360 align:start position:0%

05:25:25.070 --> 05:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
that is specifically for if the
 
05:25:25.080 --> 05:25:26.270 align:start position:0%
that is specifically for if the
University

05:25:26.270 --> 05:25:26.280 align:start position:0%
University
 
05:25:28.910 --> 05:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
has said this person's allowed to speak
 
05:25:30.350 --> 05:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
you don't get to disrupt the
 
05:25:33.288 --> 05:25:33.298 align:start position:0%
University's proceedings and it that's
 
05:25:35.150 --> 05:25:35.160 align:start position:0%
the definition but that definition is
 
05:25:38.270 --> 05:25:38.280 align:start position:0%
referenced in uh section and our Roman
 
05:25:40.128 --> 05:25:40.138 align:start position:0%
numeral two on the second page where
 
05:25:41.208 --> 05:25:41.218 align:start position:0%
it's talking about reasonable time
 
05:25:42.890 --> 05:25:42.900 align:start position:0%
placing manner restrictions applicable
 
05:25:45.350 --> 05:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
to traditional public forums
 
05:25:47.090 --> 05:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
um in service of a significant
 
05:25:49.190 --> 05:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
institutional interest so again if an
 
05:25:51.770 --> 05:25:51.780 align:start position:0%
institution has brought a speaker on the
 
05:25:53.690 --> 05:25:53.700 align:start position:0%
students can't disrupt that and then
 
05:25:56.650 --> 05:25:56.660 align:start position:0%
down in Roman rule 3 materially in
 
05:25:59.750 --> 05:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
substantially substantially disrupt the
 
05:26:01.430 --> 05:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
functioning of the public institution of
 
05:26:02.868 --> 05:26:02.878 align:start position:0%
higher education
 
05:26:06.770 --> 05:26:06.780 align:start position:0%
so again uh no you can't shout down this
 
05:26:08.448 --> 05:26:08.458 align:start position:0%
would not protect the shouting down of a
 
05:26:11.030 --> 05:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
guest speaker
 
05:26:11.040 --> 05:26:11.570 align:start position:0%
guest speaker
um

05:26:11.570 --> 05:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:16.250 --> 05:26:16.260 align:start position:0%
so uh one other thing I heard is is that
 
05:26:17.868 --> 05:26:17.878 align:start position:0%
we're so compliant and then I heard in
 
05:26:20.810 --> 05:26:20.820 align:start position:0%
the same testimony that we're worried
 
05:26:22.550 --> 05:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
about lawsuits well I don't understand
 
05:26:24.410 --> 05:26:24.420 align:start position:0%
if we're so compliant why are we worried
 
05:26:26.448 --> 05:26:26.458 align:start position:0%
about what's going to happen if we're
 
05:26:28.430 --> 05:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
doing good then we're doing good
 
05:26:31.190 --> 05:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
and I don't see any reason to to worry
 
05:26:34.368 --> 05:26:34.378 align:start position:0%
about about passing this
 
05:26:34.378 --> 05:26:35.090 align:start position:0%
about about passing this
um

05:26:35.090 --> 05:26:35.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:37.550 --> 05:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
so again I don't think I can necessarily
 
05:26:39.830 --> 05:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
help on the details I think there are
 
05:26:41.570 --> 05:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
much better legal Minds in the room than
 
05:26:43.490 --> 05:26:43.500 align:start position:0%
myself but what I haven't heard from the
 
05:26:45.230 --> 05:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
committee is an objection to the concept
 
05:26:47.750 --> 05:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
of protecting free speech so I ask that
 
05:26:50.448 --> 05:26:50.458 align:start position:0%
if you are able to find little holes
 
05:26:52.010 --> 05:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
that you can poke in this and you think
 
05:26:53.868 --> 05:26:53.878 align:start position:0%
a word or two can be changed that you do
 
05:26:56.930 --> 05:26:56.940 align:start position:0%
the good faith effort to actually make
 
05:26:59.330 --> 05:26:59.340 align:start position:0%
those changes and not just kind of get
 
05:27:02.090 --> 05:27:02.100 align:start position:0%
use it as an excuse to get rid of it and
 
05:27:04.250 --> 05:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
I'll try to answer questions thank you
 
05:27:06.350 --> 05:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
very much uh represent McDonald
 
05:27:08.448 --> 05:27:08.458 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and really thank you
 
05:27:10.788 --> 05:27:10.798 align:start position:0%
for your testimony and to bring
 
05:27:12.890 --> 05:27:12.900 align:start position:0%
bipartisan legislation forward that's
 
05:27:15.170 --> 05:27:15.180 align:start position:0%
really important I'm directing my
 
05:27:16.550 --> 05:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
question to you because you mentioned
 
05:27:19.128 --> 05:27:19.138 align:start position:0%
that you talk government yeah and a lot
 
05:27:21.110 --> 05:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
of these speakers that come to campus
 
05:27:22.670 --> 05:27:22.680 align:start position:0%
they might be associated with a
 
05:27:26.208 --> 05:27:26.218 align:start position:0%
political party but regardless do you
 
05:27:29.448 --> 05:27:29.458 align:start position:0%
believe that if they have exposure to
 
05:27:31.490 --> 05:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
whatever political party it really
 
05:27:33.288 --> 05:27:33.298 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter it would help them have a
 
05:27:34.788 --> 05:27:34.798 align:start position:0%
better understanding of government and
 
05:27:36.530 --> 05:27:36.540 align:start position:0%
what would be taught in your class just
 
05:27:38.868 --> 05:27:38.878 align:start position:0%
to be exposed to that so just
 
05:27:38.878 --> 05:27:40.490 align:start position:0%
to be exposed to that so just
anecdotally

05:27:40.490 --> 05:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
anecdotally
 
05:27:42.830 --> 05:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
um again I've already outed myself not
 
05:27:44.990 --> 05:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
that it was a secret of being a far
 
05:27:47.690 --> 05:27:47.700 align:start position:0%
leftist but I it's very specifically on
 
05:27:49.670 --> 05:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
the first day of every semester tell my
 
05:27:51.708 --> 05:27:51.718 align:start position:0%
students exactly who I am the founder of
 
05:27:53.690 --> 05:27:53.700 align:start position:0%
the progressive caucus yada yada yada
 
05:27:56.208 --> 05:27:56.218 align:start position:0%
yada and I say and if you think I'm
 
05:27:58.910 --> 05:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
being biased at any point call me out
 
05:28:02.628 --> 05:28:02.638 align:start position:0%
engage with me and every single semester
 
05:28:05.330 --> 05:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
I will have and apologies if this is
 
05:28:07.070 --> 05:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
offensive I will have a trump supporting
 
05:28:09.230 --> 05:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
student and they are almost always
 
05:28:12.770 --> 05:28:12.780 align:start position:0%
universally a some of my favorite
 
05:28:14.868 --> 05:28:14.878 align:start position:0%
students because I get to like engage in
 
05:28:17.390 --> 05:28:17.400 align:start position:0%
like arguments with them and they engage
 
05:28:19.550 --> 05:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
back but secondly I've had three
 
05:28:21.890 --> 05:28:21.900 align:start position:0%
separate Trump supporting students that
 
05:28:23.570 --> 05:28:23.580 align:start position:0%
I didn't change their mind by the end of
 
05:28:26.750 --> 05:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
it but they told me that I was their
 
05:28:29.448 --> 05:28:29.458 align:start position:0%
favorite teacher at the school so
 
05:28:32.270 --> 05:28:32.280 align:start position:0%
because I engaged in these conversations
 
05:28:32.280 --> 05:28:34.070 align:start position:0%
because I engaged in these conversations
so

05:28:34.070 --> 05:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:28:35.230 --> 05:28:35.240 align:start position:0%
um that
 
05:28:39.050 --> 05:28:39.060 align:start position:0%
Marketplace of ideas is very important
 
05:28:42.770 --> 05:28:42.780 align:start position:0%
um I'll just very briefly because the
 
05:28:44.990 --> 05:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
the whole concept of the First Amendment
 
05:28:47.570 --> 05:28:47.580 align:start position:0%
and I I apologize if this is patronizing
 
05:28:48.410 --> 05:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to read the first
 
05:28:50.270 --> 05:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
amendment really quick Congress shall
 
05:28:51.890 --> 05:28:51.900 align:start position:0%
make no law respecting an establishment
 
05:28:53.270 --> 05:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
of religion or prohibiting the free
 
05:28:55.490 --> 05:28:55.500 align:start position:0%
exercise thereof or Bridging the freedom
 
05:28:57.830 --> 05:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
of speech or of the press or of the
 
05:28:58.970 --> 05:28:58.980 align:start position:0%
right of the people to peaceably
 
05:29:01.070 --> 05:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
assemble and to petition the government
 
05:29:03.110 --> 05:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
for a redress of grievances and while
 
05:29:05.510 --> 05:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
that says Congress we have long since
 
05:29:07.550 --> 05:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
gone through what is called selective
 
05:29:09.470 --> 05:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
incorporation by saying that also
 
05:29:11.390 --> 05:29:11.400 align:start position:0%
applies to States
 
05:29:14.750 --> 05:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
um so I think that
 
05:29:14.760 --> 05:29:15.830 align:start position:0%
um so I think that
um

05:29:15.830 --> 05:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:17.390 --> 05:29:17.400 align:start position:0%
original question was about political
 
05:29:20.810 --> 05:29:20.820 align:start position:0%
parties I think right I'm sorry I went
 
05:29:22.730 --> 05:29:22.740 align:start position:0%
for your students benefit in
 
05:29:24.530 --> 05:29:24.540 align:start position:0%
understanding Civics and government and
 
05:29:26.570 --> 05:29:26.580 align:start position:0%
just being more engaged if these
 
05:29:28.250 --> 05:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
speakers were allowed to come to the
 
05:29:31.128 --> 05:29:31.138 align:start position:0%
school yes yeah so uh oh political
 
05:29:32.810 --> 05:29:32.820 align:start position:0%
speech political speed there's a reason
 
05:29:32.820 --> 05:29:34.090 align:start position:0%
speech political speed there's a reason
in

05:29:34.090 --> 05:29:34.100 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:29:37.250 --> 05:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
specifically political speech is super
 
05:29:40.010 --> 05:29:40.020 align:start position:0%
super protected so basically above and
 
05:29:41.510 --> 05:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
beyond the you know the Supreme Court
 
05:29:43.610 --> 05:29:43.620 align:start position:0%
has and through all kinds of case law
 
05:29:45.410 --> 05:29:45.420 align:start position:0%
we've determined there are exceptions to
 
05:29:47.030 --> 05:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
every single one of our constitutional
 
05:29:47.040 --> 05:29:48.470 align:start position:0%
every single one of our constitutional
rights

05:29:48.470 --> 05:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
rights
 
05:29:52.270 --> 05:29:52.280 align:start position:0%
um however political free speech is so
 
05:29:55.128 --> 05:29:55.138 align:start position:0%
fervently defended by the courts because
 
05:29:57.650 --> 05:29:57.660 align:start position:0%
it is so very important to how we have
 
05:30:00.770 --> 05:30:00.780 align:start position:0%
government if we give up political Free
 
05:30:04.070 --> 05:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
Speech we're throwing in the game so yes
 
05:30:05.390 --> 05:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
it's very important thank you very much
 
05:30:06.708 --> 05:30:06.718 align:start position:0%
are there further questions from the
 
05:30:06.718 --> 05:30:07.670 align:start position:0%
are there further questions from the
committee

05:30:07.670 --> 05:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:30:07.680 --> 05:30:10.030 align:start position:0%
committee
representately

05:30:10.030 --> 05:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
representately
 
05:30:13.030 --> 05:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you representative Reed
 
05:30:15.708 --> 05:30:15.718 align:start position:0%
where was it in here that you said it
 
05:30:18.230 --> 05:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
was in uh
 
05:30:21.470 --> 05:30:21.480 align:start position:0%
applied to indoor because I you and so
 
05:30:23.750 --> 05:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't specifically say indoor but
 
05:30:26.330 --> 05:30:26.340 align:start position:0%
the Roman numeral one so it's line 13
 
05:30:28.610 --> 05:30:28.620 align:start position:0%
with the second page
 
05:30:30.830 --> 05:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
um doesn't apply to indoor or outdoor
 
05:30:34.310 --> 05:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
applied to all forms okay and then it
 
05:30:36.110 --> 05:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
includes things like guest speakers
 
05:30:40.010 --> 05:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
which typically are indoors so um it's
 
05:30:41.628 --> 05:30:41.638 align:start position:0%
not an explicit that's one of those
 
05:30:43.250 --> 05:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
little tiny holes that if you find that
 
05:30:45.110 --> 05:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
you know you want to poke a hole in it
 
05:30:47.510 --> 05:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
then do the work to put something in it
 
05:30:50.150 --> 05:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
says it includes indoors but
 
05:30:52.128 --> 05:30:52.138 align:start position:0%
um but yeah I think this is reasonably
 
05:30:53.690 --> 05:30:53.700 align:start position:0%
interpreted to include everything on
 
05:30:53.700 --> 05:30:56.050 align:start position:0%
interpreted to include everything on
campus

05:30:56.050 --> 05:30:56.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:59.390 --> 05:30:59.400 align:start position:0%
yes thank you I asked the same question
 
05:31:01.730 --> 05:31:01.740 align:start position:0%
that I asked representative Lynn which
 
05:31:05.288 --> 05:31:05.298 align:start position:0%
was why this does not apply to private
 
05:31:08.868 --> 05:31:08.878 align:start position:0%
universities who in I think should also
 
05:31:12.070 --> 05:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
respect free speech I agree with you
 
05:31:14.990 --> 05:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
representatively I I personally do agree
 
05:31:17.750 --> 05:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
with you I think that um representative
 
05:31:20.330 --> 05:31:20.340 align:start position:0%
Lynn is correct in the assessment that
 
05:31:23.208 --> 05:31:23.218 align:start position:0%
we're running into murkier Waters when
 
05:31:24.890 --> 05:31:24.900 align:start position:0%
we talk about what a private institution
 
05:31:28.368 --> 05:31:28.378 align:start position:0%
can and can't do so you know the
 
05:31:30.890 --> 05:31:30.900 align:start position:0%
government can't ABR so first amendment
 
05:31:32.448 --> 05:31:32.458 align:start position:0%
is about what the government can do to
 
05:31:33.830 --> 05:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
you all of the Constitution is about
 
05:31:35.330 --> 05:31:35.340 align:start position:0%
what the government can and can't do to
 
05:31:35.340 --> 05:31:36.288 align:start position:0%
what the government can and can't do to
you

05:31:36.288 --> 05:31:36.298 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:31:39.350 --> 05:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
um so while we can say state
 
05:31:41.990 --> 05:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
universities cannot limit your free
 
05:31:44.330 --> 05:31:44.340 align:start position:0%
speech because of the first amendment I
 
05:31:46.430 --> 05:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
can't say that you can't limit My Free
 
05:31:48.530 --> 05:31:48.540 align:start position:0%
Speech if I come over to your house
 
05:31:51.610 --> 05:31:51.620 align:start position:0%
so I think we should be able to do that
 
05:31:55.368 --> 05:31:55.378 align:start position:0%
however we're getting into murkier this
 
05:31:58.490 --> 05:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
is very clear that if it's a state thing
 
05:32:00.170 --> 05:32:00.180 align:start position:0%
the government can't abridge your speech
 
05:32:02.030 --> 05:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
but once you're getting into private
 
05:32:05.628 --> 05:32:05.638 align:start position:0%
situations then it's much murkier and so
 
05:32:08.868 --> 05:32:08.878 align:start position:0%
I I agree in the the concept but it
 
05:32:10.190 --> 05:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
would be more difficult to get past
 
05:32:12.470 --> 05:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
you'd have a lot more people opposing it
 
05:32:15.110 --> 05:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
05:32:17.690 --> 05:32:17.700 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Robertson Lane and
 
05:32:19.190 --> 05:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
reluct our to that question you had
 
05:32:22.610 --> 05:32:22.620 align:start position:0%
we've had that many times here Dartmouth
 
05:32:24.350 --> 05:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
College was formed before we were a
 
05:32:24.360 --> 05:32:29.270 align:start position:0%
College was formed before we were a
country

05:32:29.270 --> 05:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:40.010 --> 05:32:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:41.510 --> 05:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
05:32:45.050 --> 05:32:45.060 align:start position:0%
committee uh the different face from AFP
 
05:32:46.850 --> 05:32:46.860 align:start position:0%
here today usually about Sarah so you're
 
05:32:48.948 --> 05:32:48.958 align:start position:0%
stuck with me uh my name is Ross
 
05:32:50.510 --> 05:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
Connolly I'm the deputy state director
 
05:32:53.090 --> 05:32:53.100 align:start position:0%
for Americans for Prosperity here in New
 
05:32:54.708 --> 05:32:54.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire here to voice our support for
 
05:32:57.110 --> 05:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
HB 516
 
05:32:59.208 --> 05:32:59.218 align:start position:0%
um I'll try to be brief and address some
 
05:33:00.910 --> 05:33:00.920 align:start position:0%
of the the points that have come up but
 
05:33:04.010 --> 05:33:04.020 align:start position:0%
uh really but what this discussion
 
05:33:06.110 --> 05:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
centers around is that free speech is
 
05:33:08.390 --> 05:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
really the foundational Cornerstone of
 
05:33:12.470 --> 05:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
any free and open society and University
 
05:33:16.010 --> 05:33:16.020 align:start position:0%
Systems especially uh are centers of
 
05:33:18.050 --> 05:33:18.060 align:start position:0%
Higher Learning and and diverse thought
 
05:33:21.170 --> 05:33:21.180 align:start position:0%
and should be encouraged to to protect
 
05:33:24.830 --> 05:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
and uphold the free speech of their
 
05:33:27.890 --> 05:33:27.900 align:start position:0%
students being intellectually curious
 
05:33:30.230 --> 05:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
organizing groups around a certain idea
 
05:33:34.850 --> 05:33:34.860 align:start position:0%
are very important principles for for uh
 
05:33:36.770 --> 05:33:36.780 align:start position:0%
any any Center of Higher Learning and
 
05:33:39.230 --> 05:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
this bill would stop the practice of
 
05:33:42.110 --> 05:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
constant change is in student speech
 
05:33:44.150 --> 05:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
policies from occurring and give
 
05:33:45.830 --> 05:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
certainty to students that the
 
05:33:48.708 --> 05:33:48.718 align:start position:0%
legislature is the body that is
 
05:33:50.930 --> 05:33:50.940 align:start position:0%
protecting their first amendment rights
 
05:33:53.208 --> 05:33:53.218 align:start position:0%
teaching young people the virtues of
 
05:33:56.110 --> 05:33:56.120 align:start position:0%
respectful civil debate and disagreement
 
05:33:58.490 --> 05:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
are absolutely critical in the coming
 
05:34:01.368 --> 05:34:01.378 align:start position:0%
years as we see in our our political
 
05:34:05.288 --> 05:34:05.298 align:start position:0%
system the division uh between
 
05:34:07.730 --> 05:34:07.740 align:start position:0%
disagreeing parties is just becoming
 
05:34:11.030 --> 05:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
greater and greater and the the solution
 
05:34:14.090 --> 05:34:14.100 align:start position:0%
to this is is to encourage people to
 
05:34:16.250 --> 05:34:16.260 align:start position:0%
listen to each other to hear the other
 
05:34:19.010 --> 05:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
perspective and especially for young
 
05:34:21.890 --> 05:34:21.900 align:start position:0%
people to understand those that are
 
05:34:24.708 --> 05:34:24.718 align:start position:0%
coming from a different place
 
05:34:27.050 --> 05:34:27.060 align:start position:0%
um this bill would simply put in statute
 
05:34:29.270 --> 05:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
these basic protections for students
 
05:34:30.650 --> 05:34:30.660 align:start position:0%
First Amendment rights on public
 
05:34:33.530 --> 05:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
university campuses while still allowing
 
05:34:35.868 --> 05:34:35.878 align:start position:0%
broad discretion by the university to
 
05:34:38.390 --> 05:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
protect rights of way on campus and
 
05:34:43.070 --> 05:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
control uh campus activities what HB 516
 
05:34:46.730 --> 05:34:46.740 align:start position:0%
does not do it does not allow speech
 
05:34:48.948 --> 05:34:48.958 align:start position:0%
such as calls to commit violence or
 
05:34:51.230 --> 05:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
harassment and it also still allows the
 
05:34:53.750 --> 05:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
institution uh to Halt demonstrations
 
05:34:57.250 --> 05:34:57.260 align:start position:0%
that are disruptful to campus activities
 
05:34:59.930 --> 05:34:59.940 align:start position:0%
this small reasonable change would start
 
05:35:02.390 --> 05:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
the process of moving campuses back to
 
05:35:04.490 --> 05:35:04.500 align:start position:0%
to being these centers of Higher
 
05:35:07.070 --> 05:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
Learning questioning uh and critical
 
05:35:07.080 --> 05:35:08.150 align:start position:0%
Learning questioning uh and critical
thought

05:35:08.150 --> 05:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
thought
 
05:35:11.288 --> 05:35:11.298 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's no secret that universities
 
05:35:13.670 --> 05:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
across the country and right here in New
 
05:35:16.250 --> 05:35:16.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are under pressure uh from
 
05:35:18.350 --> 05:35:18.360 align:start position:0%
both sides of this argument between
 
05:35:19.970 --> 05:35:19.980 align:start position:0%
those who who want to protect and
 
05:35:22.128 --> 05:35:22.138 align:start position:0%
preserve free speech and those who are
 
05:35:24.948 --> 05:35:24.958 align:start position:0%
demanding more and more censorship this
 
05:35:27.050 --> 05:35:27.060 align:start position:0%
bill is a release valve for the
 
05:35:30.170 --> 05:35:30.180 align:start position:0%
University system uh it protects
 
05:35:32.390 --> 05:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
University administrators and employees
 
05:35:35.510 --> 05:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
by Shifting the burden of of protecting
 
05:35:37.550 --> 05:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
those speech rights from the University
 
05:35:40.730 --> 05:35:40.740 align:start position:0%
system to the legislature where you are
 
05:35:43.910 --> 05:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
all sworn to to uphold these these
 
05:35:43.920 --> 05:35:45.650 align:start position:0%
all sworn to to uphold these these
principles

05:35:45.650 --> 05:35:45.660 align:start position:0%
principles
 
05:35:47.628 --> 05:35:47.638 align:start position:0%
um and I'll point out that this bill is
 
05:35:50.750 --> 05:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
a result uh the the language you see in
 
05:35:52.430 --> 05:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
front of you is the result of years of
 
05:35:56.030 --> 05:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
work by this committee and uh by the
 
05:35:58.010 --> 05:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
Coalition of of folks that have been
 
05:36:00.350 --> 05:36:00.360 align:start position:0%
working on on this bill from across the
 
05:36:03.110 --> 05:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
political Spectrum uh in 2021 this
 
05:36:04.788 --> 05:36:04.798 align:start position:0%
committee provided an incredibly
 
05:36:07.730 --> 05:36:07.740 align:start position:0%
valuable uh critiques and feedback on on
 
05:36:09.830 --> 05:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
a similar our bill I believe it was HB
 
05:36:12.250 --> 05:36:12.260 align:start position:0%
234 at the time
 
05:36:17.510 --> 05:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
and our Coalition used that feedback uh
 
05:36:20.150 --> 05:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
to to change the bill make it simpler
 
05:36:23.150 --> 05:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
and and more address the direct point of
 
05:36:26.868 --> 05:36:26.878 align:start position:0%
really just protecting those key speech
 
05:36:29.510 --> 05:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh Speech rights for for students on
 
05:36:34.550 --> 05:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
campus uh so HB 516 as you've seen is
 
05:36:36.770 --> 05:36:36.780 align:start position:0%
supported by a broad Coalition from
 
05:36:39.410 --> 05:36:39.420 align:start position:0%
across the political Spectrum uh fire
 
05:36:41.510 --> 05:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
the First Amendment part Partnerships
 
05:36:43.788 --> 05:36:43.798 align:start position:0%
Alliance defending Freedom Americans for
 
05:36:46.930 --> 05:36:46.940 align:start position:0%
Prosperity and the ACLU of New Hampshire
 
05:36:51.010 --> 05:36:51.020 align:start position:0%
19 States and Counting have have
 
05:36:54.590 --> 05:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
passed legislation similar to this uh
 
05:36:56.448 --> 05:36:56.458 align:start position:0%
really protecting these speech speech
 
05:36:59.690 --> 05:36:59.700 align:start position:0%
rights on public campuses uh including
 
05:37:01.850 --> 05:37:01.860 align:start position:0%
States from Republican and Democrat
 
05:37:05.208 --> 05:37:05.218 align:start position:0%
majorities uh and I I will point out I
 
05:37:07.730 --> 05:37:07.740 align:start position:0%
only know of a handful of lawsuits
 
05:37:09.770 --> 05:37:09.780 align:start position:0%
across across the entire country that
 
05:37:12.530 --> 05:37:12.540 align:start position:0%
have actually happened as a result of of
 
05:37:14.628 --> 05:37:14.638 align:start position:0%
a legislature passing legislation of
 
05:37:18.110 --> 05:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
this type Free Speech expression and
 
05:37:21.110 --> 05:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
Association they should be not uh they
 
05:37:24.350 --> 05:37:24.360 align:start position:0%
should not be partisan issues and uh you
 
05:37:26.090 --> 05:37:26.100 align:start position:0%
know we believe that this bill would go
 
05:37:28.390 --> 05:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
a long ways towards really encouraging
 
05:37:31.070 --> 05:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
students to to talk to one another on
 
05:37:33.590 --> 05:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
campus and to start to listen to each
 
05:37:35.390 --> 05:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
other and understand each other so for
 
05:37:37.550 --> 05:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
all these reasons urge the committee to
 
05:37:40.788 --> 05:37:40.798 align:start position:0%
move uh HP 516 ought to pass and I'd be
 
05:37:42.708 --> 05:37:42.718 align:start position:0%
happy it's about the best of my ability
 
05:37:44.750 --> 05:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
to answer any of your questions thank
 
05:37:46.490 --> 05:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
you are there questions from the
 
05:37:48.590 --> 05:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative Miler uh
 
05:37:50.090 --> 05:37:50.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for being
 
05:37:53.570 --> 05:37:53.580 align:start position:0%
here we've heard today from fire we've
 
05:37:56.750 --> 05:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
heard from UNH we've heard from Reverend
 
05:38:00.288 --> 05:38:00.298 align:start position:0%
Mew that there are no problems so are
 
05:38:02.930 --> 05:38:02.940 align:start position:0%
there currently based upon the work that
 
05:38:05.570 --> 05:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
was done two years ago in trying to
 
05:38:07.310 --> 05:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
comply with some of the issues that were
 
05:38:08.868 --> 05:38:08.878 align:start position:0%
in fact identified
 
05:38:11.330 --> 05:38:11.340 align:start position:0%
do you have any information that would
 
05:38:13.910 --> 05:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
contrary those perspectives as far as
 
05:38:15.708 --> 05:38:15.718 align:start position:0%
access to free speech in this state and
 
05:38:17.990 --> 05:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
college campuses I think thank you for
 
05:38:20.990 --> 05:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
the question of Representative uh I I
 
05:38:23.868 --> 05:38:23.878 align:start position:0%
think it's hard as as previous I can't
 
05:38:25.670 --> 05:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
remember who which speaker but a
 
05:38:28.190 --> 05:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
previous uh person testified that it is
 
05:38:31.250 --> 05:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
hard to identify uh where these these
 
05:38:33.410 --> 05:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
issues are popping up obviously the Dave
 
05:38:37.670 --> 05:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
Rubin event was was uh an incident that
 
05:38:40.368 --> 05:38:40.378 align:start position:0%
went viral uh there's been an incident
 
05:38:44.030 --> 05:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
in Cinco de Mayo and at UNH uh where
 
05:38:45.530 --> 05:38:45.540 align:start position:0%
there were similar incidents I can't
 
05:38:47.150 --> 05:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
really point to anything in particular
 
05:38:49.788 --> 05:38:49.798 align:start position:0%
but that's really not the purpose of
 
05:38:51.890 --> 05:38:51.900 align:start position:0%
this bill the purpose is
 
05:38:54.170 --> 05:38:54.180 align:start position:0%
it's I think it's great and and
 
05:38:56.150 --> 05:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
commendable that the university system
 
05:38:59.050 --> 05:38:59.060 align:start position:0%
has has shifted from those speech codes
 
05:39:02.030 --> 05:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
but I the the first amendment is first
 
05:39:06.170 --> 05:39:06.180 align:start position:0%
for a reason and uh I think it is of
 
05:39:11.330 --> 05:39:11.340 align:start position:0%
such importance uh that we as as a state
 
05:39:14.570 --> 05:39:14.580 align:start position:0%
encourage free speech and especially uh
 
05:39:17.868 --> 05:39:17.878 align:start position:0%
in in college systems uh that the
 
05:39:22.310 --> 05:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
legislature uh codify this into law so
 
05:39:25.310 --> 05:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
that a future administration of of
 
05:39:27.288 --> 05:39:27.298 align:start position:0%
universities public universities in New
 
05:39:30.110 --> 05:39:30.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does not retract those and we
 
05:39:32.990 --> 05:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
go backwards uh because that that's
 
05:39:34.970 --> 05:39:34.980 align:start position:0%
something uh that we believe the
 
05:39:36.830 --> 05:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
legislature should have a say in thank
 
05:39:39.410 --> 05:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
you for the questions
 
05:39:41.690 --> 05:39:41.700 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you very much
 
05:39:46.490 --> 05:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:46.500 --> 05:39:54.350 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:39:54.350 --> 05:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:56.150 --> 05:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
05:39:57.948 --> 05:39:57.958 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Caleb Dalton I'm
 
05:39:59.510 --> 05:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
senior counsel with the center for
 
05:40:01.730 --> 05:40:01.740 align:start position:0%
academic freedom at Alliance defending
 
05:40:04.970 --> 05:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
Freedom uh just by way of reference so
 
05:40:06.948 --> 05:40:06.958 align:start position:0%
my defending freedom is a non-profit
 
05:40:08.628 --> 05:40:08.638 align:start position:0%
legal organization High practice
 
05:40:10.850 --> 05:40:10.860 align:start position:0%
specifically in the area of academic
 
05:40:14.150 --> 05:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
freedom my job in essence is to sue
 
05:40:15.830 --> 05:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
public universities when I violate the
 
05:40:18.288 --> 05:40:18.298 align:start position:0%
first amendment I I'm kind of the
 
05:40:19.670 --> 05:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's bar that the university
 
05:40:22.430 --> 05:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
referred to uh and I'll come at that
 
05:40:25.430 --> 05:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
from a bit of this perspective my job
 
05:40:28.368 --> 05:40:28.378 align:start position:0%
here is if I could work myself out a job
 
05:40:30.590 --> 05:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
that would be great if you guys pass
 
05:40:32.330 --> 05:40:32.340 align:start position:0%
this bill that would work myself out of
 
05:40:34.550 --> 05:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
half of the job that I do around the
 
05:40:36.530 --> 05:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
country and that would be by eliminating
 
05:40:39.110 --> 05:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
speech zones and permit policies on
 
05:40:41.390 --> 05:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
University campuses and the securing
 
05:40:44.510 --> 05:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
free association I had a whole uh
 
05:40:47.030 --> 05:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
presentation prepared I've kind of
 
05:40:48.830 --> 05:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
philosophical about the value of free
 
05:40:50.990 --> 05:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
speech and the marketplace of ideas but
 
05:40:52.610 --> 05:40:52.620 align:start position:0%
I I think a lot of the speakers have
 
05:40:54.050 --> 05:40:54.060 align:start position:0%
already covered that and I think it'd be
 
05:40:55.788 --> 05:40:55.798 align:start position:0%
a waste of this committee's time for me
 
05:40:58.610 --> 05:40:58.620 align:start position:0%
to rehash why the first amendment is
 
05:41:00.590 --> 05:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
important I it sounds to me like most of
 
05:41:03.288 --> 05:41:03.298 align:start position:0%
us all agree that that's the case but
 
05:41:04.970 --> 05:41:04.980 align:start position:0%
representative mylar you've you've asked
 
05:41:06.470 --> 05:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
multiple times why do we need this
 
05:41:08.810 --> 05:41:08.820 align:start position:0%
there's if there's no issues right I'd
 
05:41:10.910 --> 05:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
like to address that point and also to
 
05:41:12.590 --> 05:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
respond to a few issues that the
 
05:41:14.990 --> 05:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
University's Council brought up so
 
05:41:17.030 --> 05:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
specifically why is this necessary are
 
05:41:18.890 --> 05:41:18.900 align:start position:0%
there any policies that this would
 
05:41:21.170 --> 05:41:21.180 align:start position:0%
actually address and and there actually
 
05:41:25.430 --> 05:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
are uh first I'll note I was contacted
 
05:41:26.930 --> 05:41:26.940 align:start position:0%
by a student at Keene State University
 
05:41:30.350 --> 05:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
last year who was directed to the Free
 
05:41:32.390 --> 05:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
Speech Zone Keen State maintains a free
 
05:41:34.330 --> 05:41:34.340 align:start position:0%
speech area for outside members
 
05:41:37.310 --> 05:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
ostensibly under their policy but as a
 
05:41:39.350 --> 05:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
student he was directed that he had to
 
05:41:41.570 --> 05:41:41.580 align:start position:0%
speak in that speech Zone I was able to
 
05:41:43.670 --> 05:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
work with him so that he's no longer on
 
05:41:46.610 --> 05:41:46.620 align:start position:0%
having to do that but there have been
 
05:41:48.288 --> 05:41:48.298 align:start position:0%
minor instances here and there but I
 
05:41:51.230 --> 05:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
also want to address uh the committee's
 
05:41:53.868 --> 05:41:53.878 align:start position:0%
attention to unh's specific outdoor
 
05:41:57.050 --> 05:41:57.060 align:start position:0%
assembling events permit policy I
 
05:41:58.610 --> 05:41:58.620 align:start position:0%
believe the universities Council brought
 
05:42:00.530 --> 05:42:00.540 align:start position:0%
this up saying oh if it's any event
 
05:42:04.128 --> 05:42:04.138 align:start position:0%
under 25 you don't have to get a permit
 
05:42:06.590 --> 05:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
um that's sort of true but the policy
 
05:42:07.970 --> 05:42:07.980 align:start position:0%
actually says you don't have to have a
 
05:42:10.310 --> 05:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
permit as long as you don't advertise
 
05:42:12.770 --> 05:42:12.780 align:start position:0%
your event anywhere including on social
 
05:42:15.530 --> 05:42:15.540 align:start position:0%
media so this would say you have to have
 
05:42:17.930 --> 05:42:17.940 align:start position:0%
a permit if just two members or two
 
05:42:19.550 --> 05:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
students let's say there's two students
 
05:42:22.128 --> 05:42:22.138 align:start position:0%
on campus and you say hey I I want to go
 
05:42:24.050 --> 05:42:24.060 align:start position:0%
address this important issue we're gonna
 
05:42:25.788 --> 05:42:25.798 align:start position:0%
talk about it because it's important in
 
05:42:28.250 --> 05:42:28.260 align:start position:0%
the news today and you post on Tick Tock
 
05:42:30.410 --> 05:42:30.420 align:start position:0%
or SnapChat or whatever the the current
 
05:42:32.390 --> 05:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
social media you say hey guys I'm out
 
05:42:35.208 --> 05:42:35.218 align:start position:0%
here come join me automatically then you
 
05:42:36.770 --> 05:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
have to have gotten a permit or you're
 
05:42:39.110 --> 05:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
in violation of unh's policy right now
 
05:42:41.690 --> 05:42:41.700 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate that my friends at fire
 
05:42:43.490 --> 05:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
have given these policies a green light
 
05:42:45.970 --> 05:42:45.980 align:start position:0%
and I do appreciate I want to reiterate
 
05:42:49.010 --> 05:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
UNH has some of the best policies I have
 
05:42:51.170 --> 05:42:51.180 align:start position:0%
seen on distribution of literature and
 
05:42:53.690 --> 05:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
other issues like that they have done a
 
05:42:56.150 --> 05:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
great job at at fixing several of those
 
05:42:58.070 --> 05:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
issues that haven't been there but it's
 
05:43:00.288 --> 05:43:00.298 align:start position:0%
not perfect and that highlights why this
 
05:43:02.690 --> 05:43:02.700 align:start position:0%
is necessary because changes in staff
 
05:43:05.690 --> 05:43:05.700 align:start position:0%
changes an Administration mean changes
 
05:43:07.070 --> 05:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
in policy
 
05:43:09.050 --> 05:43:09.060 align:start position:0%
this committee and the and the
 
05:43:11.570 --> 05:43:11.580 align:start position:0%
legislature if this bill is passed
 
05:43:14.810 --> 05:43:14.820 align:start position:0%
can level that out so it doesn't matter
 
05:43:16.910 --> 05:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
whether there's a change in staff or a
 
05:43:18.830 --> 05:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
change in Personnel or a change in
 
05:43:20.628 --> 05:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
leadership that the policies remain
 
05:43:23.090 --> 05:43:23.100 align:start position:0%
stable across the board I can think of
 
05:43:25.250 --> 05:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
multiple instances right now of cases
 
05:43:26.810 --> 05:43:26.820 align:start position:0%
where I've actually sued universities
 
05:43:29.030 --> 05:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
we've won a settlement with a good
 
05:43:31.550 --> 05:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
policy put in place and then within two
 
05:43:33.590 --> 05:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
years those policies have been changed
 
05:43:33.600 --> 05:43:34.368 align:start position:0%
years those policies have been changed
back

05:43:34.368 --> 05:43:34.378 align:start position:0%
back
 
05:43:35.990 --> 05:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
because there's changes in Personnel
 
05:43:38.270 --> 05:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
people forget different staff turnover a
 
05:43:39.830 --> 05:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
lot of these personal policies are
 
05:43:42.350 --> 05:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
written by staff or administrators they
 
05:43:45.170 --> 05:43:45.180 align:start position:0%
may not be familiar with these issues so
 
05:43:47.150 --> 05:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
that's one of the most important reasons
 
05:43:49.548 --> 05:43:49.558 align:start position:0%
if the university is already abiding by
 
05:43:51.410 --> 05:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
these it shouldn't be an issue to codify
 
05:43:53.090 --> 05:43:53.100 align:start position:0%
this and say look these are the basic
 
05:43:55.010 --> 05:43:55.020 align:start position:0%
standard principles that every
 
05:43:57.530 --> 05:43:57.540 align:start position:0%
University should be abiding by and I
 
05:43:59.868 --> 05:43:59.878 align:start position:0%
would like to address as well just a few
 
05:44:01.788 --> 05:44:01.798 align:start position:0%
issues that have been brought up by the
 
05:44:03.948 --> 05:44:03.958 align:start position:0%
committee and and the questions that
 
05:44:05.270 --> 05:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
have come up
 
05:44:08.030 --> 05:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
so as to immunity immunity was brought
 
05:44:11.208 --> 05:44:11.218 align:start position:0%
up several times and I the judge did a
 
05:44:12.708 --> 05:44:12.718 align:start position:0%
good job clarifying I would like to
 
05:44:15.288 --> 05:44:15.298 align:start position:0%
clarify just one brief point on that as
 
05:44:18.350 --> 05:44:18.360 align:start position:0%
well uh the 11th Amendment the text does
 
05:44:20.208 --> 05:44:20.218 align:start position:0%
say that no you know that is another
 
05:44:23.390 --> 05:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
citizen right but anybody can't no no
 
05:44:25.490 --> 05:44:25.500 align:start position:0%
person can sue the state of New
 
05:44:27.890 --> 05:44:27.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or an arm of the state and the
 
05:44:29.810 --> 05:44:29.820 align:start position:0%
university is an arm of the state right
 
05:44:33.470 --> 05:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
under the 11th Amendment Mary so I I sue
 
05:44:35.510 --> 05:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
universities all the time how do I do
 
05:44:37.490 --> 05:44:37.500 align:start position:0%
that I actually have to sue members of
 
05:44:39.048 --> 05:44:39.058 align:start position:0%
the Board of Trustees normally for
 
05:44:41.690 --> 05:44:41.700 align:start position:0%
policies like this right
 
05:44:43.850 --> 05:44:43.860 align:start position:0%
um so that's what I have to do Under the
 
05:44:46.788 --> 05:44:46.798 align:start position:0%
Federal Constitution under 1983 what
 
05:44:49.490 --> 05:44:49.500 align:start position:0%
this waiver of immunity does is allow
 
05:44:51.470 --> 05:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
for a lawsuit directly against the
 
05:44:54.770 --> 05:44:54.780 align:start position:0%
university rather than against members
 
05:44:56.628 --> 05:44:56.638 align:start position:0%
who enforce it the president or the
 
05:44:59.690 --> 05:44:59.700 align:start position:0%
university Board of Trustees so and it
 
05:45:01.788 --> 05:45:01.798 align:start position:0%
also allows an under state law whereas
 
05:45:03.470 --> 05:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
when I'm normally bringing a lawsuit
 
05:45:05.990 --> 05:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
it's under federal law so that that's
 
05:45:09.170 --> 05:45:09.180 align:start position:0%
what the immunity waiver does and I I
 
05:45:10.910 --> 05:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
think it's a good thing to add some
 
05:45:12.410 --> 05:45:12.420 align:start position:0%
teeth to this to tell the universities
 
05:45:14.810 --> 05:45:14.820 align:start position:0%
you actually mean it when you say these
 
05:45:16.190 --> 05:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
are the policies that they should be
 
05:45:18.890 --> 05:45:18.900 align:start position:0%
adopting uh something was brought up
 
05:45:21.830 --> 05:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
about violence and Shout Downs I want to
 
05:45:23.868 --> 05:45:23.878 align:start position:0%
clarify and and I believe the university
 
05:45:26.150 --> 05:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
said there's some confusion or ambiguity
 
05:45:28.548 --> 05:45:28.558 align:start position:0%
here and I don't think there really is
 
05:45:31.070 --> 05:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
and I want to but I've read this
 
05:45:33.048 --> 05:45:33.058 align:start position:0%
multiple times I'm pretty familiar with
 
05:45:35.868 --> 05:45:35.878 align:start position:0%
these issues this does not apply at all
 
05:45:38.030 --> 05:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
to classroom issues classroom issues
 
05:45:41.390 --> 05:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
have been a are a problem and when there
 
05:45:43.730 --> 05:45:43.740 align:start position:0%
are you know professors who don't have
 
05:45:46.310 --> 05:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
that excellent you know ethic that we
 
05:45:48.830 --> 05:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
just heard that has been an issue in
 
05:45:50.090 --> 05:45:50.100 align:start position:0%
classrooms this bill doesn't address
 
05:45:51.430 --> 05:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
that at all
 
05:45:54.350 --> 05:45:54.360 align:start position:0%
it doesn't Address speech in classrooms
 
05:45:55.368 --> 05:45:55.378 align:start position:0%
that's that's not what this bill
 
05:45:58.430 --> 05:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
addresses shout Downs this does not
 
05:46:00.530 --> 05:46:00.540 align:start position:0%
create a cause of action for a student
 
05:46:03.590 --> 05:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
to sue over being censored or a speaker
 
05:46:05.330 --> 05:46:05.340 align:start position:0%
it doesn't create a cause of action for
 
05:46:07.970 --> 05:46:07.980 align:start position:0%
that but what it does make very clear
 
05:46:10.250 --> 05:46:10.260 align:start position:0%
is that shout Downs are not protected
 
05:46:12.288 --> 05:46:12.298 align:start position:0%
speech under this bill so if you're
 
05:46:14.330 --> 05:46:14.340 align:start position:0%
blocking access physically blocking
 
05:46:16.610 --> 05:46:16.620 align:start position:0%
access threatening violence against a
 
05:46:18.350 --> 05:46:18.360 align:start position:0%
speaker that's not protected speech
 
05:46:21.048 --> 05:46:21.058 align:start position:0%
that's what this portion does so it
 
05:46:22.010 --> 05:46:22.020 align:start position:0%
basically makes it very clear
 
05:46:25.490 --> 05:46:25.500 align:start position:0%
universities can apply their policies to
 
05:46:27.410 --> 05:46:27.420 align:start position:0%
against protesters who are actually
 
05:46:29.930 --> 05:46:29.940 align:start position:0%
restricting other people's ability to
 
05:46:32.150 --> 05:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
have free speech as well so but it
 
05:46:33.530 --> 05:46:33.540 align:start position:0%
doesn't create a cause of action and
 
05:46:35.390 --> 05:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
specifically restrict that if that makes
 
05:46:37.610 --> 05:46:37.620 align:start position:0%
sense so those I just want to clarify
 
05:46:39.410 --> 05:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
those two ambiguities
 
05:46:41.628 --> 05:46:41.638 align:start position:0%
the university said this could raise the
 
05:46:43.730 --> 05:46:43.740 align:start position:0%
cost of litigation I don't think that's
 
05:46:45.650 --> 05:46:45.660 align:start position:0%
actually the case in fact I think it
 
05:46:48.288 --> 05:46:48.298 align:start position:0%
could lower the potential liability to
 
05:46:50.750 --> 05:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
the state if the universities look at
 
05:46:52.730 --> 05:46:52.740 align:start position:0%
these requirements and they abide by
 
05:46:52.740 --> 05:46:53.510 align:start position:0%
these requirements and they abide by
them

05:46:53.510 --> 05:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:46:55.310 --> 05:46:55.320 align:start position:0%
then they are going to be much less
 
05:46:57.890 --> 05:46:57.900 align:start position:0%
likely to be sued if they don't abide by
 
05:47:00.288 --> 05:47:00.298 align:start position:0%
them then it could be the fact that I
 
05:47:01.368 --> 05:47:01.378 align:start position:0%
have to come and Sue the university
 
05:47:04.368 --> 05:47:04.378 align:start position:0%
under 1983 under the First Amendment and
 
05:47:06.530 --> 05:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
get attorney's fees there so I don't
 
05:47:08.448 --> 05:47:08.458 align:start position:0%
think that there's any increased cost to
 
05:47:10.208 --> 05:47:10.218 align:start position:0%
the university system or the state
 
05:47:12.830 --> 05:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
bypassing this bill all it does is give
 
05:47:15.650 --> 05:47:15.660 align:start position:0%
teeth to Common Sense principles that
 
05:47:17.090 --> 05:47:17.100 align:start position:0%
the university should be abiding by
 
05:47:17.100 --> 05:47:22.010 align:start position:0%
the university should be abiding by
anyway

05:47:22.010 --> 05:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:23.628 --> 05:47:23.638 align:start position:0%
I think those are the primary issues
 
05:47:25.670 --> 05:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
that I seemed like this uh this
 
05:47:26.930 --> 05:47:26.940 align:start position:0%
committee had questions with I'm happy
 
05:47:28.548 --> 05:47:28.558 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions if you have so
 
05:47:31.190 --> 05:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
can you clarify something for me then
 
05:47:33.650 --> 05:47:33.660 align:start position:0%
um when I'm looking at definition on
 
05:47:35.030 --> 05:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
campus here it talks about Campus
 
05:47:37.788 --> 05:47:37.798 align:start position:0%
Community it talks about outdoor areas
 
05:47:40.490 --> 05:47:40.500 align:start position:0%
of Campus so immediately my mind says
 
05:47:42.470 --> 05:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
well there must be indoor areas to
 
05:47:44.270 --> 05:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
campus as well
 
05:47:48.590 --> 05:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
so do you see the statement on line 20
 
05:47:51.350 --> 05:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
6 27 page two
 
05:47:54.530 --> 05:47:54.540 align:start position:0%
as providing this bill some ambiguity in
 
05:47:56.270 --> 05:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
terms of nothing in this section shall
 
05:47:57.650 --> 05:47:57.660 align:start position:0%
be interpreted as limiting the right of
 
05:48:00.048 --> 05:48:00.058 align:start position:0%
student expression Elsewhere on campus
 
05:48:03.890 --> 05:48:03.900 align:start position:0%
Are We Now talking into our campus
 
05:48:06.530 --> 05:48:06.540 align:start position:0%
oh and I so any bill that says nothing
 
05:48:09.830 --> 05:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
in this shall reinterpreted to limit the
 
05:48:12.470 --> 05:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
rights elsewhere so if it's all that
 
05:48:15.110 --> 05:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
means is when we say you're allowed to
 
05:48:16.670 --> 05:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
speak Outdoors
 
05:48:18.410 --> 05:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
we're not saying you're not allowed to
 
05:48:19.910 --> 05:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
speak indoors we're just not speaking to
 
05:48:22.128 --> 05:48:22.138 align:start position:0%
it so this legislation just does not
 
05:48:25.310 --> 05:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
speak to indoor expression if that makes
 
05:48:25.320 --> 05:48:27.170 align:start position:0%
speak to indoor expression if that makes
sense

05:48:27.170 --> 05:48:27.180 align:start position:0%
sense
 
05:48:30.650 --> 05:48:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:34.368 --> 05:48:34.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:39.110 --> 05:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:39.120 --> 05:48:54.470 align:start position:0%

05:48:54.470 --> 05:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:56.628 --> 05:48:56.638 align:start position:0%
good afternoon

05:49:05.628 --> 05:49:05.638 align:start position:0%
day for you guys
 
05:49:08.030 --> 05:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
um my name is Kelly McLean I'm
 
05:49:09.830 --> 05:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
presenting on behalf of first Liberty
 
05:49:12.110 --> 05:49:12.120 align:start position:0%
Institute we are the nation's largest
 
05:49:15.410 --> 05:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
Law Firm dedicated exclusively to BR to
 
05:49:16.850 --> 05:49:16.860 align:start position:0%
defending and restoring religious
 
05:49:19.610 --> 05:49:19.620 align:start position:0%
liberty for all Americans
 
05:49:22.490 --> 05:49:22.500 align:start position:0%
we represent Jeffrey ozanne and Gabby
 
05:49:24.708 --> 05:49:24.718 align:start position:0%
ospina who you will be hearing from a
 
05:49:26.690 --> 05:49:26.700 align:start position:0%
little bit later
 
05:49:28.430 --> 05:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
and the other student leaders of the
 
05:49:31.970 --> 05:49:31.980 align:start position:0%
free exercise Coalition or the FEC at
 
05:49:33.530 --> 05:49:33.540 align:start position:0%
the University of New Hampshire Franklin
 
05:49:36.650 --> 05:49:36.660 align:start position:0%
Pierce School of Law also known as unh
 
05:49:39.470 --> 05:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
most of my testimony a lot of you have
 
05:49:41.930 --> 05:49:41.940 align:start position:0%
asked you know is this something that
 
05:49:44.690 --> 05:49:44.700 align:start position:0%
keeps happening how like is this
 
05:49:46.490 --> 05:49:46.500 align:start position:0%
something that needs to be addressed so
 
05:49:48.830 --> 05:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
hopefully my testimony and theirs will
 
05:49:52.190 --> 05:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:55.070 --> 05:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
um as my clients will explain
 
05:49:57.410 --> 05:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
last November the group applied to
 
05:49:59.708 --> 05:49:59.718 align:start position:0%
establish its inaugural campus location
 
05:50:02.690 --> 05:50:02.700 align:start position:0%
however instead of administratively
 
05:50:04.368 --> 05:50:04.378 align:start position:0%
approving the student group the law
 
05:50:06.948 --> 05:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
school student Bar Association tabled
 
05:50:08.690 --> 05:50:08.700 align:start position:0%
its application after publicly
 
05:50:11.448 --> 05:50:11.458 align:start position:0%
questioning its sincere the sincerity of
 
05:50:13.670 --> 05:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
its members religious beliefs
 
05:50:15.948 --> 05:50:15.958 align:start position:0%
first Liberty sent a demand letter
 
05:50:18.048 --> 05:50:18.058 align:start position:0%
explaining why the school's decision was
 
05:50:18.058 --> 05:50:20.030 align:start position:0%
explaining why the school's decision was
unconstitutional

05:50:20.030 --> 05:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
05:50:22.430 --> 05:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
almost two months after the SBA meeting
 
05:50:24.770 --> 05:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
our clients the FEC were granted
 
05:50:26.570 --> 05:50:26.580 align:start position:0%
official recognition as a student group
 
05:50:30.410 --> 05:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
but not by the SBA the SBA refused to
 
05:50:32.690 --> 05:50:32.700 align:start position:0%
act and deferred to the UNH law
 
05:50:34.910 --> 05:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
administration instead
 
05:50:37.070 --> 05:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
this is not the type of tolerance or
 
05:50:39.470 --> 05:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
free inquiry anyone should expect at one
 
05:50:41.810 --> 05:50:41.820 align:start position:0%
of our nation's law schools
 
05:50:44.330 --> 05:50:44.340 align:start position:0%
like our senior Council Jeremy dyes said
 
05:50:46.730 --> 05:50:46.740 align:start position:0%
it is simply inexcusable and
 
05:50:48.770 --> 05:50:48.780 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional for any University to
 
05:50:51.650 --> 05:50:51.660 align:start position:0%
hold itself out as tolerant diverse and
 
05:50:51.660 --> 05:50:52.788 align:start position:0%
hold itself out as tolerant diverse and
welcoming

05:50:52.788 --> 05:50:52.798 align:start position:0%
welcoming
 
05:50:54.590 --> 05:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
but then exclude students because of
 
05:50:56.510 --> 05:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
their religious viewpoint
 
05:50:58.310 --> 05:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
federal law makes clear that it is
 
05:50:59.930 --> 05:50:59.940 align:start position:0%
unlawful to discriminate against
 
05:51:02.090 --> 05:51:02.100 align:start position:0%
organizations and individuals on the
 
05:51:04.250 --> 05:51:04.260 align:start position:0%
basis of religion
 
05:51:06.288 --> 05:51:06.298 align:start position:0%
UNH law failed its duty to the
 
05:51:08.030 --> 05:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
constitution in protecting the civil
 
05:51:11.570 --> 05:51:11.580 align:start position:0%
rights of the FEC instead treated their
 
05:51:13.788 --> 05:51:13.798 align:start position:0%
religious beliefs with content public
 
05:51:16.190 --> 05:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
scorn and hostility
 
05:51:17.810 --> 05:51:17.820 align:start position:0%
it has settled law that the First
 
05:51:19.310 --> 05:51:19.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment rights of speech and
 
05:51:21.830 --> 05:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
Association extend to campuses of state
 
05:51:25.190 --> 05:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
universities widmar V Benson
 
05:51:27.288 --> 05:51:27.298 align:start position:0%
in this case and several others the
 
05:51:29.628 --> 05:51:29.638 align:start position:0%
course upheld the students at American
 
05:51:31.548 --> 05:51:31.558 align:start position:0%
universities are entitled to express
 
05:51:34.548 --> 05:51:34.558 align:start position:0%
their beliefs on campus as well as by
 
05:51:36.770 --> 05:51:36.780 align:start position:0%
associate with students that share those
 
05:51:36.780 --> 05:51:37.910 align:start position:0%
associate with students that share those
beliefs

05:51:37.910 --> 05:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
beliefs
 
05:51:39.770 --> 05:51:39.780 align:start position:0%
is the responsibility of a State
 
05:51:41.510 --> 05:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
University to ensure that students
 
05:51:43.850 --> 05:51:43.860 align:start position:0%
wishing to associate receive even-handed
 
05:51:47.330 --> 05:51:47.340 align:start position:0%
treatment under university leadership
 
05:51:49.430 --> 05:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
schools like UNH often fail to
 
05:51:51.170 --> 05:51:51.180 align:start position:0%
understand the seriousness of their
 
05:51:53.570 --> 05:51:53.580 align:start position:0%
actions and refuse to recognize the
 
05:51:55.610 --> 05:51:55.620 align:start position:0%
liability that these actions place on
 
05:51:58.010 --> 05:51:58.020 align:start position:0%
the School faculty and staff
 
05:52:00.048 --> 05:52:00.058 align:start position:0%
just within the past two years two
 
05:52:02.030 --> 05:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
federal circuit courts of appeal and one
 
05:52:03.948 --> 05:52:03.958 align:start position:0%
Federal District Court rejected
 
05:52:06.350 --> 05:52:06.360 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity defenses and imposed
 
05:52:07.788 --> 05:52:07.798 align:start position:0%
personal liability on University
 
05:52:10.368 --> 05:52:10.378 align:start position:0%
officials whose actions affirmed the
 
05:52:12.708 --> 05:52:12.718 align:start position:0%
same level of intolerance and hostility
 
05:52:17.270 --> 05:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
towards religion on display at UNH law
 
05:52:19.310 --> 05:52:19.320 align:start position:0%
it should not take a demand letter for
 
05:52:23.030 --> 05:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
UNH law SBA to comply with obligations
 
05:52:25.070 --> 05:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
of the U.S Constitution
 
05:52:27.470 --> 05:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
to respect religious organization's
 
05:52:30.470 --> 05:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
presence and its speech on campus
 
05:52:32.628 --> 05:52:32.638 align:start position:0%
in conclusion public colleges and
 
05:52:34.070 --> 05:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
universities are bound by the free
 
05:52:36.048 --> 05:52:36.058 align:start position:0%
exercise clause of the First Amendment
 
05:52:38.390 --> 05:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
and cannot base their policy decisions
 
05:52:41.208 --> 05:52:41.218 align:start position:0%
on hostility towards religion or desire
 
05:52:44.208 --> 05:52:44.218 align:start position:0%
to exclude a religious viewpoint
 
05:52:47.090 --> 05:52:47.100 align:start position:0%
which to which they disagree
 
05:52:50.390 --> 05:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
while the law is clear cases like fecs
 
05:52:52.010 --> 05:52:52.020 align:start position:0%
keep happening
 
05:52:54.288 --> 05:52:54.298 align:start position:0%
I hope you will carefully consider HB
 
05:52:57.530 --> 05:52:57.540 align:start position:0%
516 and any bill that points back to the
 
05:52:58.910 --> 05:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
protections of free speech and
 
05:53:00.590 --> 05:53:00.600 align:start position:0%
Association laid out in our first
 
05:53:00.600 --> 05:53:02.150 align:start position:0%
Association laid out in our first
amendment

05:53:02.150 --> 05:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:53:04.430 --> 05:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
I will submit my written testimony I
 
05:53:06.948 --> 05:53:06.958 align:start position:0%

05:53:13.190 --> 05:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
UNH law this includes all the settled
 
05:53:15.590 --> 05:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
law I referenced in my testimony plus
 
05:53:17.750 --> 05:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
several others
 
05:53:19.670 --> 05:53:19.680 align:start position:0%

05:53:56.208 --> 05:53:56.218 align:start position:0%
hello Mr chairman Vice chairman and
 
05:53:58.310 --> 05:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is Jeff
 
05:54:00.350 --> 05:54:00.360 align:start position:0%
ozan and I'm currently a hybrid JD
 
05:54:02.628 --> 05:54:02.638 align:start position:0%
student at UNH law and the president of
 
05:54:05.690 --> 05:54:05.700 align:start position:0%
the free exercise Coalition or FEC last
 
05:54:07.610 --> 05:54:07.620 align:start position:0%
year a group of law school students and
 
05:54:10.250 --> 05:54:10.260 align:start position:0%
myself started FEC so that our religious
 
05:54:12.590 --> 05:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
beliefs and those of other students may
 
05:54:15.048 --> 05:54:15.058 align:start position:0%
be better represented on campus we built
 
05:54:17.030 --> 05:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
our organization with one goal to equip
 
05:54:18.890 --> 05:54:18.900 align:start position:0%
and enable the religious student in
 
05:54:20.510 --> 05:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
sharing their beliefs in this Melting
 
05:54:23.030 --> 05:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
Pot we call Law School we believe that a
 
05:54:24.530 --> 05:54:24.540 align:start position:0%
public law school should have a healthy
 
05:54:26.270 --> 05:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
balance of perspectives something we
 
05:54:28.310 --> 05:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
thought was missing on our campus to do
 
05:54:30.288 --> 05:54:30.298 align:start position:0%
so we created FPC to be run by
 
05:54:32.330 --> 05:54:32.340 align:start position:0%
like-minded Believers unashamed of
 
05:54:34.310 --> 05:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
sharing our beliefs and willing to equip
 
05:54:36.470 --> 05:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
religious students of all Creeds to do
 
05:54:38.750 --> 05:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
the same these student leaders of FEC
 
05:54:40.610 --> 05:54:40.620 align:start position:0%
created and publicly subscribed to a
 
05:54:42.470 --> 05:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
statement of our beliefs that ensured
 
05:54:44.390 --> 05:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
that the organization has run consistent
 
05:54:46.368 --> 05:54:46.378 align:start position:0%
with this founding and certain canons of
 
05:54:49.070 --> 05:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
interpretation this statement embodies a
 
05:54:50.930 --> 05:54:50.940 align:start position:0%
very expression of religion we thought
 
05:54:54.230 --> 05:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
could be a better exercise on campus
 
05:54:56.510 --> 05:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
Deputy board believes that it is okay
 
05:54:57.890 --> 05:54:57.900 align:start position:0%
for law school students to have
 
05:54:59.750 --> 05:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
traditional Christian values and we
 
05:55:01.250 --> 05:55:01.260 align:start position:0%
believe that it is legal and yes
 
05:55:03.170 --> 05:55:03.180 align:start position:0%
necessary to share these values during
 
05:55:05.990 --> 05:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
our law school experience for instance I
 
05:55:07.310 --> 05:55:07.320 align:start position:0%
personally believe that our creator
 
05:55:09.230 --> 05:55:09.240 align:start position:0%
wishes to spend
 
05:55:11.150 --> 05:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
eternity with each and every person I
 
05:55:13.368 --> 05:55:13.378 align:start position:0%
believe that our sin separates us from
 
05:55:15.650 --> 05:55:15.660 align:start position:0%
our creator so our creator sent his one
 
05:55:17.990 --> 05:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
and only son to die and atone for our
 
05:55:20.448 --> 05:55:20.458 align:start position:0%
sins through faith in this love that the
 
05:55:22.910 --> 05:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
Son of God Jesus Christ died and rose
 
05:55:25.670 --> 05:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
again for our sins women be granted the
 
05:55:27.650 --> 05:55:27.660 align:start position:0%
free gift of eternal life of our crater
 
05:55:30.650 --> 05:55:30.660 align:start position:0%
and I knew I would do that there but uh
 
05:55:33.170 --> 05:55:33.180 align:start position:0%
now for the free exercise coalition to
 
05:55:34.670 --> 05:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
be a working student organization on
 
05:55:36.770 --> 05:55:36.780 align:start position:0%
campus we had to pursue affiliation
 
05:55:38.868 --> 05:55:38.878 align:start position:0%
through the student Board Association or
 
05:55:40.430 --> 05:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
the SBA
 
05:55:42.470 --> 05:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
prior to the SBA meeting to recognize
 
05:55:43.910 --> 05:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
our affiliation we submitted an
 
05:55:45.350 --> 05:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
application which included information
 
05:55:47.390 --> 05:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
about our organization including the
 
05:55:49.490 --> 05:55:49.500 align:start position:0%
statement of our beliefs from the start
 
05:55:51.530 --> 05:55:51.540 align:start position:0%
of the SBA affiliation meeting it was
 
05:55:53.208 --> 05:55:53.218 align:start position:0%
clear that our statement of police was
 
05:55:55.490 --> 05:55:55.500 align:start position:0%
an issue for the SBA the SBA spent
 
05:55:57.170 --> 05:55:57.180 align:start position:0%
nearly an hour inquiring about the
 
05:55:59.868 --> 05:55:59.878 align:start position:0%
specifics of our beliefs this SBA in
 
05:56:01.250 --> 05:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
concert with our fellow law school
 
05:56:03.410 --> 05:56:03.420 align:start position:0%
students didn't stop him aligning just
 
05:56:05.270 --> 05:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
our beliefs and organization they went
 
05:56:06.830 --> 05:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
so far to personally attack us for
 
05:56:08.810 --> 05:56:08.820 align:start position:0%
holding those beliefs for instance we
 
05:56:10.850 --> 05:56:10.860 align:start position:0%
were publicly shamed and labeled hateful
 
05:56:14.208 --> 05:56:14.218 align:start position:0%
bigots oppressors for sharing what we
 
05:56:16.788 --> 05:56:16.798 align:start position:0%
believe about God's truth even after the
 
05:56:18.708 --> 05:56:18.718 align:start position:0%
Christian legal Society had admonished
 
05:56:20.990 --> 05:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
the same SBA just a couple months prior
 
05:56:23.090 --> 05:56:23.100 align:start position:0%
for attacking their religious police the
 
05:56:25.010 --> 05:56:25.020 align:start position:0%
space still used the content of our
 
05:56:27.708 --> 05:56:27.718 align:start position:0%
religious beliefs as basis to refuse the
 
05:56:29.650 --> 05:56:29.660 align:start position:0%
affiliation of our franchise Coalition
 
05:56:31.970 --> 05:56:31.980 align:start position:0%
it even appears that in the wake of
 
05:56:34.070 --> 05:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
religious student organizations our own
 
05:56:35.448 --> 05:56:35.458 align:start position:0%
law school has been seeking to implement
 
05:56:37.910 --> 05:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
an all-commerce policy which would
 
05:56:39.350 --> 05:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
pretextually ban any student
 
05:56:41.270 --> 05:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
organization that requires its
 
05:56:43.010 --> 05:56:43.020 align:start position:0%
leadership to subscribe to a statement
 
05:56:45.288 --> 05:56:45.298 align:start position:0%
of beliefs like every faith-based group
 
05:56:47.990 --> 05:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
these actions by the law school and its
 
05:56:50.090 --> 05:56:50.100 align:start position:0%
SBA show up fundamental disregard for
 
05:56:51.650 --> 05:56:51.660 align:start position:0%
the First Amendment and the policies at
 
05:56:54.708 --> 05:56:54.718 align:start position:0%
play in every Public University FEC knew
 
05:56:55.910 --> 05:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
that our religious beliefs would not be
 
05:56:57.708 --> 05:56:57.718 align:start position:0%
widely accepted in the halls of modern
 
05:57:00.350 --> 05:57:00.360 align:start position:0%
Academia that is exactly why we believe
 
05:57:02.510 --> 05:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
our organization is important however
 
05:57:05.208 --> 05:57:05.218 align:start position:0%
what FTC did not expect is that a law
 
05:57:07.250 --> 05:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
school and a students could be so
 
05:57:09.110 --> 05:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
uninformed on the protections of the
 
05:57:10.730 --> 05:57:10.740 align:start position:0%
First Amendment
 
05:57:12.590 --> 05:57:12.600 align:start position:0%
not knowing where to turn the frick size
 
05:57:13.788 --> 05:57:13.798 align:start position:0%
Coalition reached out to the first
 
05:57:16.250 --> 05:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
Liberty Institute a non-profit Law Firm
 
05:57:18.350 --> 05:57:18.360 align:start position:0%
concerned with religious liberty for all
 
05:57:20.448 --> 05:57:20.458 align:start position:0%
charging nothing first Liberty came in
 
05:57:23.090 --> 05:57:23.100 align:start position:0%
and defended our right to exist and be a
 
05:57:24.708 --> 05:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
useful contributor to the ideas on
 
05:57:26.990 --> 05:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
campus at our next affiliation meeting
 
05:57:30.410 --> 05:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
the SBA our peers once again refused to
 
05:57:33.170 --> 05:57:33.180 align:start position:0%
vote on our affiliation a continued and
 
05:57:35.110 --> 05:57:35.120 align:start position:0%
tacit disapproval of our existence
 
05:57:37.310 --> 05:57:37.320 align:start position:0%
instead the law school administration
 
05:57:39.410 --> 05:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
now informed of the first amendment by
 
05:57:41.690 --> 05:57:41.700 align:start position:0%
first Liberty took over and did what the
 
05:57:43.548 --> 05:57:43.558 align:start position:0%
SBA refused to do approve the free
 
05:57:45.830 --> 05:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
exercise Coalition as a UNH lawsuit
 
05:57:45.840 --> 05:57:47.150 align:start position:0%
exercise Coalition as a UNH lawsuit
organization

05:57:47.150 --> 05:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
organization
 
05:57:49.490 --> 05:57:49.500 align:start position:0%
I wish I could end this testimony here
 
05:57:51.830 --> 05:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
however it seems every step forward by
 
05:57:54.830 --> 05:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
FEC is resisted for instance during the
 
05:57:56.628 --> 05:57:56.638 align:start position:0%
turmoil of our affiliation we
 
05:57:59.270 --> 05:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
inexplicably lost our faculty advisor a
 
05:58:01.690 --> 05:58:01.700 align:start position:0%
necessary prerequisite to affiliation
 
05:58:04.430 --> 05:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
UNH law has not yet appointed a faculty
 
05:58:06.410 --> 05:58:06.420 align:start position:0%
advisor for FEC that is willing to
 
05:58:08.150 --> 05:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
assist and advocate for our group
 
05:58:10.970 --> 05:58:10.980 align:start position:0%
moreover the free excise Coalition and
 
05:58:12.890 --> 05:58:12.900 align:start position:0%
the Christian legal Society has joined
 
05:58:15.230 --> 05:58:15.240 align:start position:0%
together to offer the Christian students
 
05:58:17.390 --> 05:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
a symbol that they are indeed accepted
 
05:58:20.090 --> 05:58:20.100 align:start position:0%
as an important part of campus life we
 
05:58:21.410 --> 05:58:21.420 align:start position:0%
have requested to hang the Christian
 
05:58:23.750 --> 05:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
flag on campus just as other students
 
05:58:25.490 --> 05:58:25.500 align:start position:0%
and Civic groups have hung Flags
 
05:58:27.590 --> 05:58:27.600 align:start position:0%
supporting their causes for instance
 
05:58:30.948 --> 05:58:30.958 align:start position:0%
cultural art cultural art displays black
 
05:58:33.890 --> 05:58:33.900 align:start position:0%
history displays the pride flag have all
 
05:58:36.650 --> 05:58:36.660 align:start position:0%
hung on campus and been displayed on
 
05:58:39.288 --> 05:58:39.298 align:start position:0%
campus for Years yet when we request to
 
05:58:41.090 --> 05:58:41.100 align:start position:0%
display this religious symbol the law
 
05:58:42.948 --> 05:58:42.958 align:start position:0%
school continues to delay and inform us
 
05:58:45.770 --> 05:58:45.780 align:start position:0%
that quote unquote this request provides
 
05:58:47.390 --> 05:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for our law school to
 
05:58:49.490 --> 05:58:49.500 align:start position:0%
formalize a policy with respect to the
 
05:58:52.190 --> 05:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
display of flags at the law school while
 
05:58:53.868 --> 05:58:53.878 align:start position:0%
numerous displays of other social and
 
05:58:56.150 --> 05:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
Civic groups are exhibited ours is slow
 
05:58:58.310 --> 05:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
walked in nored and sidelined we're
 
05:58:59.990 --> 05:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
simply asking that we be treated like
 
05:59:01.788 --> 05:59:01.798 align:start position:0%
other students and student groups on
 
05:59:01.798 --> 05:59:02.628 align:start position:0%
other students and student groups on
campus

05:59:02.628 --> 05:59:02.638 align:start position:0%
campus
 
05:59:05.690 --> 05:59:05.700 align:start position:0%
to conclude intentionally or not UNH law
 
05:59:07.190 --> 05:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
has made us feel marginalized as
 
05:59:09.530 --> 05:59:09.540 align:start position:0%
students centering religious viewpoints
 
05:59:11.270 --> 05:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
from even entering student conversation
 
05:59:13.910 --> 05:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
if your traditional Christian on campus
 
05:59:16.070 --> 05:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
you must not share your beliefs let
 
05:59:17.690 --> 05:59:17.700 align:start position:0%
alone operate a student organization
 
05:59:20.510 --> 05:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
consistent with those beliefs lest you
 
05:59:22.970 --> 05:59:22.980 align:start position:0%
be viciously attacked and ostracized and
 
05:59:24.948 --> 05:59:24.958 align:start position:0%
potentially worse maybe your existence
 
05:59:27.110 --> 05:59:27.120 align:start position:0%
as a religious student on campus will
 
05:59:29.030 --> 05:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
spur the law school to create a new
 
05:59:31.610 --> 05:59:31.620 align:start position:0%
General application policy to limit your
 
05:59:34.010 --> 05:59:34.020 align:start position:0%
freedom of expression there's much work
 
05:59:35.510 --> 05:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
to be done to educate New Hampshire's
 
05:59:37.788 --> 05:59:37.798 align:start position:0%
law school and students about the extent
 
05:59:39.590 --> 05:59:39.600 align:start position:0%
of the First Amendment this Marketplace
 
05:59:41.750 --> 05:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
of ideas and religions placed in the
 
05:59:43.788 --> 05:59:43.798 align:start position:0%
conversation the pre-exis Coalition
 
05:59:46.430 --> 05:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
exists for such a purpose and we hope
 
05:59:48.170 --> 05:59:48.180 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire legislature will
 
05:59:50.090 --> 05:59:50.100 align:start position:0%
carefully consider the free speech and
 
05:59:53.208 --> 05:59:53.218 align:start position:0%
Association protections of HB 516 could
 
05:59:55.610 --> 05:59:55.620 align:start position:0%
offer to FEC and future students at UNH
 
05:59:57.170 --> 05:59:57.180 align:start position:0%
law thank you for your time and
 
05:59:59.090 --> 05:59:59.100 align:start position:0%

06:00:51.530 --> 06:00:51.540 align:start position:0%
and I'm a devout Catholic
 
06:00:54.530 --> 06:00:54.540 align:start position:0%
last November Jeff approached me with
 
06:00:57.048 --> 06:00:57.058 align:start position:0%
the idea of starting a group at the law
 
06:00:58.548 --> 06:00:58.558 align:start position:0%
school with the mission of advocating
 
06:01:01.010 --> 06:01:01.020 align:start position:0%
for and protecting religious Liberties
 
06:01:02.868 --> 06:01:02.878 align:start position:0%
on campus
 
06:01:04.548 --> 06:01:04.558 align:start position:0%
our Law School
 
06:01:06.350 --> 06:01:06.360 align:start position:0%
and in fact I
 
06:01:08.930 --> 06:01:08.940 align:start position:0%
could have really used a group like this
 
06:01:11.750 --> 06:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
as a Catholic holy week is the most
 
06:01:14.628 --> 06:01:14.638 align:start position:0%
important week of the year even more so
 
06:01:17.208 --> 06:01:17.218 align:start position:0%
than the Christmas season every day has
 
06:01:19.310 --> 06:01:19.320 align:start position:0%
a purpose and a religious practice to
 
06:01:22.070 --> 06:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
participate in in preparation for Easter
 
06:01:22.080 --> 06:01:23.090 align:start position:0%
participate in in preparation for Easter
Sunday

06:01:23.090 --> 06:01:23.100 align:start position:0%
Sunday
 
06:01:25.610 --> 06:01:25.620 align:start position:0%
that week is the culmination of 40 days
 
06:01:28.250 --> 06:01:28.260 align:start position:0%
of intentional fasting praying and
 
06:01:28.260 --> 06:01:29.990 align:start position:0%
of intentional fasting praying and
almsgiving

06:01:29.990 --> 06:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
almsgiving
 
06:01:32.990 --> 06:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
it is a spiritually transformative week
 
06:01:35.208 --> 06:01:35.218 align:start position:0%
that I missed out on on my first year of
 
06:01:38.090 --> 06:01:38.100 align:start position:0%
law school because I didn't know who or
 
06:01:39.948 --> 06:01:39.958 align:start position:0%
how to ask for a religious accommodation
 
06:01:43.670 --> 06:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
in my classes or even if I could
 
06:01:45.770 --> 06:01:45.780 align:start position:0%
I was scared of anyone knowing who I am
 
06:01:47.390 --> 06:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
and what I believe in
 
06:01:49.190 --> 06:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
I was scared of being judged for my
 
06:01:49.200 --> 06:01:50.270 align:start position:0%
I was scared of being judged for my
beliefs

06:01:50.270 --> 06:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
beliefs
 
06:01:52.670 --> 06:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
and because of that fear and isolation I
 
06:01:55.128 --> 06:01:55.138 align:start position:0%
struggled during Holy Week to balance my
 
06:01:57.288 --> 06:01:57.298 align:start position:0%
religious practices with my academic
 
06:01:57.298 --> 06:01:59.090 align:start position:0%
religious practices with my academic
responsibilities

06:01:59.090 --> 06:01:59.100 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
06:02:01.610 --> 06:02:01.620 align:start position:0%
so when Jeff approached me with the idea
 
06:02:03.948 --> 06:02:03.958 align:start position:0%
of forming this group I saw very clearly
 
06:02:05.810 --> 06:02:05.820 align:start position:0%
a space in our law school where the
 
06:02:08.570 --> 06:02:08.580 align:start position:0%
group could help its students like me to
 
06:02:11.030 --> 06:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
avoid fear and isolation
 
06:02:13.010 --> 06:02:13.020 align:start position:0%
within a week we had a name the free
 
06:02:16.010 --> 06:02:16.020 align:start position:0%
exercise Coalition a mission to protect
 
06:02:18.288 --> 06:02:18.298 align:start position:0%
and defend religious Liberties and we
 
06:02:20.628 --> 06:02:20.638 align:start position:0%
also included a statement of faith for
 
06:02:23.030 --> 06:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
board members an essential component to
 
06:02:24.590 --> 06:02:24.600 align:start position:0%
ensure that the leadership of the group
 
06:02:26.810 --> 06:02:26.820 align:start position:0%
would truly protect even the most
 
06:02:29.510 --> 06:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
unpopular religious beliefs
 
06:02:31.970 --> 06:02:31.980 align:start position:0%
we submitted the application to the SBA
 
06:02:35.930 --> 06:02:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:38.510 --> 06:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
I'm aware that my religious beliefs are
 
06:02:40.970 --> 06:02:40.980 align:start position:0%
bold and that people disagree with me as
 
06:02:43.070 --> 06:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
is their right to
 
06:02:45.410 --> 06:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
but I never imagined we would be treated
 
06:02:46.970 --> 06:02:46.980 align:start position:0%
the way that we were at the SBA
 
06:02:49.310 --> 06:02:49.320 align:start position:0%
affiliation meeting
 
06:02:52.128 --> 06:02:52.138 align:start position:0%
um by law students and by faculty of the
 
06:02:54.288 --> 06:02:54.298 align:start position:0%
law school we were interrogated about
 
06:02:55.850 --> 06:02:55.860 align:start position:0%
our statement of faith
 
06:02:58.490 --> 06:02:58.500 align:start position:0%
called bigots oppressors
 
06:03:01.368 --> 06:03:01.378 align:start position:0%
and a problem the university needs to
 
06:03:04.010 --> 06:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:07.250 --> 06:03:07.260 align:start position:0%
the problem that is what I am all they
 
06:03:10.368 --> 06:03:10.378 align:start position:0%
knew about us was a short list of our
 
06:03:12.530 --> 06:03:12.540 align:start position:0%
shared religious beliefs and that was
 
06:03:14.390 --> 06:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
sufficient evidence to label me a
 
06:03:14.400 --> 06:03:16.610 align:start position:0%
sufficient evidence to label me a
problem

06:03:16.610 --> 06:03:16.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:19.850 --> 06:03:19.860 align:start position:0%
but what truly hurt in that moment was
 
06:03:22.128 --> 06:03:22.138 align:start position:0%
that at the end of the meeting my
 
06:03:24.350 --> 06:03:24.360 align:start position:0%
associate Dean apologized to the
 
06:03:26.270 --> 06:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
students who had spent the last 30
 
06:03:29.090 --> 06:03:29.100 align:start position:0%
minutes disparaging our character
 
06:03:31.128 --> 06:03:31.138 align:start position:0%
up until that moment I had experienced
 
06:03:33.110 --> 06:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
only kindness and support from the
 
06:03:33.120 --> 06:03:34.190 align:start position:0%
only kindness and support from the
University

06:03:34.190 --> 06:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
University
 
06:03:36.170 --> 06:03:36.180 align:start position:0%
while I experienced medical issues that
 
06:03:39.350 --> 06:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:40.970 --> 06:03:40.980 align:start position:0%
they were supportive when my grandfather
 
06:03:43.310 --> 06:03:43.320 align:start position:0%
passed away during finals week of my
 
06:03:45.410 --> 06:03:45.420 align:start position:0%
first semester of Law School
 
06:03:47.570 --> 06:03:47.580 align:start position:0%
and it was very difficult to feel that
 
06:03:49.910 --> 06:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
support ripped out from underneath me in
 
06:03:52.670 --> 06:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
that moment when I needed it the most
 
06:03:54.830 --> 06:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for considering this bill and
 
06:03:56.930 --> 06:03:56.940 align:start position:0%

06:03:59.930 --> 06:03:59.940 align:start position:0%
to the First Amendment and freedom
 
06:04:02.448 --> 06:04:02.458 align:start position:0%

the state while taking courses
 
06:04:32.690 --> 06:04:32.700 align:start position:0%
asynchronously and also we are obligated
 
06:04:35.750 --> 06:04:35.760 align:start position:0%

my question
 
06:04:47.930 --> 06:04:47.940 align:start position:0%
could you just give us a little more
 
06:04:52.448 --> 06:04:52.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:56.810 --> 06:04:56.820 align:start position:0%

06:05:02.090 --> 06:05:02.100 align:start position:0%
statement of faith is yeah the statement
 
06:05:03.288 --> 06:05:03.298 align:start position:0%
of faith
 
06:05:05.750 --> 06:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
um we decided to keep it as a
 
06:05:08.930 --> 06:05:08.940 align:start position:0%
judeo-christian values that represented
 
06:05:11.510 --> 06:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
a wider range of beliefs while also kind
 
06:05:13.490 --> 06:05:13.500 align:start position:0%

again
 
06:05:20.150 --> 06:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
I think you may have just answered it
 
06:05:22.850 --> 06:05:22.860 align:start position:0%
was what faiths are represented in your
 
06:05:24.590 --> 06:05:24.600 align:start position:0%

the nation's largest Faith communities

with respect to their common commitment
 
06:06:36.530 --> 06:06:36.540 align:start position:0%
to First Amendment freedoms and I I
 
06:06:37.910 --> 06:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
don't say this is a matter of undue
 
06:06:39.650 --> 06:06:39.660 align:start position:0%
flattery that I have an opportunity to
 
06:06:42.590 --> 06:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
testify across the country and uh spent
 
06:06:44.510 --> 06:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
10 years in a state legislature myself
 
06:06:47.330 --> 06:06:47.340 align:start position:0%
and I will say both the the way in which
 
06:06:49.250 --> 06:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
this uh this hearing's been conducted
 
06:06:50.868 --> 06:06:50.878 align:start position:0%
the quality of the witnesses and the
 
06:06:52.850 --> 06:06:52.860 align:start position:0%
quality of the questions uh it's not
 
06:06:54.530 --> 06:06:54.540 align:start position:0%
what you see everywhere so I'm really
 
06:06:56.270 --> 06:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
it's been exciting to be here and a
 
06:06:58.250 --> 06:06:58.260 align:start position:0%
privilege I'm going to try to direct my
 
06:07:00.530 --> 06:07:00.540 align:start position:0%
question my comments to a few things
 
06:07:03.470 --> 06:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
that have arisen
 
06:07:05.270 --> 06:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
um that I think might be helpful one of
 
06:07:06.650 --> 06:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
the questions of why this might be
 
06:07:09.110 --> 06:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
needed in New Hampshire was answered in
 
06:07:11.150 --> 06:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
part by I think the the prior to folks
 
06:07:13.610 --> 06:07:13.620 align:start position:0%
who spoke but I will say I was very
 
06:07:17.270 --> 06:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
involved in Iowa in passage of similar
 
06:07:19.730 --> 06:07:19.740 align:start position:0%
legislation in 2019 and there's been
 
06:07:22.430 --> 06:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
some brief reference to a situation at
 
06:07:25.250 --> 06:07:25.260 align:start position:0%
the University of Iowa that arose that
 
06:07:28.250 --> 06:07:28.260 align:start position:0%
resulted in some uh some judgments and
 
06:07:30.288 --> 06:07:30.298 align:start position:0%
ultimately there were two cases decided
 
06:07:32.030 --> 06:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
at the eighth Court Circuit Court of
 
06:07:35.030 --> 06:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
Appeals in 2021 that ultimately between
 
06:07:37.430 --> 06:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
the two cases resulted in a two million
 
06:07:39.708 --> 06:07:39.718 align:start position:0%
dollar judgment against the university
 
06:07:42.230 --> 06:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
ultimately paid by taxpayers in that
 
06:07:44.810 --> 06:07:44.820 align:start position:0%
instance the eighth circuit determined
 
06:07:46.788 --> 06:07:46.798 align:start position:0%
that there was not qualified immunity
 
06:07:49.490 --> 06:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
for the University officials who had
 
06:07:51.708 --> 06:07:51.718 align:start position:0%
violated the associational rights of
 
06:07:54.048 --> 06:07:54.058 align:start position:0%
student groups on campus the university
 
06:07:57.110 --> 06:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
ultimately indemnified them and so did
 
06:07:59.270 --> 06:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
pay but they were found individually
 
06:08:02.090 --> 06:08:02.100 align:start position:0%
liable for their conduct and what
 
06:08:04.490 --> 06:08:04.500 align:start position:0%
happened there it was Viewpoint
 
06:08:07.250 --> 06:08:07.260 align:start position:0%
discrimination along exactly the lines
 
06:08:08.810 --> 06:08:08.820 align:start position:0%
that are being talked about here there
 
06:08:11.510 --> 06:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
was a tiny Evangelical campus ministry
 
06:08:14.150 --> 06:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
about 10 members that was told that
 
06:08:16.548 --> 06:08:16.558 align:start position:0%
because they had standard they required
 
06:08:18.890 --> 06:08:18.900 align:start position:0%
their board members to sign a statement
 
06:08:21.170 --> 06:08:21.180 align:start position:0%
of faith that they were excluded from
 
06:08:23.628 --> 06:08:23.638 align:start position:0%
con from being on campus the university
 
06:08:26.208 --> 06:08:26.218 align:start position:0%
when they were called to account with
 
06:08:27.830 --> 06:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
respect to that by a district court
 
06:08:29.628 --> 06:08:29.638 align:start position:0%
judge said well the way we can be equal
 
06:08:32.090 --> 06:08:32.100 align:start position:0%
is to kick all the religious groups off
 
06:08:34.368 --> 06:08:34.378 align:start position:0%
campus so Muslim groups sneak groups
 
06:08:37.250 --> 06:08:37.260 align:start position:0%
they were all kicked off campus for a
 
06:08:39.110 --> 06:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
period of time it went back to the same
 
06:08:40.970 --> 06:08:40.980 align:start position:0%
district court judge as you can imagine
 
06:08:44.868 --> 06:08:44.878 align:start position:0%
was not amused and but in the midst of
 
06:08:46.548 --> 06:08:46.558 align:start position:0%
this and this is really my point that
 
06:08:50.868 --> 06:08:50.878 align:start position:0%
all started in 2017. it was 2019 when
 
06:08:52.788 --> 06:08:52.798 align:start position:0%
the legislature passed and the governor
 
06:08:55.670 --> 06:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
signed a clarifying Bill to try to make
 
06:08:57.948 --> 06:08:57.958 align:start position:0%
sure that this didn't happen again in
 
06:08:59.868 --> 06:08:59.878 align:start position:0%
Iowa but I can guarantee you that when
 
06:09:02.570 --> 06:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
the Judgment ultimately came down in 21
 
06:09:04.368 --> 06:09:04.378 align:start position:0%
uh they wish they would have passed that
 
06:09:07.430 --> 06:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
bill in 16 or 17 and not have waited to
 
06:09:09.530 --> 06:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
19 until they were in the midst of a
 
06:09:13.128 --> 06:09:13.138 align:start position:0%
controversy uh my my strong belief and
 
06:09:15.470 --> 06:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
this particular associational rights
 
06:09:17.990 --> 06:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
language has been passed in 17 States at
 
06:09:20.750 --> 06:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
this point and my belief is that Clarity
 
06:09:22.610 --> 06:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
on this issue a relatively simple
 
06:09:25.670 --> 06:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
straightforward portion of the bill is
 
06:09:28.128 --> 06:09:28.138 align:start position:0%
conflict reducing it prevents litigation
 
06:09:29.570 --> 06:09:29.580 align:start position:0%
that should never happen in the first
 
06:09:31.730 --> 06:09:31.740 align:start position:0%
place no University student no Student
 
06:09:34.010 --> 06:09:34.020 align:start position:0%
Association should ever have to sue
 
06:09:37.010 --> 06:09:37.020 align:start position:0%
their own University simply to associate
 
06:09:39.830 --> 06:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
around common ideas in fact the ability
 
06:09:42.530 --> 06:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
to assemble to associate along common
 
06:09:46.190 --> 06:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
ideas and to do so without
 
06:09:49.670 --> 06:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh any kind of uh attempt by the
 
06:09:51.410 --> 06:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
university to say certain ideas are
 
06:09:52.970 --> 06:09:52.980 align:start position:0%
approved and certain ideas are not
 
06:09:55.310 --> 06:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
approved goes to the core from my
 
06:09:57.288 --> 06:09:57.298 align:start position:0%
perspective of teaching the values of
 
06:09:58.970 --> 06:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
pluralism that universities are all
 
06:10:01.970 --> 06:10:01.980 align:start position:0%
about having diverse student clubs is a
 
06:10:04.310 --> 06:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
good to the University's Mission but I
 
06:10:05.510 --> 06:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
guess the point I want to make because
 
06:10:07.190 --> 06:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
so much of what I was intending to say
 
06:10:09.708 --> 06:10:09.718 align:start position:0%
had been said already was just to kind
 
06:10:12.730 --> 06:10:12.740 align:start position:0%
of close with this the law is very clear
 
06:10:16.430 --> 06:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
in this area there are cases going back
 
06:10:18.650 --> 06:10:18.660 align:start position:0%
50 years and it's interesting one of the
 
06:10:21.470 --> 06:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
the prior people who testified talked
 
06:10:23.628 --> 06:10:23.638 align:start position:0%
about how in the early in the 60s and
 
06:10:25.490 --> 06:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
70s it was left-wing groups that were
 
06:10:28.490 --> 06:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
winning Heely be James a case in 1972
 
06:10:30.110 --> 06:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
that said that student groups can't be
 
06:10:31.970 --> 06:10:31.980 align:start position:0%
denied recognition by a public
 
06:10:33.650 --> 06:10:33.660 align:start position:0%
university because of their beliefs was
 
06:10:35.150 --> 06:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
the case involving the students for a
 
06:10:37.070 --> 06:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
Democratic Society their National
 
06:10:38.810 --> 06:10:38.820 align:start position:0%
Organization called for the violent
 
06:10:40.190 --> 06:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
overthrow of the government of the
 
06:10:42.230 --> 06:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
United States but because their local
 
06:10:44.390 --> 06:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
chapter did not had not taken any
 
06:10:46.850 --> 06:10:46.860 align:start position:0%
affirmative action to engage in violence
 
06:10:49.070 --> 06:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
of any kind had only been peaceful in
 
06:10:50.628 --> 06:10:50.638 align:start position:0%
protesting the Vietnam War and other
 
06:10:52.610 --> 06:10:52.620 align:start position:0%
things that they were opposed to the U.S
 
06:10:54.410 --> 06:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court in Healey said they have
 
06:10:56.990 --> 06:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
to be recognized the Whitmer V Vincent
 
06:10:59.208 --> 06:10:59.218 align:start position:0%
case that came about a decade after that
 
06:11:01.190 --> 06:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
said that belief-based student groups
 
06:11:02.868 --> 06:11:02.878 align:start position:0%
must be provided access to facilities
 
06:11:04.670 --> 06:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
under the same standards as other groups
 
06:11:08.270 --> 06:11:08.280 align:start position:0%
and then in 1995 A Student Activity fee
 
06:11:09.948 --> 06:11:09.958 align:start position:0%
funds which is an issue that has come up
 
06:11:11.990 --> 06:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
cannot be withheld from a group merely
 
06:11:13.730 --> 06:11:13.740 align:start position:0%
because they promote or manifest a
 
06:11:15.410 --> 06:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
particular belief system that's
 
06:11:19.368 --> 06:11:19.378 align:start position:0%
Rosenberger V Virginia and my view is
 
06:11:21.948 --> 06:11:21.958 align:start position:0%
this I think especially post those two
 
06:11:25.190 --> 06:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
eighth circuit opinions in involving the
 
06:11:26.510 --> 06:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
University of Iowa I think
 
06:11:28.310 --> 06:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
administrators are starting to get it
 
06:11:30.770 --> 06:11:30.780 align:start position:0%
but what you've heard here is that
 
06:11:32.270 --> 06:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
oftentimes where the conflict is
 
06:11:33.708 --> 06:11:33.718 align:start position:0%
happening now is it the student
 
06:11:35.510 --> 06:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
government or student Bar Association
 
06:11:37.730 --> 06:11:37.740 align:start position:0%
level a lot of times those students
 
06:11:39.830 --> 06:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
aren't well informed of the latest case
 
06:11:41.810 --> 06:11:41.820 align:start position:0%
law involving the First Amendment and
 
06:11:44.208 --> 06:11:44.218 align:start position:0%
one thing that I know in Iowa is that
 
06:11:45.770 --> 06:11:45.780 align:start position:0%
they've begun instructing student
 
06:11:48.048 --> 06:11:48.058 align:start position:0%
government it's there in their very
 
06:11:50.990 --> 06:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
clear simple straightforward law with
 
06:11:53.030 --> 06:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
respect to Student Association so that
 
06:11:54.770 --> 06:11:54.780 align:start position:0%
when before student governments meet to
 
06:11:56.750 --> 06:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
make these decisions they're informed
 
06:11:58.548 --> 06:11:58.558 align:start position:0%
this is what the Constitution says this
 
06:12:00.650 --> 06:12:00.660 align:start position:0%
is what Iowa law says and it's not
 
06:12:03.350 --> 06:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
conflict creating its conflict reducing
 
06:12:06.110 --> 06:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
so I think that New Hampshire would do
 
06:12:08.150 --> 06:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
well to pass this legislation I think
 
06:12:10.730 --> 06:12:10.740 align:start position:0%
that locking in clear protections that
 
06:12:12.048 --> 06:12:12.058 align:start position:0%
are consistent with what the first
 
06:12:13.788 --> 06:12:13.798 align:start position:0%
amendment has long been understood to
 
06:12:16.548 --> 06:12:16.558 align:start position:0%
mean is promoted of First Amendment
 
06:12:18.350 --> 06:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
values but it's also promotive of
 
06:12:21.288 --> 06:12:21.298 align:start position:0%
Civility on campus and conflict reducing
 
06:12:22.910 --> 06:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
so I think the the committee for your
 
06:12:24.530 --> 06:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
time I'd be pleased to answer any
 
06:12:26.510 --> 06:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
questions and just it's been fun to be
 
06:12:28.190 --> 06:12:28.200 align:start position:0%
here first do you have do you have
 
06:12:31.250 --> 06:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
written testimony there so I have a
 
06:12:33.770 --> 06:12:33.780 align:start position:0%
I have a pretty big packet of info that
 
06:12:35.628 --> 06:12:35.638 align:start position:0%
I thought would be cumbersome to hand
 
06:12:37.310 --> 06:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
out but I'll like set it up here
 
06:12:38.990 --> 06:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
afterwards and anybody who wants to take
 
06:12:41.510 --> 06:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
one of my packets that would be great I
 
06:12:42.830 --> 06:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
would love you too but it's a little
 
06:12:45.110 --> 06:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
bulky okay I do have a question for you
 
06:12:47.628 --> 06:12:47.638 align:start position:0%
yes um we have a definition of student
 
06:12:49.548 --> 06:12:49.558 align:start position:0%
organization here what it means and
 
06:12:51.650 --> 06:12:51.660 align:start position:0%
officially recognized group
 
06:12:56.150 --> 06:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
by whom what's the criteria that you use
 
06:12:58.490 --> 06:12:58.500 align:start position:0%
to recognize groups in your experience
 
06:13:01.690 --> 06:13:01.700 align:start position:0%
out in Iowa when you have an association
 
06:13:03.650 --> 06:13:03.660 align:start position:0%
uh and then you mentioned that
 
06:13:05.868 --> 06:13:05.878 align:start position:0%
Administration may get it
 
06:13:10.070 --> 06:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
but down underneath folks are not
 
06:13:13.010 --> 06:13:13.020 align:start position:0%
getting it so universities it's
 
06:13:16.310 --> 06:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
commonplace for universities to have a a
 
06:13:18.410 --> 06:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
process through kind of a student life
 
06:13:21.288 --> 06:13:21.298 align:start position:0%
section of the University that deals
 
06:13:23.510 --> 06:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
with campus organizations and normally
 
06:13:25.850 --> 06:13:25.860 align:start position:0%
there are some requirements like you
 
06:13:29.150 --> 06:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
have to submit a constitution that talks
 
06:13:32.270 --> 06:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
about what your rules and bylaws are you
 
06:13:34.070 --> 06:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
have to have a faculty sponsor you have
 
06:13:35.810 --> 06:13:35.820 align:start position:0%
to have sometimes a certain number of
 
06:13:39.470 --> 06:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
members and it's very often the case it
 
06:13:41.208 --> 06:13:41.218 align:start position:0%
depends upon the university but in many
 
06:13:43.910 --> 06:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
instances those applications first do go
 
06:13:46.670 --> 06:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
to a student Bar Association or a
 
06:13:48.170 --> 06:13:48.180 align:start position:0%
student government Association depending
 
06:13:49.430 --> 06:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
upon whether it's law school or
 
06:13:51.948 --> 06:13:51.958 align:start position:0%
undergrad and so then they meet and do
 
06:13:55.010 --> 06:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
the approvals and really those approvals
 
06:13:57.770 --> 06:13:57.780 align:start position:0%
should never in any way relate to the
 
06:13:59.208 --> 06:13:59.218 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint of the group it should all
 
06:14:00.830 --> 06:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
really be whether they just meet those
 
06:14:03.230 --> 06:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
basic criteria and candidly as an
 
06:14:04.670 --> 06:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity for those groups to kind of
 
06:14:06.650 --> 06:14:06.660 align:start position:0%
present make sure they're known by the
 
06:14:08.150 --> 06:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
student organizations and then you'll
 
06:14:10.250 --> 06:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
have you know kind of a club day a
 
06:14:11.628 --> 06:14:11.638 align:start position:0%
recruitment day at the outset and then
 
06:14:14.390 --> 06:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
they get benefit to communication but
 
06:14:17.570 --> 06:14:17.580 align:start position:0%
what what happens many times then
 
06:14:19.930 --> 06:14:19.940 align:start position:0%
is that if there is a controversy
 
06:14:22.788 --> 06:14:22.798 align:start position:0%
ultimately the university itself has the
 
06:14:25.490 --> 06:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
authority to step in and
 
06:14:29.390 --> 06:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
um veto a decision by the student body
 
06:14:31.430 --> 06:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
Association but oftentimes that takes a
 
06:14:33.410 --> 06:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
significant amount of time to occur and
 
06:14:36.230 --> 06:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
what I would say is this you know the
 
06:14:38.930 --> 06:14:38.940 align:start position:0%
faith-based groups that we work with
 
06:14:40.910 --> 06:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
um the fact that you know these big
 
06:14:42.948 --> 06:14:42.958 align:start position:0%
money judgments are not what they want
 
06:14:45.590 --> 06:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh they just want to to serve and
 
06:14:47.810 --> 06:14:47.820 align:start position:0%
disciple and be places for community and
 
06:14:50.330 --> 06:14:50.340 align:start position:0%
so if you're a kid who's been working in
 
06:14:52.010 --> 06:14:52.020 align:start position:0%
you know a campus ministry for several
 
06:14:53.990 --> 06:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
years you get your senior year you're
 
06:14:55.730 --> 06:14:55.740 align:start position:0%
going to be the president and the campus
 
06:14:57.590 --> 06:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
group set and the university says no
 
06:14:59.510 --> 06:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
you're not recognized well by the time
 
06:15:01.788 --> 06:15:01.798 align:start position:0%
you go down figure out as a kid who who
 
06:15:04.010 --> 06:15:04.020 align:start position:0%
do I contact they go to Federal Court
 
06:15:06.410 --> 06:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
you sort through what the facts are a
 
06:15:07.850 --> 06:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
couple months later down the line you
 
06:15:09.110 --> 06:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
get a piece of paper from a federal
 
06:15:10.730 --> 06:15:10.740 align:start position:0%
court judge saying you know what they
 
06:15:11.868 --> 06:15:11.878 align:start position:0%
didn't do what they should have done
 
06:15:15.708 --> 06:15:15.718 align:start position:0%
well you're several months of your
 
06:15:17.570 --> 06:15:17.580 align:start position:0%
relatively short senior year of child
 
06:15:20.390 --> 06:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
knowledge your activity has been
 
06:15:22.490 --> 06:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
significantly interrupted oftentimes
 
06:15:23.868 --> 06:15:23.878 align:start position:0%
you've been drugged through the mud and
 
06:15:25.548 --> 06:15:25.558 align:start position:0%
campus newspapers and other things so
 
06:15:27.890 --> 06:15:27.900 align:start position:0%
it's best even though most of the groups
 
06:15:29.390 --> 06:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
that I'm working with if they litigate
 
06:15:31.310 --> 06:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
they're going to win under existing law
 
06:15:33.170 --> 06:15:33.180 align:start position:0%
but what they want is not to have to
 
06:15:34.548 --> 06:15:34.558 align:start position:0%
litigate and what we've seen in the
 
06:15:36.470 --> 06:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
states that have passed these is that
 
06:15:38.930 --> 06:15:38.940 align:start position:0%
when the standard is clear it's less
 
06:15:40.490 --> 06:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
likely that there'll be litigation to
 
06:15:41.868 --> 06:15:41.878 align:start position:0%
begin with and that's good for everybody
 
06:15:43.970 --> 06:15:43.980 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from the
 
06:15:46.670 --> 06:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
committee yes represent luno so thank
 
06:15:48.470 --> 06:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chair and thank you
 
06:15:50.990 --> 06:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
very much Mr Kinser for for joining us
 
06:15:53.208 --> 06:15:53.218 align:start position:0%
this afternoon and I absolutely agree
 
06:15:56.448 --> 06:15:56.458 align:start position:0%
with the with your your your very very
 
06:15:59.090 --> 06:15:59.100 align:start position:0%
first uh comments that I think this has
 
06:16:01.128 --> 06:16:01.138 align:start position:0%
been a very respectful discussion and I
 
06:16:02.990 --> 06:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
think very much a learning experience
 
06:16:04.910 --> 06:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly speaking from my uh
 
06:16:06.650 --> 06:16:06.660 align:start position:0%
perspective but I think
 
06:16:09.590 --> 06:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
for everybody here and and I also want
 
06:16:13.128 --> 06:16:13.138 align:start position:0%
to want to extend that comment to um to
 
06:16:15.770 --> 06:16:15.780 align:start position:0%
the the students from UNH law
 
06:16:18.470 --> 06:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
um uh uh Jeff ozan and Gabriella Spina
 
06:16:21.708 --> 06:16:21.718 align:start position:0%
who I think spoke very very well
 
06:16:24.170 --> 06:16:24.180 align:start position:0%
um about the situations that they're
 
06:16:26.570 --> 06:16:26.580 align:start position:0%
facing there and I don't want my my
 
06:16:29.448 --> 06:16:29.458 align:start position:0%
question here to in any way be
 
06:16:31.970 --> 06:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
interpreted as an assumption or an
 
06:16:34.490 --> 06:16:34.500 align:start position:0%
aspersion of of
 
06:16:37.548 --> 06:16:37.558 align:start position:0%
of what their organization done and what
 
06:16:39.530 --> 06:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
their beliefs are I think we can just
 
06:16:42.110 --> 06:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
sort of take it at a very generic
 
06:16:43.868 --> 06:16:43.878 align:start position:0%
um you know sort of a
 
06:16:47.628 --> 06:16:47.638 align:start position:0%
non-specific level sure but um but but
 
06:16:47.638 --> 06:16:50.030 align:start position:0%
non-specific level sure but um but but
specifically

06:16:50.030 --> 06:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
06:16:52.128 --> 06:16:52.138 align:start position:0%
um every organ every Institute of higher
 
06:16:54.288 --> 06:16:54.298 align:start position:0%
education that I have involvement with
 
06:16:56.510 --> 06:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
right now I'm on I'm on three University
 
06:16:56.520 --> 06:16:58.250 align:start position:0%
right now I'm on I'm on three University
boards

06:16:58.250 --> 06:16:58.260 align:start position:0%
boards
 
06:17:01.070 --> 06:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
um have a mission statement and core
 
06:17:04.670 --> 06:17:04.680 align:start position:0%
values and and every one of these and
 
06:17:07.670 --> 06:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
it's probably many many many many more
 
06:17:09.830 --> 06:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
um one of those core values
 
06:17:13.128 --> 06:17:13.138 align:start position:0%
um uh is a is a is a strong sense of
 
06:17:15.350 --> 06:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
diversity Equity inclusion and Justice
 
06:17:18.288 --> 06:17:18.298 align:start position:0%
and and I'm just trying to better
 
06:17:20.690 --> 06:17:20.700 align:start position:0%
understand how
 
06:17:20.700 --> 06:17:22.190 align:start position:0%
understand how
how

06:17:22.190 --> 06:17:22.200 align:start position:0%
how
 
06:17:25.250 --> 06:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
um some of these things whether they're
 
06:17:27.470 --> 06:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
student groups student organizations
 
06:17:30.590 --> 06:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
that are failing to be recognized
 
06:17:30.600 --> 06:17:31.368 align:start position:0%
that are failing to be recognized
um

06:17:31.368 --> 06:17:31.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:17:35.270 --> 06:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
um how that can coexist with with the
 
06:17:37.910 --> 06:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
core values that um that a
 
06:17:40.208 --> 06:17:40.218 align:start position:0%
post-secondary institution you know has
 
06:17:43.250 --> 06:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
and uh and where where does that line
 
06:17:45.230 --> 06:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
get get drawn and I think it's very
 
06:17:47.208 --> 06:17:47.218 align:start position:0%
similar to where's the money up here
 
06:17:49.970 --> 06:17:49.980 align:start position:0%
right that's what true sure so if I
 
06:17:52.310 --> 06:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
understand the the question I mean my
 
06:17:57.048 --> 06:17:57.058 align:start position:0%
view would be that recognizing
 
06:17:59.810 --> 06:17:59.820 align:start position:0%
um student groups on a Viewpoint neutral
 
06:18:02.750 --> 06:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
basis is not only what the law already
 
06:18:05.628 --> 06:18:05.638 align:start position:0%
requires it's promotive of diversity
 
06:18:08.690 --> 06:18:08.700 align:start position:0%
equity and inclusion and that
 
06:18:10.788 --> 06:18:10.798 align:start position:0%
um it's never been viewed as
 
06:18:13.788 --> 06:18:13.798 align:start position:0%
discrimination okay say federal civil
 
06:18:15.708 --> 06:18:15.718 align:start position:0%
rights law and I'm thinking of
 
06:18:17.208 --> 06:18:17.218 align:start position:0%
faith-based groups here in particular
 
06:18:19.788 --> 06:18:19.798 align:start position:0%
for a faith-based group to say only
 
06:18:22.368 --> 06:18:22.378 align:start position:0%
people who share our faith can teach our
 
06:18:24.948 --> 06:18:24.958 align:start position:0%
message so generally speaking religious
 
06:18:27.410 --> 06:18:27.420 align:start position:0%
discrimination is illegal but if a
 
06:18:29.090 --> 06:18:29.100 align:start position:0%
church wants to say we're only going to
 
06:18:33.410 --> 06:18:33.420 align:start position:0%
hire as a pastor someone who shares our
 
06:18:34.970 --> 06:18:34.980 align:start position:0%
theological beliefs that's
 
06:18:37.310 --> 06:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
discriminating in a sense based upon
 
06:18:39.170 --> 06:18:39.180 align:start position:0%
religion they're hiring somebody and
 
06:18:40.970 --> 06:18:40.980 align:start position:0%
they're using religion as criteria but
 
06:18:42.890 --> 06:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
it's always been understood that within
 
06:18:44.330 --> 06:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
the context of a belief-based
 
06:18:46.128 --> 06:18:46.138 align:start position:0%
organization it's actually not
 
06:18:48.230 --> 06:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
discriminatory for religious groups to
 
06:18:50.208 --> 06:18:50.218 align:start position:0%
use religious criteria in saying who
 
06:18:52.368 --> 06:18:52.378 align:start position:0%
gets to speak our message rather that's
 
06:18:54.830 --> 06:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
actually promotive of freedom and so my
 
06:18:56.330 --> 06:18:56.340 align:start position:0%
view is that the way that you promote
 
06:18:58.670 --> 06:18:58.680 align:start position:0%
diversity equity and inclusion on campus
 
06:19:01.250 --> 06:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
is not by saying certain kinds of ideas
 
06:19:04.070 --> 06:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
that groups may have are off limits and
 
06:19:06.830 --> 06:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
won't be allowed rather we make sure as
 
06:19:09.350 --> 06:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
this bill does the groups regardless of
 
06:19:12.048 --> 06:19:12.058 align:start position:0%
viewpoint are clearly protected and so
 
06:19:14.270 --> 06:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
even though I think sometimes this issue
 
06:19:17.570 --> 06:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
gets tied up in in concerns about
 
06:19:17.580 --> 06:19:18.670 align:start position:0%
gets tied up in in concerns about
whether

06:19:18.670 --> 06:19:18.680 align:start position:0%
whether
 
06:19:21.410 --> 06:19:21.420 align:start position:0%
there are groups that maybe differ on
 
06:19:23.570 --> 06:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
Dei issues and they're being recognized
 
06:19:27.110 --> 06:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
I think the broader concept of Dei is
 
06:19:29.690 --> 06:19:29.700 align:start position:0%
actually promoted by having a diversity
 
06:19:32.030 --> 06:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
of views of course those views have to
 
06:19:33.830 --> 06:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
be expressed respectfully no one should
 
06:19:35.750 --> 06:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
be harassed there should be no illegal
 
06:19:37.430 --> 06:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
conduct I think the bill does a good job
 
06:19:39.708 --> 06:19:39.718 align:start position:0%
of giving the university all the tools
 
06:19:41.628 --> 06:19:41.638 align:start position:0%
they need to make sure that that respect
 
06:19:43.490 --> 06:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
that you're understandably concerned
 
06:19:45.708 --> 06:19:45.718 align:start position:0%
about is there but it also makes sure
 
06:19:50.750 --> 06:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
that we avoid litigation and that we we
 
06:19:53.330 --> 06:19:53.340 align:start position:0%
model for students in these policies
 
06:19:55.430 --> 06:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
respect for a diversity of viewpoints
 
06:19:57.770 --> 06:19:57.780 align:start position:0%
that'll be my own view on that I'll
 
06:19:59.868 --> 06:19:59.878 align:start position:0%
follow up to that thank you and that
 
06:20:02.150 --> 06:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
that your answer helps me a lot on on
 
06:20:05.930 --> 06:20:05.940 align:start position:0%
this and so just to sort of push on on
 
06:20:08.030 --> 06:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
on you know where does it get muddy
 
06:20:11.150 --> 06:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
where does that Line in the Sand get
 
06:20:15.470 --> 06:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
drawn and um and referring back to what
 
06:20:16.910 --> 06:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn was talking about
 
06:20:16.920 --> 06:20:18.288 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn was talking about
earlier

06:20:18.288 --> 06:20:18.298 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
06:20:23.390 --> 06:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
um outside uh where outside Chicago and
 
06:20:26.090 --> 06:20:26.100 align:start position:0%
um and you know so I'm getting specific
 
06:20:28.310 --> 06:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
here but but
 
06:20:28.320 --> 06:20:30.070 align:start position:0%
here but but
um

06:20:30.070 --> 06:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:20:33.650 --> 06:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
Jeff lausanne mentioned about about a um
 
06:20:37.730 --> 06:20:37.740 align:start position:0%
not being able to to uh to display a
 
06:20:40.548 --> 06:20:40.558 align:start position:0%
flag let's say in the entry hall at UNH
 
06:20:42.350 --> 06:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
law I don't know where where where the
 
06:20:44.448 --> 06:20:44.458 align:start position:0%
display would be and I'm not again not
 
06:20:47.090 --> 06:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
casting any assumptions or aspersions on
 
06:20:51.288 --> 06:20:51.298 align:start position:0%
anything but but if if such a request
 
06:20:55.070 --> 06:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
was was so offensive in the way that
 
06:20:58.970 --> 06:20:58.980 align:start position:0%
Judge Lynn had talked about would would
 
06:21:01.610 --> 06:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
that be something that the university
 
06:21:04.128 --> 06:21:04.138 align:start position:0%
would have to comply with and allow to
 
06:21:06.410 --> 06:21:06.420 align:start position:0%
have happen or can they can they
 
06:21:09.110 --> 06:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
actually draw the line somewhere yeah so
 
06:21:10.970 --> 06:21:10.980 align:start position:0%
first I'll say and I don't mean this is
 
06:21:14.030 --> 06:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
a cop-out that my area of particular
 
06:21:15.830 --> 06:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
specialty is more on the associational
 
06:21:17.750 --> 06:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
rights and so I don't want to get out
 
06:21:19.250 --> 06:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
over my skis because there's some
 
06:21:21.948 --> 06:21:21.958 align:start position:0%
smarter folks than me behind me on some
 
06:21:25.128 --> 06:21:25.138 align:start position:0%
of these issues but I would say uh that
 
06:21:28.250 --> 06:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
from my perspective once you establish
 
06:21:31.310 --> 06:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
that we're going to allow particular
 
06:21:34.490 --> 06:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
kind we're going to allow this to be a a
 
06:21:36.410 --> 06:21:36.420 align:start position:0%
public forum or a limited public forum
 
06:21:38.690 --> 06:21:38.700 align:start position:0%
sometimes the the language that she is
 
06:21:41.510 --> 06:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
once that decision is made then the
 
06:21:43.730 --> 06:21:43.740 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint discrimination decision has
 
06:21:46.310 --> 06:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
already kind of you've kind of defaulted
 
06:21:48.788 --> 06:21:48.798 align:start position:0%
on the you know the Viewpoint
 
06:21:50.810 --> 06:21:50.820 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint discrimination decision
 
06:21:52.730 --> 06:21:52.740 align:start position:0%
already because one of the things that
 
06:21:55.368 --> 06:21:55.378 align:start position:0%
you absolutely can't do once you have a
 
06:21:58.010 --> 06:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
limited public forum is discriminate
 
06:22:00.288 --> 06:22:00.298 align:start position:0%
based upon Viewpoint now there may be
 
06:22:03.410 --> 06:22:03.420 align:start position:0%
instances where for example in the
 
06:22:05.868 --> 06:22:05.878 align:start position:0%
context of a particular classroom where
 
06:22:07.548 --> 06:22:07.558 align:start position:0%
you could argue well this isn't a a
 
06:22:09.530 --> 06:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
limited public forum we don't just allow
 
06:22:11.330 --> 06:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
people you know off the street to come
 
06:22:12.948 --> 06:22:12.958 align:start position:0%
in and express their views on whatever
 
06:22:14.990 --> 06:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
you know in the middle of a math class
 
06:22:17.330 --> 06:22:17.340 align:start position:0%
but if the university has a policy of
 
06:22:19.250 --> 06:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
saying there are certain places within
 
06:22:21.650 --> 06:22:21.660 align:start position:0%
the University where groups are free to
 
06:22:24.770 --> 06:22:24.780 align:start position:0%
display Flags then it's a very dicey
 
06:22:27.530 --> 06:22:27.540 align:start position:0%
thing not just into the context of this
 
06:22:28.788 --> 06:22:28.798 align:start position:0%
bill but I think under the First
 
06:22:30.890 --> 06:22:30.900 align:start position:0%
Amendment for the University to then say
 
06:22:34.128 --> 06:22:34.138 align:start position:0%
we're going to discriminate based upon
 
06:22:35.830 --> 06:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint that's pretty black letter
 
06:22:38.448 --> 06:22:38.458 align:start position:0%
constitutional law yeah it is
 
06:22:41.090 --> 06:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
representative cardelli oh thank you
 
06:22:44.890 --> 06:22:44.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:48.410 --> 06:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing is that possibly in
 
06:22:50.628 --> 06:22:50.638 align:start position:0%
from your experience in some of the
 
06:22:53.448 --> 06:22:53.458 align:start position:0%
instances you've come across it seems
 
06:22:57.110 --> 06:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
like maybe a narrower version of Dei
 
06:23:00.650 --> 06:23:00.660 align:start position:0%
policy rather than the broader view that
 
06:23:04.270 --> 06:23:04.280 align:start position:0%
you just mentioned has bumped up against
 
06:23:07.190 --> 06:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
associations religious associations
 
06:23:10.010 --> 06:23:10.020 align:start position:0%
trying to start up would that be an
 
06:23:12.170 --> 06:23:12.180 align:start position:0%
accurate uh characterization that's an
 
06:23:13.430 --> 06:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
interesting way to think about it I
 
06:23:14.930 --> 06:23:14.940 align:start position:0%
hadn't quite thought about it I was kind
 
06:23:17.030 --> 06:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
of thinking out loud as I was giving you
 
06:23:18.770 --> 06:23:18.780 align:start position:0%
know that that answer but I do think
 
06:23:22.250 --> 06:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
that the idea that diversity equity and
 
06:23:22.260 --> 06:23:24.190 align:start position:0%
that the idea that diversity equity and
inclusion

06:23:24.190 --> 06:23:24.200 align:start position:0%
inclusion
 
06:23:27.048 --> 06:23:27.058 align:start position:0%
broadly construed is something that I
 
06:23:29.750 --> 06:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
think we should all be able to agree to
 
06:23:31.910 --> 06:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
especially in the context of University
 
06:23:34.910 --> 06:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
campus as long as that
 
06:23:38.150 --> 06:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
diversity Equity inclusion is promotive
 
06:23:41.330 --> 06:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
of civil conversation and speech and not
 
06:23:43.070 --> 06:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
having Viewpoint discrimination I think
 
06:23:45.470 --> 06:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
when it IT flips and becomes a way of
 
06:23:47.868 --> 06:23:47.878 align:start position:0%
narrowing discourse and saying certain
 
06:23:49.548 --> 06:23:49.558 align:start position:0%
ideas are off the table just to begin
 
06:23:51.470 --> 06:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
with even if Express civilly that's
 
06:23:53.390 --> 06:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
where there's a problem at least from my
 
06:23:55.970 --> 06:23:55.980 align:start position:0%
point of view thank you
 
06:23:57.830 --> 06:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative Woodcock thank you
 
06:23:59.990 --> 06:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
chairman good afternoon I'm sure you're
 
06:24:01.070 --> 06:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
happy to be here on a Friday afternoon
 
06:24:02.628 --> 06:24:02.638 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
06:24:05.208 --> 06:24:05.218 align:start position:0%
um but in all seriousness
 
06:24:07.250 --> 06:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
as representative little said and saw
 
06:24:09.650 --> 06:24:09.660 align:start position:0%
this before that I've been amazed at the
 
06:24:13.250 --> 06:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
information uh that I've heard and some
 
06:24:16.250 --> 06:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
of my some of my thinkings altered
 
06:24:18.948 --> 06:24:18.958 align:start position:0%
um my first we first began I heard I was
 
06:24:20.510 --> 06:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
saying free speeches beats and now we're
 
06:24:22.310 --> 06:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
talking at the end of the day very small
 
06:24:23.650 --> 06:24:23.660 align:start position:0%
face-based group and a university
 
06:24:26.750 --> 06:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
organization uh so my question is the
 
06:24:28.548 --> 06:24:28.558 align:start position:0%
only uh
 
06:24:30.350 --> 06:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
group person represented we've heard
 
06:24:32.270 --> 06:24:32.280 align:start position:0%
this afternoon who is opposed to this
 
06:24:33.830 --> 06:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
but the University of New Hampshire
 
06:24:33.840 --> 06:24:35.330 align:start position:0%
but the University of New Hampshire
system

06:24:35.330 --> 06:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
system
 
06:24:38.390 --> 06:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering in your thinking what
 
06:24:39.470 --> 06:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
it is
 
06:24:42.170 --> 06:24:42.180 align:start position:0%
well I don't want to speak for anyone
 
06:24:42.180 --> 06:24:43.310 align:start position:0%
well I don't want to speak for anyone
else

06:24:43.310 --> 06:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
else
 
06:24:46.010 --> 06:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
um I will say that it's not uncommon
 
06:24:48.470 --> 06:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
when bills like this are heard for
 
06:24:52.070 --> 06:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
universities either to not weigh in at
 
06:24:55.310 --> 06:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
all or or to be supportive so but this
 
06:24:56.868 --> 06:24:56.878 align:start position:0%
isn't the first time that I've testified
 
06:24:59.510 --> 06:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
in a place where the universities have
 
06:25:01.670 --> 06:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
expressed concern I think there's an
 
06:25:04.190 --> 06:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
understandable desire for universities
 
06:25:08.390 --> 06:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
to want to control and I don't mean that
 
06:25:11.570 --> 06:25:11.580 align:start position:0%
at any kind of a negative way to have
 
06:25:13.850 --> 06:25:13.860 align:start position:0%
flexibility with respect to the policies
 
06:25:15.470 --> 06:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
that they Implement and so there's a
 
06:25:17.810 --> 06:25:17.820 align:start position:0%
natural tendency to feel that if a
 
06:25:20.930 --> 06:25:20.940 align:start position:0%
statute is enacted in this area it may
 
06:25:23.330 --> 06:25:23.340 align:start position:0%
you know maybe it's not contemplating
 
06:25:25.010 --> 06:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
some circumstance and then we're going
 
06:25:27.350 --> 06:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
to be unduly constrained and so I'm
 
06:25:30.110 --> 06:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
trying to be you know fair with respect
 
06:25:31.788 --> 06:25:31.798 align:start position:0%
to what their concerns might be I
 
06:25:33.368 --> 06:25:33.378 align:start position:0%
honestly believe
 
06:25:36.650 --> 06:25:36.660 align:start position:0%
that the the language that's in this
 
06:25:39.470 --> 06:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
bill has been subject to sufficient
 
06:25:42.890 --> 06:25:42.900 align:start position:0%
interpretive work by courts that I don't
 
06:25:44.330 --> 06:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
think it's going to lead to a lot of
 
06:25:46.430 --> 06:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
confusion and I'll just kind of in the
 
06:25:47.930 --> 06:25:47.940 align:start position:0%
answer I guess with this there have been
 
06:25:49.548 --> 06:25:49.558 align:start position:0%
a number of states but one in which I
 
06:25:50.930 --> 06:25:50.940 align:start position:0%
can think of in particular and I won't
 
06:25:52.368 --> 06:25:52.378 align:start position:0%
call out the university but a university
 
06:25:55.548 --> 06:25:55.558 align:start position:0%
came and testified
 
06:25:58.190 --> 06:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
um against a bill with some similar
 
06:26:00.230 --> 06:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
concerns that were heard here and then
 
06:26:01.970 --> 06:26:01.980 align:start position:0%
about a year later I was told by the
 
06:26:03.170 --> 06:26:03.180 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill you know the
 
06:26:06.530 --> 06:26:06.540 align:start position:0%
lobbyist for XYZ University came back
 
06:26:08.208 --> 06:26:08.218 align:start position:0%
and said you know we oppose that bill
 
06:26:10.368 --> 06:26:10.378 align:start position:0%
but we we kind of like
 
06:26:12.170 --> 06:26:12.180 align:start position:0%
um when student groups come to us and
 
06:26:14.030 --> 06:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
say why is this group we don't like why
 
06:26:15.770 --> 06:26:15.780 align:start position:0%
do they you know get to be on campus
 
06:26:17.868 --> 06:26:17.878 align:start position:0%
well go complain to your legislator they
 
06:26:20.270 --> 06:26:20.280 align:start position:0%
told us that you know we we had to do
 
06:26:21.770 --> 06:26:21.780 align:start position:0%
this that it was it was actually nice
 
06:26:23.930 --> 06:26:23.940 align:start position:0%
from their perspective to just have a
 
06:26:25.610 --> 06:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
clear standard in law they could point
 
06:26:27.948 --> 06:26:27.958 align:start position:0%
to because it's probably no fun for the
 
06:26:30.708 --> 06:26:30.718 align:start position:0%
universities to be juggling these you
 
06:26:32.330 --> 06:26:32.340 align:start position:0%
know competing claims of student groups
 
06:26:33.830 --> 06:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
that don't like each other so that's one
 
06:26:36.470 --> 06:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
thought that's fine president I have a
 
06:26:38.990 --> 06:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
smaller question smaller question yes
 
06:26:41.990 --> 06:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
sir thank you I think thank you um the
 
06:26:43.430 --> 06:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
last question at least for me thank you
 
06:26:45.230 --> 06:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
uh once again
 
06:26:47.208 --> 06:26:47.218 align:start position:0%
we've heard this afternoon the 16th and
 
06:26:49.190 --> 06:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
we're very 17 and so somewhere there in
 
06:26:51.948 --> 06:26:51.958 align:start position:0%
that nut range of states that have
 
06:26:54.350 --> 06:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
supported and participated and have uh
 
06:26:57.048 --> 06:26:57.058 align:start position:0%
enacted something similar to this is
 
06:26:58.788 --> 06:26:58.798 align:start position:0%
there what about the other state so why
 
06:27:01.788 --> 06:27:01.798 align:start position:0%
is that not happening so when I use in
 
06:27:03.590 --> 06:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
your opinion yeah when I use 17 those
 
06:27:05.650 --> 06:27:05.660 align:start position:0%
are states that have passed particularly
 
06:27:07.850 --> 06:27:07.860 align:start position:0%
associational protections and some
 
06:27:09.350 --> 06:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
states have done that as Standalone
 
06:27:11.150 --> 06:27:11.160 align:start position:0%
bills other states have done that in the
 
06:27:13.190 --> 06:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
context of bills that deal with other
 
06:27:15.650 --> 06:27:15.660 align:start position:0%
speech issues like this one
 
06:27:17.690 --> 06:27:17.700 align:start position:0%
um you know there are a variety of
 
06:27:19.730 --> 06:27:19.740 align:start position:0%
reasons I think if I was going to say
 
06:27:22.970 --> 06:27:22.980 align:start position:0%
number one it is the
 
06:27:26.270 --> 06:27:26.280 align:start position:0%
do we have an existing problem here and
 
06:27:28.368 --> 06:27:28.378 align:start position:0%
if not is this an area that we should
 
06:27:32.090 --> 06:27:32.100 align:start position:0%
really legislate in I think some of the
 
06:27:34.310 --> 06:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
other concerns that have been expressed
 
06:27:36.288 --> 06:27:36.298 align:start position:0%
about whether
 
06:27:36.298 --> 06:27:36.948 align:start position:0%
about whether
um

06:27:36.948 --> 06:27:36.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:27:39.770 --> 06:27:39.780 align:start position:0%
having tight standards at the state
 
06:27:42.770 --> 06:27:42.780 align:start position:0%
level reduces University flexibility to
 
06:27:44.390 --> 06:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
decide where some of these lines are
 
06:27:46.610 --> 06:27:46.620 align:start position:0%
with the questions that were were asked
 
06:27:48.708 --> 06:27:48.718 align:start position:0%
earlier that may be a reason but I think
 
06:27:50.810 --> 06:27:50.820 align:start position:0%
more than anything else
 
06:27:52.368 --> 06:27:52.378 align:start position:0%
um it's just hard to get bills through
 
06:27:53.690 --> 06:27:53.700 align:start position:0%
the political process I mean when I
 
06:27:55.190 --> 06:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
started working on this I was looking I
 
06:27:57.470 --> 06:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
was testifying in Missouri
 
06:27:59.150 --> 06:27:59.160 align:start position:0%
um you know a couple days ago and I've
 
06:28:01.610 --> 06:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
been they've been working on this for a
 
06:28:03.410 --> 06:28:03.420 align:start position:0%
number of years and when I first
 
06:28:05.990 --> 06:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
testified there on this in 2017 I was
 
06:28:07.730 --> 06:28:07.740 align:start position:0%
telling them they could be the eighth
 
06:28:10.010 --> 06:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
state to do this if they would pass it
 
06:28:11.810 --> 06:28:11.820 align:start position:0%
and I had to change my notes and put a
 
06:28:13.010 --> 06:28:13.020 align:start position:0%
one you know I said you could be the
 
06:28:15.530 --> 06:28:15.540 align:start position:0%
18th State and so that's actually quite
 
06:28:18.170 --> 06:28:18.180 align:start position:0%
a bit of legislative activity over just
 
06:28:20.868 --> 06:28:20.878 align:start position:0%
the last few years in this area so I
 
06:28:22.670 --> 06:28:22.680 align:start position:0%
think that there is
 
06:28:25.310 --> 06:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
um a increasing understanding of the
 
06:28:26.750 --> 06:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
importance of this and I will say it's
 
06:28:28.730 --> 06:28:28.740 align:start position:0%
increasingly bipartisan so last year
 
06:28:32.150 --> 06:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
Indiana passed a very similar Bill and
 
06:28:34.310 --> 06:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
it actually passed unanimously I think
 
06:28:36.288 --> 06:28:36.298 align:start position:0%
maybe through both Chambers but at least
 
06:28:38.570 --> 06:28:38.580 align:start position:0%
unanimously through one chamber and with
 
06:28:40.788 --> 06:28:40.798 align:start position:0%
substantial bypartisan support you know
 
06:28:42.590 --> 06:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
Governor Edwards signed a build out of
 
06:28:44.810 --> 06:28:44.820 align:start position:0%
Louisiana Democratic governor some more
 
06:28:47.930 --> 06:28:47.940 align:start position:0%
so some of the concern that you know
 
06:28:49.670 --> 06:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
these were
 
06:28:52.190 --> 06:28:52.200 align:start position:0%
conservative groups that you know were
 
06:28:53.510 --> 06:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
were concerned that they're the ones
 
06:28:56.030 --> 06:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
whose Ox is being gored right now
 
06:28:58.070 --> 06:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
um I think with a little bit more
 
06:29:00.230 --> 06:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
perspective people have realized as the
 
06:29:02.090 --> 06:29:02.100 align:start position:0%
as the representative said previously
 
06:29:02.100 --> 06:29:03.470 align:start position:0%
as the representative said previously
ultimately

06:29:03.470 --> 06:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
ultimately
 
06:29:05.390 --> 06:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
everybody is at risk if we don't have
 
06:29:07.970 --> 06:29:07.980 align:start position:0%
clear standards and so left and right I
 
06:29:11.090 --> 06:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
think our there's more bipartisan
 
06:29:12.410 --> 06:29:12.420 align:start position:0%
support in the last few years and that's
 
06:29:13.670 --> 06:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
why it's been increasing but we've got
 
06:29:15.288 --> 06:29:15.298 align:start position:0%
work to do thank you and thank you if
 
06:29:17.990 --> 06:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
you can thank you thank you further
 
06:29:20.448 --> 06:29:20.458 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee not seeing
 
06:29:23.150 --> 06:29:23.160 align:start position:0%
it one more question last one represent
 
06:29:23.160 --> 06:29:25.548 align:start position:0%
it one more question last one represent
Balboni

06:29:25.548 --> 06:29:25.558 align:start position:0%
Balboni
 
06:29:27.110 --> 06:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
um thank you chair a lot and thank you
 
06:29:29.270 --> 06:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
and I hope it is a quick question um you
 
06:29:31.368 --> 06:29:31.378 align:start position:0%
said that 17 states have passed this
 
06:29:31.378 --> 06:29:32.930 align:start position:0%
said that 17 states have passed this
legislation

06:29:32.930 --> 06:29:32.940 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
06:29:34.430 --> 06:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm curious about the number of
 
06:29:36.110 --> 06:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
lawsuits that might have been brought
 
06:29:39.470 --> 06:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
since the legislation occurred yeah and
 
06:29:41.270 --> 06:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
so again to be clear I'm just talking
 
06:29:43.490 --> 06:29:43.500 align:start position:0%
about the associational portion there
 
06:29:44.930 --> 06:29:44.940 align:start position:0%
are 17 states there are a few more that
 
06:29:47.810 --> 06:29:47.820 align:start position:0%
have passed additional protections to be
 
06:29:50.930 --> 06:29:50.940 align:start position:0%
honest with you I'm not aware
 
06:29:54.530 --> 06:29:54.540 align:start position:0%
um I'm aware of many cases where in the
 
06:29:56.448 --> 06:29:56.458 align:start position:0%
context of demand letters or
 
06:29:58.430 --> 06:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
conversations that attorneys have had
 
06:30:01.670 --> 06:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
with University general counsel where
 
06:30:05.208 --> 06:30:05.218 align:start position:0%
these laws have been used as a a basis
 
06:30:07.310 --> 06:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
for kind of reaching resolution before
 
06:30:10.070 --> 06:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
the litigation stage but I honestly
 
06:30:12.590 --> 06:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
don't know that there's a there may have
 
06:30:13.548 --> 06:30:13.558 align:start position:0%
been a you know I don't think there's
 
06:30:15.708 --> 06:30:15.718 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of a single like State
 
06:30:19.570 --> 06:30:19.580 align:start position:0%
Appellate Court opinion on one of these
 
06:30:22.128 --> 06:30:22.138 align:start position:0%
associational rights cases and one of
 
06:30:23.810 --> 06:30:23.820 align:start position:0%
the folks behind me can correct me if
 
06:30:25.610 --> 06:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong so I just don't think they're
 
06:30:27.590 --> 06:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
very generative of litigation I think
 
06:30:30.470 --> 06:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
they're more preventative than anything
 
06:30:33.110 --> 06:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much and we're
 
06:30:35.208 --> 06:30:35.218 align:start position:0%
going to close this hearing down at this
 
06:30:38.830 --> 06:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:41.990 --> 06:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
we're gonna take a
 
06:30:44.330 --> 06:30:44.340 align:start position:0%
stand-up break here let's have about 10
 
06:30:47.270 --> 06:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
minutes so we we can have that and we'll
 
06:30:50.330 --> 06:30:50.340 align:start position:0%
come back and we'll take care of the
 
06:30:52.190 --> 06:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
last hearing that this education
 
06:30:55.010 --> 06:30:55.020 align:start position:0%

06:42:29.330 --> 06:42:29.340 align:start position:0%

where taxpayers resourced Public Funding
 
06:43:59.030 --> 06:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
goes public accountability must follow
 
06:44:00.830 --> 06:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
and the discrimination are wrong it can
 
06:44:02.628 --> 06:44:02.638 align:start position:0%
be helpful to those involved
 
06:44:05.510 --> 06:44:05.520 align:start position:0%

06:44:07.850 --> 06:44:07.860 align:start position:0%
in our schools fighting discrimination
 
06:44:10.730 --> 06:44:10.740 align:start position:0%
takes courage and commitment but when we

06:44:55.128 --> 06:44:55.138 align:start position:0%
School be required to hire a teacher or
 
06:44:56.410 --> 06:44:56.420 align:start position:0%
a professor
 
06:44:59.868 --> 06:44:59.878 align:start position:0%
who did not agree with their beliefs
 
06:45:01.310 --> 06:45:01.320 align:start position:0%
I do not know the answer to that
 
06:45:04.670 --> 06:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:07.730 --> 06:45:07.740 align:start position:0%
further questions representative dry
 
06:45:10.190 --> 06:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
06:45:13.730 --> 06:45:13.740 align:start position:0%
Linda representative Tanner's substitute
 
06:45:18.650 --> 06:45:18.660 align:start position:0%
um I was looking at the same 354-a
 
06:45:20.628 --> 06:45:20.638 align:start position:0%
um and colon 27 talks about the
 
06:45:22.850 --> 06:45:22.860 align:start position:0%
opportunity for public education without
 
06:45:25.208 --> 06:45:25.218 align:start position:0%
discrimination a civil right
 
06:45:29.990 --> 06:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
it's in here about education it's also
 
06:45:33.170 --> 06:45:33.180 align:start position:0%
in Colon 29 right to freedom from
 
06:45:35.208 --> 06:45:35.218 align:start position:0%
discrimination in public workplaces and
 
06:45:37.850 --> 06:45:37.860 align:start position:0%
education I I believe this is already
 
06:45:40.490 --> 06:45:40.500 align:start position:0%
covered why are we doing it in the
 
06:45:42.230 --> 06:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
education things it's already in the
 
06:45:43.490 --> 06:45:43.500 align:start position:0%
state commission for human rights
 
06:45:43.500 --> 06:45:44.690 align:start position:0%
state commission for human rights
chapter

06:45:44.690 --> 06:45:44.700 align:start position:0%
chapter
 
06:45:46.368 --> 06:45:46.378 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the representative
 
06:45:48.590 --> 06:45:48.600 align:start position:0%
just agrees with that opinion
 
06:45:50.510 --> 06:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
is that sorry but she disagrees it's
 
06:45:52.128 --> 06:45:52.138 align:start position:0%
always instead already in statute wants
 
06:45:57.048 --> 06:45:57.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:00.470 --> 06:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
okay just try to remember that that's
 
06:46:02.930 --> 06:46:02.940 align:start position:0%
not represent a Tanner out there
 
06:46:06.110 --> 06:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
and and I don't think anybody can speak
 
06:46:08.270 --> 06:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
on behalf of Representative Tanner when
 
06:46:10.310 --> 06:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
you know we're not in representative
 
06:46:13.850 --> 06:46:13.860 align:start position:0%
Tanner's base so our head so
 
06:46:16.310 --> 06:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
try to address you know questions which
 
06:46:18.410 --> 06:46:18.420 align:start position:0%
are not really something that she has to
 
06:46:18.420 --> 06:46:19.910 align:start position:0%
are not really something that she has to
answer

06:46:19.910 --> 06:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
answer
 
06:46:23.270 --> 06:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:25.250 --> 06:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you chairman I
 
06:46:28.690 --> 06:46:28.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:30.890 --> 06:46:30.900 align:start position:0%
what were the two things you've never
 
06:46:30.900 --> 06:46:46.930 align:start position:0%
what were the two things you've never
housed

06:46:46.930 --> 06:46:46.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:53.650 --> 06:46:53.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:56.030 --> 06:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
the red lights
 
06:46:57.948 --> 06:46:57.958 align:start position:0%
and put the microphone on so you can
 
06:46:59.270 --> 06:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
hear me I'm pleased to be here talking
 
06:47:01.010 --> 06:47:01.020 align:start position:0%
and I'm pleased you can hear me now the
 
06:47:02.628 --> 06:47:02.638 align:start position:0%
microphone's on
 
06:47:07.250 --> 06:47:07.260 align:start position:0%
um I am here in support of hb451 I liked
 
06:47:09.048 --> 06:47:09.058 align:start position:0%
uh hearing from representative Woodcock
 
06:47:10.850 --> 06:47:10.860 align:start position:0%
the summary that where Public Funding
 
06:47:13.310 --> 06:47:13.320 align:start position:0%
goes public accountability must follow
 
06:47:15.948 --> 06:47:15.958 align:start position:0%
when I read this bill I saw it as a way
 
06:47:18.250 --> 06:47:18.260 align:start position:0%
of addressing the fact that we have
 
06:47:21.890 --> 06:47:21.900 align:start position:0%
public tax money going out through
 
06:47:25.250 --> 06:47:25.260 align:start position:0%
vouchers to various private schools and
 
06:47:27.708 --> 06:47:27.718 align:start position:0%
different educational vendors so for
 
06:47:29.930 --> 06:47:29.940 align:start position:0%
that reason I really appreciate the
 
06:47:32.510 --> 06:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
thought of these non-discrimination
 
06:47:35.208 --> 06:47:35.218 align:start position:0%
policies following that money so that
 
06:47:37.190 --> 06:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
students can't be discriminated against
 
06:47:40.490 --> 06:47:40.500 align:start position:0%
by any private school online program or
 
06:47:43.430 --> 06:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
educational vendor you know that is
 
06:47:45.948 --> 06:47:45.958 align:start position:0%
taking that tax money
 
06:47:48.530 --> 06:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
um as you know I've made no secret of it
 
06:47:50.570 --> 06:47:50.580 align:start position:0%
um I I do not think that the voucher
 
06:47:53.390 --> 06:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
program we have was very well conceived
 
06:47:54.708 --> 06:47:54.718 align:start position:0%
I will not dwell on that because you've
 
06:48:00.410 --> 06:48:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:02.448 --> 06:48:02.458 align:start position:0%
you know one thing that we are really
 
06:48:04.850 --> 06:48:04.860 align:start position:0%
concerned about is that vouchers are
 
06:48:08.330 --> 06:48:08.340 align:start position:0%
often used end up having the effect of
 
06:48:12.468 --> 06:48:12.478 align:start position:0%
discriminating against students
 
06:48:14.270 --> 06:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
public schools are open to all they
 
06:48:15.890 --> 06:48:15.900 align:start position:0%
serve all students but private schools
 
06:48:17.810 --> 06:48:17.820 align:start position:0%
and programs can deny students admission
 
06:48:20.570 --> 06:48:20.580 align:start position:0%
or discipline or expel them for any
 
06:48:22.548 --> 06:48:22.558 align:start position:0%
number of reasons including disability
 
06:48:25.190 --> 06:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
sexual orientation or religion and we
 
06:48:26.868 --> 06:48:26.878 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that
 
06:48:29.750 --> 06:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
a program that is using public tax money
 
06:48:32.090 --> 06:48:32.100 align:start position:0%
is not allowed to discriminate against
 
06:48:32.100 --> 06:48:33.468 align:start position:0%
is not allowed to discriminate against
students

06:48:33.468 --> 06:48:33.478 align:start position:0%
students
 
06:48:36.708 --> 06:48:36.718 align:start position:0%
based on disability sexual orientation
 
06:48:38.510 --> 06:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
religion or any of these protected
 
06:48:40.128 --> 06:48:40.138 align:start position:0%
categories that are mentioned in the
 
06:48:40.138 --> 06:48:40.910 align:start position:0%
categories that are mentioned in the
bill

06:48:40.910 --> 06:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:48:42.948 --> 06:48:42.958 align:start position:0%
there are examples across the country of
 
06:48:45.110 --> 06:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
how private voucher-funded schools have
 
06:48:47.208 --> 06:48:47.218 align:start position:0%
discriminated from children's with
 
06:48:49.490 --> 06:48:49.500 align:start position:0%
disability in Texas was rejected by 13
 
06:48:51.770 --> 06:48:51.780 align:start position:0%
different private schools to a Florida
 
06:48:54.170 --> 06:48:54.180 align:start position:0%
school that received 1.6 million in
 
06:48:56.570 --> 06:48:56.580 align:start position:0%
voucher funding in just one year but
 
06:48:58.368 --> 06:48:58.378 align:start position:0%
tell parents it would kick out gay or
 
06:49:00.350 --> 06:49:00.360 align:start position:0%
transgendered students
 
06:49:02.150 --> 06:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
especially troubling is how private
 
06:49:04.090 --> 06:49:04.100 align:start position:0%
school voucher programs Perpetual
 
06:49:07.610 --> 06:49:07.620 align:start position:0%
perpetuate racial segregation data going
 
06:49:09.110 --> 06:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
back more than 10 years show that
 
06:49:12.410 --> 06:49:12.420 align:start position:0%
vouchers disroportionately serve white
 
06:49:13.910 --> 06:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
students leaving students of color
 
06:49:15.350 --> 06:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
behind in schools that become
 
06:49:17.448 --> 06:49:17.458 align:start position:0%
increasingly more segregated
 
06:49:19.788 --> 06:49:19.798 align:start position:0%
sadly segregation is baked into vouchers
 
06:49:22.310 --> 06:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
history budget program started in the
 
06:49:22.320 --> 06:49:23.208 align:start position:0%
history budget program started in the
south

06:49:23.208 --> 06:49:23.218 align:start position:0%
south
 
06:49:25.850 --> 06:49:25.860 align:start position:0%
they were first created to allow white
 
06:49:27.708 --> 06:49:27.718 align:start position:0%
students to fund segregation academies
 
06:49:29.390 --> 06:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
in the wake of Brown versus Board of
 
06:49:31.910 --> 06:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
Education I know I often come here and
 
06:49:34.730 --> 06:49:34.740 align:start position:0%
voice positions that some of you don't
 
06:49:36.410 --> 06:49:36.420 align:start position:0%
agree with but I hope we can all agree
 
06:49:38.448 --> 06:49:38.458 align:start position:0%
that in New Hampshire we should not be
 
06:49:40.910 --> 06:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
spending taxpayer money
 
06:49:40.920 --> 06:49:42.230 align:start position:0%
spending taxpayer money
to

06:49:42.230 --> 06:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:49:42.240 --> 06:49:44.030 align:start position:0%
to
let

06:49:44.030 --> 06:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
let
 
06:49:44.040 --> 06:49:45.048 align:start position:0%
let
um

06:49:45.048 --> 06:49:45.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:49:47.090 --> 06:49:47.100 align:start position:0%
do like discrimination or segregation
 
06:49:49.670 --> 06:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
any form including private schools and
 
06:49:51.288 --> 06:49:51.298 align:start position:0%
programs that don't take certain
 
06:49:51.298 --> 06:49:53.208 align:start position:0%
programs that don't take certain
students

06:49:53.208 --> 06:49:53.218 align:start position:0%
students
 
06:49:53.218 --> 06:49:55.250 align:start position:0%
students
um

06:49:55.250 --> 06:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:49:57.468 --> 06:49:57.478 align:start position:0%
but public might be used that way
 
06:49:59.208 --> 06:49:59.218 align:start position:0%
through vouchers so I urge you to
 
06:50:01.730 --> 06:50:01.740 align:start position:0%
support HB 451.
 
06:50:03.350 --> 06:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you I was trying to summarize
 
06:50:05.868 --> 06:50:05.878 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you in light of the late
 
06:50:07.430 --> 06:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
hours are any any questions from the
 
06:50:08.930 --> 06:50:08.940 align:start position:0%
committee representative cordelli yes
 
06:50:12.110 --> 06:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you for maybe being
 
06:50:14.930 --> 06:50:14.940 align:start position:0%
our last uh testifier of the day no no
 
06:50:18.530 --> 06:50:18.540 align:start position:0%
that's okay sorry I tried yep
 
06:50:18.540 --> 06:50:19.850 align:start position:0%
that's okay sorry I tried yep
um

06:50:19.850 --> 06:50:19.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:50:22.310 --> 06:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
um how about
 
06:50:22.320 --> 06:50:24.530 align:start position:0%
um how about
um

06:50:24.530 --> 06:50:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:26.410 --> 06:50:26.420 align:start position:0%
Public Schools
 
06:50:28.930 --> 06:50:28.940 align:start position:0%
who accept
 
06:50:34.250 --> 06:50:34.260 align:start position:0%
a student but they cannot meet their
 
06:50:37.010 --> 06:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
special needs so have to place them in
 
06:50:38.930 --> 06:50:38.940 align:start position:0%
sometimes and out of state
 
06:50:38.940 --> 06:50:40.910 align:start position:0%
sometimes and out of state
facility

06:50:40.910 --> 06:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
facility
 
06:50:42.890 --> 06:50:42.900 align:start position:0%
um is that discrimination on the basis
 
06:50:45.650 --> 06:50:45.660 align:start position:0%
of of the public school
 
06:50:48.590 --> 06:50:48.600 align:start position:0%
no it's not because you are still
 
06:50:50.208 --> 06:50:50.218 align:start position:0%
providing the student with what they
 
06:50:52.430 --> 06:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
need and indeed the district is still
 
06:50:54.530 --> 06:50:54.540 align:start position:0%
paying the cost
 
06:50:54.540 --> 06:50:57.850 align:start position:0%
paying the cost
so

06:50:57.850 --> 06:50:57.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:01.310 --> 06:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
you are making all the arrangements for
 
06:51:02.570 --> 06:51:02.580 align:start position:0%
the student
 
06:51:07.070 --> 06:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:09.490 --> 06:51:09.500 align:start position:0%
often you have tried what you can within
 
06:51:11.990 --> 06:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
the you know Staffing facilities that
 
06:51:13.310 --> 06:51:13.320 align:start position:0%
you have and found that that does not
 
06:51:15.110 --> 06:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
meet the students need so then you you
 
06:51:19.070 --> 06:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
find the placement outside
 
06:51:22.010 --> 06:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
um so the more specialized placement
 
06:51:25.430 --> 06:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
um to to meet the students needs such as
 
06:51:27.948 --> 06:51:27.958 align:start position:0%
you know sending them to a specialized
 
06:51:29.868 --> 06:51:29.878 align:start position:0%
School for students with hearing
 
06:51:32.990 --> 06:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
impairment or or blindness which is one
 
06:51:37.610 --> 06:51:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:40.670 --> 06:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
then you're also paying for the cost
 
06:51:44.750 --> 06:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
it's not discrimination if that is what
 
06:51:47.510 --> 06:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
the team that is working with the
 
06:51:47.520 --> 06:51:49.368 align:start position:0%
the team that is working with the
student

06:51:49.368 --> 06:51:49.378 align:start position:0%
student
 
06:51:51.350 --> 06:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
in partnership with the parent has
 
06:51:51.360 --> 06:51:52.628 align:start position:0%
in partnership with the parent has
agreed

06:51:52.628 --> 06:51:52.638 align:start position:0%
agreed
 
06:51:55.190 --> 06:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
is the correct
 
06:51:57.048 --> 06:51:57.058 align:start position:0%
placement for that student that is
 
06:51:58.968 --> 06:51:58.978 align:start position:0%
called the IEP process
 
06:52:01.190 --> 06:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
well yes you may yeah
 
06:52:03.350 --> 06:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
06:52:07.670 --> 06:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not sure how that differs from
 
06:52:13.208 --> 06:52:13.218 align:start position:0%
a student going to a private school that
 
06:52:17.030 --> 06:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
maybe does not have the facilities to
 
06:52:20.030 --> 06:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
meet their special needs but provides
 
06:52:24.110 --> 06:52:24.120 align:start position:0%
them with other options and suggestions
 
06:52:26.410 --> 06:52:26.420 align:start position:0%
um isn't that being
 
06:52:30.170 --> 06:52:30.180 align:start position:0%
really more helpful to the student
 
06:52:34.310 --> 06:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
rather than accepting them into the
 
06:52:34.320 --> 06:52:35.530 align:start position:0%
rather than accepting them into the
school

06:52:35.530 --> 06:52:35.540 align:start position:0%
school
 
06:52:39.650 --> 06:52:39.660 align:start position:0%
taking their tuition money knowing that
 
06:52:41.628 --> 06:52:41.638 align:start position:0%
they cannot really meet the needs of
 
06:52:44.448 --> 06:52:44.458 align:start position:0%
that student well in the first situation
 
06:52:45.890 --> 06:52:45.900 align:start position:0%
the public school has not turned the
 
06:52:47.868 --> 06:52:47.878 align:start position:0%
student away this public school is still
 
06:52:49.670 --> 06:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
actively working with the student and
 
06:52:51.468 --> 06:52:51.478 align:start position:0%
the family indeed underwriting the cost
 
06:52:53.810 --> 06:52:53.820 align:start position:0%
of what the student needs in the second
 
06:52:55.610 --> 06:52:55.620 align:start position:0%
situation the private school has just
 
06:52:57.650 --> 06:52:57.660 align:start position:0%
said we've got some suggestions for you
 
06:53:00.830 --> 06:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
but that's all we are obligated to do
 
06:53:03.128 --> 06:53:03.138 align:start position:0%
so there's a difference
 
06:53:07.070 --> 06:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee yes
 
06:53:09.770 --> 06:53:09.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I kind of answered
 
06:53:12.048 --> 06:53:12.058 align:start position:0%
my old question because I find that this
 
06:53:13.850 --> 06:53:13.860 align:start position:0%
bill is taking things a little further
 
06:53:15.288 --> 06:53:15.298 align:start position:0%
and expanding everything that I talked
 
06:53:17.330 --> 06:53:17.340 align:start position:0%
about before as being not just public
 
06:53:19.610 --> 06:53:19.620 align:start position:0%
school but other things a longer list
 
06:53:22.368 --> 06:53:22.378 align:start position:0%
but I would my question to you is how
 
06:53:24.590 --> 06:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
does an online program or an educational
 
06:53:30.048 --> 06:53:30.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:33.410 --> 06:53:33.420 align:start position:0%
if it refuses to serve them that is one
 
06:53:34.910 --> 06:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
way it could discriminate against a
 
06:53:34.920 --> 06:53:35.990 align:start position:0%
way it could discriminate against a
student

06:53:35.990 --> 06:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
student
 
06:53:38.750 --> 06:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
um you know based on the categories
 
06:53:40.128 --> 06:53:40.138 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the bill
 
06:53:41.930 --> 06:53:41.940 align:start position:0%
you know because we we both take them
 
06:53:44.390 --> 06:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
yes I kind of think of online programs
 
06:53:47.570 --> 06:53:47.580 align:start position:0%
something that I buy and use or an
 
06:53:49.330 --> 06:53:49.340 align:start position:0%
educational vendors something I buy
 
06:53:52.310 --> 06:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
material from and use I don't see the
 
06:53:53.810 --> 06:53:53.820 align:start position:0%
thing an online program could be
 
06:53:55.250 --> 06:53:55.260 align:start position:0%
something you need to sign up for when
 
06:53:58.190 --> 06:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
you're actively participating in so
 
06:53:58.200 --> 06:53:58.730 align:start position:0%
you're actively participating in so
um

06:53:58.730 --> 06:53:58.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:54:02.270 --> 06:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:05.090 --> 06:54:05.100 align:start position:0%
not mutually exclusive definitions uh
 
06:54:06.350 --> 06:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
you you sign up and you are
 
06:54:09.110 --> 06:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
participating in
 
06:54:12.410 --> 06:54:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:14.330 --> 06:54:14.340 align:start position:0%
thank you further representative
 
06:54:17.090 --> 06:54:17.100 align:start position:0%
cordelli and then representative
 
06:54:19.490 --> 06:54:19.500 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um maybe you might have an
 
06:54:21.048 --> 06:54:21.058 align:start position:0%
answer for the question
 
06:54:23.448 --> 06:54:23.458 align:start position:0%
um I asked earlier about uh let's say a
 
06:54:25.548 --> 06:54:25.558 align:start position:0%
Christian School
 
06:54:29.448 --> 06:54:29.458 align:start position:0%
um would they be required under this
 
06:54:31.610 --> 06:54:31.620 align:start position:0%
um legislation if passed
 
06:54:35.868 --> 06:54:35.878 align:start position:0%
to hire a teacher who did not believe in
 
06:54:37.430 --> 06:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
their faith
 
06:54:39.170 --> 06:54:39.180 align:start position:0%
yeah I was looking at this mainly from
 
06:54:40.730 --> 06:54:40.740 align:start position:0%
the point of view of how it applied to
 
06:54:43.368 --> 06:54:43.378 align:start position:0%
students so I gotta say I'm not a lawyer
 
06:54:46.070 --> 06:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
so um I'm going to pass on that web you
 
06:54:47.570 --> 06:54:47.580 align:start position:0%
can ask representative Tanner when she
 
06:54:49.610 --> 06:54:49.620 align:start position:0%
is back thank you okay representative
 
06:54:51.890 --> 06:54:51.900 align:start position:0%
now thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
06:54:55.190 --> 06:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:57.110 --> 06:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
um I'm confused because you said that an
 
06:54:59.090 --> 06:54:59.100 align:start position:0%
online program is something you sign up
 
06:55:01.010 --> 06:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
for I would
 
06:55:03.048 --> 06:55:03.058 align:start position:0%
put the EFA program in that same
 
06:55:04.910 --> 06:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
categories the parents are signing up
 
06:55:06.770 --> 06:55:06.780 align:start position:0%
for and then choosing
 
06:55:06.780 --> 06:55:08.030 align:start position:0%
for and then choosing
what

06:55:08.030 --> 06:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
what
 
06:55:10.610 --> 06:55:10.620 align:start position:0%
how to use those funds in order to best
 
06:55:13.510 --> 06:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
serve their students needs
 
06:55:15.890 --> 06:55:15.900 align:start position:0%
it's still it's still coming out of the
 
06:55:18.830 --> 06:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
the public taxes though I mean you still
 
06:55:18.840 --> 06:55:20.510 align:start position:0%
the public taxes though I mean you still
underwriting

06:55:20.510 --> 06:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
underwriting
 
06:55:26.150 --> 06:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:28.310 --> 06:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
06:55:30.708 --> 06:55:30.718 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
06:55:43.660 --> 06:55:43.670 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:43.670 --> 06:55:46.330 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

06:55:46.330 --> 06:55:46.340 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:55:49.128 --> 06:55:49.138 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman and committee
 
06:55:51.890 --> 06:55:51.900 align:start position:0%
members thank you for having me
 
06:55:54.468 --> 06:55:54.478 align:start position:0%
um and I wish you all a very good week
 
06:55:56.810 --> 06:55:56.820 align:start position:0%
next week with your week off thank you
 
06:55:59.150 --> 06:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
so I think this is a great bill and I
 
06:56:01.548 --> 06:56:01.558 align:start position:0%
support it for the basic reason I think
 
06:56:04.190 --> 06:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
that if we have state funding going to
 
06:56:06.288 --> 06:56:06.298 align:start position:0%
schools or any organization that we
 
06:56:07.430 --> 06:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
should make sure that those
 
06:56:09.288 --> 06:56:09.298 align:start position:0%
organizations do not discriminate
 
06:56:11.208 --> 06:56:11.218 align:start position:0%
against people and that would be whether
 
06:56:12.770 --> 06:56:12.780 align:start position:0%
or not it's intentional or direct
 
06:56:15.048 --> 06:56:15.058 align:start position:0%
discrimination or if it's
 
06:56:17.390 --> 06:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
the resulting discrimination there are
 
06:56:18.948 --> 06:56:18.958 align:start position:0%
situations and I'll get into it in my
 
06:56:20.628 --> 06:56:20.638 align:start position:0%
testimony where discrimination happens
 
06:56:23.030 --> 06:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
and we see it happening in other voucher
 
06:56:25.250 --> 06:56:25.260 align:start position:0%
type programs around the country we know
 
06:56:27.048 --> 06:56:27.058 align:start position:0%
it's coming if New Hampshire is going to
 
06:56:28.910 --> 06:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
go down this road we should make sure
 
06:56:30.890 --> 06:56:30.900 align:start position:0%
that we don't allow what's happened
 
06:56:32.868 --> 06:56:32.878 align:start position:0%
elsewhere to happen here because there
 
06:56:34.368 --> 06:56:34.378 align:start position:0%
is significant discrimination in
 
06:56:35.690 --> 06:56:35.700 align:start position:0%
particular against children with
 
06:56:38.448 --> 06:56:38.458 align:start position:0%
disabilities and children of color that
 
06:56:41.570 --> 06:56:41.580 align:start position:0%
may not be intended thinking back to the
 
06:56:43.390 --> 06:56:43.400 align:start position:0%
last two hours where we talked about
 
06:56:46.190 --> 06:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
higher education three things came
 
06:56:47.930 --> 06:56:47.940 align:start position:0%
through to me quite clearly first was
 
06:56:50.990 --> 06:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
that Clarity of legislation is better
 
06:56:53.510 --> 06:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
second is that once you get into the
 
06:56:56.448 --> 06:56:56.458 align:start position:0%
public forum then you want to make sure
 
06:56:58.250 --> 06:56:58.260 align:start position:0%
that there's no discrimination that was
 
06:57:00.468 --> 06:57:00.478 align:start position:0%
the the question why is this happening
 
06:57:02.448 --> 06:57:02.458 align:start position:0%
there's the proposed previous law for
 
06:57:04.310 --> 06:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
public universities and not private
 
06:57:06.468 --> 06:57:06.478 align:start position:0%
universities and then the very
 
06:57:08.570 --> 06:57:08.580 align:start position:0%
compelling testimony from the two
 
06:57:10.730 --> 06:57:10.740 align:start position:0%
students at UNH School of Law one of
 
06:57:13.128 --> 06:57:13.138 align:start position:0%
them said we wanted to have a healthy
 
06:57:15.708 --> 06:57:15.718 align:start position:0%
balance of perspectives on campus and
 
06:57:18.350 --> 06:57:18.360 align:start position:0%
again those principles will underscore
 
06:57:20.510 --> 06:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
why I think this is this is a positive
 
06:57:22.910 --> 06:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
bill so first I'd like to go into three
 
06:57:24.410 --> 06:57:24.420 align:start position:0%
categories one is children with
 
06:57:26.868 --> 06:57:26.878 align:start position:0%
disabilities we know that there is huge
 
06:57:29.030 --> 06:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
differences between children who
 
06:57:30.948 --> 06:57:30.958 align:start position:0%
participate in the education Freedom
 
06:57:32.570 --> 06:57:32.580 align:start position:0%
accounts and in the public schools when
 
06:57:35.390 --> 06:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
it comes to disabilities 18 of the
 
06:57:37.368 --> 06:57:37.378 align:start position:0%
students in the public schools
 
06:57:39.948 --> 06:57:39.958 align:start position:0%
our children with disabilities only six
 
06:57:43.190 --> 06:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
percent in the efa's are children with
 
06:57:45.170 --> 06:57:45.180 align:start position:0%
disabilities that's a 300 difference
 
06:57:47.750 --> 06:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
that's because the public schools take
 
06:57:49.850 --> 06:57:49.860 align:start position:0%
every child that comes to the school and
 
06:57:51.830 --> 06:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
has to provide them with a free and
 
06:57:53.810 --> 06:57:53.820 align:start position:0%
appropriate education those children
 
06:57:57.048 --> 06:57:57.058 align:start position:0%
also have the right the whole slew of
 
06:57:59.868 --> 06:57:59.878 align:start position:0%
procedural rights that go with that
 
06:58:01.968 --> 06:58:01.978 align:start position:0%
in the private schools they don't have
 
06:58:03.890 --> 06:58:03.900 align:start position:0%
to take any child they don't want to so
 
06:58:05.750 --> 06:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
if they say this child is too expensive
 
06:58:08.390 --> 06:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
if the service is required are too much
 
06:58:10.610 --> 06:58:10.620 align:start position:0%
for us they won't take them or they will
 
06:58:12.288 --> 06:58:12.298 align:start position:0%
just eventually suspend the student and
 
06:58:13.850 --> 06:58:13.860 align:start position:0%
have them leave
 
06:58:17.030 --> 06:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
and it is very clear that this program
 
06:58:19.490 --> 06:58:19.500 align:start position:0%
functions essentially as a voucher if
 
06:58:21.770 --> 06:58:21.780 align:start position:0%
you go look at the website where the
 
06:58:24.708 --> 06:58:24.718 align:start position:0%
expenses are broken down over 60 some
 
06:58:27.110 --> 06:58:27.120 align:start position:0%
odd percent are just direct payments for
 
06:58:27.120 --> 06:58:28.070 align:start position:0%
odd percent are just direct payments for
tuition

06:58:28.070 --> 06:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
tuition
 
06:58:30.650 --> 06:58:30.660 align:start position:0%
the next most common thing it's kind of
 
06:58:32.448 --> 06:58:32.458 align:start position:0%
hard because it's not really very
 
06:58:34.788 --> 06:58:34.798 align:start position:0%
coherent bookkeeping that you can see if
 
06:58:36.650 --> 06:58:36.660 align:start position:0%
you're a member of the public but the
 
06:58:38.750 --> 06:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
next most common thing is Amazon item
 
06:58:40.610 --> 06:58:40.620 align:start position:0%
required by School item required by
 
06:58:42.170 --> 06:58:42.180 align:start position:0%
School and just keeps listing them all
 
06:58:44.628 --> 06:58:44.638 align:start position:0%
so I think the huge vast majority of the
 
06:58:46.968 --> 06:58:46.978 align:start position:0%
money is either for tuition or for a
 
06:58:48.890 --> 06:58:48.900 align:start position:0%
book or a laptop required by School
 
06:58:51.468 --> 06:58:51.478 align:start position:0%
which is the way that an old-fashioned
 
06:58:53.330 --> 06:58:53.340 align:start position:0%
voucher would have worked when these uh
 
06:58:54.948 --> 06:58:54.958 align:start position:0%
this first came along 20 years ago you
 
06:58:56.448 --> 06:58:56.458 align:start position:0%
would get a voucher go to a school a
 
06:58:58.190 --> 06:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
private school and that would cover your
 
06:59:01.010 --> 06:59:01.020 align:start position:0%
tuition and your books so the important
 
06:59:02.750 --> 06:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
thing here is that when you go to a
 
06:59:05.150 --> 06:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
private school you have to give up your
 
06:59:06.530 --> 06:59:06.540 align:start position:0%
right to a free and appropriate
 
06:59:09.410 --> 06:59:09.420 align:start position:0%
education you give up at the door you
 
06:59:11.510 --> 06:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
get your five thousand dollar check but
 
06:59:13.730 --> 06:59:13.740 align:start position:0%
you give up your rights you don't have
 
06:59:15.170 --> 06:59:15.180 align:start position:0%
them when you go into a private school
 
06:59:17.868 --> 06:59:17.878 align:start position:0%
the council for exceptional children in
 
06:59:20.750 --> 06:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
2020 issued their position statement on
 
06:59:22.670 --> 06:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
public education dollars to fund School
 
06:59:25.250 --> 06:59:25.260 align:start position:0%
vouchers and other voucher type programs
 
06:59:27.650 --> 06:59:27.660 align:start position:0%
and they they're opposed to these for
 
06:59:30.770 --> 06:59:30.780 align:start position:0%
four reasons first it excludes children
 
06:59:33.170 --> 06:59:33.180 align:start position:0%
of low incomes and they talk about how
 
06:59:35.150 --> 06:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
how what happens with the private
 
06:59:37.190 --> 06:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
schools they if they're going to provide
 
06:59:38.930 --> 06:59:38.940 align:start position:0%
additional Services they end up billing
 
06:59:40.730 --> 06:59:40.740 align:start position:0%
the parents and here's what they say
 
06:59:42.708 --> 06:59:42.718 align:start position:0%
this reality ultimately can make
 
06:59:44.390 --> 06:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
vouchers and voucher type programs
 
06:59:45.890 --> 06:59:45.900 align:start position:0%
appealing to Middle income and upper
 
06:59:47.930 --> 06:59:47.940 align:start position:0%
middle income families but effectively
 
06:59:51.170 --> 06:59:51.180 align:start position:0%
eliminates lower income families school
 
06:59:52.910 --> 06:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
districts also report students with
 
06:59:54.530 --> 06:59:54.540 align:start position:0%
disabilities leaving voucher-funded
 
06:59:56.090 --> 06:59:56.100 align:start position:0%
schools because the student required
 
06:59:57.530 --> 06:59:57.540 align:start position:0%
more services than the school could
 
06:59:57.540 --> 06:59:58.850 align:start position:0%
more services than the school could
provide

06:59:58.850 --> 06:59:58.860 align:start position:0%
provide
 
07:00:00.948 --> 07:00:00.958 align:start position:0%
this that's discrimination we know
 
07:00:02.868 --> 07:00:02.878 align:start position:0%
that's going to happen we need to make
 
07:00:04.490 --> 07:00:04.500 align:start position:0%
sure that it doesn't happen the way to
 
07:00:06.590 --> 07:00:06.600 align:start position:0%
make sure it happens is very simple put
 
07:00:08.990 --> 07:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
into the rule for the efas that you
 
07:00:11.090 --> 07:00:11.100 align:start position:0%
there will be no discrimination based on
 
07:00:13.548 --> 07:00:13.558 align:start position:0%
disability if a private school wants to
 
07:00:15.590 --> 07:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
participate in the program then they
 
07:00:17.270 --> 07:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
must provide
 
07:00:19.430 --> 07:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
full services to children with
 
07:00:21.890 --> 07:00:21.900 align:start position:0%
disabilities otherwise low-income
 
07:00:23.570 --> 07:00:23.580 align:start position:0%
students will not be able to participate
 
07:00:26.150 --> 07:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
and that's discriminatory a second way
 
07:00:27.650 --> 07:00:27.660 align:start position:0%
that it discriminates against children
 
07:00:29.690 --> 07:00:29.700 align:start position:0%
with disabilities is that people have to
 
07:00:31.368 --> 07:00:31.378 align:start position:0%
Forfeit their rights under the idea
 
07:00:33.288 --> 07:00:33.298 align:start position:0%
which I just mentioned and it's right on
 
07:00:36.048 --> 07:00:36.058 align:start position:0%
the website for the efas they say in
 
07:00:38.150 --> 07:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
this report the guarantee of procedural
 
07:00:40.250 --> 07:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
protections for parents and families is
 
07:00:43.190 --> 07:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
a fundamental part of the idea and
 
07:00:44.930 --> 07:00:44.940 align:start position:0%
without these Protections in private
 
07:00:47.270 --> 07:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
schools families are left as unequal
 
07:00:49.250 --> 07:00:49.260 align:start position:0%
Partners so that's the second reason why
 
07:00:52.788 --> 07:00:52.798 align:start position:0%
the vouchers the efas should be required
 
07:00:54.590 --> 07:00:54.600 align:start position:0%
to have full rights for students with
 
07:00:56.150 --> 07:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
disabilities because they lose all of
 
07:00:57.830 --> 07:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
those procedural protections and that
 
07:00:59.750 --> 07:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
answers the question that I think it was
 
07:01:01.430 --> 07:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli asks what's the
 
07:01:03.770 --> 07:01:03.780 align:start position:0%
difference between the what happens with
 
07:01:06.468 --> 07:01:06.478 align:start position:0%
uh the student who gets goes to an
 
07:01:07.788 --> 07:01:07.798 align:start position:0%
out-of-state School actually they end up
 
07:01:09.468 --> 07:01:09.478 align:start position:0%
going to Perkins School for the children
 
07:01:12.110 --> 07:01:12.120 align:start position:0%
of the blind if you do that with a
 
07:01:14.090 --> 07:01:14.100 align:start position:0%
public school placement you still have
 
07:01:15.948 --> 07:01:15.958 align:start position:0%
your procedural Protections in place
 
07:01:17.930 --> 07:01:17.940 align:start position:0%
when you go to the private school you
 
07:01:19.730 --> 07:01:19.740 align:start position:0%
have zero procedural Protections in
 
07:01:21.530 --> 07:01:21.540 align:start position:0%
place the third reason that they're
 
07:01:23.448 --> 07:01:23.458 align:start position:0%
opposed to this is because children with
 
07:01:25.430 --> 07:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
disabilities get pushed out they say
 
07:01:27.288 --> 07:01:27.298 align:start position:0%
private schools are under no obligation
 
07:01:29.030 --> 07:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
to keep a child enrolled during the
 
07:01:31.250 --> 07:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
school year or offer re-enrollment in a
 
07:01:33.230 --> 07:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
subsequent year evidence indicates that
 
07:01:34.850 --> 07:01:34.860 align:start position:0%
private schools typically do not
 
07:01:37.670 --> 07:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
re-enroll but push out children with a
 
07:01:39.350 --> 07:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
history of discipline problems or
 
07:01:41.270 --> 07:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
atypical behaviors that can diversely
 
07:01:43.670 --> 07:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
affect other students so the students
 
07:01:45.230 --> 07:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
with disabilities either don't get in
 
07:01:47.448 --> 07:01:47.458 align:start position:0%
the door they are totally part way
 
07:01:49.070 --> 07:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
through the season or they don't get to
 
07:01:50.570 --> 07:01:50.580 align:start position:0%
come back the next year it's
 
07:01:53.510 --> 07:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
discriminatory in effect even if the
 
07:01:56.510 --> 07:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
efas want to treat everybody equally the
 
07:01:57.708 --> 07:01:57.718 align:start position:0%
effect is that children with
 
07:01:59.330 --> 07:01:59.340 align:start position:0%
disabilities are discriminated against
 
07:02:01.430 --> 07:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
and the last reason they just they are
 
07:02:03.650 --> 07:02:03.660 align:start position:0%
against it is because of the no less
 
07:02:05.868 --> 07:02:05.878 align:start position:0%
restrictive environment cause private
 
07:02:08.270 --> 07:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
schools are not subject to the lre the
 
07:02:09.670 --> 07:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
least restrictive environment
 
07:02:11.690 --> 07:02:11.700 align:start position:0%
requirements and there is the potential
 
07:02:13.730 --> 07:02:13.740 align:start position:0%
for in-school segregation of children
 
07:02:15.468 --> 07:02:15.478 align:start position:0%
and youth with disabilities so even if a
 
07:02:16.850 --> 07:02:16.860 align:start position:0%
child with disabilities goes to a
 
07:02:19.128 --> 07:02:19.138 align:start position:0%
private school they'll be segregated why
 
07:02:21.650 --> 07:02:21.660 align:start position:0%
because they are not given the re the
 
07:02:23.090 --> 07:02:23.100 align:start position:0%
protection for the least restrictive
 
07:02:25.788 --> 07:02:25.798 align:start position:0%
environment which does carry with you in
 
07:02:27.948 --> 07:02:27.958 align:start position:0%
the public school so the result is that
 
07:02:29.208 --> 07:02:29.218 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities get
 
07:02:30.770 --> 07:02:30.780 align:start position:0%
discriminated against in the voucher
 
07:02:32.510 --> 07:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
plans you know this is going to happen
 
07:02:34.670 --> 07:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
evidence around the country where this
 
07:02:36.770 --> 07:02:36.780 align:start position:0%
has been done for 20 to 25 years tells
 
07:02:38.570 --> 07:02:38.580 align:start position:0%
you that the way to make sure it doesn't
 
07:02:40.430 --> 07:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
happen is to write it into the law that
 
07:02:42.048 --> 07:02:42.058 align:start position:0%
it won't happen the other problem is
 
07:02:43.490 --> 07:02:43.500 align:start position:0%
that the parents don't even know what
 
07:02:45.770 --> 07:02:45.780 align:start position:0%
they're getting into in a previous Bill
 
07:02:47.390 --> 07:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
a couple weeks ago I sent you a rather
 
07:02:50.448 --> 07:02:50.458 align:start position:0%
long written testimony but I mentioned a
 
07:02:52.968 --> 07:02:52.978 align:start position:0%
GAO report about private school choice
 
07:02:55.128 --> 07:02:55.138 align:start position:0%
and vouchers and they talked about how
 
07:02:56.990 --> 07:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
parents can't get information from these
 
07:02:58.850 --> 07:02:58.860 align:start position:0%
private schools they don't know whether
 
07:03:00.708 --> 07:03:00.718 align:start position:0%
or not they offer services specific to
 
07:03:02.390 --> 07:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
their child is there somebody there
 
07:03:04.850 --> 07:03:04.860 align:start position:0%
who's actually qualified to teach what
 
07:03:07.190 --> 07:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
they study what the private school may
 
07:03:09.048 --> 07:03:09.058 align:start position:0%
just have one person who deals with 10
 
07:03:10.788 --> 07:03:10.798 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities and does
 
07:03:12.350 --> 07:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
their best that they can for all of them
 
07:03:14.628 --> 07:03:14.638 align:start position:0%
there's no legal protection in the
 
07:03:16.788 --> 07:03:16.798 align:start position:0%
public school that child has a right to
 
07:03:18.890 --> 07:03:18.900 align:start position:0%
an individual actual education program
 
07:03:20.750 --> 07:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
and we'll be getting services from
 
07:03:23.150 --> 07:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
people who are qualified and trained in
 
07:03:26.330 --> 07:03:26.340 align:start position:0%
their specific area our governor who
 
07:03:27.830 --> 07:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
obviously helped write this plan he
 
07:03:29.810 --> 07:03:29.820 align:start position:0%
passed the legislation and all that you
 
07:03:31.610 --> 07:03:31.620 align:start position:0%
will remember last September they had a
 
07:03:33.288 --> 07:03:33.298 align:start position:0%
forum on disabilities in education
 
07:03:35.270 --> 07:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
during the campaign and it was uh
 
07:03:37.850 --> 07:03:37.860 align:start position:0%
Senator Sherman and governor sununu and
 
07:03:40.010 --> 07:03:40.020 align:start position:0%
Governor sununo said when you go to a
 
07:03:41.390 --> 07:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
private school through the voucher plan
 
07:03:43.968 --> 07:03:43.978 align:start position:0%
you give up no legal rights and he
 
07:03:46.190 --> 07:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
immediately was told that was incorrect
 
07:03:48.288 --> 07:03:48.298 align:start position:0%
by online in the next day in the Press
 
07:03:50.330 --> 07:03:50.340 align:start position:0%
by the rights Community he then came
 
07:03:51.770 --> 07:03:51.780 align:start position:0%
back and said okay well all right you
 
07:03:54.350 --> 07:03:54.360 align:start position:0%
get some rights that's all you get in
 
07:03:56.868 --> 07:03:56.878 align:start position:0%
the private school is some rights you
 
07:03:59.510 --> 07:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
give up your legal right to a free and
 
07:04:01.128 --> 07:04:01.138 align:start position:0%
appropriate education when you leave
 
07:04:03.410 --> 07:04:03.420 align:start position:0%
that public school so the way to make
 
07:04:05.930 --> 07:04:05.940 align:start position:0%
sure this doesn't happen under a voucher
 
07:04:07.310 --> 07:04:07.320 align:start position:0%
system if New Hampshire is going to
 
07:04:09.170 --> 07:04:09.180 align:start position:0%
adhere to our philosophy of not
 
07:04:11.628 --> 07:04:11.638 align:start position:0%
discriminating is to make it very clear
 
07:04:14.150 --> 07:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
you asked earlier a question well it's
 
07:04:16.910 --> 07:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
already in the civil rights law I
 
07:04:21.110 --> 07:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
remember it was 393 or okay but
 
07:04:23.270 --> 07:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
obviously that's in law we've seen this
 
07:04:24.830 --> 07:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
program in effect for two years in
 
07:04:26.628 --> 07:04:26.638 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities are not
 
07:04:29.208 --> 07:04:29.218 align:start position:0%
getting legal rights they don't have due
 
07:04:30.708 --> 07:04:30.718 align:start position:0%
process rights they don't have the least
 
07:04:32.510 --> 07:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
restrictive environment right they have
 
07:04:34.968 --> 07:04:34.978 align:start position:0%
no legal rights when they participate in
 
07:04:36.468 --> 07:04:36.478 align:start position:0%
the voucher program if they go to a
 
07:04:37.968 --> 07:04:37.978 align:start position:0%
private school that's why it needs to be
 
07:04:39.708 --> 07:04:39.718 align:start position:0%
written into this law so that it's very
 
07:04:41.868 --> 07:04:41.878 align:start position:0%
very clear that the intent of the
 
07:04:43.788 --> 07:04:43.798 align:start position:0%
legislature is that that provision
 
07:04:46.010 --> 07:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
follows over we had a judge testifying
 
07:04:48.170 --> 07:04:48.180 align:start position:0%
earlier make your laws clear this would
 
07:04:49.610 --> 07:04:49.620 align:start position:0%
make it very clear that that's what you
 
07:04:52.070 --> 07:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
want the second group of people that
 
07:04:53.868 --> 07:04:53.878 align:start position:0%
this is relevant to is Children of color
 
07:04:56.810 --> 07:04:56.820 align:start position:0%
Indiana adopted a choice program and in
 
07:04:59.448 --> 07:04:59.458 align:start position:0%
their program when the original uh
 
07:05:01.368 --> 07:05:01.378 align:start position:0%
program went into effect the ratio of
 
07:05:02.990 --> 07:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
white children to black children was two
 
07:05:05.270 --> 07:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
to one there was two white children for
 
07:05:07.190 --> 07:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
every one black child who signed up for
 
07:05:09.468 --> 07:05:09.478 align:start position:0%
the voucher programs but
 
07:05:11.390 --> 07:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
I'll just read it'd be much more simple
 
07:05:14.090 --> 07:05:14.100 align:start position:0%
for you if I say research and practice
 
07:05:16.128 --> 07:05:16.138 align:start position:0%
indicates that vouchers and voucher type
 
07:05:17.930 --> 07:05:17.940 align:start position:0%
programs point us in the other direction
 
07:05:19.368 --> 07:05:19.378 align:start position:0%
that's away from diverse student
 
07:05:21.650 --> 07:05:21.660 align:start position:0%
populations these programs can
 
07:05:23.930 --> 07:05:23.940 align:start position:0%
facilitate racial ethnic economic
 
07:05:25.490 --> 07:05:25.500 align:start position:0%
religious gender and disability
 
07:05:27.410 --> 07:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
segregation in Indiana the Indiana
 
07:05:29.628 --> 07:05:29.638 align:start position:0%
school choice program which began in
 
07:05:31.670 --> 07:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
2011 was built as a way to help poor
 
07:05:33.350 --> 07:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
minority children Escape bad Public
 
07:05:35.330 --> 07:05:35.340 align:start position:0%
Schools since then the percentage of
 
07:05:37.128 --> 07:05:37.138 align:start position:0%
white voucher recipients has increased
 
07:05:39.650 --> 07:05:39.660 align:start position:0%
from 46 to 60 percent and the percentage
 
07:05:41.390 --> 07:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
of black recipients has dropped from 24
 
07:05:44.750 --> 07:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
to 12 percent what does that mean in
 
07:05:47.208 --> 07:05:47.218 align:start position:0%
year one the ratio is two to one two
 
07:05:48.650 --> 07:05:48.660 align:start position:0%
white students for every black student
 
07:05:51.410 --> 07:05:51.420 align:start position:0%
it is now five to one the black students
 
07:05:53.750 --> 07:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
they're not working out it says in
 
07:05:55.850 --> 07:05:55.860 align:start position:0%
practice they're not being able to
 
07:05:58.128 --> 07:05:58.138 align:start position:0%
maintain in the voucher private schools
 
07:06:00.010 --> 07:06:00.020 align:start position:0%
the white students are going there and
 
07:06:02.390 --> 07:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
Deborah Howell also testified to this
 
07:06:04.670 --> 07:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
too earlier you started two to one and
 
07:06:06.410 --> 07:06:06.420 align:start position:0%
after a few years you find yourself at
 
07:06:08.390 --> 07:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
five to one that tells you that in
 
07:06:10.548 --> 07:06:10.558 align:start position:0%
practice there's discrete Nation I'm not
 
07:06:11.810 --> 07:06:11.820 align:start position:0%
saying anybody's intending to
 
07:06:13.548 --> 07:06:13.558 align:start position:0%
discriminate but if you know that that's
 
07:06:15.350 --> 07:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
going to be the result if New Hampshire
 
07:06:17.990 --> 07:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
is going to continue with efas we see
 
07:06:20.750 --> 07:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
this coming from 20 years of research we
 
07:06:22.610 --> 07:06:22.620 align:start position:0%
should put it into the law that says
 
07:06:24.770 --> 07:06:24.780 align:start position:0%
race take it out of that other law
 
07:06:26.510 --> 07:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
that's the generic law and put it right
 
07:06:29.330 --> 07:06:29.340 align:start position:0%
into the EFA law along with disability
 
07:06:31.670 --> 07:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
rights so that we make sure that when
 
07:06:33.830 --> 07:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
people participate in the EFA if they
 
07:06:35.390 --> 07:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
have a child who has a disability
 
07:06:37.190 --> 07:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
they'll know that they keep their rights
 
07:06:39.770 --> 07:06:39.780 align:start position:0%
the parent will never be confused as to
 
07:06:40.910 --> 07:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
whether or not the rights follow them
 
07:06:42.530 --> 07:06:42.540 align:start position:0%
and if you have if you're a parent with
 
07:06:44.270 --> 07:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
a child of color you will know that your
 
07:06:48.288 --> 07:06:48.298 align:start position:0%
child will not be unfairly suspended or
 
07:06:50.330 --> 07:06:50.340 align:start position:0%
kicked out of the school or not re asked
 
07:06:52.610 --> 07:06:52.620 align:start position:0%
to recumbact the next year put it in the
 
07:06:54.650 --> 07:06:54.660 align:start position:0%
law it makes it clear the last group is
 
07:06:58.250 --> 07:06:58.260 align:start position:0%
lgbtq students we know that lgbtq folks
 
07:06:59.930 --> 07:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
make up about five percent of the New
 
07:07:02.150 --> 07:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire adult population and they make
 
07:07:04.490 --> 07:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
up 22 percent of high school students in
 
07:07:05.990 --> 07:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
this country that's from the latest
 
07:07:08.030 --> 07:07:08.040 align:start position:0%
study done by the CDC
 
07:07:10.730 --> 07:07:10.740 align:start position:0%
if we're going to have students who are
 
07:07:13.788 --> 07:07:13.798 align:start position:0%
lgbtq going to private schools they will
 
07:07:16.250 --> 07:07:16.260 align:start position:0%
want to be treated fairly now the
 
07:07:18.830 --> 07:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
testimony earlier from the students at
 
07:07:20.448 --> 07:07:20.458 align:start position:0%
the law school was so compelling they
 
07:07:22.310 --> 07:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
just wanted to be treated like they were
 
07:07:24.708 --> 07:07:24.718 align:start position:0%
welcomed in their school if imagine
 
07:07:27.048 --> 07:07:27.058 align:start position:0%
being a student who comes out during
 
07:07:28.670 --> 07:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
your high school years and you find
 
07:07:30.288 --> 07:07:30.298 align:start position:0%
yourself in a voucher program and you're
 
07:07:32.810 --> 07:07:32.820 align:start position:0%
in a private private school in which
 
07:07:36.110 --> 07:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
bans members of the LGBT community from
 
07:07:38.090 --> 07:07:38.100 align:start position:0%
teaching at that school there is nobody
 
07:07:39.890 --> 07:07:39.900 align:start position:0%
there that you can look to as a mentor
 
07:07:42.170 --> 07:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
no role model nobody who could be like
 
07:07:44.270 --> 07:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
you they're going to be feeling the same
 
07:07:46.788 --> 07:07:46.798 align:start position:0%
awful feelings that the previous
 
07:07:49.250 --> 07:07:49.260 align:start position:0%
testimony came about if we're going to
 
07:07:52.788 --> 07:07:52.798 align:start position:0%
have a society where we say when it's a
 
07:07:54.468 --> 07:07:54.478 align:start position:0%
public forum when there's State actors
 
07:07:56.510 --> 07:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
involved we want to make sure that
 
07:07:58.310 --> 07:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
people who have religious beliefs feel
 
07:08:00.410 --> 07:08:00.420 align:start position:0%
welcome like at the UNA School of Law
 
07:08:02.868 --> 07:08:02.878 align:start position:0%
then if it's state money that's funding
 
07:08:04.968 --> 07:08:04.978 align:start position:0%
these private schools then we want to
 
07:08:07.368 --> 07:08:07.378 align:start position:0%
make sure that those protections also go
 
07:08:09.468 --> 07:08:09.478 align:start position:0%
with the state money so that members of
 
07:08:12.170 --> 07:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
the lgbtq community are not faced with
 
07:08:14.208 --> 07:08:14.218 align:start position:0%
ridicule or feel like I can't stay with
 
07:08:16.010 --> 07:08:16.020 align:start position:0%
this school because there's nobody here
 
07:08:18.830 --> 07:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
who understands me so again Clarity in
 
07:08:20.810 --> 07:08:20.820 align:start position:0%
the law will make sure that when we have
 
07:08:23.868 --> 07:08:23.878 align:start position:0%
public actors we should have
 
07:08:27.230 --> 07:08:27.240 align:start position:0%
uh civil rights following with the
 
07:08:30.048 --> 07:08:30.058 align:start position:0%
financial aid coming from the state
 
07:08:32.330 --> 07:08:32.340 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for listening thank
 
07:08:33.650 --> 07:08:33.660 align:start position:0%
you very much are there questions from
 
07:08:35.750 --> 07:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
07:08:37.788 --> 07:08:37.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you Mr
 
07:08:39.410 --> 07:08:39.420 align:start position:0%
chairman and with that we're going to
 
07:08:42.190 --> 07:08:42.200 align:start position:0%
close down this hearing
 
07:08:46.670 --> 07:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
and the week and adjourn
 
07:08:51.190 --> 07:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:53.570 --> 07:08:53.580 align:start position:0%
I mean we don't have the schedule will
 
07:08:55.610 --> 07:08:55.620 align:start position:0%
be put out uh next week in the next
 
07:09:05.830 --> 07:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:08.448 --> 07:09:08.458 align:start position:0%
because what we have left that we just
 
07:09:11.570 --> 07:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
have exact bills left approximately half
 
07:09:13.490 --> 07:09:13.500 align:start position:0%
the bills we receive we still have to
 
07:09:15.830 --> 07:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
exec and we'll start doing that on
 
07:09:17.810 --> 07:09:17.820 align:start position:0%
Monday and rest assured we'll probably
 
07:09:20.090 --> 07:09:20.100 align:start position:0%
start around 9 30 but there will be
