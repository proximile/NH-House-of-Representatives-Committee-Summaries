I'd like to add um with the chair's
 
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 align:start position:0%
concurrence and I know this question
 
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
will come up when we travel on these
 
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
trips we are representing the state of
 
00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:10.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and so I would um suggest
 
00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
that we we dress appropriately sometimes
 
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
people do have questions on what they
 
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
should be wearing but for me I'll be
 
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
wearing my coat and tie so if you have
 
00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360 align:start position:0%
anything to say chair Mr
 
00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:26.039 align:start position:0%
chair I agree that dorum would uh
 
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
suggest that we should all Dr dress the
 
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
same way that we would address dress for
 
00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:33.759 align:start position:0%
a committee meeting or a house
 
00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:36.639 align:start position:0%
session since that is the standard dress
 
00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
code of the house business
 
00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:42.039 align:start position:0%
casual okay before we start our work
 
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
session I have one other issue to to
 
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240 align:start position:0%
discuss with the committee at our
 
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
committee meeting last Tuesday in an
 
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
exec session we unanimously passed an
 
00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:54.199 align:start position:0%
amendment to House Bill
 
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
1644 and it has been brought to my
 
00:06:59.550 --> 00:06:59.560 align:start position:0%
attention that there is a question
 
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
concerning the germanness of the
 
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:04.280 align:start position:0%
amendment that we adopted even though we
 
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
adopted it unanimously there was no
 
00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:09.160 align:start position:0%
question of germanness at the time of
 
00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:11.919 align:start position:0%
the adoption so I went to the clerk this
 
00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
morning had an extensive discussion with
 
00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
him he is going to take the substance of
 
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
my discussion to the speaker the two of
 
00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:21.479 align:start position:0%
them are going to talk about whether or
 
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
not they believe this bill is Germaine
 
00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:26.919 align:start position:0%
and they will respond back to us at some
 
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:29.560 align:start position:0%
point during the day today with a
 
00:07:32.589 --> 00:07:32.599 align:start position:0%
decision about whether that bill is
 
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:34.360 align:start position:0%
Germaine or
 
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:38.440 align:start position:0%
not and as soon as I hear from the clerk
 
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
I will pass that information information
 
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
along to the rest of you representative
 
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.120 align:start position:0%
Bernardi I'm horrible with numbers can
 
00:07:50.029 --> 00:07:50.039 align:start position:0%
you tell me what the topic of the bill
 
00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:51.919 align:start position:0%
was yes
 
00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
1644 was the bill to which we amend that
 
00:07:59.589 --> 00:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
we amended to add nuclear to class one
 
00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:02.440 align:start position:0%
uh Rex in the renewable portfolio
 
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:05.240 align:start position:0%
standard thank you and that's adding
 
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
nuclear after the date built after the
 
00:08:14.029 --> 00:08:14.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
2024 okay with that out of the way we
 
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
can now begin our full committee work
 
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
session we're going to go slightly out
 
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
of order
 
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:27.240 align:start position:0%
because as we've all discovered during
 
00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:30.639 align:start position:0%
this session year so far
 
00:08:33.949 --> 00:08:33.959 align:start position:0%
OS sometimes delivers stuff on time and
 
00:08:37.029 --> 00:08:37.039 align:start position:0%
sometimes doesn't and so we don't have
 
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
the amendment for House Bill 1036 yet
 
00:08:43.949 --> 00:08:43.959 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington was at OS this
 
00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:45.560 align:start position:0%
morning representative Harrington you
 
00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:47.360 align:start position:0%
want to tell us what they told
 
00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:50.200 align:start position:0%
you uh well I had requested the uh
 
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
amendment by 214 and I didn't receive
 
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:55.720 align:start position:0%
anything over the weekend so I went down
 
00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
there this morning and they basically
 
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
said it hadn't been done yet and they
 
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
were going to work on it right away and
 
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:02.680 align:start position:0%
try to get it up to the fourth floor in
 
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
this building as soon as
 
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
possible okay so we do not have the
 
00:09:12.069 --> 00:09:12.079 align:start position:0%
finished Amendment for 1036 as of this
 
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
moment so we're going to start our work
 
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
session by discussion discussing House
 
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
Bill 1600 FN relative to participation
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
in net energy metering and we do have an
 
00:09:26.509 --> 00:09:26.519 align:start position:0%
amendment for that which was filed by
 
00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:29.240 align:start position:0%
representative Corman and myself it's
 
00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:30.440 align:start position:0%
amendment number
 
00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.190 align:start position:0%
amendment number
20247

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
20247
 
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
40h and I'm going to turn it over to
 
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
representative Corman to discuss what
 
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
the amendment does and to also discuss
 
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
that there may be a subsequent Amendment
 
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
coming that makes a small change
 
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
representative Corman thank excuse me
 
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:50.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and actually I have
 
00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
now a digital copy of the further
 
00:09:56.269 --> 00:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:58.870 --> 00:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
0764 and the only difference in the new
 
00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:00.839 align:start position:0%
amend amendment is the effective date so
 
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:02.920 align:start position:0%
if you look at
 
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
074 it says the uh effective date is 60
 
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
days after passage the original bill was
 
00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:11.079 align:start position:0%
supposed to take effect immediately upon
 
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
passage that's what the new Amendment
 
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:16.120 align:start position:0%
does excuse me
 
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.200 align:start position:0%

00:10:23.069 --> 00:10:23.079 align:start position:0%
the new new version um and sherbo sent
 
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
out copies of 0740 is that right yes I
 
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
did okay uh so I can I can walk you
 
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:30.949 align:start position:0%
did okay uh so I can I can walk you
through

00:10:30.949 --> 00:10:30.959 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
this the original Bill if you recall had
 
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
two sections and the first section said
 
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
that a municipal host that is used to
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
offset the load of municipal or County
 
00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
aggregations pursuant to RSA 53e that's
 
00:10:50.069 --> 00:10:50.079 align:start position:0%
the net metering statute shall be a
 
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:51.880 align:start position:0%
customer of a municipal or County
 
00:10:54.269 --> 00:10:54.279 align:start position:0%
aggregation and not on utility default
 
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
service with compensation for their
 
00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
output made pursuant to RSA 362 2 A9
 
00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:04.360 align:start position:0%
paragraph 2 and the idea of this is that
 
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:08.680 align:start position:0%
when a municipal host is um actually
 
00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
serving a municipal or County
 
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
aggregation it's not going to be on
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
default service and therefore it's it's
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
reducing the load that needs to be
 
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
served by ISO so we're actually this is
 
00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
load reducing that's that's the beauty
 
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
of it the amendment uh oh 740 and its
 
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.710 align:start position:0%
of it the amendment uh oh 740 and its
friend

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
friend
 
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
0764 the same wording is there but it's
 
00:11:40.269 --> 00:11:40.279 align:start position:0%
moved to a different section of the rsas
 
00:11:44.509 --> 00:11:44.519 align:start position:0%
so in the original bill this wording is
 
00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:46.959 align:start position:0%
in RSA
 
00:11:50.829 --> 00:11:50.839 align:start position:0%
362a but it's really about Community
 
00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
power and so the amendment moves it to
 
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
53a as a new paragraph uh 4 A
 
00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
so that's that's the first
 
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
change any
 
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
questions I'm
 
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:13.480 align:start position:0%
sorry oh that I said 53a yeah 53 EA
 
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:17.480 align:start position:0%
so so any question you're Canadian e any
 
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
questions on that and just a reminder
 
00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
this is uh actually presented to us
 
00:12:24.069 --> 00:12:24.079 align:start position:0%
originally by Cliff Belo who is the
 
00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
chair of the community power
 
00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
Coalition yes and uh Mr Belo approves of
 
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
this change so would it be safe to say
 
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
that the essence of this change is to
 
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
move this language out of the statute
 
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
that defines Municipal host and puts it
 
00:12:46.509 --> 00:12:46.519 align:start position:0%
into the statute about Community
 
00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
aggregation that would be a very good
 
00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
way to say it yes okay thank you is
 
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
there one other change that the
 
00:12:56.269 --> 00:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
amendment makes yes there is uh so in
 
00:12:59.470 --> 00:12:59.480 align:start position:0%
the original bill um there was a section
 
00:13:03.389 --> 00:13:03.399 align:start position:0%
two about uh retiring uh generators from
 
00:13:05.949 --> 00:13:05.959 align:start position:0%
the iso New England Market that is gone
 
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
and there's a new section to that really
 
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
is just housekeeping um it changes RSA
 
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
534 paragraph 6 where refers to RSA 53
 
00:13:22.829 --> 00:13:22.839 align:start position:0%
E7 paragraph 2 that's actually the wrong
 
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
paragraph it should be paragraph three
 
00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:27.160 align:start position:0%
and that's that change and this is about
 
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
uh customer data
 
00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
and if you were to look at 53
 
00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
E7 paragraph 2 it's nothing about
 
00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:37.519 align:start position:0%
customer data uh paragraph three is
 
00:13:39.949 --> 00:13:39.959 align:start position:0%
about customer
 
00:13:42.509 --> 00:13:42.519 align:start position:0%
data so it's it's really just
 
00:13:50.509 --> 00:13:50.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
amendment so it's a it's a pretty
 
00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:55.000 align:start position:0%
straightforward amendment I think it
 
00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
substantially improves the bill because
 
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
the previous version of the bill which
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
put this language into the definition of
 
00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:03.990 align:start position:0%
put this language into the definition of
Municipal

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
Municipal
 
00:14:07.749 --> 00:14:07.759 align:start position:0%
host substantially muddied the waters
 
00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
for the application of that statute and
 
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
would have required um some
 
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:18.680 align:start position:0%
administrative uh changes in order to
 
00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:21.160 align:start position:0%
effectively apply the new language but
 
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
by moving it to this statute it makes it
 
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
easy easier to apply it and doesn't
 
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
affect non-aggregation municip host
 
00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
facilities so I think it's a vastly
 
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
superior bill and I think it warrants
 
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
support by the full committee further
 
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
discussion representative muns um I have
 
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:42.680 align:start position:0%
a a question for representative Corman
 
00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:45.880 align:start position:0%
does this address the the issue that uh
 
00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
folks like yourself who are in a
 
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
community aggregated power Arrangement
 
00:14:53.389 --> 00:14:53.399 align:start position:0%
and have solar panels are having with
 
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
you know getting credit for that it
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
certainly doesn't solve the problem I
 
00:15:00.269 --> 00:15:00.279 align:start position:0%
think it takes a baby step toward it by
 
00:15:03.749 --> 00:15:03.759 align:start position:0%
at least getting the uh data part in the
 
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
right place but it's it it alone is not
 
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
solving the
 
00:15:12.269 --> 00:15:12.279 align:start position:0%
problem representative M you have a
 
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
followup quick one so it really is
 
00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:17.240 align:start position:0%
addressing just those
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
Municipal um Power producers yeah that's
 
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
really the thrust of the bill it's not
 
00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
addressing the individual um individuals
 
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
like yourself no okay thank you
 
00:15:31.069 --> 00:15:31.079 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington just a quick
 
00:15:32.629 --> 00:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
comment I think anything we can do to
 
00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:35.800 align:start position:0%
make uh uh aggregation and Community
 
00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
power less confusing that it is because
 
00:15:39.629 --> 00:15:39.639 align:start position:0%
I mean I get a lot of phone calls and
 
00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:41.240 align:start position:0%
emails and people are just totally lost
 
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
is a step in the right direction so I
 
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
think this is a good
 
00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:53.629 --> 00:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
discussion well seeing none I think we
 
00:15:55.389 --> 00:15:55.399 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:15:59.150 --> 00:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
fairly happy with this uh
 
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
amendment to House Bill 1600 when we get
 
00:16:05.949 --> 00:16:05.959 align:start position:0%
the new version 0764 H we will pass that
 
00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:08.120 align:start position:0%
out to everyone and that's the bill we
 
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
will or that's the amendment we will
 
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
take up in our exec session I I have one
 
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:15.240 align:start position:0%
other comment which is um hoping that
 
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
this will maybe go on consent or at
 
00:16:21.309 --> 00:16:21.319 align:start position:0%
least uh have have no need for a floor
 
00:16:23.389 --> 00:16:23.399 align:start position:0%
speech because this is the sort of thing
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
that uh floor speech would be no fun for
 
00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
anyone I agree with
 
00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:33.880 align:start position:0%
that we'll try to make that happen all
 
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
right any further
 
00:16:38.829 --> 00:16:38.839 align:start position:0%
discussion okay let's move on
 
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
then I was just handed moments ago by
 
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
our extremely competent committee
 
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
researcher a amendment to House Bill
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.230 align:start position:0%
 
0763

00:16:59.230 --> 00:16:59.240 align:start position:0%
0763
 
00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
everyone so this amendment was filed by
 
00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.390 align:start position:0%
everyone so this amendment was filed by
representative

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:22.079 align:start position:0%
Harrington and I am a co-sponsor of this
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
amendment we worked with uh numerous
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
parties to come up with what we thought
 
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:35.789 --> 00:17:35.799 align:start position:0%
acceptable language to solve a problem
 
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
that we believe is one
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
of significant importance
 
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
to Energy
 
00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.310 align:start position:0%
to Energy
Efficiency

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
policy so this the
 
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
original language that was passed in
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
House Bill 549 to essentially
 
00:17:59.039 --> 00:18:00.830 align:start position:0%
House Bill 549 to essentially
rescue

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
rescue
 
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
the Energy Efficiency program that was
 
00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:15.149 --> 00:18:15.159 align:start position:0%
scrapped is the section of law under 374
 
00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
D4 that talks about cost Effectiveness
 
00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:25.400 align:start position:0%
and that's the section of law that's
 
00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
being um that this proposed
 
00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:33.320 align:start position:0%
amendment is looking at so what this
 
00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:35.480 align:start position:0%
amendment wants to do is it want to
 
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
wants to give the Public Utilities
 
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
Commission more flexibility to determine
 
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
if cost Effectiveness tests are
 
00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:47.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate to the time in which they're
 
00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.310 align:start position:0%
appropriate to the time in which they're
being

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
applied and are the fairest tests that
 
00:18:57.789 --> 00:18:57.799 align:start position:0%
can be uncovered and used to determine

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:03.750 align:start position:0%

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
now in current statute there are a
 
00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
couple of tests that are used to see if
 
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
um Energy Efficiency programs are
 
00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:19.640 align:start position:0%
costeffective one is called the granite
 
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
state test the other is called the total
 
00:19:23.789 --> 00:19:23.799 align:start position:0%
recource cost
 
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
that those tests will still be
 
00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
used when the commission tries to
 
00:19:39.549 --> 00:19:39.559 align:start position:0%
determine whether Energy Efficiency
 
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
programs are costeffective or
 
00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:45.640 align:start position:0%
not however the amendment goes on to say
 
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
that the commission may consider
 
00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
modifications to the tests and different
 
00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:52.919 align:start position:0%
or additional tests as long as they're
 
00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
developed through an adjudicative
 
00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
process and approved by prior by order
 
00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
prior to the commencements of a trianium
 
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
emerge now it doesn't require the
 
00:20:13.149 --> 00:20:13.159 align:start position:0%
commission to adopt a different test it
 
00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
just says that the commission may
 
00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:18.799 align:start position:0%
consider a different test well why would
 
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
it be important for the commission to be
 
00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:27.789 --> 00:20:27.799 align:start position:0%
that the grant at state test was
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
developed through an adjudicative
 
00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
process is a pretty sturdy and Hardy
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
test that a lot of folks think works
 
00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:38.039 align:start position:0%
very very
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
well and that's why the statute doesn't
 
00:20:46.669 --> 00:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
require that it be abandoned or modified
 
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
way and that's important
 
00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:57.400 align:start position:0%
because in a letter that the consumer
 
00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
advocate wrote to this committee as his
 
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.390 align:start position:0%
advocate wrote to this committee as his
written

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
written
 
00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
testimony with regard to this the
 
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
original version of this bill he
 
00:21:11.909 --> 00:21:11.919 align:start position:0%
stated and I quote if you like rate
 
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
payer Energy Efficiency you favor a low
 
00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
discount rate which is one of the inputs
 
00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
to the granite state
 
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
test and if you think rate payer energy
 
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
rate pair funded Energy Efficiency is
 
00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
bad public policy you prefer a high
 
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:37.640 align:start position:0%
what that quote says to me is
 
00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
that the granite state test is
 
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
manipulable depending on how
 
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:53.320 align:start position:0%
inputs now do we want to put into public
 
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
policy a tool that allows people to
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
manipulate the
 
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
outcome of something as important as a
 
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
cost benefit
 
00:22:05.269 --> 00:22:05.279 align:start position:0%
test I would argue that we do not what
 
00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
we want to put into
 
00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
statute is a process that the commission
 
00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:13.240 align:start position:0%
can use
 
00:22:16.269 --> 00:22:16.279 align:start position:0%
to determine cost
 
00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness in as objective and
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
neutral a manner as is
 
00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
possible not via some test that could be
 
00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.909 align:start position:0%
possible not via some test that could be
manipulable

00:22:28.909 --> 00:22:28.919 align:start position:0%
manipulable
 
00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
manipulable based
 
00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:33.320 align:start position:0%
on how
 
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
test now I know that some people
 
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
are kind
 
00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
of in a mord of regulators as experts
 
00:22:51.549 --> 00:22:51.559 align:start position:0%
and the only people who should
 
00:22:54.029 --> 00:22:54.039 align:start position:0%
have the authority and the
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility for determining what's
 
00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.590 align:start position:0%
responsibility for determining what's
important

00:22:59.590 --> 00:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:23:03.029 --> 00:23:03.039 align:start position:0%
in terms of Regulation but I believe
 
00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
that policy makers need to set out the
 
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:15.789 --> 00:23:15.799 align:start position:0%
do I was particularly struck recently by
 
00:23:15.799 --> 00:23:16.510 align:start position:0%
do I was particularly struck recently by
a

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:16.520 align:start position:0%

really Salient
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
quote and I will quote her directly
 
00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
executive branch agencies lack this type
 
00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
of representation she was referring to
 
00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:01.720 align:start position:0%
to the kind of representation that you
 
00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:05.320 align:start position:0%
get in Congress agencies are staffed by
 
00:24:08.029 --> 00:24:08.039 align:start position:0%
subject matter quote unquote experts and
 
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
bureaucrats drawn from a narrow
 
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
knowledge class siloed in their areas of
 
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
expertise agency staff often act as
 
00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
policy partisans they simply do not
 
00:24:21.549 --> 00:24:21.559 align:start position:0%
represent the diversity of interests
 
00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
across American society and they are
 
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
institutionally not well suited to
 
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
recognize the broader economic and
 
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
policy I believe she's
 
00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:42.200 align:start position:0%
right therefore it's up to us as policy
 
00:24:45.789 --> 00:24:45.799 align:start position:0%
makers to produce a framework for
 
00:24:45.799 --> 00:24:48.190 align:start position:0%
makers to produce a framework for
implementing

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:48.200 align:start position:0%
implementing
 
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
regulation that is as objective and
 
00:24:56.029 --> 00:24:56.039 align:start position:0%
neutral as possible and that's why I
 
00:24:59.870 --> 00:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
think this amendment is absolutely
 
00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
necessary to give the Public Utilities
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
to move forward with its deliberations
 
00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
in a neutral manner to test the cost
 
00:25:19.149 --> 00:25:19.159 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of Energy Efficiency
 
00:25:21.549 --> 00:25:21.559 align:start position:0%
programs so I'm in favor of this
 
00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
amendment as you can no doubt uh
 
00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:28.360 align:start position:0%
guess and uh I'll look forward hearing
 
00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
comments from the rest of the committee
 
00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
amendment representative
 
00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr chairman um I
 
00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:41.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely agree with the intention of
 
00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
um of the amendment and I think that the
 
00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
idea that we should be looking out for
 
00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:49.720 align:start position:0%
the rate payers money and making sure
 
00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:53.080 align:start position:0%
that our programs are coste effective um
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
is is an important goal and also to to
 
00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
establish objective criteria in the
 
00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
meeting of that goal again we are in
 
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
agreement what I did in preparation for
 
00:26:09.549 --> 00:26:09.559 align:start position:0%
review of this
 
00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
amendment is I went back and read the
 
00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:14.549 align:start position:0%
amendment is I went back and read the
order

00:26:14.549 --> 00:26:14.559 align:start position:0%
order
 
00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
26908 that was referred to in our
 
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
hearing on this bill by
 
00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
Doe and it's about a 27 page Amendment
 
00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:25.960 align:start position:0%
it's on the last triennial plan it has a
 
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
um a dissenting opinion at the end of it
 
00:26:33.549 --> 00:26:33.559 align:start position:0%
and it has um it has a lot of uh
 
00:26:37.549 --> 00:26:37.559 align:start position:0%
language in it about concern for various
 
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
types of financial instruments that
 
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
could be used um various ways that we
 
00:26:44.389 --> 00:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
could carve up the people who are the
 
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries of Energy
 
00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
Efficiency um there's just a lot of
 
00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:53.039 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of stuff in that order um
 
00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
but but what it seems to be is
 
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
um is a bit uh subjective rather than
 
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
objective in terms
 
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
of the what the order was intended to do
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
which was Advance the the plan that was
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
being put in front of the Public
 
00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:12.750 align:start position:0%
being put in front of the Public
Utilities

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
Utilities
 
00:27:15.149 --> 00:27:15.159 align:start position:0%
Commission um
 
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:19.480 align:start position:0%
so I looked back at HB 549 the language
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
there the intent there um and it was
 
00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
very specific in terms of asking the
 
00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
public utilities commission to not be
 
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
overturning the will of the legislature
 
00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:34.520 align:start position:0%
that had been provided uh on
 
00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:37.000 align:start position:0%
making uh The Joint
 
00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:40.120 align:start position:0%
utilities provide these types of
 
00:27:42.269 --> 00:27:42.279 align:start position:0%
programs uh through the system benefit
 
00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
charge so the last place that I landed
 
00:27:48.149 --> 00:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
in trying to just provide context around
 
00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:50.840 align:start position:0%
whether this change is a good change was
 
00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:53.480 align:start position:0%
I went back to look at
 
00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
374f colon 3 and what I realized
 
00:28:01.789 --> 00:28:01.799 align:start position:0%
realized was that the cost Effectiveness
 
00:28:06.029 --> 00:28:06.039 align:start position:0%
section um mentions evaluation
 
00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
measurement and valuation studies but if
 
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:13.919 align:start position:0%
you go to section five it says the joint
 
00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
utilities shall present a joint Energy
 
00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:18.760 align:start position:0%
Efficiency plan to the commission for
 
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
review and approval no less frequently
 
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:23.080 align:start position:0%
than every 3 years and then it goes on
 
00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:25.720 align:start position:0%
to say up to 5% of the overall program
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
budget shall be expended on evaluation
 
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
measurement and verification studies
 
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
which the department or joint utilities
 
00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:36.440 align:start position:0%
shall contract for as the department
 
00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
deems necessary to assure program funds
 
00:28:41.669 --> 00:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
are optimized to deliver rate paay
 
00:28:44.029 --> 00:28:44.039 align:start position:0%
savings and to secure funds available
 
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
from wholesale energy and ancillary
 
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
Services markets so the mechanism for
 
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
the review has been left also with the
 
00:28:57.389 --> 00:28:57.399 align:start position:0%
Department of energy and with the joint
 
00:28:59.509 --> 00:28:59.519 align:start position:0%
utilities to provide that data to the
 
00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:02.200 align:start position:0%
commission so when the plans are
 
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
presented the cost Effectiveness and the
 
00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:07.240 align:start position:0%
measures that are being used are
 
00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
presented as well and what I see in this
 
00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:14.120 align:start position:0%
amendment is that we are opening the
 
00:29:16.389 --> 00:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
door to try and muddy the waters to use
 
00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:19.720 align:start position:0%
the term you used earlier um in order to
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
bring in perhaps uh
 
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
subjective tests that do not belong in
 
00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:27.880 align:start position:0%
this procedure
 
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
because right now and I did speak with
 
00:29:33.389 --> 00:29:33.399 align:start position:0%
uh one of the joint utilities about this
 
00:29:36.509 --> 00:29:36.519 align:start position:0%
as well and the feedback that I got was
 
00:29:39.389 --> 00:29:39.399 align:start position:0%
that from the utilities perspective they
 
00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
want shity they want to understand how
 
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
the program is supposed to proceed what
 
00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
hurdles they have to meet and what
 
00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
information they have to
 
00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:53.000 align:start position:0%
provide and when the goalposts keep
 
00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
being moved by people who can come up
 
00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
with other Financial tests to throw in
 
00:29:59.590 --> 00:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
into the mix it doesn't really benefit
 
00:30:02.269 --> 00:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
anyone it just creates instability in a
 
00:30:05.389 --> 00:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
program that when we passed HB 549 we
 
00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
said we wanted to be set so that it
 
00:30:11.549 --> 00:30:11.559 align:start position:0%
would not cause the kind of chaos that
 
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
it did uh for the utilities and also for
 
00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
the weatherization businesses in New
 
00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um when the uncertainty is put
 
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
into into the system so I think if we
 
00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:25.480 align:start position:0%
don't have an alternative to provide
 
00:30:27.789 --> 00:30:27.799 align:start position:0%
that we should not open the pandors box
 
00:30:27.799 --> 00:30:28.710 align:start position:0%
that we should not open the pandors box
of

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
saying yeah if you can think of
 
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
something else you can use that or you
 
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
can bring it up and ask people to think
 
00:30:37.389 --> 00:30:37.399 align:start position:0%
about that I I think if it ain't broke
 
00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
don't fix it and I think this is a
 
00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:42.440 align:start position:0%
really good example of that and
 
00:30:45.389 --> 00:30:45.399 align:start position:0%
um and I I think if folks want to read
 
00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
the dissenting opinion on order
 
00:30:51.909 --> 00:30:51.919 align:start position:0%
2698 uh that pretty much mirrors my
 
00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
opinion is that the I hope that the
 
00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission as
 
00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
Regulators would try and maintain some
 
00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
consistency for the policies that the
 
00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:01.720 align:start position:0%
legislature has
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
provided and and uh that this kind of a
 
00:31:08.629 --> 00:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
fly in the ointment which is how I see
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
it would not be entered into lightly uh
 
00:31:15.149 --> 00:31:15.159 align:start position:0%
since there's been so much uh effort put
 
00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
into trying to create a process that
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
everybody understands
 
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
so that's that's what I
 
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:30.909 align:start position:0%
 
excuse

00:31:30.909 --> 00:31:30.919 align:start position:0%
excuse
 
00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:35.320 align:start position:0%
me I would argue that um having read
 
00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
26908 myself that the two or three two
 
00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:42.559 align:start position:0%
out of the three Commissioners did
 
00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
identify what they thought was something
 
00:31:47.509 --> 00:31:47.519 align:start position:0%
that was broken that needed to be fixed
 
00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
any further discussion representative
 
00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
muns representative Harrington
 
00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:56.360 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you Mr chairman um I guess
 
00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
I'm a little convinced be fuddled by
 
00:31:59.669 --> 00:31:59.679 align:start position:0%
some of the discussion here because it
 
00:32:02.269 --> 00:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
sounds as if we have some obligation to
 
00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
the utilities and the weatherization
 
00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
companies to provide them a nice even
 
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
plan that they don't have to worry about
 
00:32:11.549 --> 00:32:11.559 align:start position:0%
when they're getting subsidized by rate
 
00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
payer money let's not forget all this
 
00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:15.880 align:start position:0%
money comes from the rate payers they
 
00:32:17.549 --> 00:32:17.559 align:start position:0%
pay it whether they want to or not
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
whether they can take advantage of it or
 
00:32:21.269 --> 00:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
not maybe they're living in an apartment
 
00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
and they can't they can't enjoy the joys
 
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
of Energy Efficiency or weatherization
 
00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
CU it just isn't practical but they pay
 
00:32:30.629 --> 00:32:30.639 align:start position:0%
for it anyways the weatherization
 
00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:32.360 align:start position:0%
companies and utilities ought to be
 
00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:33.880 align:start position:0%
lucky that they're getting this they
 
00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
both make money off of this program and
 
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
all this simply does is say we're going
 
00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
to give you shity through 2026 so for
 
00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
the next couple of years three years you
 
00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
can turn around and you don't have to
 
00:32:47.549 --> 00:32:47.559 align:start position:0%
make any changes and if it's determined
 
00:32:49.629 --> 00:32:49.639 align:start position:0%
by the Pu in the future that maybe
 
00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
there's a more more effective way or
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
more accurate way of measuring the
 
00:32:57.149 --> 00:32:57.159 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency programs uh to put
 
00:32:59.909 --> 00:32:59.919 align:start position:0%
them up against whatever new information
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
may be available that the Pu can
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
consider this but if they're going to do
 
00:33:05.909 --> 00:33:05.919 align:start position:0%
it they have to go through a full
 
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
adjudicative process and announce those
 
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
changes 12 months before they come into
 
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
effect which gives more than enough time
 
00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:14.440 align:start position:0%
for the weatherization companies and the
 
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
utilities to make modifications to their
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
program again the rate payers are under
 
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
no obligation to make life easy as
 
00:33:23.789 --> 00:33:23.799 align:start position:0%
possible for those two groups the thing
 
00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:25.720 align:start position:0%
that should be counting here is what is
 
00:33:28.029 --> 00:33:28.039 align:start position:0%
the most effective in Accurate Way of
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
measuring Energy Efficiency and that we
 
00:33:32.509 --> 00:33:32.519 align:start position:0%
want to give them the flexibility if
 
00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
there is a more accurate way to do that
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
and this would only be done full the F
 
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
full judicative process where all these
 
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
various players and actors could come in
 
00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:43.720 align:start position:0%
and have their day in front of the Pu
 
00:33:45.509 --> 00:33:45.519 align:start position:0%
and state why they should change or why
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't but I just think giving
 
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
them flexibility is just common
 
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
sense representative Ms thank you Mr
 
00:33:57.669 --> 00:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
chair um I I am befuddled as well
 
00:34:03.269 --> 00:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
um on on the one hand I I'm hearing that
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
um we should leave it to the legislature
 
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
to set
 
00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:12.520 align:start position:0%
policy and um I believe this legislature
 
00:34:17.109 --> 00:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
did that when they passed HB 549 and
 
00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
expressed the um the will of the
 
00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:23.399 align:start position:0%
legislature that the particular tests
 
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
that are currently in statute should be
 
00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:31.599 align:start position:0%
used um um yet I'm hearing um that we
 
00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:35.240 align:start position:0%
want to pass this amendment to give the
 
00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
executive branch
 
00:34:41.589 --> 00:34:41.599 align:start position:0%
flexibility um which you know goes
 
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
counter to the argument that the
 
00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
legislature should be the one setting
 
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
policy so it it seems like we want to
 
00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
have both sides and I'm uh I'm
 
00:34:55.470 --> 00:34:55.480 align:start position:0%
confused I'd like to clear up your
 
00:34:58.990 --> 00:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
confusion all this legislation says is
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
that the people who are responsible for
 
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
determining whether cost Effectiveness

the coste effectiveness St um standard
 
00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:11.720 align:start position:0%
is met need to have the flexibility to
 
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
consider all the possible tests that
 
00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
could be used to find one that's the
 
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
most accurate now it may be the ones
 
00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
that have already been identified but
 
00:35:25.109 --> 00:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
should we prude them from looking at
 
00:35:27.589 --> 00:35:27.599 align:start position:0%
others that's all the amendment says
 
00:35:27.599 --> 00:35:29.230 align:start position:0%
others that's all the amendment says
representative

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:29.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:33.599 align:start position:0%
Ms yet in the quote that you read you
 
00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:35.720 align:start position:0%
you you highlighted the fact that we
 
00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
should not um
 
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:42.040 align:start position:0%
trust subject matter experts in the
 
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
executive branch to make those
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
decisions no that's not what the quote
 
00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
said the quote said
 
00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
that those subject matter experts are no
 
00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
different from the rest of us and they
 
00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
can occasionally Ally be partisan but if
 
00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:01.400 align:start position:0%
you set up policy in such a way to be as
 
00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
objective as possible you can amarate
 
00:36:06.309 --> 00:36:06.319 align:start position:0%
the partisan differences that we all
 
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
have we live in a pluralistic society we
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
have to accommodate the differing views
 
00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:15.880 align:start position:0%
of everyone to the degree that we can
 
00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:18.079 align:start position:0%
and the way we do that is by setting up
 
00:36:18.079 --> 00:36:19.069 align:start position:0%
and the way we do that is by setting up
good

00:36:19.069 --> 00:36:19.079 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:36:19.079 --> 00:36:21.069 align:start position:0%
good
sound

00:36:21.069 --> 00:36:21.079 align:start position:0%
sound
 
00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
policy that eliminates as much as
 
00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
possible the objectiveness of
 
00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:30.200 align:start position:0%
partisanship subjectiveness of a
 
00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:33.800 align:start position:0%
partisanship representative
 
00:36:37.069 --> 00:36:37.079 align:start position:0%
Ms but but isn't that what happened when
 
00:36:41.069 --> 00:36:41.079 align:start position:0%
HB 549 was passed the Executive Branch
 
00:36:43.829 --> 00:36:43.839 align:start position:0%
the Pu took an action that the
 
00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
legislature disagreed with so the
 
00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
legislature exercising its legislative
 
00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
power and Duty decided that that was not
 
00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:53.560 align:start position:0%
the direction that the legislature
 
00:36:56.069 --> 00:36:56.079 align:start position:0%
wanted the executive branch to go and
 
00:36:59.309 --> 00:36:59.319 align:start position:0%
therefore the they passed HB 549 which
 
00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
specified what the test should be
 
00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
overriding the
 
00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
Pu I don't think they overrode the Pu
 
00:37:10.309 --> 00:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
with regard to the tests the tests were
 
00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
already being
 
00:37:15.349 --> 00:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
used what HB 549 did was restore the
 
00:37:19.069 --> 00:37:19.079 align:start position:0%
entire program and what this bill does
 
00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:22.040 align:start position:0%
is it modifies the existing restored
 
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
program to make it more flexible and to
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
make it potentially less partisan and
 
00:37:27.839 --> 00:37:29.589 align:start position:0%
make it potentially less partisan and
more

00:37:29.589 --> 00:37:29.599 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:33.880 align:start position:0%
objective representative rolds had a
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
comment thank you Mr chairman um I guess
 
00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:41.960 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not going to comment directly on
 
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
um on the bill um except that I'm I'm
 
00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
wanting to respond to my colleague
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington's uh
 
00:37:56.309 --> 00:37:56.319 align:start position:0%
characterization of um the systems
 
00:37:58.270 --> 00:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
benefit benefits charge and the Energy
 
00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
Efficiency programs as
 
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
subsidies and some sort of giveaways to
 
00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:05.829 align:start position:0%
subsidies and some sort of giveaways to
you

00:38:05.829 --> 00:38:05.839 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
know weatherization companies um that's
 
00:38:13.309 --> 00:38:13.319 align:start position:0%
not what the systems benefits charge is
 
00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
that's not what Energy Efficiency
 
00:38:16.349 --> 00:38:16.359 align:start position:0%
programs are
 
00:38:16.359 --> 00:38:18.069 align:start position:0%
programs are
about

00:38:18.069 --> 00:38:18.079 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:22.280 align:start position:0%
uh the systems benefits charge and
 
00:38:24.109 --> 00:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency programs like New
 
00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:27.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saves are similar to to
 
00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:30.520 align:start position:0%
programs that over half well over half
 
00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
of the states in this country have there
 
00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
a recognition that Energy Efficiency as
 
00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
a resource is uh different from a supply
 
00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:42.750 align:start position:0%
a resource is uh different from a supply
side

00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
side
 
00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
resource uh no one can build an a large
 
00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency
 
00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
plant uh Energy Efficiency must be
 
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
procured in very small amounts from
 
00:38:57.390 --> 00:38:57.400 align:start position:0%
Individual homes and businesses and
 
00:38:59.910 --> 00:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
government-owned buildings uh every
 
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
place where energy is used and systems
 
00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
benefits charges and the programs that
 
00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:09.400 align:start position:0%
they support
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
represent uh limited but
 
00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:16.200 align:start position:0%
strategic uh Collective investment in
 
00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:18.680 align:start position:0%
the resource of Energy
 
00:39:22.109 --> 00:39:22.119 align:start position:0%
Efficiency and uh you know there's 30
 
00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
plus years of um you know scholar ship
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
and Analysis uh again across the country
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
in which New Hampshire and our state's
 
00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:33.800 align:start position:0%
utilities have
 
00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:36.440 align:start position:0%
participated um everyone wants to make
 
00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:39.720 align:start position:0%
sure that the Strategic Investments made
 
00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
with the assistance benefit charge are
 
00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
coste effective uh and you know that's
 
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
where things like the granite state test
 
00:39:53.309 --> 00:39:53.319 align:start position:0%
come from and um you know I agree with
 
00:39:55.069 --> 00:39:55.079 align:start position:0%
the colleague the comments of my
 
00:39:57.109 --> 00:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
colleague representative m when he
 
00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
points out that the back and forth that
 
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
came from the pu's order you know
 
00:40:05.349 --> 00:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
gutting New Hampshire saves a few years
 
00:40:07.109 --> 00:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
ago resulted in the in the the
 
00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
legislature's response in HB
 
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
549 um and you know I don't see the need
 
00:40:16.589 --> 00:40:16.599 align:start position:0%
for the legislature to continue to
 
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
Tinker with
 
00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
um with the pu's
 
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
operation uh of of these programs uh the
 
00:40:29.069 --> 00:40:29.079 align:start position:0%
granite state test we've all said in
 
00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:31.240 align:start position:0%
here arrived at
 
00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
through much public input uh much
 
00:40:38.309 --> 00:40:38.319 align:start position:0%
scholarship and Analysis behind it and
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
um it works and we should leave it
 
00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:44.079 align:start position:0%
alone further discussion representative
 
00:40:47.309 --> 00:40:47.319 align:start position:0%
Vice chair Thomas thank you Mr chair um
 
00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
I have listened to both sides here and
 
00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
to be honest I think there were good
 
00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:55.480 align:start position:0%
arguments made on both sides what I what
 
00:40:59.390 --> 00:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
I hear and interpret is that if you if
 
00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:03.400 align:start position:0%
you believe that the legislature is
 
00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
infallible and that you have a Ironclad
 
00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:09.880 align:start position:0%
system that you never ever want changed
 
00:41:12.349 --> 00:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
because it's perfect and you don't want
 
00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:15.160 align:start position:0%
any outside influence in it then you
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
would probably not support this
 
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
amendment however if you feel that um
 
00:41:24.829 --> 00:41:24.839 align:start position:0%
the legislature and at times that may be
 
00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:26.440 align:start position:0%
correct sometimes the legislature does
 
00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
want to say to people this is the way we
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
want it we want no change and we want no
 
00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:32.440 align:start position:0%
no deviation because that's what we want
 
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
but sometimes we may feel that there's
 
00:41:37.589 --> 00:41:37.599 align:start position:0%
something out there where okay it's good
 
00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:39.800 align:start position:0%
now but maybe there's something better
 
00:41:42.109 --> 00:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
out there maybe we have people that come
 
00:41:44.829 --> 00:41:44.839 align:start position:0%
on board later on that either find a new
 
00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
way or maybe parameters change and maybe
 
00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
the legislature may want to give a
 
00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
little bit of flexibility for a chance
 
00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
to make changes faster than it would be
 
00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:55.960 align:start position:0%
under a legislative process for
 
00:41:57.069 --> 00:41:57.079 align:start position:0%
something something that affects rate
 
00:41:59.950 --> 00:41:59.960 align:start position:0%
payers I think if you believe that in
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
this case legislature um is thinking
 
00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:05.480 align:start position:0%
ahead that there might be something new
 
00:42:08.349 --> 00:42:08.359 align:start position:0%
in the future that uh uh uh that there
 
00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
might be some Innovative uh processes
 
00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:12.440 align:start position:0%
out there that would be styed if we
 
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
didn't pass the amendment and maybe then
 
00:42:17.069 --> 00:42:17.079 align:start position:0%
you would support this amendment to give
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
that that type of uh of leeway I believe
 
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
in this case I would support this
 
00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
amendment because of I would like to
 
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
give the I would like to leave the door
 
00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
open for potential innovation in in the
 
00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:31.400 align:start position:0%
future to allow people to adjust on the
 
00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:33.640 align:start position:0%
fly to certain issues and I think this
 
00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
is one case where I think it could help
 
00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:37.640 align:start position:0%
out rate payers so that's why I would
 
00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:39.160 align:start position:0%
support this
 
00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:42.440 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you further
 
00:42:45.069 --> 00:42:45.079 align:start position:0%
discussion representative McGee thank
 
00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um i' I'd like to do a
 
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
couple of things um first of all I
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
think based on reading the order it it
 
00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
appears that the question comes up for
 
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
needing a fix from concerns around
 
00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
whether the valuation of the you know
 
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
the cost benefit analysis is is adequate
 
00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
and um it's a it's a one now and the
 
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
question had been brought up in pu
 
00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:18.760 align:start position:0%
hearings well what about if it was a two
 
00:43:20.549 --> 00:43:20.559 align:start position:0%
you know so that kind of thing it's like
 
00:43:22.589 --> 00:43:22.599 align:start position:0%
yes well that would be that would be
 
00:43:25.549 --> 00:43:25.559 align:start position:0%
double the cost benefit in terms of the
 
00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
the raw number MERS but when I talked
 
00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
with triennial planners for the
 
00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
utilities about their perception of how
 
00:43:35.589 --> 00:43:35.599 align:start position:0%
these discussions are going at the
 
00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:37.400 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission their
 
00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
perception is not that those kinds of
 
00:43:42.829 --> 00:43:42.839 align:start position:0%
posings are helpful and what they
 
00:43:47.069 --> 00:43:47.079 align:start position:0%
basically said to me is uh if you say
 
00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:49.880 align:start position:0%
well 70% of the benefit is going to 20%
 
00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
of the rate payers that is exactly what
 
00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency programs are designed
 
00:43:57.630 --> 00:43:57.640 align:start position:0%
to do is is they're designed to provide
 
00:44:00.069 --> 00:44:00.079 align:start position:0%
money to the people who are eligible and
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
capable of doing energy projects when
 
00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
they can do them in order to provide the
 
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire with a demand
 
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
side lever that allows us to stop
 
00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:13.079 align:start position:0%
digging the hole of needing more and
 
00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
more uh outside energy being brought
 
00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
into the state right so if we want
 
00:44:19.549 --> 00:44:19.559 align:start position:0%
energy Independence and we throw around
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
Concepts that we all sort of agree on
 
00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:25.720 align:start position:0%
how do we get there Energy Efficiency is
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
abs absolutely the best tool and we have
 
00:44:30.069 --> 00:44:30.079 align:start position:0%
heard you know we've heard testimony
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
after testimony from people who really
 
00:44:34.549 --> 00:44:34.559 align:start position:0%
know that this is how you make a dent
 
00:44:36.829 --> 00:44:36.839 align:start position:0%
and so what we did is we said here's a
 
00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
program here are the parameters around
 
00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:40.280 align:start position:0%
the program this is what we want you to
 
00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:42.440 align:start position:0%
do we want you to invest like this we
 
00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
want you to approve or deny a plan based
 
00:44:48.589 --> 00:44:48.599 align:start position:0%
on changes to the plan and we want the
 
00:44:50.309 --> 00:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
joint utilities and the department of
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
energy to work together to make sure the
 
00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:55.240 align:start position:0%
thing that I read to you earlier right
 
00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
that there is evaluation measurement and
 
00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:01.160 align:start position:0%
verification studies provided to show
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
that we are delivering rate payer
 
00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
savings that is already in the law that
 
00:45:07.309 --> 00:45:07.319 align:start position:0%
is in section five which is subsequent
 
00:45:10.109 --> 00:45:10.119 align:start position:0%
plan and update filings when you put
 
00:45:12.549 --> 00:45:12.559 align:start position:0%
this in section 4 just because it
 
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
relates to cost Effectiveness it
 
00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
contradicts the rest of the law it also
 
00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
confuses the people who are actually
 
00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
doing the work so it isn't an advantage
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
by saying you can now
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
bring you can bring variables into the
 
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
system that have not been vetted just to
 
00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
say hey if you feel like you want
 
00:45:35.069 --> 00:45:35.079 align:start position:0%
something you'll be able to throw things
 
00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:37.160 align:start position:0%
up in the air that is that is not what
 
00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
we've been working towards as a
 
00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
legislature and so um I again would I
 
00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
see chairman you've got the piece I
 
00:45:47.829 --> 00:45:47.839 align:start position:0%
handed down to you I just made a couple
 
00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:50.200 align:start position:0%
of copies of that section because I was
 
00:45:52.109 --> 00:45:52.119 align:start position:0%
surprised when I started reading more to
 
00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
realize that we already have a cost
 
00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:55.720 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness test we already have a way
 
00:45:58.589 --> 00:45:58.599 align:start position:0%
of reviewing and in any one of these
 
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
proceedings these things can be broached
 
00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
if there's a decision that inputs need
 
00:46:05.589 --> 00:46:05.599 align:start position:0%
to change those discussions can happen
 
00:46:07.309 --> 00:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
in these in these adjudicative
 
00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:09.160 align:start position:0%
proceedings there's nothing prohibiting
 
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
that I think this opens a dangerous door
 
00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
because it is non-conclusive it is
 
00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
non-conclusive it is saying you know if
 
00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
you want to throw a wrench in this you
 
00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:21.880 align:start position:0%
can do that even though we have no idea
 
00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
uh what your objective is and I think
 
00:46:26.829 --> 00:46:26.839 align:start position:0%
that that is taking Us in the opposite
 
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
direction of what we did with 549 and I
 
00:46:31.549 --> 00:46:31.559 align:start position:0%
would I would I would caution against
 
00:46:31.559 --> 00:46:33.430 align:start position:0%
would I would I would caution against
doing

00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
it okay thank you representative McGee
 
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
I'm going to suggest that we need to
 
00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
move on pretty quickly here because we
 
00:46:41.829 --> 00:46:41.839 align:start position:0%
have another bill that we want us
 
00:46:45.309 --> 00:46:45.319 align:start position:0%
discuss and we have to uh cut this short
 
00:46:45.319 --> 00:46:46.150 align:start position:0%
discuss and we have to uh cut this short
about

00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:46:49.309 --> 00:46:49.319 align:start position:0%
11:20 in order to have uh caucuses for
 
00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
both our caucuses so representative
 
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
Bernardi I'll give you the last
 
00:46:57.390 --> 00:46:57.400 align:start position:0%
word thank you Mr chair uh as I look at
 
00:46:59.109 --> 00:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
this amendment it's it's it's very
 
00:47:01.109 --> 00:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
simple it basically says that we're
 
00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:03.400 align:start position:0%
going to continue to use the the current
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
tests that uh that are used to assess
 
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
coste Effectiveness and if in
 
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
adjudicative process is uh it moves
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
forward you can look at other methods as
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
well it doesn't change the ultimate goal
 
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
of of addressing whether we're going to
 
00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:26.430 align:start position:0%
of of addressing whether we're going to
um

00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:29.069 --> 00:47:29.079 align:start position:0%
use the system benefits charge to you
 
00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
know Advance those goals at all it it it
 
00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
just says we're going to have the
 
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity if in an adjudicative
 
00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:41.640 align:start position:0%
process something better or more useful
 
00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
can be teased out we're going to add
 
00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
that to the overall mix I don't see that
 
00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
as a problem I see that as a
 
00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
benefit thank you okay I'm passing out
 
00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
now an amendment to house bill
 
00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.109 align:start position:0%
now an amendment to house bill
1623

00:47:59.109 --> 00:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
1623
 
00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
dfn it is amendment number
 
00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:05.829 align:start position:0%
dfn it is amendment number
20247

00:48:05.829 --> 00:48:05.839 align:start position:0%
20247
 
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
34h which I'm offering or I will be
 
00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
offering on this
 
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.910 align:start position:0%
offering on this
legislation

00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:18.200 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to wait a minute for the
 
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
copies to
 
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
circulate and then I'm going to go
 
00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:25.160 align:start position:0%
through the changes in the build excuse
 
00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:26.870 align:start position:0%
through the changes in the build excuse
me

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:48:29.790 --> 00:48:29.800 align:start position:0%
open close this one open the next well
 
00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
this is just a work session so we we
 
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
move from one to the other seamlessly we
 
00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:43.960 align:start position:0%
them okay so let's go through the
 
00:48:45.309 --> 00:48:45.319 align:start position:0%
changes that are made and there are
 
00:48:47.549 --> 00:48:47.559 align:start position:0%
quite a few of them I I will admit
 
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
changes that were made into in Amendment
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
0734 so the first
 
00:48:58.589 --> 00:48:58.599 align:start position:0%
change is that the word dispatchable has
 
00:48:58.599 --> 00:48:59.589 align:start position:0%
change is that the word dispatchable has
been

00:48:59.589 --> 00:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
removed it seems that dispatchable was a
 
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
word that offended people although I
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
don't know why but um I took it out
 
00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:12.440 align:start position:0%
because affordable reliable and secure
 
00:49:14.109 --> 00:49:14.119 align:start position:0%
energy res
 
00:49:18.549 --> 00:49:18.559 align:start position:0%
resources adequately covers I think um
 
00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
what we need to protect here in the
 
00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:24.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so that's a a change that gets
 
00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
um based on the original filed or as as
 
00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:43.240 align:start position:0%
introduced Bill lines two five 8
 
00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:46.520 align:start position:0%
14 22 etc etc
 
00:49:51.069 --> 00:49:51.079 align:start position:0%
etc so that word is now removed from the
 
00:49:51.079 --> 00:49:54.510 align:start position:0%
etc so that word is now removed from the
statute

00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.030 align:start position:0%
 
altogether

00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
altogether
 
00:49:59.109 --> 00:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
next big change
 
00:49:59.119 --> 00:50:00.670 align:start position:0%
next big change
is

00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:00.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:50:02.789 --> 00:50:02.799 align:start position:0%
um on
 
00:50:02.799 --> 00:50:04.309 align:start position:0%
um on
page

00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:50:09.549 --> 00:50:09.559 align:start position:0%
two of the original Bill lines 16 and 17
 
00:50:13.789 --> 00:50:13.799 align:start position:0%
that text has been entirely stricken
 
00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
from the amendment that text no longer
 
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.870 align:start position:0%
from the amendment that text no longer
uh

00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
appears begin the text begin oh I'm
 
00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
sorry the text uh begin with the
 
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
the um sub paragraph heading of a
 
00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
lowercase G and it says New Hampshire
 
00:50:36.750 --> 00:50:36.760 align:start position:0%
shall promote the use of clean energy
 
00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
sources Etc so that text no longer
 
00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
appears there another major change is
 
00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:51.549 --> 00:50:51.559 align:start position:0%
nine in the
 
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
amendment that would be page two lines 4
 
00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:03.589 --> 00:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
read excuse me New Hampshire shall
 
00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
pursue energy conservation and
 
00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:06.760 align:start position:0%
efficiency according to Market
 
00:51:10.270 --> 00:51:10.280 align:start position:0%
principles and without state government
 
00:51:12.430 --> 00:51:12.440 align:start position:0%
subsidies it now reads New Hampshire
 
00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
shall pursue energy conservation and
 
00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
efficiency according to Market
 
00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:19.000 align:start position:0%
principles and Accord and in accordance
 
00:51:21.829 --> 00:51:21.839 align:start position:0%
with costeffective fiscal strategies as
 
00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
authorized by the
 
00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
legislature which one which once again
 
00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:29.230 align:start position:0%
legislature which one which once again
affirms

00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:29.240 align:start position:0%
affirms
 
00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:30.789 align:start position:0%
affirms
our

00:51:30.789 --> 00:51:30.799 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:51:35.309 --> 00:51:35.319 align:start position:0%
uh Reliance on inicien Energy Efficiency
 
00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
programs that are cost
 
00:51:41.549 --> 00:51:41.559 align:start position:0%
effective the other major changes that
 
00:51:45.349 --> 00:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
the amendment makes are in section two
 
00:51:47.589 --> 00:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
of the bill which starts in the
 
00:51:50.670 --> 00:51:50.680 align:start position:0%
amendment on line 12 of page two in the
 
00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:52.640 align:start position:0%
original bill that
 
00:51:57.270 --> 00:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
was line 18 of page two
 
00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
and this section just adds some
 
00:52:03.069 --> 00:52:03.079 align:start position:0%
clarifying language so for example it
 
00:52:07.349 --> 00:52:07.359 align:start position:0%
adds the phrase inate in front of
 
00:52:09.789 --> 00:52:09.799 align:start position:0%
electricity generator to specify that
 
00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:12.680 align:start position:0%
we're talking about generators that are
 
00:52:14.789 --> 00:52:14.799 align:start position:0%
located here in New Hampshire not
 
00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
somewhere else in the iso New England
 
00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:20.390 align:start position:0%
somewhere else in the iso New England
Regional

00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
Regional
 
00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:25.720 align:start position:0%
grid and the other changes that are made
 
00:52:28.829 --> 00:52:28.839 align:start position:0%
include the addition of the words or
 
00:52:33.109 --> 00:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
decommissioning after retirement and the
 
00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:35.480 align:start position:0%
addition of the word involuntary in
 
00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:37.160 align:start position:0%
front of
 
00:52:39.950 --> 00:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
retirement and then a third big change
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
to this section is the addition of a new
 
00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph C which gives the department
 
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
of energy and the Department of Justice
 
00:52:49.069 --> 00:52:49.079 align:start position:0%
the authority to seek funding from the
 
00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
legislative fiscal
 
00:52:53.470 --> 00:52:53.480 align:start position:0%
Committee in order to conduct any
 
00:52:55.349 --> 00:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
actions that are described in the two
 
00:53:01.109 --> 00:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:04.309 --> 00:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
above and those are the big changes that
 
00:53:07.069 --> 00:53:07.079 align:start position:0%
are made
 
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
to House Bill
 
00:53:15.789 --> 00:53:15.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:15.799 --> 00:53:17.430 align:start position:0%
 
0734

00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
0734
 
00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:21.400 align:start position:0%
and I made those changes in direct
 
00:53:24.309 --> 00:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
response to the public hearing that we
 
00:53:26.309 --> 00:53:26.319 align:start position:0%
had on this bill I listened to
 
00:53:29.549 --> 00:53:29.559 align:start position:0%
everybody's comments on this bill and
 
00:53:31.349 --> 00:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
made changes that I
 
00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:33.880 align:start position:0%
thought would best satisfy the
 
00:53:35.829 --> 00:53:35.839 align:start position:0%
objections that were made including
 
00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:37.880 align:start position:0%
those by the department of
 
00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
energy I think I've accommodated all
 
00:53:42.789 --> 00:53:42.799 align:start position:0%
those changes in this
 
00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
amendment now I still think it's
 
00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
important to give the state of New
 
00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:50.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:53.470 --> 00:53:53.480 align:start position:0%
tools to
 
00:53:55.789 --> 00:53:55.799 align:start position:0%
protect the health and saf safety of our
 
00:53:58.829 --> 00:53:58.839 align:start position:0%
citizens by protecting our energy
 
00:54:02.190 --> 00:54:02.200 align:start position:0%
Supply and there are outside
 
00:54:06.430 --> 00:54:06.440 align:start position:0%
forces that could negatively affect our
 
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
instate energy Supply and we need a tool
 
00:54:12.109 --> 00:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
to be able
 
00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:14.920 align:start position:0%
to protect ourselves and address those
 
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
issues in court if necessary so that's
 
00:54:21.950 --> 00:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
the main purpose for filing this
 
00:54:24.069 --> 00:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
bill for example the state of
 
00:54:24.079 --> 00:54:25.630 align:start position:0%
bill for example the state of
Massachusetts

00:54:25.630 --> 00:54:25.640 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
00:54:28.030 --> 00:54:28.040 align:start position:0%
has recently
 
00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:30.490 align:start position:0%
adopted official policies
 
00:54:30.490 --> 00:54:31.589 align:start position:0%
adopted official policies
[Music]

00:54:31.589 --> 00:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:35.640 align:start position:0%
to whenever possible prevent the
 
00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:39.160 align:start position:0%
adoption of the use of natural gas
 
00:54:42.990 --> 00:54:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:46.109 --> 00:54:46.119 align:start position:0%
state if they continue to harm the
 
00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
Marketplace the the utilities and the
 
00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:55.720 align:start position:0%
vendors of natural gas may find
 
00:54:57.589 --> 00:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
themselves in a position of being no no
 
00:55:00.309 --> 00:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
longer financially
 
00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
viable and if they go under what happens
 
00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:06.079 align:start position:0%
to the pipelines that bring natural gas
 
00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
to New
 
00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's a question that I think
 
00:55:12.270 --> 00:55:12.280 align:start position:0%
we all should
 
00:55:15.390 --> 00:55:15.400 align:start position:0%
contemplate and it's a question that I
 
00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:17.640 align:start position:0%
think the answer
 
00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
to might give us cause to think that
 
00:55:22.750 --> 00:55:22.760 align:start position:0%
this bill might be useful at some point
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.309 align:start position:0%
in the
future

00:55:27.309 --> 00:55:27.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
so having said that I'd like to hear the
 
00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
reaction of the rest of the committee
 
00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
and we'll have further discussions about
 
00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
this uh this morning and this afternoon
 
00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:40.870 align:start position:0%
this uh this morning and this afternoon
representative

00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:43.029 --> 00:55:43.039 align:start position:0%
Kennedy thank you Mr
 
00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:45.640 align:start position:0%
chairman uh what I recalled from the
 
00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:47.480 align:start position:0%
public hearing was there's there was
 
00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:50.720 align:start position:0%
some intimation that this bill would
 
00:55:52.950 --> 00:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
somehow favor fossil
 
00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
fuels um so so I I asked Mr
 
00:55:59.870 --> 00:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
Roberge if the department of energy
 
00:56:04.029 --> 00:56:04.039 align:start position:0%
promoted wind and solar answer
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
yes the next question was can you tell
 
00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
me what the cumulative cost of promoting
 
00:56:13.150 --> 00:56:13.160 align:start position:0%
wind and solar has been and he said he
 
00:56:15.549 --> 00:56:15.559 align:start position:0%
could get that information for
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
me and he sent a letter an email to
 
00:56:20.990 --> 00:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
myself and the rest of the
 
00:56:25.630 --> 00:56:25.640 align:start position:0%
committee and the the total cost is 5
 
00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:27.829 align:start position:0%
committee and the the total cost is 5
50.5

00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:27.839 align:start position:0%
50.5
 
00:56:31.589 --> 00:56:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
2008 a couple days later I I just
 
00:56:36.990 --> 00:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
happened to be reading uh representative
 
00:56:41.150 --> 00:56:41.160 align:start position:0%
uh ammon's report on nuclear
 
00:56:43.710 --> 00:56:43.720 align:start position:0%
power and there was a table in the
 
00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:48.640 align:start position:0%
report from the US Energy Information
 
00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
Administration and it had uh a listing
 
00:56:55.829 --> 00:56:55.839 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire's energy generation mix
 
00:56:55.839 --> 00:56:56.750 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire's energy generation mix
in

00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:56:59.549 --> 00:56:59.559 align:start position:0%
2022 along with ISO New
 
00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
England so I won't read everything but
 
00:57:05.349 --> 00:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
but a couple things in this table U I
 
00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
think are
 
00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
notable one nuclear generated 10,900
 
00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
gwatt hours of electricity which was
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
58% of New Hampshire's
 
00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
total natural gas 4,500 gaw which was
 
00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
24% of new captures
 
00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:31.240 align:start position:0%
total wind generated 482 gwatt hours
 
00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:34.760 align:start position:0%
which is 3% of New Hampshire's
 
00:57:38.829 --> 00:57:38.839 align:start position:0%
total solar generated 4 gwatt hours
 
00:57:43.349 --> 00:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:47.069 --> 00:57:47.079 align:start position:0%
0.02% uh that was rounded to zero in the
 
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
table for ISO New England uh wind
 
00:57:57.230 --> 00:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
generated 4,000 gwatt hours 4% and solar
 
00:58:00.109 --> 00:58:00.119 align:start position:0%
3,300 gaw which is
 
00:58:02.549 --> 00:58:02.559 align:start position:0%
3% and and the only reason I bring this
 
00:58:05.109 --> 00:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
up is you know maybe everyone's already
 
00:58:07.710 --> 00:58:07.720 align:start position:0%
aware of this or maybe not but you know
 
00:58:09.349 --> 00:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
I want to keep things real you know
 
00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:11.640 align:start position:0%
where are we really with this how much
 
00:58:14.789 --> 00:58:14.799 align:start position:0%
money have we spent trying to get more
 
00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
wind and solar onto the grid and what's
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:23.720 align:start position:0%
result further discussion representative
 
00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah I have a a question on
 
00:58:30.029 --> 00:58:30.039 align:start position:0%
the um section two loss of instate
 
00:58:33.549 --> 00:58:33.559 align:start position:0%
electrical generation when it uh refers
 
00:58:33.559 --> 00:58:35.109 align:start position:0%
electrical generation when it uh refers
to

00:58:35.109 --> 00:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:58:37.829 --> 00:58:37.839 align:start position:0%
um generator receives notice of an
 
00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
external regulatory action that may
 
00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
result in involuntary retirement or
 
00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
decommissioning um what exactly are we
 
00:58:47.789 --> 00:58:47.799 align:start position:0%
going to define inv voluntary ASM let me
 
00:58:50.430 --> 00:58:50.440 align:start position:0%
give you an example
 
00:58:54.270 --> 00:58:54.280 align:start position:0%
um uh the EPA passes a new regulation
 
00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
Congress passes a new law that says you
 
00:58:59.670 --> 00:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
will limit your uh emissions to a
 
00:59:02.270 --> 00:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
certain amount and a gas plant in New
 
00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:05.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire looks and says if we have to
 
00:59:07.789 --> 00:59:07.799 align:start position:0%
put that type of equipment on to do that
 
00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
we are not going to be economically
 
00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
competitive so we're not being forced to
 
00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
retire we could go out and buy that
 
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
equipment and put it on there but in our
 
00:59:17.349 --> 00:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
opinion it wouldn't be worth the
 
00:59:20.069 --> 00:59:20.079 align:start position:0%
investment so we're going to voluntarily
 
00:59:22.510 --> 00:59:22.520 align:start position:0%
retire how does that fit in with this
 
00:59:24.870 --> 00:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
involuntary retirement because most to
 
00:59:26.589 --> 00:59:26.599 align:start position:0%
these things it's not the federal
 
00:59:27.789 --> 00:59:27.799 align:start position:0%
government which I assume who you're
 
00:59:30.109 --> 00:59:30.119 align:start position:0%
referring to in most cases saying You
 
00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
must shut down that plant but saying
 
00:59:34.589 --> 00:59:34.599 align:start position:0%
that if you want to keep operating
 
00:59:36.190 --> 00:59:36.200 align:start position:0%
here's the conditions you have to uh
 
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
live up
 
00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
to it's a good question so that's the
 
00:59:42.270 --> 00:59:42.280 align:start position:0%
reason I put
 
00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
involuntary into the language of the
 
00:59:49.109 --> 00:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
amendment obviously if it's a voluntary
 
00:59:52.549 --> 00:59:52.559 align:start position:0%
retirement then they would never notify
 
00:59:54.670 --> 00:59:54.680 align:start position:0%
the department of energy and the
 
00:59:56.069 --> 00:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
Department would never open an
 
00:59:56.079 --> 00:59:57.589 align:start position:0%
Department would never open an
investigatory

00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
investigatory
 
01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
docket only if the retirement is
 
01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
involuntary will follow up or the
 
01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
decommissioning is involuntary would the
 
01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:09.589 align:start position:0%
decommissioning is involuntary would the
uh

01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
generator inform the commission of the
 
01:00:14.549 --> 01:00:14.559 align:start position:0%
Department of energy and request some
 
01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
action I guess my my question comes down
 
01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:20.440 align:start position:0%
to if the a new regulation Federal
 
01:00:22.549 --> 01:00:22.559 align:start position:0%
Regulation came out and a generator made
 
01:00:25.309 --> 01:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
a decision saying to SP that kind of
 
01:00:27.069 --> 01:00:27.079 align:start position:0%
money to be in compliance with the new
 
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
regulation would not be cost effective
 
01:00:32.069 --> 01:00:32.079 align:start position:0%
so we're not being forced to close but
 
01:00:34.349 --> 01:00:34.359 align:start position:0%
we choose to close because of economic
 
01:00:35.950 --> 01:00:35.960 align:start position:0%
reasons would that be considered
 
01:00:38.069 --> 01:00:38.079 align:start position:0%
involuntary retirement or
 
01:00:41.029 --> 01:00:41.039 align:start position:0%
not if they didn't have any plans to
 
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
close before this regulation
 
01:00:48.109 --> 01:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
became uh or came down from on high
 
01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
somewhere and if they determine that
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
this regulation could potentially be
 
01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:55.349 align:start position:0%
this regulation could potentially be
unconstitutional

01:00:55.349 --> 01:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
then they could turn to the Department
 
01:00:59.789 --> 01:00:59.799 align:start position:0%
of energy and potentially even further
 
01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:07.069 --> 01:01:07.079 align:start position:0%
redress I just think it's not clear the
 
01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
term involuntary retirement maybe needs
 
01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
to be defined more specifically okay
 
01:01:13.589 --> 01:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for that comment
 
01:01:13.599 --> 01:01:15.789 align:start position:0%
thank you for that comment
representative

01:01:15.789 --> 01:01:15.799 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
Kaplan thank you Mr chair I uh I have
 
01:01:20.029 --> 01:01:20.039 align:start position:0%
some questions about some of the
 
01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
language around the state's Sovereign
 
01:01:25.069 --> 01:01:25.079 align:start position:0%
authority over generation facilities
 
01:01:26.789 --> 01:01:26.799 align:start position:0%
uh correct me if I'm wrong but most of
 
01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
these generation facilities are private
 
01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
companies and so what would what would
 
01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:32.200 align:start position:0%
constitute the state's Sovereign
 
01:01:34.349 --> 01:01:34.359 align:start position:0%
authority to make any decision over
 
01:01:37.150 --> 01:01:37.160 align:start position:0%
their operation or or their U or their
 
01:01:41.109 --> 01:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:44.319 align:start position:0%
not so the state's sovereignty is
 
01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
guaranteed by the 10th Amendment of the
 
01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
United States
 
01:01:51.789 --> 01:01:51.799 align:start position:0%
Constitution and the state can exercise
 
01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
that Authority when it feels it needs to
 
01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
do that's what the body of this
 
01:02:01.789 --> 01:02:01.799 align:start position:0%
legislation sets up as a framework for
 
01:02:04.349 --> 01:02:04.359 align:start position:0%
the state to do that if it determines
 
01:02:09.150 --> 01:02:09.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:13.549 --> 01:02:13.559 align:start position:0%
necessary did you need a followup yeah
 
01:02:16.349 --> 01:02:16.359 align:start position:0%
followup so are you suggesting that the
 
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:20.200 align:start position:0%
the state could step in and overrule uh
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
so to speak uh EPA regulations for
 
01:02:23.359 --> 01:02:25.029 align:start position:0%
so to speak uh EPA regulations for
example

01:02:25.029 --> 01:02:25.039 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:02:28.589 --> 01:02:28.599 align:start position:0%
no I'm suggesting that the state for
 
01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
just for Just Cause could
 
01:02:34.589 --> 01:02:34.599 align:start position:0%
challenge an EPA regulation if it if it
 
01:02:38.190 --> 01:02:38.200 align:start position:0%
thought that said regulation was
 
01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional so the kind of thing
 
01:02:43.069 --> 01:02:43.079 align:start position:0%
that this legislation is trying to head
 
01:02:46.589 --> 01:02:46.599 align:start position:0%
off is when Regulatory
 
01:02:50.349 --> 01:02:50.359 align:start position:0%
Agencies create regulations that are not
 
01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
authorized by
 
01:02:55.150 --> 01:02:55.160 align:start position:0%
Congress and that has has happened
 
01:02:58.390 --> 01:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
repeatedly over the last 25 years the
 
01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:01.240 align:start position:0%
EPA has been challenged in court
 
01:03:03.789 --> 01:03:03.799 align:start position:0%
numerous times
 
01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:07.160 align:start position:0%
and this legislation gives New Hampshire
 
01:03:10.589 --> 01:03:10.599 align:start position:0%
a way to participate in that if it so
 
01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
desires based on protecting an instate
 
01:03:17.549 --> 01:03:17.559 align:start position:0%
generation resource followup yeah one
 
01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
more followup that seems to be
 
01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
predicated uh uh Mr Mr chairman on on a
 
01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision that hasn't
 
01:03:25.589 --> 01:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
really come down yet if you're talking
 
01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
about Chevron deference to Regulatory
 
01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
Agencies um as far as as I'm I'm aware
 
01:03:33.029 --> 01:03:33.039 align:start position:0%
those Regulatory Agencies have the right
 
01:03:35.829 --> 01:03:35.839 align:start position:0%
to make those rules so no it's not
 
01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
predicated upon it I did discuss it in
 
01:03:41.269 --> 01:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
the public hearing when I introduced the
 
01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
bill the EPA has been taken to court
 
01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:45.349 align:start position:0%
bill the EPA has been taken to court
multiple

01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
01:03:48.069 --> 01:03:48.079 align:start position:0%
times and there have been various
 
01:03:51.069 --> 01:03:51.079 align:start position:0%
decisions made about the constit
 
01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of some of the
 
01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
regulations that they've
 
01:03:58.510 --> 01:03:58.520 align:start position:0%
uh offered some have been overruled some
 
01:04:00.029 --> 01:04:00.039 align:start position:0%
have been have been
 
01:04:03.029 --> 01:04:03.039 align:start position:0%
upheld the question is does New
 
01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have any real legal way to
 
01:04:10.510 --> 01:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
object if a rule potentially can hurt an
 
01:04:12.670 --> 01:04:12.680 align:start position:0%
instate generation
 
01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
facility representative Ms thank you Mr
 
01:04:18.510 --> 01:04:18.520 align:start position:0%
chairman um like representative
 
01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
Harrington I had a question on um page
 
01:04:25.309 --> 01:04:25.319 align:start position:0%
two the section two on page two but mine
 
01:04:27.349 --> 01:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
mine was a little little little
 
01:04:31.390 --> 01:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
different um I guess I my my question is
 
01:04:35.069 --> 01:04:35.079 align:start position:0%
does does external Rel regulatory action
 
01:04:38.510 --> 01:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
does that apply to action regulatory
 
01:04:42.109 --> 01:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
actions by state agencies as well and
 
01:04:44.269 --> 01:04:44.279 align:start position:0%
and I can think of two examples that
 
01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
could result in the involuntary
 
01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
retirement or decommissioning of a
 
01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839 align:start position:0%
generators facility one is the de the
 
01:04:53.789 --> 01:04:53.799 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
01:04:53.799 --> 01:04:54.789 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
decid

01:04:54.789 --> 01:04:54.799 align:start position:0%
decid
 
01:04:59.029 --> 01:04:59.039 align:start position:0%
Ides that um it's in the best interest
 
01:05:04.269 --> 01:05:04.279 align:start position:0%
to eliminate a dam on a river that and
 
01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
that Dam happens to also be a Electric
 
01:05:09.109 --> 01:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
electrical generating
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
facility um I if that happens does that
 
01:05:17.630 --> 01:05:17.640 align:start position:0%
uh generator have the ability to uh
 
01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
petition the commissioner and the
 
01:05:21.870 --> 01:05:21.880 align:start position:0%
Attorney General to take action and then
 
01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
another example that um um you know we
 
01:05:27.069 --> 01:05:27.079 align:start position:0%
spent quite a bit of time talking about
 
01:05:31.230 --> 01:05:31.240 align:start position:0%
last year is if for example the Pu
 
01:05:37.710 --> 01:05:37.720 align:start position:0%
issues an order um um kind of U abating
 
01:05:40.829 --> 01:05:40.839 align:start position:0%
an agreement that a power generator such
 
01:05:43.589 --> 01:05:43.599 align:start position:0%
as the Burgess biomass plant has entered
 
01:05:47.349 --> 01:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
into um making it unattractive for that
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
business to continue operating and then
 
01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
the legislature on top of that you know
 
01:05:57.870 --> 01:05:57.880 align:start position:0%
introduces some um some um significant
 
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh Financial um hurdles that they have
 
01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:01.230 align:start position:0%
uh Financial um hurdles that they have
to

01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:01.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:04.200 align:start position:0%
cross if this is passed does that give
 
01:06:06.349 --> 01:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
does this give the Burgess biomass plant
 
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to petition the
 
01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner and the attorney general or
 
01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:12.440 align:start position:0%
does this apply strictly to Federal
 
01:06:15.630 --> 01:06:15.640 align:start position:0%
regulatory um
 
01:06:20.269 --> 01:06:20.279 align:start position:0%
action well because it it does discuss
 
01:06:21.349 --> 01:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
in its
 
01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:24.640 align:start position:0%
Preamble the 10th Amendment
 
01:06:26.349 --> 01:06:26.359 align:start position:0%
rights of the state to protect its
 
01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:29.480 align:start position:0%
Sovereign Sovereign Authority it is
 
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
aimed more at National rather than
 
01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
instate activity regulatory activity
 
01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
instate regulatory
 
01:06:43.150 --> 01:06:43.160 align:start position:0%
activity is under the control of the
 
01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
legislature as we set policy for that so
 
01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
that this particular legislation
 
01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
probably would not be invoked in that
 
01:06:57.950 --> 01:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
situation but it could be
 
01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:25.109 align:start position:0%
 
hello

01:07:25.109 --> 01:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
hello
 
01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
testing testing hello oh mine's is
 
01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:29.870 align:start position:0%
testing testing hello oh mine's is
mine's

01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
mine's
 
01:07:33.069 --> 01:07:33.079 align:start position:0%
on hello hello hello hello hello hello
 
01:07:35.190 --> 01:07:35.200 align:start position:0%
oh I guess it's back on okay I don't
 
01:07:37.109 --> 01:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
know what happened there all right well
 
01:07:38.549 --> 01:07:38.559 align:start position:0%
that now that we've got everyone's
 
01:07:38.559 --> 01:07:40.029 align:start position:0%
that now that we've got everyone's
attention

01:07:40.029 --> 01:07:40.039 align:start position:0%
attention
 
01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
um so the point I want to make is I want
 
01:07:44.430 --> 01:07:44.440 align:start position:0%
to sort of pull back the Gaze again uh
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
on this one which this is basically a
 
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
rewrite of New Hampshire's energy policy
 
01:07:53.150 --> 01:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
which is uh 378 37 and it's very much a
 
01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:54.829 align:start position:0%
which is uh 378 37 and it's very much a
departure

01:07:54.829 --> 01:07:54.839 align:start position:0%
departure
 
01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
from existing um language and
 
01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
so this is more protectionist and from
 
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
sort of the state's perspective that we
 
01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
have to guard generating Assets in order
 
01:08:13.630 --> 01:08:13.640 align:start position:0%
to make sure we don't run out of stuff
 
01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
that we need but we are part of a
 
01:08:18.309 --> 01:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
regional grid system and we had
 
01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
testimony which was pretty extensive and
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
also succinct from the New Hampshire New
 
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um power generators
 
01:08:30.910 --> 01:08:30.920 align:start position:0%
Association and they are responsible for
 
01:08:32.910 --> 01:08:32.920 align:start position:0%
the wholesale markets and they talked
 
01:08:35.550 --> 01:08:35.560 align:start position:0%
about how this could have the unintended
 
01:08:38.110 --> 01:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
consequence of actually take taking us
 
01:08:40.630 --> 01:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
in the opposite direction and stifling
 
01:08:43.110 --> 01:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
Innovation for
 
01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
um for changes that happen because the
 
01:08:48.430 --> 01:08:48.440 align:start position:0%
market puts those pressures out there
 
01:08:52.510 --> 01:08:52.520 align:start position:0%
and so um when I look at uh the language
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
that says that we have a duty to defend
 
01:08:57.309 --> 01:08:57.319 align:start position:0%
the production and supply of affordable
 
01:09:00.749 --> 01:09:00.759 align:start position:0%
reliable and secure energy and then it
 
01:09:02.349 --> 01:09:02.359 align:start position:0%
says you know from these particular
 
01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
people but it says that we have that
 
01:09:07.070 --> 01:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
Duty and I the first thing I thought
 
01:09:08.910 --> 01:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
when I read the original amendment I
 
01:09:14.110 --> 01:09:14.120 align:start position:0%
wrote do we because um I understand the
 
01:09:17.430 --> 01:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
idea that if we have uh if we have seab
 
01:09:20.309 --> 01:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
Brook and it's producing 58% of the
 
01:09:22.470 --> 01:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
generation in the State Electric
 
01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
generation and most of that energy is
 
01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
being bought by other folks on the
 
01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
regional grid so we're not necessarily
 
01:09:31.390 --> 01:09:31.400 align:start position:0%
benefiting from all of that
 
01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
energy but that asset located in our
 
01:09:38.269 --> 01:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
state is an asset that we would seek to
 
01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
protect but we would have to do that
 
01:09:43.070 --> 01:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
through the
 
01:09:46.789 --> 01:09:46.799 align:start position:0%
existing um bodies of uh you know
 
01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
regulatory bodies and and infrastructure
 
01:09:51.349 --> 01:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
that currently exists we can't vote
 
01:09:54.070 --> 01:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
ourselves into more power than than we
 
01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
have and our doj already has the
 
01:10:01.229 --> 01:10:01.239 align:start position:0%
authority to bring a suit anytime
 
01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
something comes against the state that
 
01:10:04.510 --> 01:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
we would think would be against State
 
01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
interests we don't need to change the
 
01:10:11.630 --> 01:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
state's position on energy policy uh in
 
01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
order to have that Authority so we're
 
01:10:15.870 --> 01:10:15.880 align:start position:0%
not granting ourselves any additional
 
01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
Authority we're just saying that we want
 
01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
to interpret the 10th Amendment of the
 
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
US Constitution as providing us with
 
01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
authority to provide these protections
 
01:10:28.270 --> 01:10:28.280 align:start position:0%
and the last thing I'll say on this is
 
01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
those protections are in the eye of the
 
01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
beholder because in many cases the
 
01:10:35.790 --> 01:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
changes in policy that are coming down
 
01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
are because many of the powers that be
 
01:10:42.030 --> 01:10:42.040 align:start position:0%
in the federal government are concerned
 
01:10:43.830 --> 01:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
about much
 
01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
larger um impacts to human health and
 
01:10:51.189 --> 01:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
environmental um
 
01:10:53.870 --> 01:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
degradation and that is the whole reason
 
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
for the efforts that people have been
 
01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
making for the last 30 or 40 years so
 
01:11:02.030 --> 01:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's in the eye of the beholder and
 
01:11:03.630 --> 01:11:03.640 align:start position:0%
my problem with this bill and this
 
01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
language is
 
01:11:08.350 --> 01:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
that it is not something that we all
 
01:11:10.669 --> 01:11:10.679 align:start position:0%
agree to as far as how energy policy
 
01:11:14.590 --> 01:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
should be described in our state
 
01:11:17.149 --> 01:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
statutes it's a very much a departure
 
01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
and and as well um NEPA had asked us
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
really not to do this basically for the
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences that they could
 
01:11:30.910 --> 01:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
see happening um to um representative
 
01:11:33.709 --> 01:11:33.719 align:start position:0%
kaplan's point to private plants which
 
01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
are going
 
01:11:38.470 --> 01:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
through going through their own um
 
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
changes based on the need for cleaner
 
01:11:45.189 --> 01:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
power so what what they said in their
 
01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
testimony was this could have the
 
01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence of alleviating
 
01:11:52.510 --> 01:11:52.520 align:start position:0%
people from making those changes at a
 
01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
time when it would be really helpful if
 
01:11:56.830 --> 01:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
they would be doing that so um I think
 
01:12:00.669 --> 01:12:00.679 align:start position:0%
it puts it puts a finger on the scale of
 
01:12:04.030 --> 01:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
how we approach energy policy that is as
 
01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
I said very much a departure from where
 
01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
the state has been for the last 30 years
 
01:12:11.709 --> 01:12:11.719 align:start position:0%
and so I can't vote for it because I
 
01:12:13.950 --> 01:12:13.960 align:start position:0%
don't think it I don't think it serves
 
01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
us and I also don't think it um I don't
 
01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
think it comes from a place where it
 
01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
understands both how the system works
 
01:12:28.590 --> 01:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
and um and how the regulatory piece
 
01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
works right it it it seems to be devoid
 
01:12:33.110 --> 01:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
of understanding that we're part of a
 
01:12:35.430 --> 01:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
regional grid so we just really don't
 
01:12:37.510 --> 01:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
have this doesn't give us any more
 
01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
Authority is I guess what I'm trying to
 
01:12:41.110 --> 01:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
say the bill doesn't really help us do
 
01:12:45.629 --> 01:12:45.639 align:start position:0%
anything um so I I can't see muddying
 
01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
the waters which we've now used to
 
01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
describe every single bill that we've
 
01:12:51.229 --> 01:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
reviewed this morning but I just don't
 
01:12:53.390 --> 01:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
see muddying the Waters of State energy
 
01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
energ policy uh with something like this
 
01:12:59.550 --> 01:12:59.560 align:start position:0%
that says we're going to have to get out
 
01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
and legally defend uh the life of of
 
01:13:07.510 --> 01:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
power plants which are morphing and
 
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
transitioning and changing based on the
 
01:13:11.870 --> 01:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
free market I I just I don't think
 
01:13:20.510 --> 01:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
doing seems like oh here we go okay well
 
01:13:26.229 --> 01:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
mine's working thank you Mr chairman for
 
01:13:28.950 --> 01:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
recognizing me and um yeah my comments
 
01:13:31.229 --> 01:13:31.239 align:start position:0%
will be I guess unsurprisingly along the
 
01:13:31.239 --> 01:13:32.270 align:start position:0%
will be I guess unsurprisingly along the
lines

01:13:32.270 --> 01:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
lines
 
01:13:35.550 --> 01:13:35.560 align:start position:0%
of my ranking members comments I too
 
01:13:37.189 --> 01:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
went and you know of course looked at
 
01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
the existing uh statute and I found you
 
01:13:44.430 --> 01:13:44.440 align:start position:0%
know the the New Hampshire energy policy
 
01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
existing law
 
01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:48.229 align:start position:0%
existing law
section

01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
um the site right here 3787 378 37 to be
 
01:13:57.229 --> 01:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
be you know a rather elegant uh
 
01:14:00.990 --> 01:14:01.000 align:start position:0%
73w total of 73 words uh general
 
01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
statement that mentions things we all
 
01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
support agree on as as policy goals
 
01:14:09.070 --> 01:14:09.080 align:start position:0%
lowest reasonable cost reliability
 
01:14:10.830 --> 01:14:10.840 align:start position:0%
diversity of energy
 
01:14:13.189 --> 01:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
resources uh cost effective Energy
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
Efficiency and other demand side
 
01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
resources are in there uh along with of
 
01:14:21.149 --> 01:14:21.159 align:start position:0%
course uh safety and health so you know
 
01:14:24.990 --> 01:14:25.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I I don't um have no doubt
 
01:14:27.629 --> 01:14:27.639 align:start position:0%
about your your sincerity obviously and
 
01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
concern you know for for New Hampshire's
 
01:14:33.390 --> 01:14:33.400 align:start position:0%
energy security and the welfare of the
 
01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire I just um have
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh real concern as as representative
 
01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
McGee expressed with this sort
 
01:14:48.629 --> 01:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
of um you
 
01:14:51.550 --> 01:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
know alternative statement
 
01:14:54.270 --> 01:14:54.280 align:start position:0%
of what that can consists of how to
 
01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
achieve energy security for for the
 
01:14:59.070 --> 01:14:59.080 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire and uh
 
01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
particularly to um you know and I
 
01:15:05.669 --> 01:15:05.679 align:start position:0%
appreciate your work on the amendment um
 
01:15:08.590 --> 01:15:08.600 align:start position:0%
you're you're hearing uh or you're
 
01:15:09.990 --> 01:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
listening at the public hearing and
 
01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:11.480 align:start position:0%
responding to the concerns like
 
01:15:14.270 --> 01:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
elimination of the word dispatchable and
 
01:15:15.709 --> 01:15:15.719 align:start position:0%
and some of the other changes you made I
 
01:15:18.709 --> 01:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
do appreciate that but my my remaining
 
01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
concerns really are still with the
 
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
continued inclusion of uh inclusion of
 
01:15:27.310 --> 01:15:27.320 align:start position:0%
one concept and the exclusion of another
 
01:15:29.390 --> 01:15:29.400 align:start position:0%
concept which you know the word
 
01:15:32.830 --> 01:15:32.840 align:start position:0%
diversity of energy resources you have
 
01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
you are you would be taking out of New
 
01:15:36.270 --> 01:15:36.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's energy
 
01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
policy um and you specifically uh
 
01:15:44.030 --> 01:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
include in particular you know paragraph
 
01:15:47.709 --> 01:15:47.719 align:start position:0%
1A of your um Amendment continues to
 
01:15:50.110 --> 01:15:50.120 align:start position:0%
state that the the state of New
 
01:15:52.750 --> 01:15:52.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire shall work to ensure the
 
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
states energy
 
01:15:59.430 --> 01:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
Independence um I just think you know
 
01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
law New Hampshire law has no business
 
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
including a statement like that because
 
01:16:06.830 --> 01:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
May well the notion of energy
 
01:16:13.149 --> 01:16:13.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:16.030 --> 01:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
totally it is totally
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
facius New
 
01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and really every state in New
 
01:16:23.149 --> 01:16:23.159 align:start position:0%
England is the farthest thing from
 
01:16:23.159 --> 01:16:24.350 align:start position:0%
England is the farthest thing from
energy

01:16:24.350 --> 01:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
independent that a state could
 
01:16:32.430 --> 01:16:32.440 align:start position:0%
be um while we may have a
 
01:16:35.470 --> 01:16:35.480 align:start position:0%
um um nuclear power plant located within
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
our boundaries uh it's a plant that
 
01:16:41.310 --> 01:16:41.320 align:start position:0%
serves the region not simply New
 
01:16:44.189 --> 01:16:44.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and New Hampshire has no
 
01:16:48.669 --> 01:16:48.679 align:start position:0%
Authority or means to uh one day you
 
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
know somehow order that plant to only
 
01:16:53.870 --> 01:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
serve the state of New Hampshire so you
 
01:16:55.550 --> 01:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
know seab Brook is a big generating
 
01:16:57.470 --> 01:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
asset and it may be within our borders
 
01:16:59.830 --> 01:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
but it serves the region in of which we
 
01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
are a part
 
01:17:04.229 --> 01:17:04.239 align:start position:0%
um you
 
01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
know and and a vast majority of the
 
01:17:10.030 --> 01:17:10.040 align:start position:0%
energy we uh use besides uh coming from
 
01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
seab Brook is from fossil fuels and of
 
01:17:14.590 --> 01:17:14.600 align:start position:0%
course New Hampshire or and New England
 
01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
has none of those all of those are
 
01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
imported to this region as you mentioned
 
01:17:23.950 --> 01:17:23.960 align:start position:0%
via pipelines and we remain um um highly
 
01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
dependent on or I should say you know
 
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
extremely vulnerable to disruptions in
 
01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
in those uh weather events acts of War
 
01:17:34.229 --> 01:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
you know the price of gas natural gas
 
01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
spikes and the state experiences what we
 
01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
what we did uh the a couple of years
 
01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
ago in in uh price spikes for our
 
01:17:45.790 --> 01:17:45.800 align:start position:0%
electricity so you know if if we're
 
01:17:48.270 --> 01:17:48.280 align:start position:0%
going to pass a new law or make a new
 
01:17:51.709 --> 01:17:51.719 align:start position:0%
statement about um energy security for
 
01:17:53.790 --> 01:17:53.800 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire you know it's
 
01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's going to be found uh
 
01:17:59.430 --> 01:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
either in that you know felicious notion
 
01:18:02.910 --> 01:18:02.920 align:start position:0%
of energy Independence or in sort of
 
01:18:06.669 --> 01:18:06.679 align:start position:0%
exer uh asserting a new sort of state
 
01:18:11.070 --> 01:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
power over private Market uh generation
 
01:18:14.229 --> 01:18:14.239 align:start position:0%
assets that we somehow might be able to
 
01:18:17.149 --> 01:18:17.159 align:start position:0%
command to continue uh operating or
 
01:18:20.510 --> 01:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
something you know rather the state's
 
01:18:24.070 --> 01:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
energy policy should uh embrace
 
01:18:26.550 --> 01:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh not in not Independence but
 
01:18:29.350 --> 01:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
interdependence the interdependence that
 
01:18:31.070 --> 01:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
we have with
 
01:18:34.669 --> 01:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
our um New England neighbors as well as
 
01:18:37.990 --> 01:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
our our neighbor uh North in Canada as
 
01:18:39.790 --> 01:18:39.800 align:start position:0%
well as embracing going back to the
 
01:18:41.430 --> 01:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
other word that I mentioned the
 
01:18:44.149 --> 01:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
diversity uh of energy resources that
 
01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
power our economy today and liberate us
 
01:18:50.750 --> 01:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
from overdependence on any one asset or
 
01:19:06.510 --> 01:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:10.590 --> 01:19:10.600 align:start position:0%
thoughts hello oh mine's
 
01:19:14.550 --> 01:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
working hello oh now it's working okay
 
01:19:16.870 --> 01:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
all right so we have three minutes left
 
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:21.840 --> 01:20:52.310 align:start position:0%
 
word

01:20:52.310 --> 01:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:21.629 --> 01:21:21.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:21.639 --> 03:04:18.950 align:start position:0%
 
working

03:04:18.950 --> 03:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:22.190 --> 03:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
everybody I have a working mic cross
 
03:04:23.950 --> 03:04:23.960 align:start position:0%
your fingers that it stays that way for
 
03:04:23.960 --> 03:04:24.910 align:start position:0%
your fingers that it stays that way for
a

03:04:24.910 --> 03:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:04:28.990 --> 03:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
while we're here for an executive
 
03:04:31.910 --> 03:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
session on three bills this afternoon
 
03:04:35.349 --> 03:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
we're going to be looking at House Bill
 
03:04:38.630 --> 03:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
1036 relative to assessment of cost
 
03:04:41.190 --> 03:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of the system benefits
 
03:04:44.030 --> 03:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
charge House Bill 1600 relative to
 
03:04:46.309 --> 03:04:46.319 align:start position:0%
participation in net energy
 
03:04:49.670 --> 03:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
metering and House Bill 1623 relative to
 
03:04:52.550 --> 03:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
the state energy policy we had an
 
03:04:54.550 --> 03:04:54.560 align:start position:0%
extensive full committee work session on
 
03:04:56.790 --> 03:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
all three bills this morning we think we
 
03:04:59.110 --> 03:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
have a pretty good idea about how things
 
03:05:01.550 --> 03:05:01.560 align:start position:0%
are going to go this
 
03:05:05.790 --> 03:05:05.800 align:start position:0%
afternoon and one little wrinkle that
 
03:05:08.030 --> 03:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
happened that I wasn't made aware of
 
03:05:10.590 --> 03:05:10.600 align:start position:0%
until about two minutes ago is that
 
03:05:12.950 --> 03:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative Lucius parshall who
 
03:05:15.190 --> 03:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't here this morning is also not
 
03:05:16.429 --> 03:05:16.439 align:start position:0%
going to be here this afternoon
 
03:05:20.269 --> 03:05:20.279 align:start position:0%
apparently Lucius is sick we wish him a
 
03:05:24.150 --> 03:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
speedy recovery and hope he gets well
 
03:05:26.550 --> 03:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
very very soon so we can see him uh
 
03:05:28.990 --> 03:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
sooner rather than
 
03:05:29.000 --> 03:05:30.590 align:start position:0%
sooner rather than
later

03:05:30.590 --> 03:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
later
 
03:05:33.389 --> 03:05:33.399 align:start position:0%
and the house rule is that you can't
 
03:05:36.309 --> 03:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
replace a member unless you
 
03:05:41.750 --> 03:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
notify the relevant staff 24 hours in
 
03:05:44.790 --> 03:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
advance but I have asked representative
 
03:05:47.590 --> 03:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
McGee to go and see if she can because
 
03:05:49.309 --> 03:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
these are extraordinary
 
03:05:51.630 --> 03:05:51.640 align:start position:0%
circumstances M representative partial
 
03:05:52.830 --> 03:05:52.840 align:start position:0%
didn't know he was going to be sick
 
03:05:55.510 --> 03:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
until he woke up this morning so I've
 
03:05:57.990 --> 03:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
asked if we can get a replacement on
 
03:06:02.710 --> 03:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
short notice um speaker office she's
 
03:06:05.950 --> 03:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
calling the staff and speaker I guess I
 
03:06:07.950 --> 03:06:07.960 align:start position:0%
don't know who she's calling but she's
 
03:06:09.910 --> 03:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
she's working on
 
03:06:12.630 --> 03:06:12.640 align:start position:0%
it you probably should alert the speaker
 
03:06:15.309 --> 03:06:15.319 align:start position:0%
too not I'm sure the speaker will get
 
03:06:17.469 --> 03:06:17.479 align:start position:0%
involved yes I'm sure the speaker will
 
03:06:17.479 --> 03:06:18.349 align:start position:0%
involved yes I'm sure the speaker will
get

03:06:18.349 --> 03:06:18.359 align:start position:0%
get
 
03:06:20.870 --> 03:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
involved I believe Mr chairman that's a
 
03:06:22.550 --> 03:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
house rule right representative
 
03:06:24.670 --> 03:06:24.680 align:start position:0%
Harrington I believe that's a house rule
 
03:06:27.710 --> 03:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
then we can't wave house rules can we
 
03:06:30.830 --> 03:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
I'm I can't but maybe the speaker can
 
03:06:32.750 --> 03:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
that's why I asked her to double
 
03:06:36.790 --> 03:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
check so we will proceed one way or the
 
03:06:39.110 --> 03:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
other with this ex with executive
 
03:06:42.950 --> 03:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
session I'd prefer that we had uh both
 
03:06:44.830 --> 03:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
Co fuses at full strength but we'll see
 
03:06:47.030 --> 03:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
what happens representative
 
03:06:49.670 --> 03:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
clog thank you chair I'd just like to
 
03:06:52.910 --> 03:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
thank the chair for reaching out to the
 
03:06:56.190 --> 03:06:56.200 align:start position:0%
minority leadership I almost did not
 
03:06:59.269 --> 03:06:59.279 align:start position:0%
make it in today um last night probably
 
03:07:02.389 --> 03:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
for a similar reason it sounds um I
 
03:07:04.990 --> 03:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
cleared up nothing contagious just one
 
03:07:06.309 --> 03:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
of those things I was going to call you
 
03:07:10.309 --> 03:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
at 2: in the morning thank you much as I
 
03:07:12.110 --> 03:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
like you Tom please don't call me at two
 
03:07:15.670 --> 03:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:18.950 --> 03:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
whatever the reason all right so there's
 
03:07:20.429 --> 03:07:20.439 align:start position:0%
one other matter I want to discuss with
 
03:07:22.469 --> 03:07:22.479 align:start position:0%
you all before we start our first
 
03:07:25.349 --> 03:07:25.359 align:start position:0%
executive session and that is at the
 
03:07:27.630 --> 03:07:27.640 align:start position:0%
beginning of the of the day today I
 
03:07:30.550 --> 03:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned that I had visited the clerk
 
03:07:33.349 --> 03:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
to talk about the gerain of an amendment
 
03:07:35.229 --> 03:07:35.239 align:start position:0%
to house bill for
 
03:07:39.389 --> 03:07:39.399 align:start position:0%
1644 which we passed 20 to nothing last
 
03:07:42.710 --> 03:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
Tuesday and the clerk informed me during
 
03:07:45.389 --> 03:07:45.399 align:start position:0%
the lunch break that he and the speaker
 
03:07:48.510 --> 03:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
had determined that that amendment is
 
03:07:48.520 --> 03:07:49.550 align:start position:0%
had determined that that amendment is
not

03:07:49.550 --> 03:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:07:52.750 --> 03:07:52.760 align:start position:0%
Germain therefore the bill can't go
 
03:07:56.710 --> 03:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
forward as written or as
 
03:07:59.950 --> 03:07:59.960 align:start position:0%
submitted so what I'm going to do is I'm
 
03:08:01.910 --> 03:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
going to make a motion on the house
 
03:08:04.790 --> 03:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
floor well first uh representative McGee
 
03:08:06.389 --> 03:08:06.399 align:start position:0%
is going to pull the bill off consent
 
03:08:07.830 --> 03:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
because that's where it currently
 
03:08:10.190 --> 03:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
resides and then I'm going to make a
 
03:08:12.190 --> 03:08:12.200 align:start position:0%
motion on the house floor to refer the
 
03:08:14.990 --> 03:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
bill for interim
 
03:08:17.910 --> 03:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
study and I would encourage you all to
 
03:08:21.870 --> 03:08:21.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:21.880 --> 03:08:24.630 align:start position:0%
 
motion

03:08:24.630 --> 03:08:24.640 align:start position:0%
motion
 
03:08:27.429 --> 03:08:27.439 align:start position:0%
1644 it's on the consent
 
03:08:31.990 --> 03:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
calendar it was a 20 to nothing vote
 
03:08:37.070 --> 03:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
but we will refer it now for interim
 
03:08:40.349 --> 03:08:40.359 align:start position:0%
study and before I start this NE next
 
03:08:43.110 --> 03:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
executive session I'm going to ask
 
03:08:46.190 --> 03:08:46.200 align:start position:0%
representative McGee if she had any
 
03:08:50.429 --> 03:08:50.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:10.790 --> 03:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:14.750 --> 03:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
well okay so since uh representative
 
03:09:16.990 --> 03:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
McGee was not able to get any relief
 
03:09:18.830 --> 03:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
from the speaker's
 
03:09:21.309 --> 03:09:21.319 align:start position:0%
office I just had a conference with
 
03:09:24.150 --> 03:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
representative n and she has some other
 
03:09:27.070 --> 03:09:27.080 align:start position:0%
business to transact so she is going to
 
03:09:30.710 --> 03:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
leave so that we'll have an equal equal
 
03:09:36.429 --> 03:09:36.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:39.190 --> 03:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
representation okay so representative
 
03:09:40.950 --> 03:09:40.960 align:start position:0%

03:10:21.710 --> 03:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
beforehand okay so representative Corman
 
03:10:25.710 --> 03:10:25.720 align:start position:0%
moves the adoption of amendment
 
03:10:29.870 --> 03:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
0764 and I second that motion so it has
 
03:10:32.190 --> 03:10:32.200 align:start position:0%
been moved and seconded that we adopt
 
03:10:34.349 --> 03:10:34.359 align:start position:0%
this amendment and
 
03:10:36.510 --> 03:10:36.520 align:start position:0%
I'll the chair will recognize
 
03:10:38.830 --> 03:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
representative Corman to
 
03:10:42.429 --> 03:10:42.439 align:start position:0%
discuss thank you uh as we talked about
 
03:10:44.790 --> 03:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
during the work session this amendment
 
03:10:48.950 --> 03:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh has basically the same idea in the
 
03:10:51.630 --> 03:10:51.640 align:start position:0%
first part as the original Bill where a
 
03:10:55.469 --> 03:10:55.479 align:start position:0%
municipal host that is using its power
 
03:10:57.550 --> 03:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
to offset the load of a municipal or
 
03:11:01.469 --> 03:11:01.479 align:start position:0%
County aggregation uh then it is not
 
03:11:03.670 --> 03:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
going to be considered part of default
 
03:11:07.309 --> 03:11:07.319 align:start position:0%
service not in the load requirements of
 
03:11:10.550 --> 03:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
of iso New England and therefore um what
 
03:11:13.910 --> 03:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
we should be seeing would be uh less
 
03:11:15.950 --> 03:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
requirement in the transmission lines
 
03:11:17.830 --> 03:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
and therefore saving money for everybody
 
03:11:20.229 --> 03:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
with lower transmission requirements and
 
03:11:22.110 --> 03:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
then part two of the amendment is really
 
03:11:25.630 --> 03:11:25.640 align:start position:0%
just housekeeping that says that um the
 
03:11:27.790 --> 03:11:27.800 align:start position:0%
part of RSA
 
03:11:32.469 --> 03:11:32.479 align:start position:0%
53e 4 that refers to customer data it's
 
03:11:36.710 --> 03:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:40.190 --> 03:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you very much I forgot
 
03:11:42.349 --> 03:11:42.359 align:start position:0%
to mention earlier that we have a
 
03:11:44.550 --> 03:11:44.560 align:start position:0%

03:15:58.309 --> 03:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
2024
 
03:16:06.429 --> 03:16:06.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:11.309 --> 03:16:11.319 align:start position:0%
1036 yeah I think what you meant was
 
03:16:11.319 --> 03:16:13.269 align:start position:0%
1036 yeah I think what you meant was
20247

03:16:13.269 --> 03:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
20247
 
03:16:15.950 --> 03:16:15.960 align:start position:0%
63h that is correct
 
03:16:15.960 --> 03:16:17.469 align:start position:0%
63h that is correct
0763

03:16:17.469 --> 03:16:17.479 align:start position:0%
0763
 
03:16:21.389 --> 03:16:21.399 align:start position:0%
H okay great I second that
 
03:16:24.950 --> 03:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
motion and I recognize representative
 
03:16:28.030 --> 03:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
Harrington to discuss the
 
03:16:30.269 --> 03:16:30.279 align:start position:0%
amendment well I recognize we discussed
 
03:16:31.590 --> 03:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
this for a long time this morning I
 
03:16:32.550 --> 03:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
don't think anyone's going to change
 
03:16:34.309 --> 03:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
their mind so there's really not much
 
03:16:36.469 --> 03:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
point in discussing it
 
03:16:40.630 --> 03:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:43.429 --> 03:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
discussion representative McGee yeah Mr
 
03:16:45.189 --> 03:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
chair I would just say that I think
 
03:16:46.950 --> 03:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
among my caucus we thought that the
 
03:16:48.670 --> 03:16:48.680 align:start position:0%
amendment was preferable to the original
 
03:16:50.830 --> 03:16:50.840 align:start position:0%
bill so we're still we're voting for the
 
03:16:53.910 --> 03:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
amendment whether we like it or not and
 
03:16:56.269 --> 03:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
then the bill as amended right so we
 
03:16:59.429 --> 03:16:59.439 align:start position:0%
have two two votes correct correct we
 
03:17:02.150 --> 03:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
will vote on the amendment first
 
03:17:06.389 --> 03:17:06.399 align:start position:0%

03:17:13.590 --> 03:17:13.600 align:start position:0%

03:18:20.269 --> 03:18:20.279 align:start position:0%

03:18:24.070 --> 03:18:24.080 align:start position:0%

move ought to pass as amended on House
Bill

03:18:40.189 --> 03:18:40.199 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:18:43.950 --> 03:18:43.960 align:start position:0%
1036 correct
 
03:18:45.950 --> 03:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
okay I second that
 
03:18:49.469 --> 03:18:49.479 align:start position:0%
motion and I will re reiterate some of
 
03:18:51.990 --> 03:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
what I said this morning
 
03:18:54.750 --> 03:18:54.760 align:start position:0%
namely that this bill does
 
03:18:57.630 --> 03:18:57.640 align:start position:0%
not obligate the Public Utilities
 
03:19:01.630 --> 03:19:01.640 align:start position:0%
Commission to make any changes to the
 
03:19:05.189 --> 03:19:05.199 align:start position:0%
existing cost Effectiveness formulas
 
03:19:07.830 --> 03:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
that are used to
 
03:19:10.950 --> 03:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
determine if energ Energy Efficiency
 
03:19:13.710 --> 03:19:13.720 align:start position:0%
programs are cost effective it does not
 
03:19:17.469 --> 03:19:17.479 align:start position:0%
mandate any changes but what it does do
 
03:19:21.070 --> 03:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
is it gives the commission
 
03:19:24.030 --> 03:19:24.040 align:start position:0%
flexibility that if something better
 
03:19:26.910 --> 03:19:26.920 align:start position:0%
comes down the pike in the next two or
 
03:19:29.830 --> 03:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
three years that they can look at it and
 
03:19:32.349 --> 03:19:32.359 align:start position:0%
consider whether there isn't a better
 
03:19:35.830 --> 03:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
way to evaluate Energy Efficiency cost
 
03:19:37.510 --> 03:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness that's all this
 
03:19:40.830 --> 03:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
legislation does I think it's the kind
 
03:19:43.910 --> 03:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
of public policy that we ought to be
 
03:19:47.150 --> 03:19:47.160 align:start position:0%
providing as guidance to our Regulatory
 
03:19:50.349 --> 03:19:50.359 align:start position:0%
Agencies and I think we should
 
03:19:54.389 --> 03:19:54.399 align:start position:0%
adopt House Bill 1036 as
 
03:19:57.510 --> 03:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
amended further
 
03:19:59.950 --> 03:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
03:20:02.349 --> 03:20:02.359 align:start position:0%
Kaplan thank you Mr chair I I agree that
 
03:20:04.309 --> 03:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
the amended version is is a better
 
03:20:06.389 --> 03:20:06.399 align:start position:0%
version uh but I still can't vote for
 
03:20:09.870 --> 03:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
this bill as amended uh because I think
 
03:20:12.790 --> 03:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
U that the flexibility already exist
 
03:20:14.950 --> 03:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
statute and this would be opening up a
 
03:20:16.469 --> 03:20:16.479 align:start position:0%
can of worms that's already been
 
03:20:19.510 --> 03:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
adjudicated and U is not in the best
 
03:20:21.510 --> 03:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
interest of my constitu so I can't be I
 
03:20:29.030 --> 03:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:31.429 --> 03:20:31.439 align:start position:0%

extensively this morning so I'll ask the
 
03:20:37.349 --> 03:20:37.359 align:start position:0%

House Bill 1623 relative to State energy
policy

03:22:48.710 --> 03:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
policy
 
03:22:53.070 --> 03:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
and I am passing out a new
 
03:22:55.910 --> 03:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
amendment that was
 
03:22:59.229 --> 03:22:59.239 align:start position:0%
crafted during the lunch
 
03:23:08.710 --> 03:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:13.070 --> 03:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
0782 and this amendment was while it's
 
03:23:16.030 --> 03:23:16.040 align:start position:0%
working its way around to you I will
 
03:23:17.830 --> 03:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
explain what it
 
03:23:21.150 --> 03:23:21.160 align:start position:0%
does if you go to page
 
03:23:27.189 --> 03:23:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:32.429 --> 03:23:32.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:32.439 --> 03:23:35.750 align:start position:0%
 
Amendment

03:23:35.750 --> 03:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:40.670 --> 03:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:40.680 --> 03:23:52.110 align:start position:0%
 
it

03:23:52.110 --> 03:23:52.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:54.950 --> 03:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
the previous Amendment on that line read
 
03:23:57.110 --> 03:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
that may result in the involuntary
 
03:23:59.349 --> 03:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
retirement or decommissioning of the
 
03:23:59.359 --> 03:24:00.990 align:start position:0%
retirement or decommissioning of the
generator's

03:24:00.990 --> 03:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
generator's
 
03:24:03.630 --> 03:24:03.640 align:start position:0%
facility the amendment changes that to
 
03:24:06.670 --> 03:24:06.680 align:start position:0%
read that makes continued operation
 
03:24:10.030 --> 03:24:10.040 align:start position:0%
economically infeasible or may result in
 
03:24:12.590 --> 03:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
the invent involuntary retirement or
 
03:24:14.429 --> 03:24:14.439 align:start position:0%
decommissioning of the generator's
 
03:24:18.110 --> 03:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
facility so it basically adds the phrase
 
03:24:18.120 --> 03:24:19.309 align:start position:0%
facility so it basically adds the phrase
makes

03:24:19.309 --> 03:24:19.319 align:start position:0%
makes
 
03:24:22.030 --> 03:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
continued operation economically
 
03:24:26.150 --> 03:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
infeasible or it adds that text it's
 
03:24:27.710 --> 03:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
line 14

03:25:12.550 --> 03:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
07828
 
03:25:18.070 --> 03:25:18.080 align:start position:0%

Thomas

03:25:19.670 --> 03:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
Thomas
 
03:25:22.510 --> 03:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
second moved and seconded that we adopt
 
03:25:25.830 --> 03:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment now we can have a
 
03:25:29.110 --> 03:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
discussion representative McGee thank
 
03:25:31.150 --> 03:25:31.160 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I would just like to
 
03:25:34.229 --> 03:25:34.239 align:start position:0%
reiterate my
 
03:25:39.110 --> 03:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
my perspective that the the amendment as
 
03:25:42.189 --> 03:25:42.199 align:start position:0%
well as the original Amendment
 
03:25:44.269 --> 03:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
are unworkable because they attempt to
 
03:25:47.950 --> 03:25:47.960 align:start position:0%
redefine how the electric system works
 
03:25:52.670 --> 03:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
um and how it is regulated by um stating
 
03:25:55.070 --> 03:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
that that the state has an interest in
 
03:25:57.269 --> 03:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
private businesses and I think that goes
 
03:26:00.070 --> 03:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
against our general position that we are
 
03:26:02.790 --> 03:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
for free markets and we understand that
 
03:26:04.389 --> 03:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
these generating facilities are not
 
03:26:05.469 --> 03:26:05.479 align:start position:0%
under our
 
03:26:08.229 --> 03:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and we understand what the
 
03:26:10.469 --> 03:26:10.479 align:start position:0%
system is that does have jurisdiction
 
03:26:12.309 --> 03:26:12.319 align:start position:0%
and how we would have to interact with
 
03:26:13.790 --> 03:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
them if we were trying to save a
 
03:26:16.429 --> 03:26:16.439 align:start position:0%
particular generating facility so I just
 
03:26:18.710 --> 03:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
I just still don't think this this is
 
03:26:21.830 --> 03:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
workable language thanks Vice chair
 
03:26:25.670 --> 03:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair um I think
 
03:26:28.750 --> 03:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
this amendment clarifies an issue uh
 
03:26:31.389 --> 03:26:31.399 align:start position:0%
that some Representatives had earlier
 
03:26:34.349 --> 03:26:34.359 align:start position:0%
and adds to the existing bill so I think
 
03:26:36.189 --> 03:26:36.199 align:start position:0%
in any event this amendment does make
 
03:26:39.070 --> 03:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
the bill better and I will be supporting
 
03:26:41.990 --> 03:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
it further discussion
 
03:26:45.429 --> 03:26:45.439 align:start position:0%
representative Ms thank you Mr chair um
 
03:26:48.990 --> 03:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
I I too have some continued concerns
 
03:26:53.070 --> 03:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
with the language in the bill um the the
 
03:26:55.429 --> 03:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
change in this amendment uh well it
 
03:26:58.550 --> 03:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
certainly addresses um one of the issues
 
03:27:00.229 --> 03:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
that I think I had raised with respect
 
03:27:04.309 --> 03:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
to the um the Burgess biomass plant um
 
03:27:06.309 --> 03:27:06.319 align:start position:0%
I'm still not clear what an external
 
03:27:08.349 --> 03:27:08.359 align:start position:0%
regulatory action is and whether that
 
03:27:11.910 --> 03:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
applies to um
 
03:27:13.950 --> 03:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
state or or federal
 
03:27:18.110 --> 03:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
authorities and um I um I continue to
 
03:27:20.030 --> 03:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
struggle with the
 
03:27:23.590 --> 03:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
numerous cases where the word sovereign
 
03:27:25.710 --> 03:27:25.720 align:start position:0%
and Sovereign Authority is included in
 
03:27:31.189 --> 03:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
the um in the um in the bill and um not
 
03:27:33.469 --> 03:27:33.479 align:start position:0%
not sure that that's necessary and
 
03:27:36.269 --> 03:27:36.279 align:start position:0%
concerned as to why it's in there so I
 
03:27:37.870 --> 03:27:37.880 align:start position:0%
won't will not be able to support this
 
03:27:40.309 --> 03:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you further
 
03:27:40.319 --> 03:27:42.229 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you further
discussion

03:27:42.229 --> 03:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
03:27:42.239 --> 03:27:44.110 align:start position:0%
discussion
representative

03:27:44.110 --> 03:27:44.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:27:46.750 --> 03:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
bernardy thank you Mr chair I think this
 
03:27:50.510 --> 03:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
bill confirms that in the end the state
 
03:27:53.670 --> 03:27:53.680 align:start position:0%
is the ultimate Sovereign Authority on
 
03:27:57.670 --> 03:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
the need to uh and the having the the
 
03:28:00.389 --> 03:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
responsibility to ensure there is power
 
03:28:03.030 --> 03:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
available within the state after all
 
03:28:05.429 --> 03:28:05.439 align:start position:0%
other regulatory Avenues have been
 
03:28:08.670 --> 03:28:08.680 align:start position:0%
pursued at the end of the day the state
 
03:28:11.790 --> 03:28:11.800 align:start position:0%
is the ultimate sovereign
 
03:28:14.550 --> 03:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
03:28:18.389 --> 03:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
reels thank you Mr chairman um I I
 
03:28:22.070 --> 03:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh I think that the most
 
03:28:24.309 --> 03:28:24.319 align:start position:0%
recent amendment is a is a a slight
 
03:28:28.110 --> 03:28:28.120 align:start position:0%
Improvement to the prior Amendment but I
 
03:28:31.510 --> 03:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
um you know I have to have to push back
 
03:28:31.520 --> 03:28:33.389 align:start position:0%
um you know I have to have to push back
on

03:28:33.389 --> 03:28:33.399 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:28:36.990 --> 03:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
um my colleague representative Bernard's
 
03:28:40.189 --> 03:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
assertion that this bill could possibly
 
03:28:42.910 --> 03:28:42.920 align:start position:0%
make the state of New Hampshire the
 
03:28:42.920 --> 03:28:44.590 align:start position:0%
make the state of New Hampshire the
ultimate

03:28:44.590 --> 03:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
ultimate
 
03:28:47.150 --> 03:28:47.160 align:start position:0%
um Authority we the state of New
 
03:28:50.990 --> 03:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in no way has the uh
 
03:28:53.870 --> 03:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
information the analytical
 
03:28:59.389 --> 03:28:59.399 align:start position:0%
capability uh let alone the um legal
 
03:29:02.710 --> 03:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
authority to do
 
03:29:06.590 --> 03:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
what ISO New England and the North
 
03:29:08.950 --> 03:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
American uh electric reliability
 
03:29:12.309 --> 03:29:12.319 align:start position:0%
Corporation are in fact legally
 
03:29:15.189 --> 03:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
charged with doing by the Federal Energy
 
03:29:18.030 --> 03:29:18.040 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Commission which is having
 
03:29:19.790 --> 03:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
the responsibility
 
03:29:23.510 --> 03:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
to continuously Monitor and
 
03:29:26.110 --> 03:29:26.120 align:start position:0%
manage the regional electric grid and
 
03:29:28.590 --> 03:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
ensure reliability for everyone on it
 
03:29:30.950 --> 03:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
all six New England states so I just
 
03:29:32.790 --> 03:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
this idea that New Hampshire in the end
 
03:29:37.189 --> 03:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
would uh have either the the knowledge
 
03:29:40.110 --> 03:29:40.120 align:start position:0%
or the authority to to do what this bill
 
03:29:44.429 --> 03:29:44.439 align:start position:0%
envisions uh uh is is just I think not
 
03:29:47.750 --> 03:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
there and uh in addition I'll just
 
03:29:50.590 --> 03:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
briefly restate what I something I said
 
03:29:54.030 --> 03:29:54.040 align:start position:0%
earlier I don't think that language that
 
03:29:57.630 --> 03:29:57.640 align:start position:0%
uh asserts that the state of New
 
03:30:01.670 --> 03:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could ever be uh is or could
 
03:30:03.590 --> 03:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
ever be energy
 
03:30:05.790 --> 03:30:05.800 align:start position:0%
independent uh has any place in New
 
03:30:09.150 --> 03:30:09.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law we are very far from
 
03:30:12.990 --> 03:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
energy independent and uh security you
 
03:30:15.429 --> 03:30:15.439 align:start position:0%
know the state of Texas as large as that
 
03:30:18.990 --> 03:30:19.000 align:start position:0%
is uh that years ago asserted their
 
03:30:21.990 --> 03:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
desire to be energy independent and to
 
03:30:25.469 --> 03:30:25.479 align:start position:0%
actually be their own uh electric
 
03:30:29.630 --> 03:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
grid they finally learned that even even
 
03:30:33.030 --> 03:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
they could not be uh security was not
 
03:30:35.750 --> 03:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
found in being energy independent in in
 
03:30:37.630 --> 03:30:37.640 align:start position:0%
the huge cold snap that they experienced
 
03:30:40.429 --> 03:30:40.439 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago when their their grid
 
03:30:41.710 --> 03:30:41.720 align:start position:0%
went down
 
03:30:42.870 --> 03:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
gas plants
 
03:30:46.229 --> 03:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
failed uh transmission lines failed uh
 
03:30:47.590 --> 03:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
certainly the state of New Hampshire
 
03:30:50.150 --> 03:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
will never be energy independent and we
 
03:30:50.160 --> 03:30:51.830 align:start position:0%
will never be energy independent and we
shouldn't

03:30:51.830 --> 03:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
shouldn't
 
03:30:55.150 --> 03:30:55.160 align:start position:0%
um state it as a policy goal that that
 
03:30:56.950 --> 03:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to be instead we should
 
03:31:00.790 --> 03:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
embrace uh our interdependence and the
 
03:31:05.429 --> 03:31:05.439 align:start position:0%
other word diversity of energy resources
 
03:31:07.990 --> 03:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
so can't support this
 
03:31:11.950 --> 03:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
bill further discussion representative
 
03:31:15.750 --> 03:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair um this is a
 
03:31:17.309 --> 03:31:17.319 align:start position:0%
question I guess for you on the
 
03:31:22.189 --> 03:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
amendment um on page two line 20 it it
 
03:31:25.950 --> 03:31:25.960 align:start position:0%
says that um they the department of
 
03:31:29.750 --> 03:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
energy is is mandated to recommend any
 
03:31:32.790 --> 03:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
action necessary to defend the
 
03:31:35.030 --> 03:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
generator however there's
 
03:31:37.950 --> 03:31:37.960 align:start position:0%
no there's no inclusion of public
 
03:31:40.990 --> 03:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
benefit or Community impact even though
 
03:31:43.110 --> 03:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
through it the the top of the page on
 
03:31:45.670 --> 03:31:45.680 align:start position:0%
page one you talk about health safety
 
03:31:47.550 --> 03:31:47.560 align:start position:0%
and Welfare health safety and Welfare
 
03:31:51.110 --> 03:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
you it's mentioned a few times so why is
 
03:31:55.550 --> 03:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
not the health safety and Welfare
 
03:31:58.469 --> 03:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
considered under this mandate I guess
 
03:32:01.910 --> 03:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:04.429 --> 03:32:04.439 align:start position:0%
question well because this paragraph
 
03:32:07.389 --> 03:32:07.399 align:start position:0%
pertains to the involuntary retirement
 
03:32:14.630 --> 03:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:17.590 --> 03:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
right but but what you're saying is that
 
03:32:20.590 --> 03:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
if a plant has has an involuntary
 
03:32:22.349 --> 03:32:22.359 align:start position:0%
retirement or decommissioning that the
 
03:32:24.030 --> 03:32:24.040 align:start position:0%
department of educa uh Department of
 
03:32:27.309 --> 03:32:27.319 align:start position:0%
energy sorry is recommending must
 
03:32:30.630 --> 03:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
recommend any action necessary to defend
 
03:32:30.640 --> 03:32:31.870 align:start position:0%
recommend any action necessary to defend
the

03:32:31.870 --> 03:32:31.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:32:34.510 --> 03:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
generator but shouldn't those actions
 
03:32:37.550 --> 03:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
also consider public benefit and
 
03:32:37.560 --> 03:32:38.870 align:start position:0%

Community
 
03:32:41.389 --> 03:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
impact well that recommendation would be
 
03:32:43.950 --> 03:32:43.960 align:start position:0%
based on the results of the
 
03:32:46.229 --> 03:32:46.239 align:start position:0%
investigatory docket to determine how
 
03:32:48.590 --> 03:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
such an involuntary retirement or
 
03:32:50.710 --> 03:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
decommissioning would affect the
 
03:32:52.510 --> 03:32:52.520 align:start position:0%
reliability and affordability of the
 
03:32:56.030 --> 03:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:58.550 --> 03:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
resources okay I think we're ship's
 
03:33:01.510 --> 03:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
passing in the night but thank you thank
 
03:33:03.990 --> 03:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
you further
 
03:33:06.189 --> 03:33:06.199 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
03:33:09.110 --> 03:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
kapin yes this uh uh thank you Mr chair
 
03:33:10.950 --> 03:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
this is sort of along the lines of
 
03:33:14.349 --> 03:33:14.359 align:start position:0%
represented Wendy Thomas's uh concerns I
 
03:33:17.830 --> 03:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
I just wonder how
 
03:33:21.309 --> 03:33:21.319 align:start position:0%
um the state is going to step in on
 
03:33:24.309 --> 03:33:24.319 align:start position:0%
behalf of private generators when it's
 
03:33:27.429 --> 03:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
determined that external regulatory
 
03:33:29.590 --> 03:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
action makes their operation
 
03:33:29.600 --> 03:33:31.229 align:start position:0%
action makes their operation
economically

03:33:31.229 --> 03:33:31.239 align:start position:0%
economically
 
03:33:34.030 --> 03:33:34.040 align:start position:0%
unfeasible uh I I just I mean I
 
03:33:35.910 --> 03:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
understand the chair's sort of
 
03:33:38.590 --> 03:33:38.600 align:start position:0%
ideological position that the Regulatory
 
03:33:41.269 --> 03:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
Agencies at the federal level ought to
 
03:33:44.990 --> 03:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
be backed up by a legislative mandate
 
03:33:47.469 --> 03:33:47.479 align:start position:0%
but I just fear that this is going to
 
03:33:50.830 --> 03:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
put us at odds with federal regulations
 
03:33:52.630 --> 03:33:52.640 align:start position:0%
and is based on
 
03:33:55.910 --> 03:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
a you know a flawed view of of our
 
03:33:57.590 --> 03:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
sovereignty and how that you know how
 
03:34:00.110 --> 03:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
that means that that it's it's you know
 
03:34:01.870 --> 03:34:01.880 align:start position:0%
the Federal Regulations still have
 
03:34:05.110 --> 03:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
Supremacy and and we need to not be
 
03:34:06.750 --> 03:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
writing something that goes contrary to
 
03:34:09.790 --> 03:34:09.800 align:start position:0%
that in our in our official policy on
 
03:34:09.800 --> 03:34:11.349 align:start position:0%
that in our in our official policy on
energy

03:34:11.349 --> 03:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
energy
 
03:34:13.590 --> 03:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
so I can't vote for this bill even
 
03:34:13.600 --> 03:34:16.349 align:start position:0%
so I can't vote for this bill even
additional

03:34:16.349 --> 03:34:16.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:18.750 --> 03:34:18.760 align:start position:0%
discussion Vice chair Thomas thank you
 
03:34:21.309 --> 03:34:21.319 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um I just like to reiterate
 
03:34:23.429 --> 03:34:23.439 align:start position:0%
that whether it's one argument whether
 
03:34:27.189 --> 03:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
or not uh the state can actually U uh
 
03:34:30.150 --> 03:34:30.160 align:start position:0%
has the ability to uh physically perform
 
03:34:32.309 --> 03:34:32.319 align:start position:0%
some of these actions I think the point
 
03:34:33.550 --> 03:34:33.560 align:start position:0%
I'd like to refer back to what
 
03:34:35.189 --> 03:34:35.199 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi said is that
 
03:34:37.950 --> 03:34:37.960 align:start position:0%
this is just a reaffirmation of the
 
03:34:40.389 --> 03:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
state's right under the 10th Amendment
 
03:34:43.870 --> 03:34:43.880 align:start position:0%
which uh far as I can recollect back in
 
03:34:47.189 --> 03:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
you know in the 1700s there was no
 
03:34:49.309 --> 03:34:49.319 align:start position:0%
mention of electric grid in the
 
03:34:53.590 --> 03:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
Constitution so all powers not expressly
 
03:34:55.309 --> 03:34:55.319 align:start position:0%
prohibited in the Constitution fall back
 
03:34:57.590 --> 03:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
on the state so I think this is just a
 
03:35:00.510 --> 03:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
reaffirmation that the state has the
 
03:35:02.750 --> 03:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
right not saying has the ability or
 
03:35:05.189 --> 03:35:05.199 align:start position:0%
capability or even the materials to
 
03:35:06.790 --> 03:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
carry forward but they at least have the
 
03:35:10.269 --> 03:35:10.279 align:start position:0%
right to challenge and to um do certain
 
03:35:12.309 --> 03:35:12.319 align:start position:0%
laws as to for the to protect the
 
03:35:13.950 --> 03:35:13.960 align:start position:0%
welfare of of its people here which
 
03:35:17.630 --> 03:35:17.640 align:start position:0%
would be the power grid so although this
 
03:35:19.070 --> 03:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
bill may not have a whole lot of teeth
 
03:35:21.070 --> 03:35:21.080 align:start position:0%
to it I think the point is that it's
 
03:35:23.590 --> 03:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
saying the state does reserve its right
 
03:35:25.910 --> 03:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
to challenge these regulations under the
 
03:35:25.920 --> 03:35:28.070 align:start position:0%
to challenge these regulations under the
10th

03:35:28.070 --> 03:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
10th
 
03:35:31.229 --> 03:35:31.239 align:start position:0%
Amendment representative Ms thank you Mr
 
03:35:33.790 --> 03:35:33.800 align:start position:0%
chair with with all due respect to to
 
03:35:37.269 --> 03:35:37.279 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas
 
03:35:39.830 --> 03:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
um that's not all this bill does this
 
03:35:43.670 --> 03:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
bill eliminates or changes dramatically
 
03:35:46.550 --> 03:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
the state's energy policy and if the
 
03:35:50.870 --> 03:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
intent was to um introduce legislation
 
03:35:54.710 --> 03:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
to reassert the state's 10th Amendment
 
03:35:58.950 --> 03:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
rights doing that and and eliminating
 
03:36:00.910 --> 03:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
the state's energy policy would not be
 
03:36:03.590 --> 03:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
the appropriate way to do
 
03:36:07.189 --> 03:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:09.510 --> 03:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing
 
03:36:09.520 --> 03:36:11.189 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing
none

03:36:11.189 --> 03:36:11.199 align:start position:0%
none
 
03:36:13.349 --> 03:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
representative McGee it did just come to
 
03:36:17.469 --> 03:36:17.479 align:start position:0%
me so uh on that point of this affecting
 
03:36:20.870 --> 03:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
the state the stated State energy policy
 
03:36:23.550 --> 03:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
um we have multiple vehicles that are
 
03:36:26.349 --> 03:36:26.359 align:start position:0%
rewriting the state energy policy this
 
03:36:30.590 --> 03:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
time around on both sides of the wall so
 
03:36:33.550 --> 03:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
um I another reason that I wouldn't vote
 
03:36:36.229 --> 03:36:36.239 align:start position:0%
for this particular legislation is that
 
03:36:38.429 --> 03:36:38.439 align:start position:0%
this is the one that is counter to the
 
03:36:41.790 --> 03:36:41.800 align:start position:0%
other um the other two vehicles that
 
03:36:43.269 --> 03:36:43.279 align:start position:0%
have been passed which are more in
 
03:36:46.590 --> 03:36:46.600 align:start position:0%
keeping with the existing policy and I
 
03:36:48.750 --> 03:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
think if we are going to undertake uh
 
03:36:52.030 --> 03:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
and about face on what we are listing as
 
03:36:54.550 --> 03:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's priorities in terms of
 
03:36:56.469 --> 03:36:56.479 align:start position:0%
energy policy this should be a more full
 
03:36:58.950 --> 03:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
some process than what we've had here
 
03:37:02.630 --> 03:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
today um because this doesn't reflect
 
03:37:05.030 --> 03:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
what it was mentioned earlier uh in the
 
03:37:08.830 --> 03:37:08.840 align:start position:0%
work session uh I believe 72 words or
 
03:37:11.630 --> 03:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
something I think Ned wrote red it it's
 
03:37:15.110 --> 03:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
it's succinct it's elegant um and it was
 
03:37:16.590 --> 03:37:16.600 align:start position:0%
pulled together over time to really
 
03:37:18.189 --> 03:37:18.199 align:start position:0%
Encompass all of the things that we're
 
03:37:19.990 --> 03:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish with our energy
 
03:37:22.630 --> 03:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
policy and I think that the language in
 
03:37:25.309 --> 03:37:25.319 align:start position:0%
this bill would replace that language
 
03:37:27.910 --> 03:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
and it would um it would leave us
 
03:37:29.950 --> 03:37:29.960 align:start position:0%
wanting on a number of areas that were
 
03:37:31.990 --> 03:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned in that original policy which
 
03:37:34.990 --> 03:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
are preserved in both the house bill and
 
03:37:38.830 --> 03:37:38.840 align:start position:0%
the Senate bill that um seek to modify
 
03:37:42.309 --> 03:37:42.319 align:start position:0%
that energy policy with with the um the
 
03:37:46.710 --> 03:37:46.720 align:start position:0%
IRP right the um the integrated resource
 
03:37:48.510 --> 03:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
planning uh language that we're trying
 
03:37:51.710 --> 03:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
to reinstate that we took out of the
 
03:37:58.030 --> 03:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:04.070 --> 03:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
281 so the state's consumer Advocate
 
03:38:06.189 --> 03:38:06.199 align:start position:0%
wrote in a recent
 
03:38:09.830 --> 03:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
article right now and I quote right now
 
03:38:17.469 --> 03:38:17.479 align:start position:0%
RS 378 colon7 37 is a malage of mixed
 
03:38:19.950 --> 03:38:19.960 align:start position:0%
messages there are references to keeping
 
03:38:21.830 --> 03:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
utilities financially healthy to
 
03:38:23.429 --> 03:38:23.439 align:start position:0%
protecting the safety and health of our
 
03:38:25.910 --> 03:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
citizens to maximizing maximizing the
 
03:38:26.990 --> 03:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
use of
 
03:38:29.870 --> 03:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
costeffective Energy
 
03:38:32.590 --> 03:38:32.600 align:start position:0%
Efficiency and
 
03:38:32.600 --> 03:38:34.710 align:start position:0%
Efficiency and
Etc

03:38:34.710 --> 03:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
03:38:37.510 --> 03:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
so if there is a malange of
 
03:38:40.030 --> 03:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
contradictory messages there then maybe
 
03:38:42.830 --> 03:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
we should replace it thank you Mr chair
 
03:38:44.670 --> 03:38:44.680 align:start position:0%
and I'd just like to say that I read the
 
03:38:47.110 --> 03:38:47.120 align:start position:0%
article and he he also goes on to say
 
03:38:50.910 --> 03:38:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:54.990 --> 03:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:57.030 --> 03:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none I'll ask the
 
03:38:58.750 --> 03:38:58.760 align:start position:0%

fails and so does the bill so it will go

to the house floor without
 
03:40:07.510 --> 03:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation I will write the report
