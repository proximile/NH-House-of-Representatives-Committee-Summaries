01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
I'm open in the public hearing on House
 
01:00:24.349 --> 01:00:24.359 align:start position:0%
Bill 1 190 and invite the sponsor to
 
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill
 
01:00:29.309 --> 01:00:29.319 align:start position:0%
thank you honorable Mr chair and uh
 
01:00:30.589 --> 01:00:30.599 align:start position:0%
committee members my name is
 
01:00:32.549 --> 01:00:32.559 align:start position:0%
representative Heath Howard I represent
 
01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
the towns of straford and barington in
 
01:00:36.589 --> 01:00:36.599 align:start position:0%
straford District 4 uh today I'm
 
01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:40.720 align:start position:0%
introducing HB 190 which uh increases
 
01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:42.440 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis purchase and
 
01:00:45.150 --> 01:00:45.160 align:start position:0%
possession limits from 2 to 4 ounces
 
01:00:48.029 --> 01:00:48.039 align:start position:0%
this does not legalize cannabis for uh
 
01:00:51.069 --> 01:00:51.079 align:start position:0%
recreational use this does not change
 
01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:53.559 align:start position:0%
the who can purchase cannabis this does
 
01:00:55.309 --> 01:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
not change anything other than the fact
 
01:00:57.349 --> 01:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
that people who are already allowed to
 
01:00:59.710 --> 01:00:59.720 align:start position:0%
purchase and possess cannabis for
 
01:01:02.670 --> 01:01:02.680 align:start position:0%
therapeutic and medical use can now
 
01:01:06.069 --> 01:01:06.079 align:start position:0%
purchase and possess more which really
 
01:01:07.589 --> 01:01:07.599 align:start position:0%
does benefit them from a medical
 
01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
perspective as some people do need
 
01:01:12.430 --> 01:01:12.440 align:start position:0%
larger doses than others it helps reduce
 
01:01:14.670 --> 01:01:14.680 align:start position:0%
uh travel in the number of trips people
 
01:01:17.029 --> 01:01:17.039 align:start position:0%
need to take to the dispensaries and
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
overall makes it easier for the people
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
who are uh most in need so with that uh
 
01:01:25.109 --> 01:01:25.119 align:start position:0%
because the language is pretty simple
 
01:01:27.309 --> 01:01:27.319 align:start position:0%
all it does is change uh the two to the
 
01:01:30.430 --> 01:01:30.440 align:start position:0%
four uh I'm open to any questions thank
 
01:01:34.510 --> 01:01:34.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you um I have a question in
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
crafting this build did you talk to any
 
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
or work with any cannabis patients yes I
 
01:01:41.109 --> 01:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
I'm actually a therapeutic cannabis
 
01:01:42.589 --> 01:01:42.599 align:start position:0%
patient myself I broke my back when I
 
01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
was 16 I have uh used it as an
 
01:01:47.549 --> 01:01:47.559 align:start position:0%
alternative to uh things like opiates
 
01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
and I I personally think that this is a
 
01:01:52.430 --> 01:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
a much needed change it's something
 
01:01:56.190 --> 01:01:56.200 align:start position:0%
where uh obviously uh some people uh
 
01:01:58.430 --> 01:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
because we only have a limited number of
 
01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:00.200 align:start position:0%
dispensaries in the state we have three
 
01:02:03.109 --> 01:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
companies uh with uh only a handful of
 
01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
locations so it's not exactly always
 
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
accessible for people so this way we can
 
01:02:11.349 --> 01:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
help kind of uh alleviate some of that
 
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
strain on them okay so my point I guess
 
01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
I was getting at is and maybe this is
 
01:02:20.029 --> 01:02:20.039 align:start position:0%
great that you you're a patient
 
01:02:23.109 --> 01:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
yourself have you ever utilized 2 ounces
 
01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
in a month uh personally no but again
 
01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:28.960 align:start position:0%
the it's it's different uh
 
01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
differentiates uh we need to
 
01:02:31.789 --> 01:02:31.799 align:start position:0%
differentiate between different types of
 
01:02:33.870 --> 01:02:33.880 align:start position:0%
patients and the thing is is that
 
01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
different patients use different amounts
 
01:02:38.589 --> 01:02:38.599 align:start position:0%
and sometimes they uh actually will I
 
01:02:40.829 --> 01:02:40.839 align:start position:0%
mean they'll buy in bulk and what
 
01:02:43.549 --> 01:02:43.559 align:start position:0%
they'll do is make oil uh which then
 
01:02:46.269 --> 01:02:46.279 align:start position:0%
they can use to cook uh different types
 
01:02:48.109 --> 01:02:48.119 align:start position:0%
of food whether it may be you know a
 
01:02:51.549 --> 01:02:51.559 align:start position:0%
brownie or you know even uh uh you know
 
01:02:53.630 --> 01:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
something like as as basic as salad
 
01:02:56.670 --> 01:02:56.680 align:start position:0%
dressing even so uh there are various
 
01:02:58.630 --> 01:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
different types of uh ways that people
 
01:03:00.549 --> 01:03:00.559 align:start position:0%
can utilize it and buying in bulk kind
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
of helps uh reduce some of these
 
01:03:05.390 --> 01:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
people's needs uh to produce that oil
 
01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:07.839 align:start position:0%
multiple times uh throughout the year so
 
01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
okay that's interesting so the the
 
01:03:14.349 --> 01:03:14.359 align:start position:0%
amount of the bulk product you're saying
 
01:03:16.430 --> 01:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
um is the weight that they're allowed to
 
01:03:19.349 --> 01:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
have but that's reduced down when they
 
01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:21.240 align:start position:0%
um cook it or do whatever to make
 
01:03:22.309 --> 01:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
something else that they're going to use
 
01:03:24.910 --> 01:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
it for yes okay yeah that is corre and
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that isett potent though
 
01:03:29.230 --> 01:03:29.240 align:start position:0%
that that it it can be but it depends
 
01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:32.440 align:start position:0%
again on the different strain and uh
 
01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
people will then have to dose themselves
 
01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
accordingly uh you know uh like I I have
 
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
a tray of brownies at home and it's
 
01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
something where depending on what I want
 
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
for that evening I'll cut a differ size
 
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
piece and and uh because it's something
 
01:03:50.190 --> 01:03:50.200 align:start position:0%
that I've had before I kind of
 
01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
understand what the effect is going to
 
01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:54.839 align:start position:0%
be on me and so I can kind of adjust
 
01:03:57.470 --> 01:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
accordingly so it's something where the
 
01:04:00.269 --> 01:04:00.279 align:start position:0%
patient really uh is the one kind of uh
 
01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
taking it upon themselves to
 
01:04:04.069 --> 01:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
self-regulate okay thank you questions
 
01:04:05.829 --> 01:04:05.839 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
Muse I I've I have heard that uh it is
 
01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
problematic for some people the the the
 
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
amount of distance uh that they have to
 
01:04:19.549 --> 01:04:19.559 align:start position:0%
travel have you been contacted by people
 
01:04:21.549 --> 01:04:21.559 align:start position:0%
like that and yes I mean is that is that
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
an issue that that comes up a lot yes it
 
01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
it is especially up in the north country
 
01:04:28.789 --> 01:04:28.799 align:start position:0%
uh I mean there are uh again only a
 
01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:31.240 align:start position:0%
handful of dispensaries across the state
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
and a lot of them are in the southern
 
01:04:35.230 --> 01:04:35.240 align:start position:0%
half it's something where a lot of these
 
01:04:37.710 --> 01:04:37.720 align:start position:0%
patients especially in the North Country
 
01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
it's a lot easier if you can cut down
 
01:04:42.109 --> 01:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
the amount of trips that they're making
 
01:04:43.829 --> 01:04:43.839 align:start position:0%
uh and you know if they only need to
 
01:04:46.710 --> 01:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
come once every two months that's a huge
 
01:04:49.269 --> 01:04:49.279 align:start position:0%
change because then that's a whole trip
 
01:04:52.029 --> 01:04:52.039 align:start position:0%
that they don't need to take every month
 
01:04:57.269 --> 01:04:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:59.430 --> 01:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
followup do you
 
01:05:02.670 --> 01:05:02.680 align:start position:0%
see you know an analogy that I kind of
 
01:05:04.390 --> 01:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
make in my own mind as I take a
 
01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
cholesterol medication and one of the
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
things that my Pharmacy benefit manager
 
01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
did years and years ago was uh encourag
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
me to buy a 90-day Supply instead of a
 
01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
30-day Supply and these days I actually
 
01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
pay less for the 90-day Supply than I
 
01:05:19.870 --> 01:05:19.880 align:start position:0%
ever did for the 30-day Supply is there
 
01:05:22.349 --> 01:05:22.359 align:start position:0%
is are we talking about something
 
01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
similar yeah I mean again it's something
 
01:05:27.549 --> 01:05:27.559 align:start position:0%
where whenever I purchase I always
 
01:05:29.029 --> 01:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
purchase the limit because it is
 
01:05:30.990 --> 01:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
something where financially speaking it
 
01:05:33.950 --> 01:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
is a lot more advantageous to uh to
 
01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
purchase the limit uh a lot of the times
 
01:05:37.349 --> 01:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
there are some discounts that are
 
01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
available when you do it that way and it
 
01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
can reduce the cost
 
01:05:45.029 --> 01:05:45.039 align:start position:0%
significantly and one more
 
01:05:47.789 --> 01:05:47.799 align:start position:0%
followup and the cost of therapeutic
 
01:05:49.789 --> 01:05:49.799 align:start position:0%
cannabis is not reimbursed by insurance
 
01:05:51.150 --> 01:05:51.160 align:start position:0%
companies is that correct that is
 
01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
correct thank
 
01:05:56.910 --> 01:05:56.920 align:start position:0%
you with regard to the North country are
 
01:05:59.109 --> 01:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire cannabis patients allowed
 
01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
to cross the border to Vermont or Maine
 
01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
in you in purchase or would that be a
 
01:06:06.549 --> 01:06:06.559 align:start position:0%
violation of their contract so they can
 
01:06:09.069 --> 01:06:09.079 align:start position:0%
cross state lines and purchase in other
 
01:06:11.470 --> 01:06:11.480 align:start position:0%
states uh around us so uh except for
 
01:06:14.230 --> 01:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so Vermont uh if I'm not
 
01:06:16.710 --> 01:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
mistaken uh in Maine you can go in their
 
01:06:18.829 --> 01:06:18.839 align:start position:0%
medical dispensaries however you cannot
 
01:06:21.349 --> 01:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
cross back into New Hampshire with that
 
01:06:24.349 --> 01:06:24.359 align:start position:0%
product it is locked uh by state and you
 
01:06:25.990 --> 01:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
cannot cross uh because then you would
 
01:06:28.109 --> 01:06:28.119 align:start position:0%
have interstate commerce and that is
 
01:06:28.119 --> 01:06:29.269 align:start position:0%
have interstate commerce and that is
federally

01:06:29.269 --> 01:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
federally
 
01:06:31.470 --> 01:06:31.480 align:start position:0%
legal pretty sure the whole shooting
 
01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:34.200 align:start position:0%
match is federally legal but further
 
01:06:38.109 --> 01:06:38.119 align:start position:0%
questions uh yes represent
 
01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
s thank you for taking my question um
 
01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
with respect to the North Country uh
 
01:06:48.430 --> 01:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
years ago I'm going to say six or eight
 
01:06:52.549 --> 01:06:52.559 align:start position:0%
years ago there was a a u a
 
01:06:56.269 --> 01:06:56.279 align:start position:0%
major problem with uh
 
01:07:00.029 --> 01:07:00.039 align:start position:0%
um opioids in the North country and the
 
01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
the reason for that was that uh people
 
01:07:06.910 --> 01:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
in the North Country couldn't Avail
 
01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
themselves to physical therapy so they
 
01:07:15.390 --> 01:07:15.400 align:start position:0%
had to resort to opioids for pain
 
01:07:18.630 --> 01:07:18.640 align:start position:0%
relief um so I'm I'm particularly
 
01:07:20.589 --> 01:07:20.599 align:start position:0%
interested when you said that there are
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
very few dispensaries do you know where
 
01:07:26.309 --> 01:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
the closest dispensary is up north
 
01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
I want to say it's in North Conway if
 
01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not mistaken really so if you're in
 
01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:37.480 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh or arol or Co Brook that's a
 
01:07:43.269 --> 01:07:43.279 align:start position:0%
long track yes it it is just follow up
 
01:07:47.309 --> 01:07:47.319 align:start position:0%
follow pardon me but I for my ignorance
 
01:07:49.069 --> 01:07:49.079 align:start position:0%
on this subject
 
01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
but recently there's been some uh talk
 
01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
of a synthetic cannabis called K2 or
 
01:07:58.269 --> 01:07:58.279 align:start position:0%
something like
 
01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
that can you explain what that
 
01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
is I might not be the best one to
 
01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
explain uh synthetic uh cannaboids uh
 
01:08:09.309 --> 01:08:09.319 align:start position:0%
there there are other uh experts here
 
01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
who who would be able to answer that
 
01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:14.640 align:start position:0%
better than I okay thank
 
01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
you see no further questions thank you
 
01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:18.669 align:start position:0%
you see no further questions thank you
thank

01:08:18.669 --> 01:08:18.679 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:08:21.669 --> 01:08:21.679 align:start position:0%
you the chair recognizes The Honorable
 
01:08:29.709 --> 01:08:29.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:30.829 --> 01:08:30.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
01:08:33.149 --> 01:08:33.159 align:start position:0%
committee um so you guys asked a lot of
 
01:08:34.669 --> 01:08:34.679 align:start position:0%
really good questions but like I think
 
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
the prime hit it like nail on the head
 
01:08:37.709 --> 01:08:37.719 align:start position:0%
it's like multiple trips ends up
 
01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
becoming a burden on people that are
 
01:08:40.870 --> 01:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
just looking for like medical relief and
 
01:08:43.149 --> 01:08:43.159 align:start position:0%
like who doesn't like to buy in bulk so
 
01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
I'm a big supporter of this bill I I'm
 
01:08:46.669 --> 01:08:46.679 align:start position:0%
also not an expert in this field I I'm
 
01:08:48.189 --> 01:08:48.199 align:start position:0%
not a user uh there's people in my
 
01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
family that are um and they may or may
 
01:08:52.950 --> 01:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
not go to Massachusetts to just do it to
 
01:08:55.309 --> 01:08:55.319 align:start position:0%
deal to get around the freaking hassle
 
01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
um I live on the mass border so it's
 
01:08:58.990 --> 01:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
convenient for me but these I hear about
 
01:09:00.269 --> 01:09:00.279 align:start position:0%
these guys up in the north country and
 
01:09:01.630 --> 01:09:01.640 align:start position:0%
like having to drive like an hour or
 
01:09:04.749 --> 01:09:04.759 align:start position:0%
something seems absolutely egregious um
 
01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
that's that's what I got I'm not sure if
 
01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
I can really answer any questions but
 
01:09:10.789 --> 01:09:10.799 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take
 
01:09:16.189 --> 01:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
you the chair uh calls The Honorable Suk
 
01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:29.669 align:start position:0%
you the chair uh calls The Honorable Suk
Homa

01:09:29.669 --> 01:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:31.789 --> 01:09:31.799 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for allowing me to
 
01:09:34.829 --> 01:09:34.839 align:start position:0%
speak on this bill today um I'm here on
 
01:09:36.309 --> 01:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
behalf of Sam New Hampshire which is a
 
01:09:38.229 --> 01:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
drug prevention group a National Drug
 
01:09:40.189 --> 01:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
prevention group I'm the state chairman
 
01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
uh the issues that we have with hb10 is
 
01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
explaining the limit of medical medical
 
01:09:46.709 --> 01:09:46.719 align:start position:0%
marijuana possession from 2 to 4 ounces
 
01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
is a significant increase and one of the
 
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
reasons that we keep hearing is so that
 
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh we can reduce travel time which is a
 
01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
very Noble goal for people who may be
 
01:09:57.870 --> 01:09:57.880 align:start position:0%
suffer uffing in pain uh the issue that
 
01:09:59.910 --> 01:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
that I have is that we're not actually
 
01:10:01.950 --> 01:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
increasing the number of days that go
 
01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
along with this um if if the real goal
 
01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
is to reduce the amount of trips to
 
01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana facilities then it
 
01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
this bill should also come with a
 
01:10:14.350 --> 01:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
lengthening of the days so if we're
 
01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
doubling the amount of marijuana then we
 
01:10:18.870 --> 01:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
should double the amount of days in
 
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
state St in the state statute um we did
 
01:10:23.229 --> 01:10:23.239 align:start position:0%
hear that sometimes people need
 
01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
additional cannabis and things like that
 
01:10:27.510 --> 01:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
but right now now um we haven't I
 
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
haven't seen any data that has um been
 
01:10:32.430 --> 01:10:32.440 align:start position:0%
given to anyone on this committee that
 
01:10:33.990 --> 01:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
actually gives hard data on that as
 
01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
opposed to anecdotal sometimes people
 
01:10:38.990 --> 01:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
like to use more cannabis um many states
 
01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
to include New Hampshire like I was
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
saying they they list a frequency for
 
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana purchases overall the
 
01:10:47.470 --> 01:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
majority of medical marijuana states set
 
01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
their limit at 2.5 ounces or less that's
 
01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
the majority uh there are a sizable uh
 
01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
handful of legalized States who do it
 
01:10:57.550 --> 01:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
kind of an interesting way is they
 
01:10:59.350 --> 01:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
actually do it based off of a one month
 
01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
supply or a 30 or a 60-day supply but
 
01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
they do that with the doctor actually
 
01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
prescribing the amount so they don't
 
01:11:08.910 --> 01:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
actually put a limit on how much
 
01:11:10.750 --> 01:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis people say they say that the
 
01:11:12.870 --> 01:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
their doctor has to prescribe an amount
 
01:11:14.149 --> 01:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
and then they're allowed to have a one
 
01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
month or whatever Supply so that's kind
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
of an interesting way to think about
 
01:11:19.830 --> 01:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
that if that's truly an issue that might
 
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
be a novel way to approach that um to
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
determine the the depth of the medical
 
01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
marijuana user accessibility in New
 
01:11:28.030 --> 01:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I really believe that
 
01:11:29.630 --> 01:11:29.640 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis oversight or the
 
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
Cannabis program should document the
 
01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
number of users who are significantly
 
01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
affected and uh that's all I have to say
 
01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
on this bill I did want to say on
 
01:11:38.830 --> 01:11:38.840 align:start position:0%
another note I won't be able to be here
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
all day but there are a number of
 
01:11:42.669 --> 01:11:42.679 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana bills that are being
 
01:11:44.510 --> 01:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
heard yesterday that were heard
 
01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
yesterday in the Health and Human
 
01:11:47.709 --> 01:11:47.719 align:start position:0%
Services committee one of the things
 
01:11:50.350 --> 01:11:50.360 align:start position:0%
that uh is relative for you all is today
 
01:11:52.270 --> 01:11:52.280 align:start position:0%
is I would really request that you look
 
01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
at the totality of all these bills
 
01:11:56.590 --> 01:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
because yesterday I there was a bill
 
01:12:02.669 --> 01:12:02.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
um allow homegrown for medical marijuana
 
01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
and what you'll hear later today is this
 
01:12:11.790 --> 01:12:11.800 align:start position:0%
in this homegrown bill it had no
 
01:12:15.149 --> 01:12:15.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement no inspection it was totally
 
01:12:18.629 --> 01:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
on the honor System it um also kind of
 
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
hamstrung law enforcement in their
 
01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
ability if they say if they suspect
 
01:12:24.790 --> 01:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
somebody who is growing something
 
01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
illegal they have a lot of difficulty
 
01:12:29.189 --> 01:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
actually trying to get the to find out
 
01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
if that person's under the program or
 
01:12:33.790 --> 01:12:33.800 align:start position:0%
not um you'll be hearing later today HB
 
01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
380 which was removes the felony for
 
01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
selling mirical marijuana to
 
01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
non-designated individuals I just want
 
01:12:41.149 --> 01:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
to let you know that yesterday in
 
01:12:43.709 --> 01:12:43.719 align:start position:0%
testimony one of the things that I heard
 
01:12:45.709 --> 01:12:45.719 align:start position:0%
that why homegrown was a good idea was
 
01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
because we already have these
 
01:12:48.629 --> 01:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
Protections in place we already have
 
01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
this this there's no problem you know
 
01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
there's enough deterrence but you're
 
01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
listening to a bill today that actually
 
01:12:56.350 --> 01:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
is removing that one protection so I'm
 
01:12:57.950 --> 01:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
just giving you I'm just encouraging you
 
01:12:59.189 --> 01:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
if you could when you're considering
 
01:13:01.189 --> 01:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
your bills to look at the totality of it
 
01:13:03.550 --> 01:13:03.560 align:start position:0%
because uh Sam New Hampshire is kind of
 
01:13:07.510 --> 01:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
concerned at the amount of play on the
 
01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
uh to undermine some of the safeguarding
 
01:13:11.629 --> 01:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
law enforcement protections that are in
 
01:13:12.870 --> 01:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
right now for the medical marijuana
 
01:13:15.149 --> 01:13:15.159 align:start position:0%
program does anyone have any questions
 
01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer them thank you do
 
01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
you or does your organization have any
 
01:13:23.110 --> 01:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
um data with regard to the amounts of
 
01:13:26.430 --> 01:13:26.440 align:start position:0%
marijuana that um medical pay Pati use
 
01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
in other words in the other states what
 
01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
are they what what are they using the
 
01:13:32.430 --> 01:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
only data that I have and I'll I'll send
 
01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
you all the electronic testimony that I
 
01:13:36.550 --> 01:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
have later um the only data that I have
 
01:13:39.470 --> 01:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
is data on what other states do for
 
01:13:41.950 --> 01:13:41.960 align:start position:0%
their medical marijuana program what's
 
01:13:45.310 --> 01:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
the highest um gosh the highest is8
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
ounces and I think that's like
 
01:13:50.990 --> 01:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
California Oregon one of those too um
 
01:13:53.189 --> 01:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
that was the highest but for the most
 
01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
part and that's in a month that's just
 
01:13:57.910 --> 01:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
in general they I don't I from what I
 
01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
could tell they didn't have a a time
 
01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
limit on it it was just sort of a
 
01:14:05.910 --> 01:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
possession um so in most of them I
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
counted up the number of states who in
 
01:14:09.550 --> 01:14:09.560 align:start position:0%
the ounces I did a little chart of like
 
01:14:11.669 --> 01:14:11.679 align:start position:0%
okay who has what ounces and things like
 
01:14:14.590 --> 01:14:14.600 align:start position:0%
that and like I said the majority about
 
01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
I would say 60% were 2.5 ounces or less
 
01:14:20.189 --> 01:14:20.199 align:start position:0%
um yesterday we heard in the Health and
 
01:14:22.189 --> 01:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
Human Services Community uh committee
 
01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
somebody testified that that hom grow is
 
01:14:27.629 --> 01:14:27.639 align:start position:0%
legal in other states and it's not it's
 
01:14:29.950 --> 01:14:29.960 align:start position:0%
not legal in all other states um there's
 
01:14:33.110 --> 01:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
actually kind of caps on that as well so
 
01:14:34.990 --> 01:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
um that if you happen to hear that today
 
01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:37.400 align:start position:0%
that's not a actual fact you have data
 
01:14:39.550 --> 01:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
that we could I'd be happy to share with
 
01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:42.280 align:start position:0%
committee sir yes sir thank you any
 
01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
questions see oh yeah representative
 
01:14:46.830 --> 01:14:46.840 align:start position:0%
share yes sir just to F just to follow
 
01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
up on what uh the chair said um I'd love
 
01:14:51.550 --> 01:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
to see the little chart you did I think
 
01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
that'd be very helpful for the committee
 
01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
great I will I'll pass that along thank
 
01:14:57.550 --> 01:14:57.560 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
01:15:02.510 --> 01:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you heie the chair recognizes
 
01:15:22.990 --> 01:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
Brown sorry sorry about that uh
 
01:15:28.110 --> 01:15:28.120 align:start position:0%
representative kerk unfortunately
 
01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
couldn't be here to join us today so he
 
01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
did have testimony that he wanted me to
 
01:15:46.990 --> 01:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:50.470 --> 01:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
him sorry so my name is Heather Marie
 
01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
Brown and I actually am the patient
 
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
representative for the therapeutic
 
01:15:58.149 --> 01:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
cannabis medical oversight board I also
 
01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
serve as the alternate chair the reason
 
01:16:03.669 --> 01:16:03.679 align:start position:0%
I'm here today instead of Jerry is
 
01:16:05.790 --> 01:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that he felt and we
 
01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
all felt that I could give a better
 
01:16:10.750 --> 01:16:10.760 align:start position:0%
perspective on this since it is myself
 
01:16:12.750 --> 01:16:12.760 align:start position:0%
and the patient population within the
 
01:16:14.189 --> 01:16:14.199 align:start position:0%
state that this
 
01:16:18.030 --> 01:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
impacts um we are in unanimous support
 
01:16:20.590 --> 01:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
of this bill we were in support of it
 
01:16:22.709 --> 01:16:22.719 align:start position:0%
before when it had a different number
 
01:16:24.950 --> 01:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
and previously came before you and we
 
01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
are still in unanimous support of this
 
01:16:32.110 --> 01:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
bill uh we have come to realize over the
 
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
last few years that cost and
 
01:16:37.830 --> 01:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
affordability and accessibility are
 
01:16:40.590 --> 01:16:40.600 align:start position:0%
major hurdles for some of our patients
 
01:16:43.629 --> 01:16:43.639 align:start position:0%
also what we've come to realize and also
 
01:16:46.590 --> 01:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
myself from personal experience is that
 
01:16:49.070 --> 01:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
I has a patient consumed cannabis in
 
01:16:51.629 --> 01:16:51.639 align:start position:0%
multiple ways there are times throughout
 
01:16:53.669 --> 01:16:53.679 align:start position:0%
the day where it is appropriate for me
 
01:16:56.310 --> 01:16:56.320 align:start position:0%
to sit down and inhale my cannabis
 
01:16:58.189 --> 01:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
through smoking and there are other
 
01:16:59.870 --> 01:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
times throughout the day where it is
 
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
inappropriate of me to do so so I um
 
01:17:06.470 --> 01:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
utilize Edibles or ures or things of
 
01:17:11.629 --> 01:17:11.639 align:start position:0%
that nature um the thing that comes with
 
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
that is for myself I cannot afford to go
 
01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
to the dispensary and to purchase
 
01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
Edibles and to purchase tinctures and to
 
01:17:25.390 --> 01:17:25.400 align:start position:0%
purchase the items that I need to carry
 
01:17:28.629 --> 01:17:28.639 align:start position:0%
me throughout the month but if I was
 
01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
able to purchase 4 ounces of cannabis at
 
01:17:35.910 --> 01:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
one time I could go home and I can make
 
01:17:38.510 --> 01:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
my butter and I can make my oil and I
 
01:17:41.629 --> 01:17:41.639 align:start position:0%
can make my tinkerers and then I am all
 
01:17:45.709 --> 01:17:45.719 align:start position:0%
set for a month of that along with what
 
01:17:50.629 --> 01:17:50.639 align:start position:0%
I need for flower um to take if I follow
 
01:17:53.149 --> 01:17:53.159 align:start position:0%
the law by the letter of it I have to
 
01:17:56.709 --> 01:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
pick up 2 ounces I have to wait 10 days
 
01:17:59.229 --> 01:17:59.239 align:start position:0%
to pick up two more ounces there's 20
 
01:18:02.189 --> 01:18:02.199 align:start position:0%
days of the month now technically I'm in
 
01:18:04.590 --> 01:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
violation of the law because I have 4
 
01:18:07.790 --> 01:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
ounces sitting at home and then I take
 
01:18:10.350 --> 01:18:10.360 align:start position:0%
that 4 ounces I make my butter I make my
 
01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
tinure and I have 30 days worth of what
 
01:18:17.629 --> 01:18:17.639 align:start position:0%
I need to help me get through um I don't
 
01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
think that that's appropriate I don't
 
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
think that it's right I don't think that
 
01:18:23.790 --> 01:18:23.800 align:start position:0%
at any point in time should I have to
 
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
feel like I'm skirting around the law or
 
01:18:29.910 --> 01:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
violating the law or that I'm a criminal
 
01:18:31.870 --> 01:18:31.880 align:start position:0%
I fought very long and hard to take
 
01:18:34.669 --> 01:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
control of my Healthcare and I am
 
01:18:37.870 --> 01:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
extremely proud of where I am today um
 
01:18:40.189 --> 01:18:40.199 align:start position:0%
you know you you watch me walk over here
 
01:18:42.669 --> 01:18:42.679 align:start position:0%
I'm 47 years old I'm a mother of three
 
01:18:45.229 --> 01:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
children if I didn't have my therapeutic
 
01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis I would already be in a
 
01:18:50.669 --> 01:18:50.679 align:start position:0%
wheelchair um I think that the change in
 
01:18:54.510 --> 01:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
the law is extremely long overdue and I
 
01:18:57.669 --> 01:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
think that it has many many benefits to
 
01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
our patients because again yes
 
01:19:04.189 --> 01:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
Transportation uh can be an issue uh
 
01:19:06.510 --> 01:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
distance can be an issue cost and
 
01:19:09.030 --> 01:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
affordability can be an issue but at the
 
01:19:11.790 --> 01:19:11.800 align:start position:0%
end of the day it's really on how each
 
01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
individual patient chooses to treat
 
01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
their ailments for some it's inhalation
 
01:19:19.790 --> 01:19:19.800 align:start position:0%
2 ounces of flour every 10 days may be
 
01:19:22.629 --> 01:19:22.639 align:start position:0%
appropriate for others it involves
 
01:19:25.070 --> 01:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
consumption through other means and it's
 
01:19:27.390 --> 01:19:27.400 align:start position:0%
not appropriate and we need the larger
 
01:19:30.510 --> 01:19:30.520 align:start position:0%
amounts um you know I know this is some
 
01:19:34.590 --> 01:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
math but when I take 4 ounces of
 
01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
cannabis and I go to make oil with it
 
01:19:40.510 --> 01:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
there technically is only a 30% return
 
01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
on it so if you're trying to do that
 
01:19:45.550 --> 01:19:45.560 align:start position:0%
with 1 o or 2 O you're getting
 
01:19:49.149 --> 01:19:49.159 align:start position:0%
absolutely nothing back which will mean
 
01:19:52.270 --> 01:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
that you have no sustainable amount to
 
01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
get you any farther than you know the 10
 
01:19:58.270 --> 01:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
days or the 15 days with the 4 o you
 
01:20:01.390 --> 01:20:01.400 align:start position:0%
have a much greater return and I'm able
 
01:20:03.790 --> 01:20:03.800 align:start position:0%
to treat my illness my ailments
 
01:20:06.149 --> 01:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
appropriately and for a longer duration
 
01:20:09.149 --> 01:20:09.159 align:start position:0%
of time therefore saving myself money
 
01:20:12.669 --> 01:20:12.679 align:start position:0%
saving myself time and travel and saving
 
01:20:14.470 --> 01:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
you know like I said I have three
 
01:20:16.910 --> 01:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
children so who's going to babysit them
 
01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
while I make a trip off to the
 
01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
dispensary that doesn't come for free so
 
01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
um I think this bill
 
01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
is something that you should definitely
 
01:20:29.790 --> 01:20:29.800 align:start position:0%
pass and definitely support and I I
 
01:20:32.229 --> 01:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
think that it will decrease a lot of the
 
01:20:35.189 --> 01:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
barriers that some of our patients face
 
01:20:38.830 --> 01:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
these days and I do know that we have a
 
01:20:40.750 --> 01:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
wonderful the medical oversight board
 
01:20:43.629 --> 01:20:43.639 align:start position:0%
has a wonderful relationship with the
 
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
dispensaries and um you know we do do
 
01:20:49.669 --> 01:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
annual reports and so forth and although
 
01:20:51.790 --> 01:20:51.800 align:start position:0%
I don't have those numbers on me you are
 
01:20:53.870 --> 01:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
more than welcome to get on our website
 
01:20:56.229 --> 01:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
and we do have have annual reports that
 
01:20:58.709 --> 01:20:58.719 align:start position:0%
give you some of the data that you were
 
01:21:01.470 --> 01:21:01.480 align:start position:0%
asking questions about earlier I also
 
01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
know that if you were to reach out to
 
01:21:05.950 --> 01:21:05.960 align:start position:0%
the dispensaries that the dispensaries
 
01:21:09.550 --> 01:21:09.560 align:start position:0%
would be more than willing to cooperate
 
01:21:11.310 --> 01:21:11.320 align:start position:0%
and and give you answers to some of
 
01:21:13.510 --> 01:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
those questions as well because really
 
01:21:15.110 --> 01:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
they're the ones that work with the
 
01:21:17.950 --> 01:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
patients and see how much is actually
 
01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
being utilized and distributed and you
 
01:21:23.070 --> 01:21:23.080 align:start position:0%
know Edibles versus flowers and things
 
01:21:26.750 --> 01:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
like that so I do hope that you will
 
01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
vote and support this bill and pass it
 
01:21:32.229 --> 01:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
on to to the next level so because I
 
01:21:34.510 --> 01:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
still should not feel like I'm am doing
 
01:21:36.990 --> 01:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
something wrong when all I'm trying to
 
01:21:39.910 --> 01:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
do is maintain my health and my ability
 
01:21:42.590 --> 01:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
to be a productive member of society and
 
01:21:44.270 --> 01:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
a contributing member here in New
 
01:21:46.629 --> 01:21:46.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so thank you very much if you
 
01:21:48.149 --> 01:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
have any
 
01:21:51.030 --> 01:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um about how how
 
01:21:53.590 --> 01:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
long will that 4 ounces last you u based
 
01:21:56.629 --> 01:21:56.639 align:start position:0%
on your personal therapy that you need
 
01:22:00.030 --> 01:22:00.040 align:start position:0%
uh for myself if I can obtain 4 ounces
 
01:22:03.070 --> 01:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
at one time I'm able to produce enough
 
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
butter and enough oil and enough
 
01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
tincture that I will that I'm able to
 
01:22:13.950 --> 01:22:13.960 align:start position:0%
get through the month with that I do
 
01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
still need the accessibility to the
 
01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
flower as well because as I said there
 
01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
are certain times of the day or certain
 
01:22:24.790 --> 01:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
conditions where it's more appropriate
 
01:22:27.390 --> 01:22:27.400 align:start position:0%
for me to use the flour versus the
 
01:22:29.070 --> 01:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
Edibles or the
 
01:22:31.830 --> 01:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
tinctures do you find a a difference in
 
01:22:34.189 --> 01:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
the level of therapy you receive from
 
01:22:36.510 --> 01:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
the flower versus for example The Vape
 
01:22:38.510 --> 01:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
cartridges or do you not use those at
 
01:22:43.030 --> 01:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
all I myself do not use the Vape
 
01:22:46.030 --> 01:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
cartridges um I've always just kind of
 
01:22:49.470 --> 01:22:49.480 align:start position:0%
been a natural kind of gal so um you
 
01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
know I U utilize primarily my flow um I
 
01:22:58.430 --> 01:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
have to where all of our T our cannabis
 
01:23:00.750 --> 01:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
is tested there are actually certain
 
01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
profiles that I look for in the Cannabis
 
01:23:06.030 --> 01:23:06.040 align:start position:0%
that I select and that includes when I'm
 
01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
using the Cannabis to create Edibles and
 
01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:09.950 align:start position:0%
using the Cannabis to create Edibles and
so

01:23:09.950 --> 01:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:23:12.189 --> 01:23:12.199 align:start position:0%
forth so further
 
01:23:15.510 --> 01:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative um
 
01:23:17.709 --> 01:23:17.719 align:start position:0%
new thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I was just
 
01:23:21.149 --> 01:23:21.159 align:start position:0%
wondering I think it would be um
 
01:23:22.910 --> 01:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
enlightening especially as a therapeutic
 
01:23:25.030 --> 01:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis patient to understand a little
 
01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
bit about um what kind of what is uh the
 
01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
difference in
 
01:23:34.790 --> 01:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
um can you speak to when it is more
 
01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate um to consume an edible in
 
01:23:40.550 --> 01:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
that form
 
01:23:44.030 --> 01:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
medically um so for certain people
 
01:23:48.149 --> 01:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
myself included um I suffer from chronic
 
01:23:51.430 --> 01:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
pain I suffer from PTSD and a few other
 
01:23:53.629 --> 01:23:53.639 align:start position:0%
ailments but those are the two that I
 
01:23:56.870 --> 01:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
received my card for um there are
 
01:24:00.910 --> 01:24:00.920 align:start position:0%
instances where um we'll say a panic
 
01:24:03.430 --> 01:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
attack may start sitting in my anxiety
 
01:24:06.709 --> 01:24:06.719 align:start position:0%
may start increasing um at that time I
 
01:24:10.470 --> 01:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
would utilize a flower to smoke and
 
01:24:13.189 --> 01:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
inhale because it is a much faster
 
01:24:16.189 --> 01:24:16.199 align:start position:0%
acting way to get it into my system and
 
01:24:19.229 --> 01:24:19.239 align:start position:0%
it has almost instant effect and helps
 
01:24:22.350 --> 01:24:22.360 align:start position:0%
to bring me back down so I can function
 
01:24:25.830 --> 01:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
um there are times most of the time I
 
01:24:30.310 --> 01:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
utilize um Edibles because they take a
 
01:24:32.870 --> 01:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
little bit longer to affect uh to take
 
01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
effect but they also last a little bit
 
01:24:39.229 --> 01:24:39.239 align:start position:0%
longer too as well um so I like to view
 
01:24:41.629 --> 01:24:41.639 align:start position:0%
them almost like when you when you're an
 
01:24:44.590 --> 01:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
asmatic and you have a rescue inhaler
 
01:24:46.030 --> 01:24:46.040 align:start position:0%
and then you have your regular
 
01:24:48.830 --> 01:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
medication that you take each day you
 
01:24:51.030 --> 01:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
know so that's that's kind of how I
 
01:24:55.390 --> 01:24:55.400 align:start position:0%
utilize cannabis so when I like say for
 
01:24:59.550 --> 01:24:59.560 align:start position:0%
today I I I can't I can't utilize
 
01:25:01.669 --> 01:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
inhalation methods here no matter how
 
01:25:04.109 --> 01:25:04.119 align:start position:0%
nervous or anxious I am yeah we would
 
01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
prefer that you
 
01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
didn't so you know it would be
 
01:25:10.870 --> 01:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
completely inappropriate of me to walk
 
01:25:12.590 --> 01:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
outside the state house and light up a
 
01:25:14.910 --> 01:25:14.920 align:start position:0%
blunt and say hallelujah and come back
 
01:25:18.910 --> 01:25:18.920 align:start position:0%
in but before I left my home I did make
 
01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
sure that I was able to um have a little
 
01:25:26.550 --> 01:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
bit of butter on my toast to make sure
 
01:25:28.910 --> 01:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
that my pain would be under control and
 
01:25:30.870 --> 01:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
to make sure that any of the little
 
01:25:32.910 --> 01:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
butterflies I may or may not have
 
01:25:36.510 --> 01:25:36.520 align:start position:0%
throughout the day um are kept at Bay
 
01:25:38.830 --> 01:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
and as you can see even for somebody
 
01:25:41.310 --> 01:25:41.320 align:start position:0%
that's on cannabis and that just
 
01:25:46.270 --> 01:25:46.280 align:start position:0%
consumed a few hours ago I'm not wacky
 
01:25:49.550 --> 01:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not doing anything disrespectful I'm
 
01:25:52.350 --> 01:25:52.360 align:start position:0%
normal I'm functioning I'm able to walk
 
01:25:55.870 --> 01:25:55.880 align:start position:0%
over here and sit down and you know
 
01:25:58.950 --> 01:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
share my experiences with you and that's
 
01:26:00.910 --> 01:26:00.920 align:start position:0%
not different from any other patient
 
01:26:04.030 --> 01:26:04.040 align:start position:0%
that we have on the program so all all
 
01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
we want to do is be able to take our
 
01:26:09.669 --> 01:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
health into our own control and and be
 
01:26:12.109 --> 01:26:12.119 align:start position:0%
able to do what we need to do so that we
 
01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:14.639 align:start position:0%
can be functioning members of society so
 
01:26:16.830 --> 01:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
that we can interact with everyone and
 
01:26:19.470 --> 01:26:19.480 align:start position:0%
be the best that we possibly can be and
 
01:26:21.310 --> 01:26:21.320 align:start position:0%
change our future
 
01:26:24.669 --> 01:26:24.679 align:start position:0%
outcomes thank you appreciate that um
 
01:26:28.390 --> 01:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
one one last question for me um how
 
01:26:29.790 --> 01:26:29.800 align:start position:0%
often would it be that you would
 
01:26:31.550 --> 01:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
actually be driving around with that
 
01:26:34.149 --> 01:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
much product with you 4 ounces I mean
 
01:26:36.390 --> 01:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be the case would it it
 
01:26:39.430 --> 01:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
for me specifically once a month I I
 
01:26:42.270 --> 01:26:42.280 align:start position:0%
would utilize that for once a month I
 
01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
would go I would pick up my 4 ounces I
 
01:26:48.109 --> 01:26:48.119 align:start position:0%
would go home I would make whatever I
 
01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
needed to make in 10 days I would go
 
01:26:54.590 --> 01:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
back to make sure I had flour that I
 
01:26:56.990 --> 01:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
needed for the rest of the month and I
 
01:26:59.550 --> 01:26:59.560 align:start position:0%
would be okay it would cut my dispensary
 
01:27:04.229 --> 01:27:04.239 align:start position:0%
trips down over half I would save money
 
01:27:06.750 --> 01:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
I would not have to make the decision do
 
01:27:09.550 --> 01:27:09.560 align:start position:0%
I want to cross the border today because
 
01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
yes that may be illegal but
 
01:27:14.149 --> 01:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
unfortunately sometimes our patients are
 
01:27:16.270 --> 01:27:16.280 align:start position:0%
actually driven to that point where they
 
01:27:18.189 --> 01:27:18.199 align:start position:0%
are crossing the border they are
 
01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
purchasing cannabis in other states and
 
01:27:22.910 --> 01:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
they're risking prosecution and jail
 
01:27:25.189 --> 01:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
time coming back over the border just so
 
01:27:27.390 --> 01:27:27.400 align:start position:0%
they can be able to treat themselves
 
01:27:29.470 --> 01:27:29.480 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't that shouldn't be a
 
01:27:32.590 --> 01:27:32.600 align:start position:0%
problem and it shouldn't be you know
 
01:27:34.270 --> 01:27:34.280 align:start position:0%
something that we encourage and
 
01:27:36.430 --> 01:27:36.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately unless we increase The
 
01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
Possession limits it's almost like the
 
01:27:40.270 --> 01:27:40.280 align:start position:0%
state is encouraging that type of
 
01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:42.400 align:start position:0%
behavior and I don't think that's what
 
01:27:44.550 --> 01:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
the state intended to
 
01:27:47.910 --> 01:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
do thank you very much oh yeah M uh
 
01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:49.590 align:start position:0%
do thank you very much oh yeah M uh
represent

01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:27:52.950 --> 01:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
Mel thank you for taking taking my
 
01:27:56.470 --> 01:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
question and and I apologize for my
 
01:27:59.229 --> 01:27:59.239 align:start position:0%
ignorance on this subject and it might
 
01:28:03.629 --> 01:28:03.639 align:start position:0%
be too personal but in your case MH
 
01:28:09.189 --> 01:28:09.199 align:start position:0%
where you purchase uh 4 oz plus per
 
01:28:12.149 --> 01:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
month how much does that cost you for
 
01:28:12.159 --> 01:28:13.390 align:start position:0%
month how much does that cost you for
your

01:28:13.390 --> 01:28:13.400 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:14.950 align:start position:0%
your
medication

01:28:14.950 --> 01:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
medication
 
01:28:17.310 --> 01:28:17.320 align:start position:0%
oh through the New Hampshire
 
01:28:20.470 --> 01:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
dispensaries if I have to do it 2 ounces
 
01:28:25.350 --> 01:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
at a time I am potentially looking at
 
01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
yes I I am not going to say yes or no
 
01:28:39.709 --> 01:28:39.719 align:start position:0%
but I am going to say that I am one of
 
01:28:41.950 --> 01:28:41.960 align:start position:0%
those patients that maybe once or twice
 
01:28:44.350 --> 01:28:44.360 align:start position:0%
has been tempted to go through other
 
01:28:46.750 --> 01:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
means and cross state borders just to
 
01:28:48.189 --> 01:28:48.199 align:start position:0%
make sure
 
01:28:51.629 --> 01:28:51.639 align:start position:0%
that I can maintain my level of Health
 
01:28:54.669 --> 01:28:54.679 align:start position:0%
needed to be a functioning member
 
01:28:56.229 --> 01:28:56.239 align:start position:0%
to be there for my
 
01:28:59.750 --> 01:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
children followup Mr
 
01:29:03.669 --> 01:29:03.679 align:start position:0%
chairman cannabis is available outside
 
01:29:07.790 --> 01:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
the dispensaries on the streets MH how
 
01:29:09.629 --> 01:29:09.639 align:start position:0%
much would it cost you if you were able
 
01:29:12.669 --> 01:29:12.679 align:start position:0%
to purchase it that way do you have any
 
01:29:17.870 --> 01:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
idea I unfortunately do and it is part
 
01:29:19.950 --> 01:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
of my language a hell of a lot cheaper
 
01:29:22.550 --> 01:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately through the black market
 
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
but as a patient I know that the black
 
01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:28.639 align:start position:0%
market is unregulated I know that there
 
01:29:32.350 --> 01:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
is a possibility that I am not getting
 
01:29:35.310 --> 01:29:35.320 align:start position:0%
something that is clean or that is safe
 
01:29:38.149 --> 01:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
or that I should be even putting in my
 
01:29:41.870 --> 01:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
body so that is not a solution
 
01:29:45.470 --> 01:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
thankfully that I have chosen to take I
 
01:29:48.109 --> 01:29:48.119 align:start position:0%
I have thought about it once or twice
 
01:29:50.910 --> 01:29:50.920 align:start position:0%
but if I'm trying to control my health
 
01:29:52.870 --> 01:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
care and I'm trying to provide the best
 
01:29:55.990 --> 01:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
health that I can for myself then I need
 
01:29:58.790 --> 01:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
to be very careful of where I do
 
01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:02.440 align:start position:0%
purchase my cannabis so I choose to
 
01:30:05.229 --> 01:30:05.239 align:start position:0%
purchase it from dispensaries and
 
01:30:07.910 --> 01:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
reputable sources that I know my
 
01:30:10.709 --> 01:30:10.719 align:start position:0%
medication is being tested I know that
 
01:30:12.669 --> 01:30:12.679 align:start position:0%
what I'm receiving is clean and I know
 
01:30:15.709 --> 01:30:15.719 align:start position:0%
that I'm not going to get sick from it
 
01:30:17.109 --> 01:30:17.119 align:start position:0%
one more
 
01:30:21.870 --> 01:30:21.880 align:start position:0%
followup you said with respect to on the
 
01:30:24.390 --> 01:30:24.400 align:start position:0%
street you said it's a heck of a lot
 
01:30:29.149 --> 01:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
cheaper mhm so versus
 
01:30:33.669 --> 01:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
$1,000 just in an average what would
 
01:30:38.270 --> 01:30:38.280 align:start position:0%
that type of that level of of dosage
 
01:30:42.149 --> 01:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:47.390 --> 01:30:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:50.669 --> 01:30:50.679 align:start position:0%
or well let's just say that there are
 
01:30:53.669 --> 01:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
opportunities available in this state
 
01:30:56.790 --> 01:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
and in other states for that kind of
 
01:31:00.510 --> 01:31:00.520 align:start position:0%
transaction to to happen and you are
 
01:31:02.470 --> 01:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
literally looking at Pennies on the
 
01:31:05.709 --> 01:31:05.719 align:start position:0%
dollar so what an ounce would cost here
 
01:31:06.990 --> 01:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
in New
 
01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can in some instances acquire
 
01:31:13.310 --> 01:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
a half a pound in another area in
 
01:31:16.629 --> 01:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
another state in another market so 1/8
 
01:31:16.639 --> 01:31:17.910 align:start position:0%
another state in another market so 1/8
would

01:31:17.910 --> 01:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:31:22.229 --> 01:31:22.239 align:start position:0%
be so I'm talking about a half a pound
 
01:31:24.669 --> 01:31:24.679 align:start position:0%
versus the cost of an ounce
 
01:31:29.030 --> 01:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:31.229 --> 01:31:31.239 align:start position:0%
gram we'll just stick with a heck of a
 
01:31:34.270 --> 01:31:34.280 align:start position:0%
lot cheaper yes thank you very much for
 
01:31:41.149 --> 01:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:44.910 --> 01:31:44.920 align:start position:0%
Y for the uninformed like
 
01:31:48.310 --> 01:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
myself it seems like there are very few
 
01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:49.990 align:start position:0%
myself it seems like there are very few
um

01:31:49.990 --> 01:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
dispensaries and I see other um
 
01:31:58.870 --> 01:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
retail places that advertise CBD what's
 
01:32:00.430 --> 01:32:00.440 align:start position:0%
what is that all
 
01:32:06.070 --> 01:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
about so CBD can be derived in many
 
01:32:08.510 --> 01:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
different Fashions the CBD that you see
 
01:32:10.790 --> 01:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
advertised that are that's available at
 
01:32:13.350 --> 01:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
the gas station or the health food store
 
01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
or anything like that that is derived
 
01:32:20.070 --> 01:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
from the hemp plant which the federal
 
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
Farm Bill protects which New Hampshire
 
01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
says is okay to do um you know so those
 
01:32:32.270 --> 01:32:32.280 align:start position:0%
facilities are able to get hemp derived
 
01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
CBD and sell them in their locations and
 
01:32:39.070 --> 01:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
give them to people um I am definitely
 
01:32:40.990 --> 01:32:41.000 align:start position:0%
not saying that there is anything wrong
 
01:32:43.229 --> 01:32:43.239 align:start position:0%
with that because there's not sometimes
 
01:32:45.709 --> 01:32:45.719 align:start position:0%
that's what a person needs but most
 
01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
patients rely on what we call the onage
 
01:32:51.750 --> 01:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
effect and that is where CBD THC and
 
01:32:53.470 --> 01:32:53.480 align:start position:0%
every other cannaboid that's in the
 
01:32:53.480 --> 01:32:54.350 align:start position:0%
every other cannaboid that's in the
plant

01:32:54.350 --> 01:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
plant
 
01:32:58.229 --> 01:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
works together so it's not always
 
01:33:01.350 --> 01:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily best for us to utilize only
 
01:33:05.149 --> 01:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
one can cannaboid but in some cases it
 
01:33:07.390 --> 01:33:07.400 align:start position:0%
is so the difference between hemp
 
01:33:10.950 --> 01:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
derived and between medicinal CBD that
 
01:33:14.149 --> 01:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
has actually come from a plant that
 
01:33:17.990 --> 01:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
contains THC is basically the THC amount
 
01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
within the plant I I think it's
 
01:33:27.390 --> 01:33:27.400 align:start position:0%
3% point it's 3% for um in order for the
 
01:33:29.350 --> 01:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
plant to be considered
 
01:33:32.430 --> 01:33:32.440 align:start position:0%
hemp um in the medicinal world the
 
01:33:36.430 --> 01:33:36.440 align:start position:0%
dispensaries when they grow a CBD strain
 
01:33:38.669 --> 01:33:38.679 align:start position:0%
it usually does not meet the hemp
 
01:33:40.709 --> 01:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
standard and because it has a little
 
01:33:43.030 --> 01:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
higher concentration of the THC and the
 
01:33:46.270 --> 01:33:46.280 align:start position:0%
other cannaboids but that is absolutely
 
01:33:47.790 --> 01:33:47.800 align:start position:0%
wonderful and again that's where the
 
01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
Entourage effect comes in and it's
 
01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
available for more people to be able to
 
01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:55.229 align:start position:0%
available for more people to be able to
utilize

01:33:55.229 --> 01:33:55.239 align:start position:0%
utilize
 
01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
thank you it's it's basically um like uh
 
01:34:02.750 --> 01:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
comparing Heen refer to Old
 
01:34:07.229 --> 01:34:07.239 align:start position:0%
duels it's one's one's uh got no alcohol
 
01:34:09.950 --> 01:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
well I I I know about the relationship
 
01:34:13.550 --> 01:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
there so that's an anal that analogy is
 
01:34:17.350 --> 01:34:17.360 align:start position:0%
good but then so how would that work
 
01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
with the comparison between CBD and hemp
 
01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:23.950 align:start position:0%
with the comparison between CBD and hemp
product

01:34:23.950 --> 01:34:23.960 align:start position:0%
product
 
01:34:25.350 --> 01:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
like there's a big difference between
 
01:34:29.229 --> 01:34:29.239 align:start position:0%
Recreation marijuana and and CBD yeah
 
01:34:31.790 --> 01:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
CBD has there is some some relationship
 
01:34:35.550 --> 01:34:35.560 align:start position:0%
between CBD and hemp yeah so would that
 
01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
be as great for both of them or no the
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
the the one that you would get at like a
 
01:34:43.070 --> 01:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
convenience store it's my understanding
 
01:34:46.910 --> 01:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
it um it's it's like one ingredient of
 
01:34:49.870 --> 01:34:49.880 align:start position:0%
the hemp plant the part that doesn't
 
01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
have the uh hallucinogenic effect or the
 
01:34:54.229 --> 01:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
painkilling effect
 
01:34:57.870 --> 01:34:57.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's more of um it's considered
 
01:35:00.350 --> 01:35:00.360 align:start position:0%
more of like a a supplement type thing
 
01:35:01.990 --> 01:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
but in all of the products you get it
 
01:35:04.830 --> 01:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
from that combination yes right it's but
 
01:35:06.870 --> 01:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
the combination has very small
 
01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
quantities of some of it and it has
 
01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
larger quantity of the CB okay great
 
01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:13.229 align:start position:0%
larger quantity of the CB okay great
thank

01:35:13.229 --> 01:35:13.239 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
you um no further questions thank
 
01:35:19.669 --> 01:35:19.679 align:start position:0%
you I if it's all right I just would
 
01:35:22.109 --> 01:35:22.119 align:start position:0%
like to say thank you so much and I do
 
01:35:24.270 --> 01:35:24.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate the questions
 
01:35:26.310 --> 01:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
um I think that this is an opportunity
 
01:35:28.470 --> 01:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
for all of us to be able to learn
 
01:35:30.709 --> 01:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
something new and so I thank you for
 
01:35:33.750 --> 01:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
your open mindness thank
 
01:35:37.430 --> 01:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
you um to chair um calls The Honorable
 
01:35:44.830 --> 01:35:44.840 align:start position:0%

Hannah good morning uh thank you for
 
01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
listening to us today uh my name is Joe

01:35:59.430 --> 01:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
the time uh and I'm also on The Advisory
 
01:36:00.830 --> 01:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
board for the New Hampshire cannabis
 
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
Association I'm in favor of this bill um
 
01:36:04.510 --> 01:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to go into too many of the
 
01:36:05.870 --> 01:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
reasons we heard because we've heard
 
01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
about the the travel times and you know
 
01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
I think most of us have a Costco card or
 
01:36:11.070 --> 01:36:11.080 align:start position:0%
a BJ's Club card so we understand buying
 
01:36:13.590 --> 01:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
in bulk saves money but I don't think uh
 
01:36:16.229 --> 01:36:16.239 align:start position:0%
some of us realize um some may I I
 
01:36:17.950 --> 01:36:17.960 align:start position:0%
realized this in the last few years how
 
01:36:19.030 --> 01:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
difficult it is for some people just to
 
01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
leave the house sometimes because of
 
01:36:22.990 --> 01:36:23.000 align:start position:0%
their medical conditions um you know I
 
01:36:25.550 --> 01:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
had a cousin who was was agoraphobic you
 
01:36:27.310 --> 01:36:27.320 align:start position:0%
know with fear of public places going my
 
01:36:28.830 --> 01:36:28.840 align:start position:0%
dad thought I was angor phobic I'm like
 
01:36:30.390 --> 01:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
it's not sweaters it's she didn't want
 
01:36:34.030 --> 01:36:34.040 align:start position:0%
to go outside but um I I had severe back
 
01:36:35.950 --> 01:36:35.960 align:start position:0%
pain and I wasn't able to leave um I was
 
01:36:37.629 --> 01:36:37.639 align:start position:0%
able to but it was extremely difficult
 
01:36:38.629 --> 01:36:38.639 align:start position:0%
for me I actually went out and bought
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
five pairs of sandals because I couldn't
 
01:36:42.430 --> 01:36:42.440 align:start position:0%
tie my shoes for a while um driving was
 
01:36:44.109 --> 01:36:44.119 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult I just had to drop
 
01:36:45.550 --> 01:36:45.560 align:start position:0%
my son back off of college and it was a
 
01:36:48.550 --> 01:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
4-Hour Drive each way and I was I'm much
 
01:36:50.030 --> 01:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
better now but it was a very difficult
 
01:36:52.830 --> 01:36:52.840 align:start position:0%
thing for a seemingly healthy young
 
01:36:54.189 --> 01:36:54.199 align:start position:0%
person to do
 
01:36:56.470 --> 01:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
um you know someone who has a chronic
 
01:36:58.669 --> 01:36:58.679 align:start position:0%
pain condition uh or other chronic
 
01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
illnesses like cancer or you know and
 
01:37:02.709 --> 01:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
any other person who may be in Hospice
 
01:37:05.669 --> 01:37:05.679 align:start position:0%
Care leaving the house is not an option
 
01:37:07.750 --> 01:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh and if it is it's it's going to be
 
01:37:11.350 --> 01:37:11.360 align:start position:0%
very planned very focused and it's it's
 
01:37:13.109 --> 01:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
much a bigger bigger deal than people
 
01:37:13.119 --> 01:37:14.990 align:start position:0%
much a bigger bigger deal than people
think

01:37:14.990 --> 01:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:37:17.350 --> 01:37:17.360 align:start position:0%
um also we heard from you know people
 
01:37:19.149 --> 01:37:19.159 align:start position:0%
like Heather um they need to make their
 
01:37:20.870 --> 01:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
tinctures or edibles we don't want
 
01:37:22.750 --> 01:37:22.760 align:start position:0%
people to smoke more necessarily from a
 
01:37:24.590 --> 01:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
harm reduction state standpoint it's you
 
01:37:26.910 --> 01:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
know the preferred way of most it's easy
 
01:37:28.270 --> 01:37:28.280 align:start position:0%
people get it it's they know what
 
01:37:30.350 --> 01:37:30.360 align:start position:0%
they're getting right away but sometimes
 
01:37:32.430 --> 01:37:32.440 align:start position:0%
it's better to make edibles for for all
 
01:37:35.270 --> 01:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
kinds of reasons um and also we don't
 
01:37:36.750 --> 01:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
want people on the roads as much you
 
01:37:38.189 --> 01:37:38.199 align:start position:0%
know we want people to dve you know to
 
01:37:39.790 --> 01:37:39.800 align:start position:0%
be we don't want people using substances
 
01:37:41.870 --> 01:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
and being on the roads and most people
 
01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
are trying not to do that but I
 
01:37:44.310 --> 01:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
guarantee there's going to be a
 
01:37:45.510 --> 01:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
percentage of people who drive to the
 
01:37:47.109 --> 01:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
liquor store a little too buzzed or
 
01:37:49.070 --> 01:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
drive to the cannabis store a little too
 
01:37:51.629 --> 01:37:51.639 align:start position:0%
Under the Influence it happens we want
 
01:37:53.109 --> 01:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
to minimize that effect by not having
 
01:37:54.950 --> 01:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
them just drive an hour to these stores
 
01:37:56.510 --> 01:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
or driving out of state they're not
 
01:37:58.270 --> 01:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
going to stop using it if it's really
 
01:37:59.550 --> 01:37:59.560 align:start position:0%
necessary and they're able to get out of
 
01:38:01.310 --> 01:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
the house they're going to go to some
 
01:38:03.910 --> 01:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
other store um if if it's that cheap on
 
01:38:05.310 --> 01:38:05.320 align:start position:0%
the streets we don't want to push people
 
01:38:06.430 --> 01:38:06.440 align:start position:0%
towards the street so if we want to
 
01:38:08.310 --> 01:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
combat the black market keep people safe
 
01:38:10.390 --> 01:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
on the roads protect our environment not
 
01:38:12.310 --> 01:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
waste money not waste gas not waste our
 
01:38:15.070 --> 01:38:15.080 align:start position:0%
time not suffer and not prohibit people
 
01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
who have a medical problem this is not
 
01:38:17.910 --> 01:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
recreational like we've heard a million
 
01:38:19.510 --> 01:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
times if you want recreational you can
 
01:38:21.070 --> 01:38:21.080 align:start position:0%
go to the state liquor store and fill up
 
01:38:23.070 --> 01:38:23.080 align:start position:0%
a tractor trailer full of whiskey that's
 
01:38:25.149 --> 01:38:25.159 align:start position:0%
fine but a medical patient has to have a
 
01:38:26.589 --> 01:38:26.599 align:start position:0%
certain amount and not more because
 
01:38:28.830 --> 01:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
that's bad for whatever I don't know
 
01:38:31.109 --> 01:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
what what they're really um it doesn't
 
01:38:33.189 --> 01:38:33.199 align:start position:0%
make sense this is something that we've
 
01:38:35.350 --> 01:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
admitted as a medication people need it
 
01:38:38.270 --> 01:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
it changes lives it's it drastically
 
01:38:39.709 --> 01:38:39.719 align:start position:0%
transforms many people's lives and if
 
01:38:41.550 --> 01:38:41.560 align:start position:0%
someone needs that much of it it's
 
01:38:44.030 --> 01:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely necessary for them to get it
 
01:38:47.470 --> 01:38:47.480 align:start position:0%
um I've also last point I'll make um not
 
01:38:48.990 --> 01:38:49.000 align:start position:0%
the last one but the second last the
 
01:38:50.950 --> 01:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
I've I've done a lot of time in other
 
01:38:52.350 --> 01:38:52.360 align:start position:0%
disaster zones and I've seen what
 
01:38:54.390 --> 01:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
happens when natural disaster occur I'm
 
01:38:55.910 --> 01:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
not a crazy I don't have a bunker in my
 
01:38:57.510 --> 01:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
backyard I don't have two years worth of
 
01:39:00.350 --> 01:39:00.360 align:start position:0%
Beats and a a barrel but I have I
 
01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:02.159 align:start position:0%
prepare myself for when the snow goes
 
01:39:03.390 --> 01:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
when the power goes out for snow
 
01:39:05.149 --> 01:39:05.159 align:start position:0%
emergencies or disasters I've lived in
 
01:39:06.470 --> 01:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
Florida I've survived many hurricanes I
 
01:39:08.750 --> 01:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
was in Katrina for five weeks doing
 
01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
working with police officers and I
 
01:39:12.669 --> 01:39:12.679 align:start position:0%
noticed not to notice but it was blaring
 
01:39:13.589 --> 01:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest problems I didn't
 
01:39:15.390 --> 01:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
hear about in a disaster and I'm sure
 
01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
it's happening in LA right now all these
 
01:39:19.229 --> 01:39:19.239 align:start position:0%
officers and firefighters they might not
 
01:39:20.149 --> 01:39:20.159 align:start position:0%
be able to have access to their
 
01:39:21.950 --> 01:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
medications I'm not even I'm not talking
 
01:39:23.109 --> 01:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
about cannabis but just in general they
 
01:39:24.990 --> 01:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
might not have access to the medications
 
01:39:26.990 --> 01:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
so if someone's up north that's you know
 
01:39:28.790 --> 01:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
I get snowed in on the Sea Coast you
 
01:39:30.109 --> 01:39:30.119 align:start position:0%
don't think they get snowed in more up
 
01:39:31.629 --> 01:39:31.639 align:start position:0%
north and don't want to go on the roads
 
01:39:33.310 --> 01:39:33.320 align:start position:0%
I don't like driving at night I'm pretty
 
01:39:35.790 --> 01:39:35.800 align:start position:0%
young my eyes aren't that bad yet but
 
01:39:37.390 --> 01:39:37.400 align:start position:0%
you know you don't want people to go out
 
01:39:39.149 --> 01:39:39.159 align:start position:0%
the sun goes down at 3:30 it's Pitch
 
01:39:40.910 --> 01:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
Black it's cold and they're in pain you
 
01:39:43.229 --> 01:39:43.239 align:start position:0%
want to make people go out more often I
 
01:39:45.430 --> 01:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
get annoyed because I have to drive you
 
01:39:46.830 --> 01:39:46.840 align:start position:0%
know four miles to get Chinese food
 
01:39:49.550 --> 01:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
where I live uh you don't want people to
 
01:39:51.229 --> 01:39:51.239 align:start position:0%
have to be in that situation and as far
 
01:39:54.950 --> 01:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
as last thing we we heard a an illusion
 
01:39:56.470 --> 01:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
they mentioned the other committees and
 
01:39:57.750 --> 01:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
bills and I don't like to do this I know
 
01:39:59.109 --> 01:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
it's not allowed but since it happened I
 
01:40:02.149 --> 01:40:02.159 align:start position:0%
figured it'll be okay yeah thanks um
 
01:40:04.550 --> 01:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
appreciate it uh you know about no
 
01:40:06.589 --> 01:40:06.599 align:start position:0%
regulation for hom grow uh and you're
 
01:40:08.510 --> 01:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
going to hear this and it's relative to
 
01:40:10.030 --> 01:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
this because if people were able to grow
 
01:40:13.070 --> 01:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
it at home they wouldn't need as much at
 
01:40:14.830 --> 01:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
the store and most people aren't going
 
01:40:16.350 --> 01:40:16.360 align:start position:0%
to do it it's very difficult I wouldn't
 
01:40:18.229 --> 01:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
plan on it I can barely keep a cactus
 
01:40:20.030 --> 01:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
alive but you can grow two you can Brew
 
01:40:21.709 --> 01:40:21.719 align:start position:0%
200 gallons of beer wine if you have two
 
01:40:23.910 --> 01:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
adults in the house over 21 that's about
 
01:40:27.669 --> 01:40:27.679 align:start position:0%
a sixpack a day and no regulation no
 
01:40:28.950 --> 01:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
oversight when we were on the commission
 
01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
and we asked the Liquor Commission if
 
01:40:32.070 --> 01:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
they do anything about it they're they
 
01:40:33.189 --> 01:40:33.199 align:start position:0%
kind of looked at us like well no it's
 
01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
just Homebrew no one cares it's not a
 
01:40:37.189 --> 01:40:37.199 align:start position:0%
problem there's no big operations going
 
01:40:40.669 --> 01:40:40.679 align:start position:0%
on but if there were people would be
 
01:40:43.990 --> 01:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
getting better you know Med these plants
 
01:40:45.669 --> 01:40:45.679 align:start position:0%
are going to be coming from stores or
 
01:40:46.870 --> 01:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
known Growers so there's going to be a
 
01:40:49.589 --> 01:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
known strain or quantity of uh cannabis
 
01:40:51.270 --> 01:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
if it's going to be diverted and we'll
 
01:40:52.830 --> 01:40:52.840 align:start position:0%
get to that later on the the penalty
 
01:40:56.070 --> 01:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
bills for people in the program but um
 
01:40:57.709 --> 01:40:57.719 align:start position:0%
you know they're getting something
 
01:40:59.629 --> 01:40:59.639 align:start position:0%
that's not corrupted with other drugs or
 
01:41:02.070 --> 01:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
adulterated so I don't recommend it I
 
01:41:03.189 --> 01:41:03.199 align:start position:0%
don't think it should be done but if
 
01:41:04.950 --> 01:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
it's if it's going to happen I'd rather
 
01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
someone get it from from their
 
01:41:09.750 --> 01:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
grandfather or grandmother um and not
 
01:41:12.229 --> 01:41:12.239 align:start position:0%
get it from the street so there's a lot
 
01:41:14.470 --> 01:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
of reasons why people have limited drug
 
01:41:16.350 --> 01:41:16.360 align:start position:0%
quantities in the past and some of them
 
01:41:18.629 --> 01:41:18.639 align:start position:0%
are for safety the number one now public
 
01:41:21.229 --> 01:41:21.239 align:start position:0%
safety aside they're mostly for uh
 
01:41:22.629 --> 01:41:22.639 align:start position:0%
personal safety like we don't want to
 
01:41:24.350 --> 01:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
give someone not that they can easily
 
01:41:25.510 --> 01:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
die from an overdose but most
 
01:41:27.589 --> 01:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
medications that are prescribed a 30-day
 
01:41:29.589 --> 01:41:29.599 align:start position:0%
Supply can kill most people I can list
 
01:41:30.870 --> 01:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
probably 100 drugs off the top of my
 
01:41:32.030 --> 01:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
head that'll probably kill you if you
 
01:41:33.310 --> 01:41:33.320 align:start position:0%
take a 30-day Supply and they give it
 
01:41:36.550 --> 01:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
out like like nothing um so is it to
 
01:41:38.870 --> 01:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
limit other people getting it I I don't
 
01:41:40.510 --> 01:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
know how effective it really is but it's
 
01:41:42.149 --> 01:41:42.159 align:start position:0%
definitely cheaper I would definitely
 
01:41:44.310 --> 01:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
buy in bulk if I could do it I know
 
01:41:46.629 --> 01:41:46.639 align:start position:0%
before Co who bought toilet paper in
 
01:41:48.910 --> 01:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
huge bulk you know so it's hypocritical
 
01:41:50.550 --> 01:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
for me hypocritical for me not to say
 
01:41:51.910 --> 01:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
that people should be allowed to prepare
 
01:41:54.430 --> 01:41:54.440 align:start position:0%
themselves and not be in a position
 
01:41:55.669 --> 01:41:55.679 align:start position:0%
where they're meant to suffer because of
 
01:41:57.510 --> 01:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
an unjust
 
01:42:00.550 --> 01:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
law be happy to take any questions thank
 
01:42:02.070 --> 01:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
you except K2 I just thought that was a
 
01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:04.109 align:start position:0%
you except K2 I just thought that was a
mountain

01:42:04.109 --> 01:42:04.119 align:start position:0%
mountain
 
01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
um 2 ounces yeah so for me that sounds
 
01:42:10.589 --> 01:42:10.599 align:start position:0%
like a real lot is is it um could you
 
01:42:13.070 --> 01:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
give us a a I mean I know it's kind of
 
01:42:14.790 --> 01:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
this etheral thing like how much for
 
01:42:17.470 --> 01:42:17.480 align:start position:0%
each patient um you know I'm going back
 
01:42:19.149 --> 01:42:19.159 align:start position:0%
to the high school days with the bag I
 
01:42:21.189 --> 01:42:21.199 align:start position:0%
mean how two ounces how much is that
 
01:42:22.709 --> 01:42:22.719 align:start position:0%
that sounds like a lot of I mean I I
 
01:42:24.510 --> 01:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
haven't seen it I haven't wor I haven't
 
01:42:26.350 --> 01:42:26.360 align:start position:0%
sat down with a 2 ooun bag since college
 
01:42:30.030 --> 01:42:30.040 align:start position:0%
but uh a lot right it it was quite a bit
 
01:42:31.830 --> 01:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
um and I was I actually asked several
 
01:42:34.350 --> 01:42:34.360 align:start position:0%
people because I don't smoke um
 
01:42:37.350 --> 01:42:37.360 align:start position:0%
and the the question is you know is it a
 
01:42:40.470 --> 01:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
lot it it varies I prescribed opiates to
 
01:42:42.990 --> 01:42:43.000 align:start position:0%
people in my practice uh very sparingly
 
01:42:44.189 --> 01:42:44.199 align:start position:0%
since I was someone in long-term
 
01:42:45.669 --> 01:42:45.679 align:start position:0%
recovery I was very hesitant to do so so
 
01:42:46.910 --> 01:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
I was one of those people who was very
 
01:42:48.750 --> 01:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
cautious about and and this is back when
 
01:42:51.470 --> 01:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
everyone was just handing them out um
 
01:42:52.910 --> 01:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
and even now I probably do less than I
 
01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:53.750 align:start position:0%
and even now I probably do less than I
did

01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:42:56.189 --> 01:42:56.199 align:start position:0%
as far as prescribing but I see people
 
01:42:57.550 --> 01:42:57.560 align:start position:0%
that would come in on a daily basis with
 
01:42:58.990 --> 01:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
enough opiates in their system that
 
01:43:00.790 --> 01:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
could kill three people yeah and they
 
01:43:02.510 --> 01:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
take them like it's nothing and they're
 
01:43:04.189 --> 01:43:04.199 align:start position:0%
functioning I have a friend who's in end
 
01:43:06.030 --> 01:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
of lifeare right now and she's taking
 
01:43:07.589 --> 01:43:07.599 align:start position:0%
enough opiates and she's been driving
 
01:43:10.870 --> 01:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
for 20 years like this yeah F she's
 
01:43:12.950 --> 01:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely you know fine appearing
 
01:43:14.709 --> 01:43:14.719 align:start position:0%
tolerance builds tolerance builds up I'm
 
01:43:16.109 --> 01:43:16.119 align:start position:0%
not saying that you know I don't want to
 
01:43:17.470 --> 01:43:17.480 align:start position:0%
get into the debate about what we should
 
01:43:19.310 --> 01:43:19.320 align:start position:0%
be allowed to drive with under opiates
 
01:43:21.589 --> 01:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
and things but it's happening um whether
 
01:43:23.470 --> 01:43:23.480 align:start position:0%
we know it or not but I think it's
 
01:43:25.510 --> 01:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
important to say that uh you know is 2 O
 
01:43:28.830 --> 01:43:28.840 align:start position:0%
A lot you know someone who's taking
 
01:43:31.470 --> 01:43:31.480 align:start position:0%
enough opiates to kill a large farm
 
01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
animal that's nothing but the opius have
 
01:43:37.350 --> 01:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
a lethal dose all drugs have a and real
 
01:43:39.070 --> 01:43:39.080 align:start position:0%
quick medical background uh you might
 
01:43:40.669 --> 01:43:40.679 align:start position:0%
hear you won't hear this a lot but ld50
 
01:43:43.189 --> 01:43:43.199 align:start position:0%
is a lethal dose 50 that means what
 
01:43:45.669 --> 01:43:45.679 align:start position:0%
dosage a certain drug has to be to kill
 
01:43:47.350 --> 01:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
about half the people so half the people
 
01:43:49.229 --> 01:43:49.239 align:start position:0%
will live maybe not doing well but half
 
01:43:50.669 --> 01:43:50.679 align:start position:0%
the people will probably die at that
 
01:43:53.109 --> 01:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
will die at that dose every drug that's
 
01:43:55.470 --> 01:43:55.480 align:start position:0%
described has that dose I don't know
 
01:43:57.430 --> 01:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
offand what the lethal dose for cannabis
 
01:44:00.470 --> 01:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
is in studies cuz there haven't been any
 
01:44:02.669 --> 01:44:02.679 align:start position:0%
it's it's actually you can't overdose on
 
01:44:05.109 --> 01:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
it you can get sick you can get you know
 
01:44:06.430 --> 01:44:06.440 align:start position:0%
all kinds of weird feelings but no one's
 
01:44:08.629 --> 01:44:08.639 align:start position:0%
going to die from it unless it actually
 
01:44:10.830 --> 01:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
falls now if we I let them have enough
 
01:44:11.870 --> 01:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
that it could fall in their head like a
 
01:44:13.310 --> 01:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
bail of it landing on someone's head
 
01:44:15.310 --> 01:44:15.320 align:start position:0%
from a farm Barn yes that is a lethal
 
01:44:16.870 --> 01:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
dose of cannabis so if you want to know
 
01:44:18.629 --> 01:44:18.639 align:start position:0%
how much cannabis will kill you it's
 
01:44:20.950 --> 01:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
probably the size of a bail of hay um
 
01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
from a height cuz I could probably hold
 
01:44:23.830 --> 01:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
that on my head so it's got to be from a
 
01:44:27.270 --> 01:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
height but you know is that too much I
 
01:44:28.910 --> 01:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
would think it would be an awful lot but
 
01:44:30.270 --> 01:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
for someone with chronic pain or a
 
01:44:32.709 --> 01:44:32.719 align:start position:0%
chronic opiate problem might not be that
 
01:44:34.189 --> 01:44:34.199 align:start position:0%
much at all I know people that do a
 
01:44:36.750 --> 01:44:36.760 align:start position:0%
th000 milligrams of tinctures or edibles
 
01:44:41.750 --> 01:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
a month and that's a lot but um to to
 
01:44:43.830 --> 01:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
get that much flour to make a tinure
 
01:44:47.149 --> 01:44:47.159 align:start position:0%
ebles on your own you'd need more uh and
 
01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
I'd rather see people doing that than
 
01:44:51.870 --> 01:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
getting opiates or other more far more
 
01:44:53.310 --> 01:44:53.320 align:start position:0%
dangerous prescription drugs or
 
01:44:54.870 --> 01:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
non-prescription drugs from the street
 
01:44:57.990 --> 01:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
whatever I know K2 or whatever it is um
 
01:45:00.950 --> 01:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
and and cost is an issue so
 
01:45:03.589 --> 01:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question and sorry
 
01:45:05.189 --> 01:45:05.199 align:start position:0%
for the long answer no thank you that
 
01:45:07.510 --> 01:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
the tolerance thing was actually a good
 
01:45:09.310 --> 01:45:09.320 align:start position:0%
point good um further questions yes
 
01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:11.750 align:start position:0%
point good um further questions yes
represent

01:45:11.750 --> 01:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:45:14.189 --> 01:45:14.199 align:start position:0%
Newman back to the questions I was
 
01:45:15.310 --> 01:45:15.320 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
01:45:18.790 --> 01:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
before in the analogy between regular
 
01:45:20.470 --> 01:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
beer and
 
01:45:23.830 --> 01:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
odules so you have some t
 
01:45:27.709 --> 01:45:27.719 align:start position:0%
um THC in the medical
 
01:45:30.470 --> 01:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
marijuana and you have some in the plant
 
01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:31.990 align:start position:0%
marijuana and you have some in the plant
more

01:45:31.990 --> 01:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:45:35.149 --> 01:45:35.159 align:start position:0%
obviously and if you were drinking beer
 
01:45:37.189 --> 01:45:37.199 align:start position:0%
you could get a buzz on but to get the
 
01:45:40.990 --> 01:45:41.000 align:start position:0%
same Buzz with the nonalcoholic beer you
 
01:45:43.310 --> 01:45:43.320 align:start position:0%
probably have to drink a case is there
 
01:45:45.709 --> 01:45:45.719 align:start position:0%
the same kind of analogy like that
 
01:45:47.870 --> 01:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
between uh I I am an expert on the
 
01:45:49.669 --> 01:45:49.679 align:start position:0%
subject I I stopped drinking many years
 
01:45:53.030 --> 01:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
ago but I was a pretty bad Drinker uh if
 
01:45:54.709 --> 01:45:54.719 align:start position:0%
it's you know people that drink
 
01:45:55.830 --> 01:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
non-alcoholic beers I see people there
 
01:45:56.910 --> 01:45:56.920 align:start position:0%
are some people in recovery that are
 
01:45:58.550 --> 01:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
just don't want to go near it and I know
 
01:45:59.990 --> 01:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
some that do drink it and those that do
 
01:46:01.589 --> 01:46:01.599 align:start position:0%
Don't Think Twice especially when it's
 
01:46:03.310 --> 01:46:03.320 align:start position:0%
zero there are alul when originally came
 
01:46:05.550 --> 01:46:05.560 align:start position:0%
out I think it was 0.5% so you'd have to
 
01:46:07.310 --> 01:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
drink what 12 to get the equivalent of
 
01:46:11.109 --> 01:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
one beer on average um one beer does not
 
01:46:13.270 --> 01:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
get too many people I know even mildly
 
01:46:15.470 --> 01:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
buzzed but to get two beers you have to
 
01:46:18.390 --> 01:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
drink a case yeah or is that right no 12
 
01:46:21.790 --> 01:46:21.800 align:start position:0%
12 pack um they could but it's just a
 
01:46:23.310 --> 01:46:23.320 align:start position:0%
matter of how big your stomach is I mean
 
01:46:24.870 --> 01:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
you have to drink like a if you can you
 
01:46:27.109 --> 01:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
can the average stomach can expand to
 
01:46:29.790 --> 01:46:29.800 align:start position:0%
about a gallon um more with training
 
01:46:33.109 --> 01:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
that's another discussion but um um I
 
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
can eat a lot of chicken nuggets but
 
01:46:38.189 --> 01:46:38.199 align:start position:0%
anyway um so yeah I don't think that
 
01:46:39.510 --> 01:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to get that problem now
 
01:46:41.790 --> 01:46:41.800 align:start position:0%
people can buy uh your question I think
 
01:46:44.109 --> 01:46:44.119 align:start position:0%
was about earlier about CBD yeah now
 
01:46:46.790 --> 01:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
it's the non psychoactive one of the
 
01:46:48.550 --> 01:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
many non- psychoactive parts of the
 
01:46:51.430 --> 01:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis plant um and just the
 
01:46:52.910 --> 01:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
percentage doesn't mean that you know
 
01:46:56.149 --> 01:46:56.159 align:start position:0%
hemp plants and true cannabis plants
 
01:46:59.550 --> 01:46:59.560 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily um they don't they
 
01:47:01.390 --> 01:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
have they have both they have both but
 
01:47:03.669 --> 01:47:03.679 align:start position:0%
the percentages are much lower so they
 
01:47:05.430 --> 01:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
they the cannabis plants that are being
 
01:47:07.470 --> 01:47:07.480 align:start position:0%
made you know grown now much higher
 
01:47:09.430 --> 01:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
percentages of THC they still have CBD
 
01:47:12.589 --> 01:47:12.599 align:start position:0%
in them but that's not um as
 
01:47:15.070 --> 01:47:15.080 align:start position:0%
as I wouldn't say readily available it's
 
01:47:16.550 --> 01:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
it's not the prime reason why some
 
01:47:19.550 --> 01:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
people are using it now you heard uh
 
01:47:21.030 --> 01:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
someone talk about the Entourage effect
 
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
when you take CBD with different kinds
 
01:47:25.550 --> 01:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
of now there's multiple kinds of CBD and
 
01:47:26.669 --> 01:47:26.679 align:start position:0%
I'd love to talk to you about that but
 
01:47:27.750 --> 01:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we could that in the hallway
 
01:47:29.669 --> 01:47:29.679 align:start position:0%
because that'll take a lot longer but
 
01:47:32.830 --> 01:47:32.840 align:start position:0%
when you take um THC the psychoactive
 
01:47:35.910 --> 01:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
chemical in in cannabis with uh TBD and
 
01:47:40.270 --> 01:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
other other CBD CBN um you know and some
 
01:47:42.790 --> 01:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
others you you can Al can have different
 
01:47:45.990 --> 01:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
effects and sometimes they're better um
 
01:47:48.790 --> 01:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
and a lot of people find um you know CBD
 
01:47:51.510 --> 01:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
is good for different conditions but to
 
01:47:53.030 --> 01:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
a certain point so the doses is
 
01:47:55.270 --> 01:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
important for a lot of
 
01:47:58.070 --> 01:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
um well for any drug the dose and also
 
01:47:59.430 --> 01:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
the poison is in the dose like I said if
 
01:48:00.589 --> 01:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
you take too much it's poison it's like
 
01:48:02.470 --> 01:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
water if you have too much will kill you
 
01:48:04.229 --> 01:48:04.239 align:start position:0%
so we should limit W you know swiming
 
01:48:06.070 --> 01:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
pools are deadly but we can have as much
 
01:48:07.709 --> 01:48:07.719 align:start position:0%
as we want in the swimming pool you know
 
01:48:08.950 --> 01:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
but it can kill people it's one of the
 
01:48:10.669 --> 01:48:10.679 align:start position:0%
number one killers of young children
 
01:48:15.589 --> 01:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
under the age of five um so CBD can have
 
01:48:17.629 --> 01:48:17.639 align:start position:0%
hemp derived products can have THC in it
 
01:48:19.589 --> 01:48:19.599 align:start position:0%
but it's a very small amount you won't
 
01:48:22.270 --> 01:48:22.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily get high from it or have any
 
01:48:24.189 --> 01:48:24.199 align:start position:0%
uh effects but if you take enough of
 
01:48:26.229 --> 01:48:26.239 align:start position:0%
them you could you know I've seen uh
 
01:48:28.470 --> 01:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
people get a an edible container with
 
01:48:31.790 --> 01:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
maybe 30 um CBD chewies or gummies or
 
01:48:34.750 --> 01:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
whatever in it and I think a standard
 
01:48:36.550 --> 01:48:36.560 align:start position:0%
you know dose of them is 30 milligrams
 
01:48:38.910 --> 01:48:38.920 align:start position:0%
of CBD or maybe more some some are 60
 
01:48:40.470 --> 01:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
but 30 to throw that number out there
 
01:48:42.870 --> 01:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
there might be 30 of CBD in it and to
 
01:48:45.750 --> 01:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
have 0.3% there might be one of th one
 
01:48:46.990 --> 01:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
milligram of
 
01:48:49.870 --> 01:48:49.880 align:start position:0%
THC now that does have THC and it would
 
01:48:51.709 --> 01:48:51.719 align:start position:0%
be illegal if it came from a cannabis
 
01:48:53.310 --> 01:48:53.320 align:start position:0%
plant but if it came from a plant where
 
01:48:55.870 --> 01:48:55.880 align:start position:0%
the whole thing only has 3% we're
 
01:48:56.990 --> 01:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
talking about flowers so Edibles they
 
01:48:59.790 --> 01:48:59.800 align:start position:0%
can change it but it's not illegal and
 
01:49:01.109 --> 01:49:01.119 align:start position:0%
you're probably not you'd have to take
 
01:49:02.669 --> 01:49:02.679 align:start position:0%
the whole you can get 30 milligrams
 
01:49:05.310 --> 01:49:05.320 align:start position:0%
which is quite a large U amount of THC
 
01:49:08.390 --> 01:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
for a a a new individual who hasn't done
 
01:49:10.870 --> 01:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
it before uh but you have to take 30 of
 
01:49:13.030 --> 01:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
them and it becomes cross it can be
 
01:49:15.629 --> 01:49:15.639 align:start position:0%
cross prohibitive uh you know it's they
 
01:49:16.830 --> 01:49:16.840 align:start position:0%
they charge the same amount of for a
 
01:49:19.790 --> 01:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
gummy with CBD and and 1 milligram of
 
01:49:22.510 --> 01:49:22.520 align:start position:0%
THC that's hemp derived as they might do
 
01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
for for an edible with a lot more THC so
 
01:49:26.109 --> 01:49:26.119 align:start position:0%
to get the same effect You' have to buy
 
01:49:27.470 --> 01:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
a you know the equivalent of a case of
 
01:49:29.229 --> 01:49:29.239 align:start position:0%
old DS or more to get a little bit out
 
01:49:30.350 --> 01:49:30.360 align:start position:0%
of it and it's not worth it you're going
 
01:49:32.430 --> 01:49:32.440 align:start position:0%
to feel other effects you know I'd love
 
01:49:33.830 --> 01:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
to eat a bag of candy but I'm going to
 
01:49:36.310 --> 01:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
get you know other problems from that
 
01:49:41.070 --> 01:49:41.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:45.830 --> 01:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
sure yes um again I apologize for my
 
01:49:49.669 --> 01:49:49.679 align:start position:0%
ignorance here but uh one of the the
 
01:49:51.270 --> 01:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
things that makes
 
01:49:53.510 --> 01:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
fentol so
 
01:49:58.229 --> 01:49:58.239 align:start position:0%
so um such a big deal is compared to
 
01:50:01.830 --> 01:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
heroin it's much less
 
01:50:05.950 --> 01:50:05.960 align:start position:0%
expensive uh it's well fentanyl is not
 
01:50:08.070 --> 01:50:08.080 align:start position:0%
only usually cheaper it's easier to
 
01:50:09.470 --> 01:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
smuggle you know instead of having to
 
01:50:11.270 --> 01:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
bring this much in you can just bring in
 
01:50:15.950 --> 01:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
this much um it's more lethal um and
 
01:50:17.550 --> 01:50:17.560 align:start position:0%
it's harder to tirate something like
 
01:50:19.550 --> 01:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
that you can't um when you take a
 
01:50:20.870 --> 01:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
medicine if you're taking cannabis with
 
01:50:21.990 --> 01:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
tinctures you have an eye dropper you
 
01:50:23.870 --> 01:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
can say okay I need three drops or half
 
01:50:25.109 --> 01:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
of a milliliter or whatever you're
 
01:50:26.310 --> 01:50:26.320 align:start position:0%
taking you cut a gummy in half if you
 
01:50:27.629 --> 01:50:27.639 align:start position:0%
only need a certain amount but if you're
 
01:50:30.030 --> 01:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
doing Fentanyl and they shoot it up and
 
01:50:31.350 --> 01:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
I worked with syringe programs for a
 
01:50:33.229 --> 01:50:33.239 align:start position:0%
long time I helped get some of a lot of
 
01:50:35.669 --> 01:50:35.679 align:start position:0%
those started if you have uh a syringe
 
01:50:37.950 --> 01:50:37.960 align:start position:0%
and you pull it up with fentanyl in it
 
01:50:40.109 --> 01:50:40.119 align:start position:0%
um you know there might be this much in
 
01:50:41.350 --> 01:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
the syringe and you might push that much
 
01:50:43.870 --> 01:50:43.880 align:start position:0%
into your vein not me but you know put
 
01:50:46.189 --> 01:50:46.199 align:start position:0%
that much in most of the fenel might be
 
01:50:48.790 --> 01:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
in that last half you know so if you do
 
01:50:51.030 --> 01:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
if you if you chop something up it might
 
01:50:53.189 --> 01:50:53.199 align:start position:0%
be it's not all
 
01:50:54.669 --> 01:50:54.679 align:start position:0%
and if you get pure heroin you know what
 
01:50:56.550 --> 01:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
you're getting like back many years ago
 
01:50:58.950 --> 01:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
I worked in a in a hospital in a very
 
01:51:03.390 --> 01:51:03.400 align:start position:0%
high heroin um area um prevalent area
 
01:51:05.470 --> 01:51:05.480 align:start position:0%
they uh people would go out and say oh
 
01:51:07.589 --> 01:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
someone died of an overdose we want that
 
01:51:09.229 --> 01:51:09.239 align:start position:0%
because it was the Pure Heroin it wasn't
 
01:51:11.069 --> 01:51:11.079 align:start position:0%
cut up because people would take it and
 
01:51:12.669 --> 01:51:12.679 align:start position:0%
not know what they were taking you know
 
01:51:14.270 --> 01:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
they people overdose when they don't
 
01:51:16.350 --> 01:51:16.360 align:start position:0%
know how much they're taking often
 
01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah sorry chairman um sorry
 
01:51:22.629 --> 01:51:22.639 align:start position:0%
if I'm ignorant the reason I ask is that
 
01:51:29.030 --> 01:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
obviously cost is an issue and it's my
 
01:51:31.390 --> 01:51:31.400 align:start position:0%
understanding and again I'm rather
 
01:51:35.149 --> 01:51:35.159 align:start position:0%
Elementary here but K2 is a synthetic
 
01:51:38.790 --> 01:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
form of cannabis yes
 
01:51:45.310 --> 01:51:45.320 align:start position:0%
um if they're able to produce K2 much
 
01:51:48.910 --> 01:51:48.920 align:start position:0%
cheaper than the natural form of
 
01:51:51.910 --> 01:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis would that take some of the
 
01:51:55.189 --> 01:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
bite out out of the cost of
 
01:51:57.629 --> 01:51:57.639 align:start position:0%
therapy uh I don't know a lot about the
 
01:51:59.790 --> 01:51:59.800 align:start position:0%
pharmacology of K2 so I I don't really
 
01:52:01.470 --> 01:52:01.480 align:start position:0%
to feel competent to speak on it I don't
 
01:52:05.030 --> 01:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
know why someone would get
 
01:52:07.229 --> 01:52:07.239 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know why someone would do
 
01:52:08.750 --> 01:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
that I mean I don't understand other
 
01:52:11.669 --> 01:52:11.679 align:start position:0%
than cost um and you know we've heard
 
01:52:12.990 --> 01:52:13.000 align:start position:0%
people testify for and especially we're
 
01:52:14.310 --> 01:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
talking about Med medical right here
 
01:52:15.870 --> 01:52:15.880 align:start position:0%
people in the medical program are
 
01:52:17.510 --> 01:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
they're paying a premium and still going
 
01:52:19.790 --> 01:52:19.800 align:start position:0%
to the dispensaries and not that they're
 
01:52:21.870 --> 01:52:21.880 align:start position:0%
way higher prices they're they're you
 
01:52:23.910 --> 01:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
know competitive to a degree but they're
 
01:52:26.430 --> 01:52:26.440 align:start position:0%
it is cheaper when you can buy uh other
 
01:52:28.030 --> 01:52:28.040 align:start position:0%
products now since the the people in the
 
01:52:30.189 --> 01:52:30.199 align:start position:0%
medical program are not looking for K2
 
01:52:31.910 --> 01:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
they will they will probably not use
 
01:52:33.430 --> 01:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
that unless it's just to try it out for
 
01:52:35.229 --> 01:52:35.239 align:start position:0%
whatever reason it's so much easier just
 
01:52:37.550 --> 01:52:37.560 align:start position:0%
to go somewhere else if that's the case
 
01:52:39.149 --> 01:52:39.159 align:start position:0%
uh we're surrounded by states it is not
 
01:52:40.790 --> 01:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
a problem when at the in the commission
 
01:52:41.910 --> 01:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
when we heard testimony all the
 
01:52:42.870 --> 01:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
prevention groups they brought all the
 
01:52:44.589 --> 01:52:44.599 align:start position:0%
kids in talking about how it's so
 
01:52:46.149 --> 01:52:46.159 align:start position:0%
prevalent it's everywhere and I don't
 
01:52:48.750 --> 01:52:48.760 align:start position:0%
disagree it's it's very prevalent uh for
 
01:52:50.069 --> 01:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
for young kids to get it was harder for
 
01:52:52.109 --> 01:52:52.119 align:start position:0%
them to get alcohol um especially I have
 
01:52:54.589 --> 01:52:54.599 align:start position:0%
a freshman in college son and it's much
 
01:52:56.350 --> 01:52:56.360 align:start position:0%
easier for them to get you know cannabis
 
01:52:59.709 --> 01:52:59.719 align:start position:0%
than alcohol sometimes um and well not
 
01:53:00.589 --> 01:53:00.599 align:start position:0%
when it got to college it's little
 
01:53:02.790 --> 01:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
easier to get alcohol but in high school
 
01:53:05.109 --> 01:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
um so I I don't think that that that's
 
01:53:06.669 --> 01:53:06.679 align:start position:0%
who's going to buy stuff like that or
 
01:53:08.069 --> 01:53:08.079 align:start position:0%
more likely to get at the gas station is
 
01:53:09.950 --> 01:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
someone who can't go in a dispensary
 
01:53:11.550 --> 01:53:11.560 align:start position:0%
with because they're 21 so people that
 
01:53:14.629 --> 01:53:14.639 align:start position:0%
are using that are probably under 21 or
 
01:53:16.870 --> 01:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
um you know just don't have any money at
 
01:53:19.629 --> 01:53:19.639 align:start position:0%
all and we're talking very very uh you
 
01:53:22.149 --> 01:53:22.159 align:start position:0%
know low on funds to to try that over
 
01:53:26.069 --> 01:53:26.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:27.990 --> 01:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
thing it's a good question but I don't
 
01:53:29.470 --> 01:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
think it's relevant to
 
01:53:32.069 --> 01:53:32.079 align:start position:0%
Medical thank you for your
 
01:53:36.470 --> 01:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you this last one Matt
 
01:53:48.229 --> 01:53:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:51.109 --> 01:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
calls thank you Mr chairman for the
 
01:53:53.350 --> 01:53:53.360 align:start position:0%
record my name is Matt Simon I work for
 
01:53:55.910 --> 01:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
granite Leaf cannabis we are a nonprofit
 
01:53:57.910 --> 01:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis alternative
 
01:54:01.030 --> 01:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
treatment center uh we have a production
 
01:54:02.709 --> 01:54:02.719 align:start position:0%
facility located in Peterboro New
 
01:54:04.870 --> 01:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we operate two dispensaries
 
01:54:08.830 --> 01:54:08.840 align:start position:0%
one in marac one in Chai Chester and we
 
01:54:11.310 --> 01:54:11.320 align:start position:0%
support this bill for the reasons you've
 
01:54:13.510 --> 01:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
already heard and I will elaborate a
 
01:54:15.750 --> 01:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
little bit on a couple things the main
 
01:54:17.390 --> 01:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
reason is what you've already heard from
 
01:54:20.270 --> 01:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
Heather Marie Brown uh most of the
 
01:54:22.069 --> 01:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
patients that visit our dispensary do
 
01:54:26.189 --> 01:54:26.199 align:start position:0%
not by the limit but we do realize the
 
01:54:29.189 --> 01:54:29.199 align:start position:0%
therapeutic canvas is very individual uh
 
01:54:30.870 --> 01:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
different patients have very different
 
01:54:33.709 --> 01:54:33.719 align:start position:0%
needs and as you heard a small subset of
 
01:54:36.390 --> 01:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
our patient population needs a lot more
 
01:54:39.390 --> 01:54:39.400 align:start position:0%
than the average person so it is to
 
01:54:41.950 --> 01:54:41.960 align:start position:0%
accommodate those individuals
 
01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
particularly if they live in outlying
 
01:54:46.589 --> 01:54:46.599 align:start position:0%
areas uh we have seven dispensaries in
 
01:54:49.310 --> 01:54:49.320 align:start position:0%
the state there's one in Conway there's
 
01:54:51.149 --> 01:54:51.159 align:start position:0%
one in Plymouth so the North Country in
 
01:54:55.189 --> 01:54:55.199 align:start position:0%
particular is quite some distance um so
 
01:54:57.189 --> 01:54:57.199 align:start position:0%
it would help that patient population
 
01:55:00.430 --> 01:55:00.440 align:start position:0%
most dramatically it would also help all
 
01:55:03.270 --> 01:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
of our patients because one of the
 
01:55:05.870 --> 01:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
confusing aspects of our program is that
 
01:55:10.030 --> 01:55:10.040 align:start position:0%
we have to track patients allotment when
 
01:55:12.030 --> 01:55:12.040 align:start position:0%
the bill originally passed in
 
01:55:14.790 --> 01:55:14.800 align:start position:0%
2013 it was assumed that cannabis flour
 
01:55:17.910 --> 01:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
would be the product now it's a wide
 
01:55:20.830 --> 01:55:20.840 align:start position:0%
range of things from you know brownies
 
01:55:23.830 --> 01:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
tinctures edibles we make capsules we
 
01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:24.790 align:start position:0%
tinctures edibles we make capsules we
make

01:55:24.790 --> 01:55:24.800 align:start position:0%
make
 
01:55:27.669 --> 01:55:27.679 align:start position:0%
suppositories Vape cartridges really a
 
01:55:31.950 --> 01:55:31.960 align:start position:0%
lot of things and 2 O is a flower amount
 
01:55:35.629 --> 01:55:35.639 align:start position:0%
so for every product we make there is a
 
01:55:37.589 --> 01:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
corresponding amount that that
 
01:55:40.189 --> 01:55:40.199 align:start position:0%
translates to in flour and so we have to
 
01:55:43.390 --> 01:55:43.400 align:start position:0%
do math and patients are often extremely
 
01:55:45.589 --> 01:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
confused about how much of their
 
01:55:48.310 --> 01:55:48.320 align:start position:0%
allotment they have left how much they
 
01:55:50.069 --> 01:55:50.079 align:start position:0%
can continue to purchase usually they're
 
01:55:52.510 --> 01:55:52.520 align:start position:0%
way below the 2 oz but it's it's hard
 
01:55:54.229 --> 01:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
for them to understand that and our
 
01:55:56.350 --> 01:55:56.360 align:start position:0%
staff has to spend a lot of time
 
01:55:58.470 --> 01:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
explaining to them frankly I wouldn't be
 
01:56:00.510 --> 01:56:00.520 align:start position:0%
able to explain it very well cuz I don't
 
01:56:02.270 --> 01:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
understand it very well so it would ease
 
01:56:06.149 --> 01:56:06.159 align:start position:0%
a lot of confusion around What patients
 
01:56:10.189 --> 01:56:10.199 align:start position:0%
can buy and can't buy at any given
 
01:56:15.350 --> 01:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
time um we heard the 10day limit as an
 
01:56:18.310 --> 01:56:18.320 align:start position:0%
issue so I support the bill as it's
 
01:56:21.030 --> 01:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
currently written uh if that's the
 
01:56:22.950 --> 01:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
sticking point
 
01:56:24.750 --> 01:56:24.760 align:start position:0%
I think there might be a potential
 
01:56:27.950 --> 01:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
compromise uh if the bill was amended to
 
01:56:31.550 --> 01:56:31.560 align:start position:0%
4 ounces every 15 or 20 days something
 
01:56:34.629 --> 01:56:34.639 align:start position:0%
like that uh it would help the the the
 
01:56:37.950 --> 01:56:37.960 align:start position:0%
patients who live in say Pittsburgh if
 
01:56:39.950 --> 01:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
they could they're not trying to come
 
01:56:42.589 --> 01:56:42.599 align:start position:0%
every 10 days uh so that might be a
 
01:56:44.109 --> 01:56:44.119 align:start position:0%
potential compromise I haven't discussed
 
01:56:45.910 --> 01:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
that with the prime sponsor or with any
 
01:56:48.310 --> 01:56:48.320 align:start position:0%
stakeholders but it it would be better
 
01:56:51.589 --> 01:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
than not passing this bill in my opinion
 
01:56:55.189 --> 01:56:55.199 align:start position:0%
um on to a few other topics that have
 
01:56:57.950 --> 01:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
been raised if if I may uh so the price
 
01:57:00.950 --> 01:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
of cannabis uh it is more expensive in
 
01:57:02.750 --> 01:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for a number of reasons we
 
01:57:04.149 --> 01:57:04.159 align:start position:0%
discussed some of those reasons in
 
01:57:05.790 --> 01:57:05.800 align:start position:0%
committee yesterday there are a few
 
01:57:07.790 --> 01:57:07.800 align:start position:0%
bills that would help us bring those
 
01:57:10.149 --> 01:57:10.159 align:start position:0%
prices down I will say we have brought
 
01:57:12.189 --> 01:57:12.199 align:start position:0%
prices down considerably uh our
 
01:57:13.790 --> 01:57:13.800 align:start position:0%
leadership team's been in place for
 
01:57:16.870 --> 01:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
three and a half years at Granite Leaf
 
01:57:21.750 --> 01:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh when we took charge all igh ounces of
 
01:57:24.669 --> 01:57:24.679 align:start position:0%
cannabis in New Hampshire were $55 e
 
01:57:26.109 --> 01:57:26.119 align:start position:0%
which was
 
01:57:29.750 --> 01:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
exorbitant uh and just earlier this week
 
01:57:32.310 --> 01:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
we reduced flower prices for the third
 
01:57:34.910 --> 01:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
time uh they're now down somewhere
 
01:57:37.629 --> 01:57:37.639 align:start position:0%
between 30 and 40% overall from when
 
01:57:40.709 --> 01:57:40.719 align:start position:0%
where we started uh
 
01:57:44.990 --> 01:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
currently uh most of our flour is $199
 
01:57:48.870 --> 01:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
for an ounce so you it' be 5 ounces
 
01:57:51.310 --> 01:57:51.320 align:start position:0%
under a th000 and some of our flowers in
 
01:57:53.510 --> 01:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
a little higher tier so it's 239 an
 
01:57:55.510 --> 01:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
ounce those prices are all on our
 
01:57:57.430 --> 01:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
website and if you're curious about the
 
01:57:59.310 --> 01:57:59.320 align:start position:0%
prices I just encourage you to look at
 
01:58:02.149 --> 01:58:02.159 align:start position:0%
the atc's websites everything we have is
 
01:58:03.790 --> 01:58:03.800 align:start position:0%
listed and also look at neighboring
 
01:58:06.589 --> 01:58:06.599 align:start position:0%
states and see what uh cannabis is
 
01:58:08.830 --> 01:58:08.840 align:start position:0%
selling for in both the adult use and
 
01:58:11.310 --> 01:58:11.320 align:start position:0%
and medical markets I I do this research
 
01:58:13.589 --> 01:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
all the time because it's part of my job
 
01:58:15.990 --> 01:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh but basically we're working very hard
 
01:58:17.750 --> 01:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
to lower prices and every time we're
 
01:58:20.149 --> 01:58:20.159 align:start position:0%
able to lower prices a little bit due to
 
01:58:22.470 --> 01:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
Market factors in neighboring states
 
01:58:24.310 --> 01:58:24.320 align:start position:0%
they've lowered them even more so the
 
01:58:26.189 --> 01:58:26.199 align:start position:0%
expectations continually change and
 
01:58:28.709 --> 01:58:28.719 align:start position:0%
we're always trying to play catchup and
 
01:58:31.669 --> 01:58:31.679 align:start position:0%
never quite succeeding but we are
 
01:58:34.870 --> 01:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
trying synthetic cannaboids is a huge
 
01:58:36.270 --> 01:58:36.280 align:start position:0%
issue I've been working on for a long
 
01:58:39.830 --> 01:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
time uh we want patients to have access
 
01:58:41.950 --> 01:58:41.960 align:start position:0%
to Natural
 
01:58:45.270 --> 01:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis cannabis is the scientific name
 
01:58:48.069 --> 01:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
for the plant it doesn't know the plant
 
01:58:49.750 --> 01:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't know whether it's hemp or quote
 
01:58:53.709 --> 01:58:53.719 align:start position:0%
unquote marijuana hemp is a legal
 
01:58:56.790 --> 01:58:56.800 align:start position:0%
definition uh that arbitrarily says any
 
01:59:00.109 --> 01:59:00.119 align:start position:0%
cannabis plant that is less than 3% THC
 
01:59:03.350 --> 01:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
by dry weight is hemp and any other
 
01:59:05.350 --> 01:59:05.360 align:start position:0%
cannabis plant that has more THC than
 
01:59:09.470 --> 01:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
that is not hemp so when the farm bill
 
01:59:11.510 --> 01:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
passed in
 
01:59:14.669 --> 01:59:14.679 align:start position:0%
2018 this whole game changed prior to
 
01:59:16.270 --> 01:59:16.280 align:start position:0%
that we were hearing a lot about spice
 
01:59:18.390 --> 01:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
and K2 which are not cannabis at all
 
01:59:22.149 --> 01:59:22.159 align:start position:0%
spice and K2 are fake cannabis they are
 
01:59:24.149 --> 01:59:24.159 align:start position:0%
different types of plant material that
 
01:59:27.109 --> 01:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
are sprayed with synthetic chemicals
 
01:59:29.709 --> 01:59:29.719 align:start position:0%
that are designed to resemble canabo
 
01:59:32.149 --> 01:59:32.159 align:start position:0%
they aren't even actually canabo so that
 
01:59:35.030 --> 01:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
stuff was awful and we worked hard to
 
01:59:36.510 --> 01:59:36.520 align:start position:0%
get it out of the convenience stores
 
01:59:37.990 --> 01:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
there was a study commission 10 years
 
01:59:41.149 --> 01:59:41.159 align:start position:0%
ago that I worked with and ultimately
 
01:59:44.069 --> 01:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
prohibited those products then hemp
 
01:59:45.830 --> 01:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
became federally legal and we were in
 
01:59:49.589 --> 01:59:49.599 align:start position:0%
round two of this now because since the
 
01:59:51.470 --> 01:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
federal government has not regulated
 
01:59:53.790 --> 01:59:53.800 align:start position:0%
hemp production has not regulated CBD
 
01:59:55.589 --> 01:59:55.599 align:start position:0%
markets has not stepped in to regulate
 
01:59:57.750 --> 01:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
any of this it's all fallen on the
 
01:59:59.470 --> 01:59:59.480 align:start position:0%
states to regulate some states aren't
 
02:00:01.550 --> 02:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
regulating at all so we have a massive
 
02:00:04.870 --> 02:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
hemp derived Market in cannabinoids like
 
02:00:08.669 --> 02:00:08.679 align:start position:0%
CBD uh I think any analogy to alcohol
 
02:00:11.510 --> 02:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
fails because alcoholic beverages
 
02:00:13.430 --> 02:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
there's one molecule that's active it's
 
02:00:15.270 --> 02:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
ethanol we're all pretty familiar with
 
02:00:18.750 --> 02:00:18.760 align:start position:0%
that one cannabis has over a 100
 
02:00:21.550 --> 02:00:21.560 align:start position:0%
potentially cannabinoids in it THC is
 
02:00:23.470 --> 02:00:23.480 align:start position:0%
the one that is intoxicating or
 
02:00:25.470 --> 02:00:25.480 align:start position:0%
potentially intoxicating there are over
 
02:00:29.189 --> 02:00:29.199 align:start position:0%
a 100 non- intoxic canabo that are
 
02:00:31.550 --> 02:00:31.560 align:start position:0%
increasingly the focus of
 
02:00:33.870 --> 02:00:33.880 align:start position:0%
research and they can all be produced
 
02:00:35.750 --> 02:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
from hemp and they are being produced
 
02:00:36.870 --> 02:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
from hemp and there's a massive
 
02:00:38.990 --> 02:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
unregulated market for these products
 
02:00:41.669 --> 02:00:41.679 align:start position:0%
there's also hemp companies that are
 
02:00:43.910 --> 02:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
realizing they can make more money by
 
02:00:48.669 --> 02:00:48.679 align:start position:0%
synthesizing THC products from hemp and
 
02:00:50.189 --> 02:00:50.199 align:start position:0%
that's where we run into trouble and New
 
02:00:52.830 --> 02:00:52.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has prohibited that last
 
02:00:55.830 --> 02:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
two sessions ago uh passed a law to
 
02:00:59.430 --> 02:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
prohibit hemp dve synthetic th products
 
02:01:01.750 --> 02:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
and last year eliminated the sunset on
 
02:01:03.910 --> 02:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
that bill so they're illegal to sell in
 
02:01:05.870 --> 02:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh but they are still very
 
02:01:07.149 --> 02:01:07.159 align:start position:0%
much available and that's a whole
 
02:01:07.159 --> 02:01:08.229 align:start position:0%
much available and that's a whole
another

02:01:08.229 --> 02:01:08.239 align:start position:0%
another
 
02:01:10.790 --> 02:01:10.800 align:start position:0%
messy Federal issue that may or may not
 
02:01:12.430 --> 02:01:12.440 align:start position:0%
be addressed in this year's farm bill
 
02:01:15.510 --> 02:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
and I'll certainly be tracking that uh
 
02:01:18.109 --> 02:01:18.119 align:start position:0%
but back to this bill we're trying to
 
02:01:20.990 --> 02:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
help patients here we serve uh they're a
 
02:01:23.030 --> 02:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
little over 15 ,000 patients currently
 
02:01:24.750 --> 02:01:24.760 align:start position:0%
registered for the therapeutic cannabis
 
02:01:28.589 --> 02:01:28.599 align:start position:0%
program we're trying to make life as
 
02:01:31.109 --> 02:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
okay as possible for them and this bill
 
02:01:32.950 --> 02:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
would do that
 
02:01:35.470 --> 02:01:35.480 align:start position:0%
so ask you to pass it happy to answer
 
02:01:35.480 --> 02:01:36.870 align:start position:0%
so ask you to pass it happy to answer
any

02:01:36.870 --> 02:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:01:40.830 --> 02:01:40.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um as as you you
 
02:01:43.149 --> 02:01:43.159 align:start position:0%
said you represent one of the eight um
 
02:01:46.310 --> 02:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
um stores I have a question how have you
 
02:01:48.229 --> 02:01:48.239 align:start position:0%
ever been visited by or anyone from the
 
02:01:50.709 --> 02:01:50.719 align:start position:0%
federal government like the um for
 
02:01:54.069 --> 02:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
example the ATF like that do you keep on
 
02:01:57.069 --> 02:01:57.079 align:start position:0%
hand records that were they to show up
 
02:01:59.870 --> 02:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
that would show patient names that had
 
02:02:02.470 --> 02:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
been there that are purchasing things
 
02:02:05.270 --> 02:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
there if federal agents showed up at our
 
02:02:08.030 --> 02:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
facility yeah keeping in mind I mean it
 
02:02:10.629 --> 02:02:10.639 align:start position:0%
is illegal federally so the the ATF
 
02:02:12.870 --> 02:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
could theoretically show up do you
 
02:02:14.510 --> 02:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
maintain records there that they could
 
02:02:17.229 --> 02:02:17.239 align:start position:0%
use to trace back the patients in our
 
02:02:19.870 --> 02:02:19.880 align:start position:0%
state we do maintain those records I
 
02:02:21.390 --> 02:02:21.400 align:start position:0%
don't think we would be very interested
 
02:02:23.350 --> 02:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
in sharing in them with federal agents
 
02:02:26.229 --> 02:02:26.239 align:start position:0%
so it's interesting uh the therapeutic
 
02:02:28.430 --> 02:02:28.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis law includes a specific
 
02:02:30.229 --> 02:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
prohibition uh the Department of Health
 
02:02:32.830 --> 02:02:32.840 align:start position:0%
and Human Services cannot share patient
 
02:02:35.189 --> 02:02:35.199 align:start position:0%
information with the ATF if they showed
 
02:02:38.189 --> 02:02:38.199 align:start position:0%
up at DHHS they're not allowed to do it
 
02:02:41.669 --> 02:02:41.679 align:start position:0%
right uh what nobody's ever asked what I
 
02:02:43.990 --> 02:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
think we would want a court order
 
02:02:45.270 --> 02:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
obviously we're not going to just hand
 
02:02:47.990 --> 02:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
over I'm concerned Pati or we have a lot
 
02:02:50.229 --> 02:02:50.239 align:start position:0%
of veterans that that absolutely that
 
02:02:52.270 --> 02:02:52.280 align:start position:0%
take advantage of this product to help
 
02:02:54.709 --> 02:02:54.719 align:start position:0%
them with their PTSD and many of them I
 
02:02:57.550 --> 02:02:57.560 align:start position:0%
don't think realize that were the ATF to
 
02:02:59.950 --> 02:02:59.960 align:start position:0%
show up with the subpoena um you would
 
02:03:01.430 --> 02:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
not have much of a choice but to turn
 
02:03:02.669 --> 02:03:02.679 align:start position:0%
over those records I mean you may go
 
02:03:05.950 --> 02:03:05.960 align:start position:0%
into court but I I I would I would say
 
02:03:07.030 --> 02:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
it would probably be a losing
 
02:03:09.109 --> 02:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
proposition so I'm interested in somehow
 
02:03:11.390 --> 02:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
shielding that information I appreciate
 
02:03:12.990 --> 02:03:13.000 align:start position:0%
the question and I'm interested in
 
02:03:15.350 --> 02:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
shielding patients from any potential
 
02:03:18.069 --> 02:03:18.079 align:start position:0%
negative legal consequences uh our law
 
02:03:19.950 --> 02:03:19.960 align:start position:0%
is tighter than most on this some states
 
02:03:21.830 --> 02:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
allow that kind of sharing with with
 
02:03:23.470 --> 02:03:23.480 align:start position:0%
federal agents we've explicitly
 
02:03:25.870 --> 02:03:25.880 align:start position:0%
prohibited and that was the main reason
 
02:03:27.990 --> 02:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
for that but yeah we would fight in
 
02:03:30.189 --> 02:03:30.199 align:start position:0%
court to prevent anything like that from
 
02:03:31.709 --> 02:03:31.719 align:start position:0%
happening and I'm heartened by the fact
 
02:03:34.709 --> 02:03:34.719 align:start position:0%
that it has not happened at all anywhere
 
02:03:38.669 --> 02:03:38.679 align:start position:0%
that this is uh prosecutions for you
 
02:03:41.350 --> 02:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
know for example the firearm issue have
 
02:03:43.750 --> 02:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
been very very few and far between and
 
02:03:45.310 --> 02:03:45.320 align:start position:0%
very selective and there have actually
 
02:03:47.669 --> 02:03:47.679 align:start position:0%
been a number of court rulings that call
 
02:03:49.750 --> 02:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
the entire constitutionality of that
 
02:03:52.069 --> 02:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
prohibition into question so I'm
 
02:03:54.189 --> 02:03:54.199 align:start position:0%
somewhat hopeful that that will change
 
02:03:55.790 --> 02:03:55.800 align:start position:0%
not because I think Congress is
 
02:03:57.470 --> 02:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
particularly functional but because I
 
02:03:59.030 --> 02:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
think the Court decisions are going in
 
02:04:01.350 --> 02:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
the direction that some court is going
 
02:04:04.069 --> 02:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
to throw that out uh and say that as
 
02:04:05.910 --> 02:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
long as you're not impaired at the time
 
02:04:07.589 --> 02:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
there's no reason why somebody who
 
02:04:09.709 --> 02:04:09.719 align:start position:0%
happens to consume or possess cannabis
 
02:04:11.830 --> 02:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
should be prohibited from owning a
 
02:04:14.510 --> 02:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
firearm well as often is the case with
 
02:04:16.629 --> 02:04:16.639 align:start position:0%
the our federal friends it would come
 
02:04:18.910 --> 02:04:18.920 align:start position:0%
down to what did you put on a form the
 
02:04:20.709 --> 02:04:20.719 align:start position:0%
piece of paper when they go to purchase
 
02:04:20.719 --> 02:04:22.390 align:start position:0%
piece of paper when they go to purchase
firearm

02:04:22.390 --> 02:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
firearm
 
02:04:23.589 --> 02:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
right it's got nothing to do with
 
02:04:24.950 --> 02:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
whether they're actually using it or not
 
02:04:26.709 --> 02:04:26.719 align:start position:0%
it's what they put on that form I would
 
02:04:29.470 --> 02:04:29.480 align:start position:0%
agree yeah there's a big gap between how
 
02:04:32.189 --> 02:04:32.199 align:start position:0%
the ATF interprets federal law and
 
02:04:34.270 --> 02:04:34.280 align:start position:0%
applies it to that form and what a
 
02:04:35.990 --> 02:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
number of Courts across the country have
 
02:04:37.709 --> 02:04:37.719 align:start position:0%
said on this issue when it's actually
 
02:04:39.750 --> 02:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
come up so thank you well I may reach
 
02:04:41.950 --> 02:04:41.960 align:start position:0%
out to you after to discuss certainly
 
02:04:43.310 --> 02:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions yes
 
02:04:44.910 --> 02:04:44.920 align:start position:0%
representative new yeah just in the very
 
02:04:47.149 --> 02:04:47.159 align:start position:0%
beginning of your testimony you said I I
 
02:04:48.830 --> 02:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
don't know whether it was not for-profit
 
02:04:51.910 --> 02:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
or a nonprofit would uh the New
 
02:04:53.510 --> 02:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire alternative treatment centers
 
02:04:55.430 --> 02:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
are required to be organized as
 
02:04:57.950 --> 02:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
nonprofits at the state level we are not
 
02:04:59.990 --> 02:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
recognized as nonprofits by the federal
 
02:05:02.629 --> 02:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
government so that puts us in an odd
 
02:05:04.310 --> 02:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
state of limbo there's another bill and
 
02:05:06.709 --> 02:05:06.719 align:start position:0%
another committee on that thank you
 
02:05:06.719 --> 02:05:07.910 align:start position:0%
another committee on that thank you
representative

02:05:07.910 --> 02:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:05:11.470 --> 02:05:11.480 align:start position:0%
share thank you Mr chair um just for for
 
02:05:13.270 --> 02:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
your information for the chair's
 
02:05:16.990 --> 02:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
information to to show up with the the
 
02:05:18.709 --> 02:05:18.719 align:start position:0%
ATF would have to show up to get the
 
02:05:20.629 --> 02:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
names of people they would have to show
 
02:05:22.229 --> 02:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
up with a search warrant to get the
 
02:05:24.390 --> 02:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
search warrant they would need to have
 
02:05:26.549 --> 02:05:26.559 align:start position:0%
probable cause to believe there was
 
02:05:29.910 --> 02:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
evidence of a crime in in the names they
 
02:05:32.870 --> 02:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
were seeking so it couldn't be a a
 
02:05:34.990 --> 02:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
general hey let's get these names and
 
02:05:36.589 --> 02:05:36.599 align:start position:0%
see what we can come up with it would
 
02:05:39.109 --> 02:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
have to be targeted at a specific person
 
02:05:41.790 --> 02:05:41.800 align:start position:0%
or persons for whom they they have
 
02:05:43.549 --> 02:05:43.559 align:start position:0%
probable cause to believe is committing
 
02:05:46.310 --> 02:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
a crime just I I would posit that a
 
02:05:48.709 --> 02:05:48.719 align:start position:0%
store that has a big sign out front that
 
02:05:51.229 --> 02:05:51.239 align:start position:0%
says we sell marijuana is probably C it
 
02:05:52.549 --> 02:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
there's a federal crime happening
 
02:05:56.390 --> 02:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
because it's illegal said it would be um
 
02:05:57.790 --> 02:05:57.800 align:start position:0%
a I mean it would stretch and it would
 
02:06:00.470 --> 02:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
go to court but well it yeah we sell
 
02:06:04.069 --> 02:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
marijuana that give probable cause to uh
 
02:06:06.950 --> 02:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
search the place but not for the names
 
02:06:09.589 --> 02:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
it would just to information about the
 
02:06:12.069 --> 02:06:12.079 align:start position:0%
owners and it would be messy yeah it
 
02:06:15.030 --> 02:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
would be if I may we do have limited
 
02:06:17.669 --> 02:06:17.679 align:start position:0%
protection from federal enforcement it's
 
02:06:19.790 --> 02:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
about the most limited form you can have
 
02:06:21.390 --> 02:06:21.400 align:start position:0%
in the form of a budget amendment that's
 
02:06:21.400 --> 02:06:22.229 align:start position:0%
in the form of a budget amendment that's
been

02:06:22.229 --> 02:06:22.239 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:06:23.950 --> 02:06:23.960 align:start position:0%
approved as part of the last several
 
02:06:25.790 --> 02:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
Federal budgets it simply prohibits
 
02:06:28.589 --> 02:06:28.599 align:start position:0%
federal agencies from spending money to
 
02:06:32.750 --> 02:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
undermine State cannabis laws okay so I
 
02:06:34.870 --> 02:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
would have to fight them in court over
 
02:06:36.549 --> 02:06:36.559 align:start position:0%
that too there'd be a lot of fights
 
02:06:38.350 --> 02:06:38.360 align:start position:0%
going on but I don't anti I think you're
 
02:06:39.910 --> 02:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
right that it would it would be targeted
 
02:06:42.189 --> 02:06:42.199 align:start position:0%
towards one individual in the unlikely
 
02:06:44.149 --> 02:06:44.159 align:start position:0%
event that the feds showed up at our
 
02:06:45.790 --> 02:06:45.800 align:start position:0%
dispensary they would not be trying to
 
02:06:48.149 --> 02:06:48.159 align:start position:0%
access our entire records I think that
 
02:06:49.750 --> 02:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
ship is sailed and the federal
 
02:06:51.030 --> 02:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
government has moved on to other
 
02:06:51.040 --> 02:06:52.870 align:start position:0%
government has moved on to other
priorities

02:06:52.870 --> 02:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
priorities
 
02:06:54.950 --> 02:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
rightly so thank
 
02:06:57.310 --> 02:06:57.320 align:start position:0%
you with that oh we're all set thank
 
02:06:59.350 --> 02:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
thank you um with that is there anyone
 
02:07:00.669 --> 02:07:00.679 align:start position:0%
else who hasn't testified in this bill
 
02:07:01.870 --> 02:07:01.880 align:start position:0%
that wishes to
 
02:07:04.149 --> 02:07:04.159 align:start position:0%
testify see none I'm going to close the
 
02:07:07.069 --> 02:07:07.079 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill one what

amendment I forgot to sign up to speak
 
02:08:16.910 --> 02:08:16.920 align:start position:0%

Safety Committee ranking member goth
 
02:09:50.310 --> 02:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
representative rhs for some reason this
 
02:09:52.709 --> 02:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
room feels very familiar I don't quite
 
02:09:56.310 --> 02:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
know why but it's always good to be back
 
02:09:59.350 --> 02:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
here and the amendment that I brought
 
02:10:00.950 --> 02:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
forward to you today thank you for
 
02:10:02.790 --> 02:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
taking the time to read it I apologize
 
02:10:05.390 --> 02:10:05.400 align:start position:0%
for that I was hopeful that my amended
 
02:10:07.790 --> 02:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment would be in in time for me to
 
02:10:09.589 --> 02:10:09.599 align:start position:0%
email the committee last night but it
 
02:10:12.350 --> 02:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
wasn't so I waited for this morning in
 
02:10:14.589 --> 02:10:14.599 align:start position:0%
time for me to be able to mark it and go
 
02:10:19.069 --> 02:10:19.079 align:start position:0%
up to O uh HCS and produce some copies
 
02:10:21.510 --> 02:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
with what the amended Amendment will be
 
02:10:23.870 --> 02:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunately not an error of os but an
 
02:10:27.069 --> 02:10:27.079 align:start position:0%
error of Mind there was on line 25 a
 
02:10:29.830 --> 02:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
missed word where reads expunged it
 
02:10:32.350 --> 02:10:32.360 align:start position:0%
should say an olded but I've marked that
 
02:10:33.470 --> 02:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
on each of your
 
02:10:37.750 --> 02:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
sheets HP 1996 was brought forward
 
02:10:39.950 --> 02:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
before the legislature last year last
 
02:10:42.830 --> 02:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
term by myself and we had in this
 
02:10:44.990 --> 02:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
committee had some pretty thorough
 
02:10:47.830 --> 02:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
conversations about what the legislation
 
02:10:50.669 --> 02:10:50.679 align:start position:0%
was about and moving it forward to the
 
02:10:52.589 --> 02:10:52.599 align:start position:0%
house floor representative rhods you and
 
02:10:54.189 --> 02:10:54.199 align:start position:0%
I had a really good debate on the house
 
02:10:57.470 --> 02:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
floor about it
 
02:11:01.709 --> 02:11:01.719 align:start position:0%
always and um the legislation itself
 
02:11:06.310 --> 02:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
what it does is allow people and
 
02:11:08.910 --> 02:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
initiate the dep Department of Safety to
 
02:11:12.350 --> 02:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
anull the crime of anyone who has a
 
02:11:14.589 --> 02:11:14.599 align:start position:0%
possession misdemeanor or violation
 
02:11:17.629 --> 02:11:17.639 align:start position:0%
level possession charge for cannabis
 
02:11:19.669 --> 02:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
offenses the point behind the
 
02:11:21.910 --> 02:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
legislation is similar to
 
02:11:25.270 --> 02:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
what the spirit behind Governor sununu's
 
02:11:28.109 --> 02:11:28.119 align:start position:0%
decriminalization law and its annulment
 
02:11:31.430 --> 02:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
provision was which is the state is
 
02:11:34.430 --> 02:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
moving forward on this issue as other
 
02:11:37.310 --> 02:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
states have uh I like to use the example
 
02:11:39.870 --> 02:11:39.880 align:start position:0%
of Colorado and Washington other states
 
02:11:42.669 --> 02:11:42.679 align:start position:0%
that moved forward and allowed people to
 
02:11:48.669 --> 02:11:48.679 align:start position:0%
smoke sell and use this drug but kept
 
02:11:51.229 --> 02:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
the record of people who had been ared
 
02:11:54.750 --> 02:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
arrested prior on their record and what
 
02:11:59.549 --> 02:11:59.559 align:start position:0%
that did was stop them from get loans or
 
02:12:01.990 --> 02:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
get a job with the federal government or
 
02:12:05.669 --> 02:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
other programs which restrict people
 
02:12:07.910 --> 02:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
from getting that job if they have such
 
02:12:10.030 --> 02:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
a charge on their record these are
 
02:12:12.910 --> 02:12:12.920 align:start position:0%
people that have served their sentence
 
02:12:15.950 --> 02:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
done the time come out and now the
 
02:12:19.149 --> 02:12:19.159 align:start position:0%
charge that they were incarcerated for
 
02:12:22.830 --> 02:12:22.840 align:start position:0%
in is no longer um being
 
02:12:25.030 --> 02:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
prosecuted but they're still unable to
 
02:12:27.229 --> 02:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
get forward in life which is the point
 
02:12:29.270 --> 02:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
of the Criminal Justice System the
 
02:12:32.390 --> 02:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation side of it because this
 
02:12:35.189 --> 02:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
this charge is still on their record so
 
02:12:35.199 --> 02:12:36.910 align:start position:0%
this charge is still on their record so
this

02:12:36.910 --> 02:12:36.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:12:39.790 --> 02:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
legislation changed from the original
 
02:12:43.950 --> 02:12:43.960 align:start position:0%
version of hb1 196 would authorize the
 
02:12:45.669 --> 02:12:45.679 align:start position:0%
department of safety over the course of
 
02:12:49.470 --> 02:12:49.480 align:start position:0%
the next 18 months after passage to go
 
02:12:51.790 --> 02:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
through and expunge the record of anyone
 
02:12:54.149 --> 02:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
who has a misdemeanor or possession
 
02:12:57.350 --> 02:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
violation level possession offense for
 
02:13:00.189 --> 02:13:00.199 align:start position:0%
cannabis um it also allows for people if
 
02:13:00.199 --> 02:13:01.149 align:start position:0%
cannabis um it also allows for people if
they

02:13:01.149 --> 02:13:01.159 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:13:05.030 --> 02:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
are missed in that 18 months to petition
 
02:13:07.549 --> 02:13:07.559 align:start position:0%
the court to get an analment it doesn't
 
02:13:09.510 --> 02:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
allow for anyone to who's currently
 
02:13:12.950 --> 02:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
serving a sentence get their analment or
 
02:13:16.990 --> 02:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
anyone who's uh about to be convicted to
 
02:13:19.709 --> 02:13:19.719 align:start position:0%
not be convicted it doesn't allow for
 
02:13:22.030 --> 02:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
anyone who has any other charge other
 
02:13:24.030 --> 02:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
than the misdemeanor violation offense
 
02:13:26.270 --> 02:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
on their record to to have that an olded
 
02:13:28.149 --> 02:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
and if you're petitioning for your
 
02:13:29.669 --> 02:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
analment but you
 
02:13:32.830 --> 02:13:32.840 align:start position:0%
have but the conviction of a misdemeanor
 
02:13:35.189 --> 02:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
charge included other charges if you
 
02:13:37.390 --> 02:13:37.400 align:start position:0%
were arrested for for selling but it
 
02:13:40.030 --> 02:13:40.040 align:start position:0%
also included misdemeanor possession etc
 
02:13:41.990 --> 02:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
etc you would not be eligible for
 
02:13:43.629 --> 02:13:43.639 align:start position:0%
analment this is only for people that
 
02:13:46.189 --> 02:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
were arrested for violation level and
 
02:13:48.069 --> 02:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor cannabis
 
02:13:54.229 --> 02:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:56.669 --> 02:13:56.679 align:start position:0%
currently with the analment statute as
 
02:13:59.830 --> 02:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
it is where people can petition the
 
02:14:02.669 --> 02:14:02.679 align:start position:0%
court nobody has gone forward and
 
02:14:05.030 --> 02:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
petitioned the court we've group of
 
02:14:07.669 --> 02:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
lawyers have sought people to ask if
 
02:14:09.350 --> 02:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
they have under the current law because
 
02:14:11.270 --> 02:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
you can as I said in the beginning under
 
02:14:14.189 --> 02:14:14.199 align:start position:0%
the current law but they don't and we've
 
02:14:18.229 --> 02:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
seen in states where this is uh
 
02:14:20.830 --> 02:14:20.840 align:start position:0%
implemented that people don't go forward
 
02:14:23.470 --> 02:14:23.480 align:start position:0%
because the form is cumbersome we had
 
02:14:26.109 --> 02:14:26.119 align:start position:0%
testimony from lawyers who are working
 
02:14:27.790 --> 02:14:27.800 align:start position:0%
on this issue who said that when they
 
02:14:29.510 --> 02:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
looked at the form that they're eyes
 
02:14:32.069 --> 02:14:32.079 align:start position:0%
glazed over because it was uh such a
 
02:14:35.229 --> 02:14:35.239 align:start position:0%
cumbersome form and I imagine that I
 
02:14:36.790 --> 02:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
can't imagine that it would be easy for
 
02:14:40.870 --> 02:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
somebody that uh doesn't have the
 
02:14:43.149 --> 02:14:43.159 align:start position:0%
background and experience that a lawyer
 
02:14:45.750 --> 02:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
does to look at that form and and to
 
02:14:47.589 --> 02:14:47.599 align:start position:0%
seek an analment so what this process
 
02:14:50.390 --> 02:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
does is make it a proactive process for
 
02:14:50.400 --> 02:14:51.790 align:start position:0%
does is make it a proactive process for
annulments

02:14:51.790 --> 02:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
annulments
 
02:14:54.430 --> 02:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
and allow people the opportunity to
 
02:14:55.870 --> 02:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
petition the court if they feel like
 
02:14:58.549 --> 02:14:58.559 align:start position:0%
they've been missed from that proactive
 
02:15:00.830 --> 02:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
process there are 12 states that have
 
02:15:03.430 --> 02:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
implemented legislation such as Oklahoma
 
02:15:06.750 --> 02:15:06.760 align:start position:0%
and Utah that goes much Beyond this they
 
02:15:09.910 --> 02:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
call it uh Clean Slate laws where
 
02:15:14.109 --> 02:15:14.119 align:start position:0%
essentially the the it's uh much more
 
02:15:16.350 --> 02:15:16.360 align:start position:0%
thorough wipe of people's records that
 
02:15:19.589 --> 02:15:19.599 align:start position:0%
is not what we're doing here this is a
 
02:15:22.350 --> 02:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
very simple proactive measure on one
 
02:15:24.870 --> 02:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
specific the misdemeanor violation
 
02:15:27.069 --> 02:15:27.079 align:start position:0%
offenses for for cannabis possession
 
02:15:30.189 --> 02:15:30.199 align:start position:0%
over the course of people's lifetime um
 
02:15:31.830 --> 02:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
right now we're not necessarily
 
02:15:33.510 --> 02:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting those offenses we heard that
 
02:15:37.149 --> 02:15:37.159 align:start position:0%
in testimony last year but people still
 
02:15:38.950 --> 02:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
do have it on their record from from
 
02:15:40.910 --> 02:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
when the state was Prosecuting these so
 
02:15:43.990 --> 02:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
I think it's good if someone has shown
 
02:15:45.470 --> 02:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
that they've gone through the criminal
 
02:15:48.350 --> 02:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
justice system they serve their time to
 
02:15:50.510 --> 02:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
allow them to move forward in life get
 
02:15:52.750 --> 02:15:52.760 align:start position:0%
their job get their loan and and have
 
02:15:54.750 --> 02:15:54.760 align:start position:0%
their record expunged for this crime
 
02:15:56.430 --> 02:15:56.440 align:start position:0%
which which the state is no longer
 
02:15:59.430 --> 02:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting in this way that is outlined
 
02:16:01.549 --> 02:16:01.559 align:start position:0%
in the bill before you here today so
 
02:16:02.870 --> 02:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time Mr
 
02:16:04.830 --> 02:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
chairman and I'm happy to take any
 
02:16:06.950 --> 02:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee might have
 
02:16:09.109 --> 02:16:09.119 align:start position:0%
thank you um I don't see a fiscal note
 
02:16:13.470 --> 02:16:13.480 align:start position:0%
on this but yet it it mandates um the
 
02:16:15.790 --> 02:16:15.800 align:start position:0%
department of safety to go back and go
 
02:16:17.109 --> 02:16:17.119 align:start position:0%
through all these
 
02:16:19.870 --> 02:16:19.880 align:start position:0%
records did you have or did anyone reach
 
02:16:21.189 --> 02:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
out to you to say hey that that might
 
02:16:23.069 --> 02:16:23.079 align:start position:0%
cost some money did did you hear
 
02:16:24.709 --> 02:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
anything well no doubt will cost some
 
02:16:28.189 --> 02:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
money I think I would imagine there
 
02:16:31.069 --> 02:16:31.079 align:start position:0%
would be a fiscal note eventually uh
 
02:16:33.429 --> 02:16:33.439 align:start position:0%
this is the amendment as it does the
 
02:16:35.270 --> 02:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
original have the FIS does it anyone
 
02:16:48.349 --> 02:16:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:52.270 --> 02:16:52.280 align:start position:0%
note indeterminable
 
02:16:59.070 --> 02:16:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:01.870 --> 02:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
um yeah go ahead all right thank you I
 
02:17:03.629 --> 02:17:03.639 align:start position:0%
was I was curious because it seems to me
 
02:17:05.709 --> 02:17:05.719 align:start position:0%
that that's it could be Labor
 
02:17:07.589 --> 02:17:07.599 align:start position:0%
intensitive uh for them to have to go
 
02:17:08.990 --> 02:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
back through and figure I don't even
 
02:17:12.030 --> 02:17:12.040 align:start position:0%
know if they have a way to do that um to
 
02:17:14.990 --> 02:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
search by who has been or has such a
 
02:17:17.549 --> 02:17:17.559 align:start position:0%
thing on their record
 
02:17:19.830 --> 02:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
um did you reach out to the Department
 
02:17:21.629 --> 02:17:21.639 align:start position:0%
of Safety at all to ask about what the
 
02:17:23.349 --> 02:17:23.359 align:start position:0%
procedure would look like to kind of do
 
02:17:25.589 --> 02:17:25.599 align:start position:0%
this the department of safety and I had
 
02:17:30.509 --> 02:17:30.519 align:start position:0%
conversations last year or 20 2024 last
 
02:17:33.270 --> 02:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
year uh but we haven't had conversations
 
02:17:35.669 --> 02:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
on on this bill about the specifics I
 
02:17:39.469 --> 02:17:39.479 align:start position:0%
would say that uh given the number of
 
02:17:42.750 --> 02:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
these charges that uh I wouldn't say
 
02:17:44.190 --> 02:17:44.200 align:start position:0%
that there would
 
02:17:46.629 --> 02:17:46.639 align:start position:0%
be thousands of these charges that they
 
02:17:48.030 --> 02:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
would have to go through to look at I
 
02:17:50.030 --> 02:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say it's extraordinarily labor
 
02:17:51.589 --> 02:17:51.599 align:start position:0%
intensive and I would be open to any
 
02:17:53.270 --> 02:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
amendment that the committee has around
 
02:17:55.549 --> 02:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
changing some of those Staffing I'm just
 
02:17:57.030 --> 02:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
more curious as to whether or not they
 
02:17:59.669 --> 02:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
have the technology to to I mean i' I've
 
02:18:01.190 --> 02:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
seen some things that are kind of scary
 
02:18:03.070 --> 02:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
I don't know if they have if they have
 
02:18:04.830 --> 02:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
systems that are linked or how how they
 
02:18:06.349 --> 02:18:06.359 align:start position:0%
would be able to go do that so we'll
 
02:18:08.389 --> 02:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
reach out to somebody from safety thank
 
02:18:10.190 --> 02:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
you uh representative Ro you had a
 
02:18:12.950 --> 02:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman uh thank
 
02:18:15.030 --> 02:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
you representative I don't know if I'm
 
02:18:16.150 --> 02:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
looking at this wrong because it was
 
02:18:19.629 --> 02:18:19.639 align:start position:0%
just a real quick look over here but
 
02:18:21.629 --> 02:18:21.639 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a like basically a
 
02:18:26.469 --> 02:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:28.750 --> 02:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
about hold on I might be looking at it
 
02:18:30.950 --> 02:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
says prior to January 25 I was thinking
 
02:18:33.709 --> 02:18:33.719 align:start position:0%
it was supposed to take
 
02:18:38.830 --> 02:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
effect but that was getting but carry on
 
02:18:41.990 --> 02:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
okay question withdrawn um anyone
 
02:18:44.429 --> 02:18:44.439 align:start position:0%
else representative
 
02:18:46.629 --> 02:18:46.639 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
02:18:49.509 --> 02:18:49.519 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I recently had
 
02:18:53.629 --> 02:18:53.639 align:start position:0%
some friends of mine who were accepted
 
02:18:57.389 --> 02:18:57.399 align:start position:0%
to an apartment and then the landlord uh
 
02:18:59.990 --> 02:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
withdrew his offer after finding out
 
02:19:02.870 --> 02:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
that 10 years ago one of them had been
 
02:19:05.349 --> 02:19:05.359 align:start position:0%
charged with possession while he was in
 
02:19:07.589 --> 02:19:07.599 align:start position:0%
college um and those charges were later
 
02:19:09.709 --> 02:19:09.719 align:start position:0%
dropped and he was found not guilty but
 
02:19:11.509 --> 02:19:11.519 align:start position:0%
then it came up on the background report
 
02:19:14.190 --> 02:19:14.200 align:start position:0%
and so the landlord withdrew the offer
 
02:19:16.509 --> 02:19:16.519 align:start position:0%
to move into this apartment um would you
 
02:19:16.519 --> 02:19:17.830 align:start position:0%
to move into this apartment um would you
believe

02:19:17.830 --> 02:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
believe
 
02:19:20.030 --> 02:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
that well I'm asking more like do you
 
02:19:22.309 --> 02:19:22.319 align:start position:0%
think that this bill would address that
 
02:19:25.910 --> 02:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
slash like that analment clears the
 
02:19:27.549 --> 02:19:27.559 align:start position:0%
record enough that those kind of
 
02:19:28.870 --> 02:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
situations wouldn't happen because I
 
02:19:31.589 --> 02:19:31.599 align:start position:0%
know an nment will still leave something
 
02:19:33.150 --> 02:19:33.160 align:start position:0%
available on some records you know what
 
02:19:33.160 --> 02:19:34.549 align:start position:0%
available on some records you know what
I

02:19:34.549 --> 02:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:19:37.270 --> 02:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
mean I can't speak to that specific case
 
02:19:38.469 --> 02:19:38.479 align:start position:0%
but that's
 
02:19:41.150 --> 02:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
uh what I would say is the generalities
 
02:19:43.230 --> 02:19:43.240 align:start position:0%
of that case is why I'm bringing forward
 
02:19:44.469 --> 02:19:44.479 align:start position:0%
this legislation because you have
 
02:19:47.150 --> 02:19:47.160 align:start position:0%
situations where people but I'm you know
 
02:19:48.710 --> 02:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
in doing this legislation I was thinking
 
02:19:50.790 --> 02:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
more of people in my in my mother's
 
02:19:52.630 --> 02:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
ation but it's definitely college kids
 
02:19:54.910 --> 02:19:54.920 align:start position:0%
that were just there as well but people
 
02:19:56.670 --> 02:19:56.680 align:start position:0%
from you know the 80s and the 90s when
 
02:19:58.270 --> 02:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
this state was Prosecuting this this
 
02:20:01.429 --> 02:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
drug a little bit more um intensely a
 
02:20:03.910 --> 02:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
lot of a lot of bit more intensely um
 
02:20:06.750 --> 02:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
that it's people go through situations
 
02:20:08.190 --> 02:20:08.200 align:start position:0%
like that I'm not able to get my
 
02:20:09.790 --> 02:20:09.800 align:start position:0%
apartment I'm not able to get my loan
 
02:20:11.710 --> 02:20:11.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not able to get the job that I'm
 
02:20:13.150 --> 02:20:13.160 align:start position:0%
more than qualified for and they're
 
02:20:15.590 --> 02:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
looking forward to me being a part of
 
02:20:17.710 --> 02:20:17.720 align:start position:0%
I've heard anecdotes about that what I
 
02:20:20.950 --> 02:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
would say is the anulan I think would
 
02:20:23.110 --> 02:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
that situation there would be things
 
02:20:24.830 --> 02:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
left there would be a way to look at
 
02:20:27.270 --> 02:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
past records or you know you can't anull
 
02:20:31.230 --> 02:20:31.240 align:start position:0%
a uh a newspaper article you know but I
 
02:20:32.990 --> 02:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
think the fact that the court had come
 
02:20:35.230 --> 02:20:35.240 align:start position:0%
and said this is anold it gives that
 
02:20:36.750 --> 02:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
person the ability to go to that
 
02:20:40.429 --> 02:20:40.439 align:start position:0%
landlord or the uh boss at the job that
 
02:20:42.950 --> 02:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
they're looking for or the bank and say
 
02:20:45.110 --> 02:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
yes this did happen but I took the
 
02:20:48.469 --> 02:20:48.479 align:start position:0%
proactive step and the state assisted in
 
02:20:50.630 --> 02:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
getting me this annulment so that I have
 
02:20:52.590 --> 02:20:52.600 align:start position:0%
shown that I've been rehabilitated and
 
02:20:55.110 --> 02:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
I'm looking to move forward in life as a
 
02:20:58.309 --> 02:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
citizen participating in this community
 
02:20:59.349 --> 02:20:59.359 align:start position:0%
in the right
 
02:21:02.630 --> 02:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
way thank you I think to answer your
 
02:21:05.110 --> 02:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
question en nment would not be available
 
02:21:07.190 --> 02:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
for like a landlord or an employee to
 
02:21:09.510 --> 02:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
see employer but it would remain
 
02:21:11.270 --> 02:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
available for law enforcement to see if
 
02:21:12.830 --> 02:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
they were running a background check for
 
02:21:16.510 --> 02:21:16.520 align:start position:0%
that purposes um representative
 
02:21:19.510 --> 02:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
Sher just to add to that there is a law
 
02:21:20.950 --> 02:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
on New Hampshire law I don't have the
 
02:21:23.550 --> 02:21:23.560 align:start position:0%
the statute number right now that says
 
02:21:26.309 --> 02:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
uh you can't ask the question have you
 
02:21:28.750 --> 02:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
ever been convicted of a crime without
 
02:21:31.110 --> 02:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
asking without attaching that have you
 
02:21:33.110 --> 02:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
ever been convicted of a crime that
 
02:21:36.270 --> 02:21:36.280 align:start position:0%
hasn't been an olded so uh that's
 
02:21:38.950 --> 02:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
another layer to it I think um the
 
02:21:40.910 --> 02:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
housing issue though might be a federal
 
02:21:42.309 --> 02:21:42.319 align:start position:0%
thing like if you're applying for
 
02:21:45.270 --> 02:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
federal housing that yes you would be
 
02:21:47.389 --> 02:21:47.399 align:start position:0%
barred if you were applying for federal
 
02:21:48.830 --> 02:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
housing then that that would definitely
 
02:21:51.070 --> 02:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
be the case yeah exactly
 
02:21:53.230 --> 02:21:53.240 align:start position:0%
um see no further questions thank you
 
02:21:54.630 --> 02:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman for your
 
02:21:57.990 --> 02:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
time the committee good to see you as
 
02:22:08.070 --> 02:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:10.150 --> 02:22:10.160 align:start position:0%
Manion thank you Mr chair members of the
 
02:22:12.950 --> 02:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
committee uh so uh you guys in the last
 
02:22:14.590 --> 02:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
bill you were mentioning the ATF and I
 
02:22:15.990 --> 02:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
thought that was a really good point and
 
02:22:17.790 --> 02:22:17.800 align:start position:0%
that comes into play here when we have
 
02:22:20.910 --> 02:22:20.920 align:start position:0%
the ATF uh form um 4473
 
02:22:23.870 --> 02:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
where section 21f requires that you
 
02:22:26.030 --> 02:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
admit whether or not you are a cannabis
 
02:22:27.870 --> 02:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
user and that that disqualifies you from
 
02:22:30.990 --> 02:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
purchasing a firearm um so I think the
 
02:22:32.990 --> 02:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
en nment here is is a great way to
 
02:22:34.510 --> 02:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
protect your own ass against like
 
02:22:35.790 --> 02:22:35.800 align:start position:0%
whether or not the atf's going to come
 
02:22:37.670 --> 02:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
down on you like do a cross search
 
02:22:39.190 --> 02:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
against whatever may be in your history
 
02:22:40.870 --> 02:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
about cannabis use when you purchased a
 
02:22:43.510 --> 02:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
firearm because they can uh flag you as
 
02:22:45.990 --> 02:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
like for a felony if you lie on this
 
02:22:49.590 --> 02:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
form five years and like so like coming
 
02:22:51.230 --> 02:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
from my my persp persective I think that
 
02:22:52.830 --> 02:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
this bill does a great job of trying to
 
02:22:55.630 --> 02:22:55.640 align:start position:0%
protect people against uh you know they
 
02:22:58.030 --> 02:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
may not be aware that cannabis is is
 
02:22:59.349 --> 02:22:59.359 align:start position:0%
prohibited by the federal government you
 
02:23:02.710 --> 02:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
can't own a firearm if you're a cannabis
 
02:23:07.550 --> 02:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:20.710 --> 02:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:24.510 --> 02:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:37.110 --> 02:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:40.110 --> 02:23:40.120 align:start position:0%
are I promise you will only see me one
 
02:23:42.830 --> 02:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
other time today besides
 
02:23:46.429 --> 02:23:46.439 align:start position:0%
now so I my name obviously is Heather
 
02:23:49.590 --> 02:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
Marie Brown I am here in support of this
 
02:23:53.349 --> 02:23:53.359 align:start position:0%
bill uh this bill has actually uh this
 
02:23:56.990 --> 02:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
topic has actually impacted me uh
 
02:24:00.349 --> 02:24:00.359 align:start position:0%
personally uh so by the time before I
 
02:24:04.710 --> 02:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
graduated high school I was uh able to
 
02:24:06.910 --> 02:24:06.920 align:start position:0%
experience a program called the Epsom
 
02:24:09.550 --> 02:24:09.560 align:start position:0%
earn and learn program uh what that
 
02:24:12.630 --> 02:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
program did was it took High School uh
 
02:24:14.830 --> 02:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
students that were close to graduation
 
02:24:17.030 --> 02:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
and it gave them training in the field
 
02:24:20.190 --> 02:24:20.200 align:start position:0%
of uh certified nursing assistance with
 
02:24:23.910 --> 02:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
a specialty in geriatric care uh it had
 
02:24:26.630 --> 02:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
always been a lifelong dream of mine
 
02:24:28.750 --> 02:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
ever since I was a small child to be
 
02:24:31.710 --> 02:24:31.720 align:start position:0%
involved in the medical field even now I
 
02:24:33.510 --> 02:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
still dream of being involved in the
 
02:24:37.670 --> 02:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
medical field uh by the time I was uh
 
02:24:39.469 --> 02:24:39.479 align:start position:0%
before I even graduated high school I
 
02:24:41.429 --> 02:24:41.439 align:start position:0%
was licensed by the state of New
 
02:24:43.389 --> 02:24:43.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as a certified nursing
 
02:24:48.790 --> 02:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
assistant my plan was to experience that
 
02:24:51.750 --> 02:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
and to work in that realm for a few
 
02:24:54.349 --> 02:24:54.359 align:start position:0%
years and then use the abilities that
 
02:24:58.110 --> 02:24:58.120 align:start position:0%
the job gave me to be able to pursue a
 
02:25:00.830 --> 02:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
um a better career in nursing my goal
 
02:25:04.230 --> 02:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
was to take each of the steps necessary
 
02:25:07.830 --> 02:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
to move up the ladder so that ultimately
 
02:25:10.790 --> 02:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
I could be in a wonderful position where
 
02:25:13.230 --> 02:25:13.240 align:start position:0%
I was working hand inand with patients
 
02:25:15.750 --> 02:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
and I was giving that love and comfort
 
02:25:18.630 --> 02:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
and support and medical care that I so
 
02:25:21.150 --> 02:25:21.160 align:start position:0%
desperately wanted to give
 
02:25:25.269 --> 02:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
uh unfortunately because of a couple of
 
02:25:29.870 --> 02:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
cannabis arrests uh one of them included
 
02:25:32.230 --> 02:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
uh this was probably my favorite um I
 
02:25:36.870 --> 02:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
had a bowl on me and I was not charged
 
02:25:39.590 --> 02:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
with paraphernalia I was charged with
 
02:25:43.429 --> 02:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
possession because the bowl was dirty so
 
02:25:45.990 --> 02:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
therefore I was in possession of
 
02:25:48.269 --> 02:25:48.279 align:start position:0%
cannabis it made the charge a little
 
02:25:49.630 --> 02:25:49.640 align:start position:0%
heavier and a little bit more
 
02:25:51.670 --> 02:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
substantial and it sure cost me a lot
 
02:25:55.230 --> 02:25:55.240 align:start position:0%
more money in the long run um so I have
 
02:25:58.790 --> 02:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
a couple of small arrests on my record I
 
02:26:01.269 --> 02:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
was extremely excited when the first
 
02:26:03.349 --> 02:26:03.359 align:start position:0%
bill passed and that it became a
 
02:26:05.630 --> 02:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
possibility for me to possibly get an
 
02:26:07.990 --> 02:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
analment because that meant that I could
 
02:26:11.150 --> 02:26:11.160 align:start position:0%
continue moving forward in the medical
 
02:26:13.750 --> 02:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
field um unfortunately when you have
 
02:26:15.870 --> 02:26:15.880 align:start position:0%
drug convictions you're they really
 
02:26:17.710 --> 02:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
frown upon that and you're not allowed
 
02:26:21.590 --> 02:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
to move forward in in that area
 
02:26:26.150 --> 02:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
um so when the law went into effect I I
 
02:26:28.110 --> 02:26:28.120 align:start position:0%
looked into it and I've looked into it a
 
02:26:30.150 --> 02:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
few times in hopes that maybe the
 
02:26:32.830 --> 02:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
process had changed but it was such a
 
02:26:36.870 --> 02:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:39.710 --> 02:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
ridiculously Indescribable process to be
 
02:26:41.790 --> 02:26:41.800 align:start position:0%
able to go through it even with working
 
02:26:44.429 --> 02:26:44.439 align:start position:0%
with the court with the clerks at the
 
02:26:46.790 --> 02:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
courthouse there was still confusion
 
02:26:49.590 --> 02:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
from them and the bottom line was that
 
02:26:52.670 --> 02:26:52.680 align:start position:0%
it was going to cost me more money
 
02:26:54.030 --> 02:26:54.040 align:start position:0%
because of having to file with the
 
02:26:55.870 --> 02:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
courts and then having to file with this
 
02:26:58.190 --> 02:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
person and that person and this person
 
02:26:59.990 --> 02:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
it was going to cost me more money that
 
02:27:03.710 --> 02:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
I just unfortunately didn't have I am
 
02:27:06.070 --> 02:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
considered a low-income individual in
 
02:27:08.750 --> 02:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
the state I wish that my circumstances
 
02:27:10.750 --> 02:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
were different but they weren't so it
 
02:27:12.389 --> 02:27:12.399 align:start position:0%
became a choice do I get my record
 
02:27:15.030 --> 02:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
analed or do I pay my bills for this
 
02:27:17.110 --> 02:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
month and keep a roof over my head or do
 
02:27:19.710 --> 02:27:19.720 align:start position:0%
I buy groceries or things like that I
 
02:27:22.630 --> 02:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
think that that this bill and and I hate
 
02:27:24.510 --> 02:27:24.520 align:start position:0%
to use the term but it's almost like a
 
02:27:27.230 --> 02:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
cleanup bill it alleviates those
 
02:27:30.349 --> 02:27:30.359 align:start position:0%
problems that stood in the way I know
 
02:27:33.190 --> 02:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely no one that has been able to
 
02:27:36.750 --> 02:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
utilize the analment process and
 
02:27:39.710 --> 02:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
actually get some place with it um this
 
02:27:43.269 --> 02:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
cleans it up this allows for people to
 
02:27:45.670 --> 02:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
get a second chance this allows someone
 
02:27:46.670 --> 02:27:46.680 align:start position:0%
such as
 
02:27:49.750 --> 02:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
myself to possibly move forward into
 
02:27:51.950 --> 02:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
better my circumstances and create a
 
02:27:53.790 --> 02:27:53.800 align:start position:0%
better future and outcome for my
 
02:27:55.990 --> 02:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
children you know there there are all
 
02:27:57.790 --> 02:27:57.800 align:start position:0%
sorts of studies out there that show
 
02:27:59.550 --> 02:27:59.560 align:start position:0%
that children brought up in low-income
 
02:28:02.190 --> 02:28:02.200 align:start position:0%
families they have less chances at a
 
02:28:04.750 --> 02:28:04.760 align:start position:0%
better future unfortunately and you know
 
02:28:06.550 --> 02:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
that's something I never wanted to pass
 
02:28:10.309 --> 02:28:10.319 align:start position:0%
on to my children or my family um I want
 
02:28:13.630 --> 02:28:13.640 align:start position:0%
to be able to get my charges inal I want
 
02:28:16.150 --> 02:28:16.160 align:start position:0%
to be able to move forward with my life
 
02:28:18.910 --> 02:28:18.920 align:start position:0%
I want to be able to seek out housing
 
02:28:22.469 --> 02:28:22.479 align:start position:0%
employment and even education I couldn't
 
02:28:24.670 --> 02:28:24.680 align:start position:0%
even attend some of the courses I wanted
 
02:28:26.870 --> 02:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
to attend because of that criminal
 
02:28:29.990 --> 02:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
aspect record of mine so I hope that you
 
02:28:31.990 --> 02:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
will support this bill I hope you'll
 
02:28:34.510 --> 02:28:34.520 align:start position:0%
vote it and move it forward and I think
 
02:28:36.990 --> 02:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
that it'll have a huge impact and really
 
02:28:39.469 --> 02:28:39.479 align:start position:0%
be able to change the lives of so many
 
02:28:41.870 --> 02:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
individuals within the
 
02:28:45.309 --> 02:28:45.319 align:start position:0%
state thank you um see no questions
 
02:28:49.030 --> 02:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:59.870 --> 02:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:02.110 --> 02:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
H good
 
02:29:06.070 --> 02:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
afternoon um Joe Hannah again um it's
 
02:29:07.469 --> 02:29:07.479 align:start position:0%
been said a lot so I'll probably be
 
02:29:08.750 --> 02:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
brief on those but we know about public
 
02:29:11.110 --> 02:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
housing student loans limited job
 
02:29:12.910 --> 02:29:12.920 align:start position:0%
opportunities professional lure that's
 
02:29:16.269 --> 02:29:16.279 align:start position:0%
been denied but um you know the only
 
02:29:17.750 --> 02:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
reason we've been here discussing this
 
02:29:20.950 --> 02:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
is because cannabis laws have been
 
02:29:24.269 --> 02:29:24.279 align:start position:0%
uh not strictly enforced across the
 
02:29:25.630 --> 02:29:25.640 align:start position:0%
country across
 
02:29:28.150 --> 02:29:28.160 align:start position:0%
demographics and the people that do get
 
02:29:30.349 --> 02:29:30.359 align:start position:0%
arrested for it and have convictions are
 
02:29:31.990 --> 02:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely in the minority of people who
 
02:29:34.990 --> 02:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
use cannabis in 2021 it was estimated
 
02:29:36.550 --> 02:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
there were 52 and a half million people
 
02:29:39.269 --> 02:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
in the US about 19% of Americans had
 
02:29:41.870 --> 02:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
used cannabis at least once uh that
 
02:29:43.870 --> 02:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
number was substantially higher for
 
02:29:45.429 --> 02:29:45.439 align:start position:0%
those between 19 and
 
02:29:49.510 --> 02:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
30 in federal prisons there were only in
 
02:29:51.750 --> 02:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
federal courts there were only 145
 
02:29:54.309 --> 02:29:54.319 align:start position:0%
Federal simple possession offenders in
 
02:29:56.190 --> 02:29:56.200 align:start position:0%
that had been convicted at all in the
 
02:29:58.790 --> 02:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
whole country out of 51 52 and a half
 
02:30:01.070 --> 02:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
million people that were using it so
 
02:30:02.230 --> 02:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
we're talking a very small number at the
 
02:30:03.349 --> 02:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
federal level most of the people that
 
02:30:05.309 --> 02:30:05.319 align:start position:0%
were in jail are at the state level
 
02:30:08.110 --> 02:30:08.120 align:start position:0%
obviously um in 22 the president at the
 
02:30:10.790 --> 02:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
time pardoned uh all simple possession
 
02:30:12.670 --> 02:30:12.680 align:start position:0%
charges I believe and there were a total
 
02:30:14.030 --> 02:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
and dating back I think I forget the
 
02:30:15.870 --> 02:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
year was many many years they went back
 
02:30:18.349 --> 02:30:18.359 align:start position:0%
to the early 90s or 80s even and it was
 
02:30:20.230 --> 02:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
about 6,557
 
02:30:22.110 --> 02:30:22.120 align:start position:0%
people that were pardoned uh those
 
02:30:23.790 --> 02:30:23.800 align:start position:0%
pardons have continued at the the
 
02:30:26.429 --> 02:30:26.439 align:start position:0%
presidential level but states have also
 
02:30:28.070 --> 02:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh gone out of their way to to write
 
02:30:31.910 --> 02:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
this wrong um we wouldn't have any we
 
02:30:33.230 --> 02:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be having any legalization
 
02:30:34.990 --> 02:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
bills any discussion on this whatsoever
 
02:30:36.510 --> 02:30:36.520 align:start position:0%
if it was strictly enforce President
 
02:30:38.510 --> 02:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
Lincoln said the best way to get a bad
 
02:30:40.630 --> 02:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
law repealed is to enforce it strictly
 
02:30:42.349 --> 02:30:42.359 align:start position:0%
this law has been stepped around and
 
02:30:43.790 --> 02:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
tiptoed and we only arrest certain
 
02:30:44.990 --> 02:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
people that aren't going to complain and
 
02:30:46.870 --> 02:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
make a big stink we've had how many
 
02:30:48.790 --> 02:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
presidents have admitted to smoking
 
02:30:51.110 --> 02:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
cannabis or even doing stronger drugs
 
02:30:53.510 --> 02:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
like cocaine or other drugs if they had
 
02:30:54.710 --> 02:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
been arrested would they have been if
 
02:30:55.830 --> 02:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
they had been arrested and convicted
 
02:30:57.230 --> 02:30:57.240 align:start position:0%
would any of those individuals be
 
02:30:59.389 --> 02:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
president how many CEOs wouldn't be a
 
02:31:01.070 --> 02:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
CEO of a company or how many doctors or
 
02:31:02.309 --> 02:31:02.319 align:start position:0%
nurses wouldn't be practicing and
 
02:31:05.750 --> 02:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
helping people and saving lives um we
 
02:31:08.269 --> 02:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
are going over a very we're you think
 
02:31:10.070 --> 02:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
we're just you know granting amnesty to
 
02:31:12.150 --> 02:31:12.160 align:start position:0%
everyone who's been convicted but you
 
02:31:14.830 --> 02:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
and I most of us in this room were not
 
02:31:16.870 --> 02:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
those people or may may have been but
 
02:31:19.510 --> 02:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
they they don't Target um people that
 
02:31:20.950 --> 02:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
are going to come to conquered and stand
 
02:31:22.950 --> 02:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
up to fight for themselves usually they
 
02:31:24.429 --> 02:31:24.439 align:start position:0%
don't they don't Target people who are
 
02:31:26.230 --> 02:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
going to make us stink and I think it's
 
02:31:28.750 --> 02:31:28.760 align:start position:0%
wrong that we have this uh law that says
 
02:31:30.150 --> 02:31:30.160 align:start position:0%
you know we're not going to charge you
 
02:31:31.190 --> 02:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
and throw you into prison we're just
 
02:31:32.590 --> 02:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
going to give you a fine now and we're
 
02:31:34.309 --> 02:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
still going to say that's that stain
 
02:31:35.870 --> 02:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
should be on your record like a Scarlet
 
02:31:37.230 --> 02:31:37.240 align:start position:0%
Letter and everyone should know about it
 
02:31:39.190 --> 02:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
so you can't get a job you know you walk
 
02:31:40.190 --> 02:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
down the street and see a homeless
 
02:31:41.309 --> 02:31:41.319 align:start position:0%
person and we go well why don't they get
 
02:31:43.110 --> 02:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
a job why don't they get off their feet
 
02:31:45.349 --> 02:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
you know they can't get public housing
 
02:31:47.510 --> 02:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
they can't get a college education
 
02:31:49.590 --> 02:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
student loan you know we make it harder
 
02:31:51.469 --> 02:31:51.479 align:start position:0%
to keep people down because of these so
 
02:31:53.910 --> 02:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
the very least we can do is to anull the
 
02:31:55.710 --> 02:31:55.720 align:start position:0%
convictions of people who are at The
 
02:31:58.550 --> 02:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
Fringe of society as far as convictions
 
02:32:00.150 --> 02:32:00.160 align:start position:0%
are concerned the number of people using
 
02:32:01.710 --> 02:32:01.720 align:start position:0%
cannabis it's hypocritical to even put
 
02:32:04.910 --> 02:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
one person in jail or 6500 some people
 
02:32:06.550 --> 02:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
in jail in federal prisons over many
 
02:32:07.870 --> 02:32:07.880 align:start position:0%
years when we've had millions and
 
02:32:09.510 --> 02:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
millions of people using this with
 
02:32:11.990 --> 02:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
impunity in some cases and I'm not going
 
02:32:13.590 --> 02:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
to talk about specifics but I was you
 
02:32:14.950 --> 02:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
know I've talked to reps who was said
 
02:32:16.510 --> 02:32:16.520 align:start position:0%
well I was a kid and you know we got
 
02:32:18.150 --> 02:32:18.160 align:start position:0%
pulled over and no they didn't find the
 
02:32:19.389 --> 02:32:19.399 align:start position:0%
they they found the marijuana they let
 
02:32:21.429 --> 02:32:21.439 align:start position:0%
us go luckily didn't find our cocaine
 
02:32:22.830 --> 02:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
you know I've heard these stories from
 
02:32:24.830 --> 02:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
people in not this room none of you
 
02:32:27.429 --> 02:32:27.439 align:start position:0%
don't get upset um I've heard these
 
02:32:29.150 --> 02:32:29.160 align:start position:0%
stories not just one but multiple
 
02:32:30.990 --> 02:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
stories like that from people elected to
 
02:32:33.190 --> 02:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
office they wouldn't have been here if
 
02:32:35.429 --> 02:32:35.439 align:start position:0%
that police officer says well you look
 
02:32:37.230 --> 02:32:37.240 align:start position:0%
like a you know like a troublemaker or
 
02:32:38.670 --> 02:32:38.680 align:start position:0%
someone I don't particularly like the
 
02:32:40.230 --> 02:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
looks of so I'm going to arrest you for
 
02:32:41.830 --> 02:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
this simple possession offense they
 
02:32:42.950 --> 02:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
didn't even know about the cocaine they
 
02:32:44.429 --> 02:32:44.439 align:start position:0%
ared them for that and they wouldn't be
 
02:32:46.990 --> 02:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
here today so I I think about you know
 
02:32:49.070 --> 02:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
we've all made mistakes in our lives if
 
02:32:51.230 --> 02:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
if I had been convicted if I got charged
 
02:32:52.950 --> 02:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
for any of the stuff I did as a teenager
 
02:32:55.230 --> 02:32:55.240 align:start position:0%
you know luckily most of us in here were
 
02:32:56.750 --> 02:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
not didn't have video cameras when we
 
02:32:59.110 --> 02:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
were in high school and college um but
 
02:33:01.389 --> 02:33:01.399 align:start position:0%
think about what would you do today if
 
02:33:03.070 --> 02:33:03.080 align:start position:0%
your life had been drastically changed
 
02:33:04.269 --> 02:33:04.279 align:start position:0%
what would you what would you be like
 
02:33:06.550 --> 02:33:06.560 align:start position:0%
today if you had a conviction at a young
 
02:33:09.550 --> 02:33:09.560 align:start position:0%
age or even you know now would you want
 
02:33:12.030 --> 02:33:12.040 align:start position:0%
that to stand for a for a crime that is
 
02:33:13.790 --> 02:33:13.800 align:start position:0%
no longer a crime in some in some
 
02:33:15.349 --> 02:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
situations or is just a misdemeanor in
 
02:33:17.550 --> 02:33:17.560 align:start position:0%
the state and I I'd like you to think
 
02:33:20.389 --> 02:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
about that personally and vote
 
02:33:25.349 --> 02:33:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:28.389 --> 02:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
questions uh for for what it's worth uh
 
02:33:30.750 --> 02:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
a few years ago not too many years ago
 
02:33:33.990 --> 02:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
um I did a study uh I looked at um all
 
02:33:36.070 --> 02:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
the licensing boards in the state of New
 
02:33:38.429 --> 02:33:38.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh to see what questions they
 
02:33:40.550 --> 02:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
asked about criminal
 
02:33:44.790 --> 02:33:44.800 align:start position:0%
convictions uh it was revealing in that
 
02:33:48.590 --> 02:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
many many uh uh asked question would
 
02:33:50.230 --> 02:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
would not uh
 
02:33:54.389 --> 02:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
allow uh uh a li to Grant a license uh
 
02:33:56.309 --> 02:33:56.319 align:start position:0%
if you had any criminal conviction like
 
02:33:57.389 --> 02:33:57.399 align:start position:0%
if you
 
02:34:00.269 --> 02:34:00.279 align:start position:0%
were Wilderness guide and you had a
 
02:34:02.070 --> 02:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
criminal conviction you couldn't get a
 
02:34:05.349 --> 02:34:05.359 align:start position:0%
license since then as a part A a result
 
02:34:09.510 --> 02:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
of that study the uh uh the licensing
 
02:34:12.309 --> 02:34:12.319 align:start position:0%
organization in the state um the office
 
02:34:16.710 --> 02:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
of Licensing I forgot the acronym has
 
02:34:19.070 --> 02:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
gone through all the licensing board
 
02:34:19.080 --> 02:34:20.389 align:start position:0%
gone through all the licensing board
application

02:34:20.389 --> 02:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
application
 
02:34:22.389 --> 02:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
and they've made a significant number of
 
02:34:25.389 --> 02:34:25.399 align:start position:0%
changes as to what if any criminal
 
02:34:27.269 --> 02:34:27.279 align:start position:0%
convictions they're even going to ask
 
02:34:32.190 --> 02:34:32.200 align:start position:0%
about so um I I just want to get that
 
02:34:35.550 --> 02:34:35.560 align:start position:0%
out on the table so you know that I I'd
 
02:34:38.710 --> 02:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
love to believe that I I think I I I I
 
02:34:40.110 --> 02:34:40.120 align:start position:0%
believe you I'm not doubting you but I
 
02:34:44.510 --> 02:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
so is that true I I I you're the expert
 
02:34:46.389 --> 02:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
I believe it
 
02:34:49.910 --> 02:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh so the answer is I would believe him
 
02:34:52.110 --> 02:34:52.120 align:start position:0%
thank you um but I also I also think
 
02:34:54.710 --> 02:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
that it's important to to realize that
 
02:34:57.269 --> 02:34:57.279 align:start position:0%
um it's not just the professional
 
02:34:59.150 --> 02:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
licenser there's a stigma associated
 
02:35:01.630 --> 02:35:01.640 align:start position:0%
with it you know um we love to hang the
 
02:35:03.710 --> 02:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
you know we've seen people say oh
 
02:35:05.910 --> 02:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
they're a felon whatever it it changes
 
02:35:08.030 --> 02:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
your opinion of someone and that changes
 
02:35:10.269 --> 02:35:10.279 align:start position:0%
not just those concrete things we
 
02:35:11.910 --> 02:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned like jobs and housing but it
 
02:35:13.309 --> 02:35:13.319 align:start position:0%
it changes how we interact with people
 
02:35:15.510 --> 02:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
in society unfortunately and I think
 
02:35:16.990 --> 02:35:17.000 align:start position:0%
that's very important that we get away
 
02:35:18.990 --> 02:35:19.000 align:start position:0%
from that uh none of us is better than
 
02:35:20.910 --> 02:35:20.920 align:start position:0%
anybody else I don't think we should you
 
02:35:22.790 --> 02:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
know labels are bad enough we don't need
 
02:35:24.150 --> 02:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
uh Scarlet letters hanging around your
 
02:35:25.389 --> 02:35:25.399 align:start position:0%
neck for the rest of I mean there was a
 
02:35:26.550 --> 02:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
book about it I had to read it in grade
 
02:35:29.110 --> 02:35:29.120 align:start position:0%
school or middle middle school and it's
 
02:35:30.710 --> 02:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
still there we we're not we've not
 
02:35:33.590 --> 02:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
gotten rid of that concept for like I
 
02:35:35.349 --> 02:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
said we're talking about very few people
 
02:35:36.590 --> 02:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
that get the people that get convicted
 
02:35:37.950 --> 02:35:37.960 align:start position:0%
are not the average person if they
 
02:35:40.469 --> 02:35:40.479 align:start position:0%
arrested everybody that did it it
 
02:35:41.429 --> 02:35:41.439 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be against the law because
 
02:35:51.030 --> 02:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:51.040 --> 02:35:52.870 align:start position:0%
 
chair

02:35:52.870 --> 02:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:36:05.429 --> 02:36:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:09.670 --> 02:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
catalo sorry I she told me Sergeant it's
 
02:36:20.349 --> 02:36:20.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:22.269 --> 02:36:22.279 align:start position:0%
apologies chairman members of the
 
02:36:23.550 --> 02:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
committee my uh written testimony is
 
02:36:24.870 --> 02:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
being passed around it is in reference
 
02:36:27.429 --> 02:36:27.439 align:start position:0%
to the original bill so feel free to
 
02:36:30.230 --> 02:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
read it but a lot of that is uh now moot
 
02:36:31.790 --> 02:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
um I'm here on behalf of New Hampshire
 
02:36:33.469 --> 02:36:33.479 align:start position:0%
association's Chiefs of police and uh we
 
02:36:35.150 --> 02:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
are opposed to this bill I had a chance
 
02:36:38.150 --> 02:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
to look over the amended um bill which
 
02:36:41.230 --> 02:36:41.240 align:start position:0%
I'll speak to now um so we would still
 
02:36:42.950 --> 02:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
be opposed to this and and the primary
 
02:36:46.389 --> 02:36:46.399 align:start position:0%
reason is the implementation of sweeping
 
02:36:50.830 --> 02:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
annulments for Mr meter and violation um
 
02:36:53.349 --> 02:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
level offenses for cannabis uh first of
 
02:36:55.630 --> 02:36:55.640 align:start position:0%
all there's already an analment law that
 
02:36:58.429 --> 02:36:58.439 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you're all aware of um that
 
02:37:00.750 --> 02:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
allows people to petition and receive an
 
02:37:04.230 --> 02:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
analment for the decriminalized amount
 
02:37:08.309 --> 02:37:08.319 align:start position:0%
um which is 3/4 of an ounce 21 Grams um
 
02:37:09.950 --> 02:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
we feel that's
 
02:37:11.870 --> 02:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
inappropriate law in the books it's
 
02:37:13.710 --> 02:37:13.720 align:start position:0%
already addressed and people have the
 
02:37:16.830 --> 02:37:16.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do that um the sweeping
 
02:37:18.349 --> 02:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
analment of all misdemeanor and
 
02:37:20.150 --> 02:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
violation level offenses
 
02:37:22.950 --> 02:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
is in our view not the purpose of
 
02:37:24.950 --> 02:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
annulments which we believe are for
 
02:37:26.550 --> 02:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
people who are seeking Rehabilitation to
 
02:37:28.790 --> 02:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
move on with their lives to take steps
 
02:37:32.110 --> 02:37:32.120 align:start position:0%
to do that doing this widespread
 
02:37:35.030 --> 02:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
analment um kind of Loops everybody in
 
02:37:36.590 --> 02:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
people that may have had numerous
 
02:37:39.790 --> 02:37:39.800 align:start position:0%
offenses extensive criminal records um
 
02:37:41.230 --> 02:37:41.240 align:start position:0%
you really don't know the people that
 
02:37:42.870 --> 02:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
you're analing where the process we have
 
02:37:44.590 --> 02:37:44.600 align:start position:0%
now in the law that is on the books is
 
02:37:47.750 --> 02:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
much more Case by casee and intentional
 
02:37:49.590 --> 02:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
um and we just feel that's far more
 
02:37:51.590 --> 02:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate I haven't had a chance to
 
02:37:55.429 --> 02:37:55.439 align:start position:0%
read this bill in depth but that's for
 
02:37:57.790 --> 02:37:57.800 align:start position:0%
what I have seen so far um what I'm
 
02:37:59.550 --> 02:37:59.560 align:start position:0%
comfortable testifying to at this point
 
02:38:01.230 --> 02:38:01.240 align:start position:0%
any questions I'll be happy to
 
02:38:03.630 --> 02:38:03.640 align:start position:0%
answer thank you we heard testimony that
 
02:38:05.750 --> 02:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
the current en nment process can be both
 
02:38:07.910 --> 02:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
expensive and complicated what is your
 
02:38:10.150 --> 02:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
understanding of that I obviously
 
02:38:11.550 --> 02:38:11.560 align:start position:0%
haven't I haven't been through it um
 
02:38:13.190 --> 02:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
reading it I mean it seems pretty
 
02:38:14.550 --> 02:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
straight forward it allows for petition
 
02:38:16.309 --> 02:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
to the court what happens after that
 
02:38:19.150 --> 02:38:19.160 align:start position:0%
petition um I'm not sure if it if that
 
02:38:21.349 --> 02:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
is the case and that could be addressed
 
02:38:23.870 --> 02:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
separately than making it simpler making
 
02:38:25.429 --> 02:38:25.439 align:start position:0%
it easier making it more accessible to
 
02:38:28.070 --> 02:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
people rather than this kind of what I
 
02:38:29.870 --> 02:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
feel is a more drastic step is these
 
02:38:32.349 --> 02:38:32.359 align:start position:0%
sweeping annulments um which like you
 
02:38:34.429 --> 02:38:34.439 align:start position:0%
said chairman puts which another issue
 
02:38:36.190 --> 02:38:36.200 align:start position:0%
puts quite a bit of bonus on the
 
02:38:38.230 --> 02:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
department of safety to do which I'm not
 
02:38:39.870 --> 02:38:39.880 align:start position:0%
even sure would be fully possible I
 
02:38:41.030 --> 02:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
don't I'm not sure that they would be
 
02:38:44.190 --> 02:38:44.200 align:start position:0%
able to do it either um and to your
 
02:38:46.870 --> 02:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
point so if someone could be
 
02:38:50.590 --> 02:38:50.600 align:start position:0%
theoretically an active um
 
02:38:52.389 --> 02:38:52.399 align:start position:0%
not only drug user but involved in
 
02:38:55.150 --> 02:38:55.160 align:start position:0%
various crimes and automatically
 
02:38:57.670 --> 02:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
received this analment is that your
 
02:39:00.630 --> 02:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
understanding uh reading the bill I have
 
02:39:01.550 --> 02:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
in front of me and it was in the
 
02:39:03.830 --> 02:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
testimony yeah these are seems pretty
 
02:39:05.590 --> 02:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
clear convictions and arrest for Mr M
 
02:39:07.230 --> 02:39:07.240 align:start position:0%
violation pH possession of cannabis
 
02:39:09.230 --> 02:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
prior to the January 1st date shall be
 
02:39:12.910 --> 02:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
annulled um with no qualifiers as far as
 
02:39:15.269 --> 02:39:15.279 align:start position:0%
um criminal records ongoing Behavior
 
02:39:16.389 --> 02:39:16.399 align:start position:0%
anything like
 
02:39:20.309 --> 02:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
that thank you any further questions
 
02:39:23.070 --> 02:39:23.080 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
02:39:25.030 --> 02:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
pette thank you I just have a quick
 
02:39:28.710 --> 02:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
question um it says remove misdemeanor
 
02:39:31.469 --> 02:39:31.479 align:start position:0%
and violation level offenses what is the
 
02:39:33.030 --> 02:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
difference between those two as it
 
02:39:35.590 --> 02:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
applies to this specifically so
 
02:39:38.150 --> 02:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor would be like as the law
 
02:39:39.910 --> 02:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
stands now it's anything above that 3/4
 
02:39:42.630 --> 02:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
of an ounce would be an arrest so 21
 
02:39:45.150 --> 02:39:45.160 align:start position:0%
gram which I mean anyone's familiar with
 
02:39:47.150 --> 02:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
usual level amounts of marijuana I mean
 
02:39:49.550 --> 02:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
I think people typically smoke half a
 
02:39:51.910 --> 02:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
gram up to a couple grams at a time so
 
02:39:54.349 --> 02:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
if people are in possession of over 21
 
02:39:58.269 --> 02:39:58.279 align:start position:0%
gram that is quite a significant amount
 
02:40:00.550 --> 02:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
um and that would be the misdemeanor
 
02:40:02.870 --> 02:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
anything below that right now is a
 
02:40:04.590 --> 02:40:04.600 align:start position:0%
violation which is essentially a ticket
 
02:40:06.030 --> 02:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
similar what you get when you do traffic
 
02:40:08.309 --> 02:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
infractions those are also violations um
 
02:40:11.429 --> 02:40:11.439 align:start position:0%
so this bill would anull not only the
 
02:40:13.190 --> 02:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
violations but all the misdemeanors for
 
02:40:16.910 --> 02:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
people in possession of above that thank
 
02:40:22.389 --> 02:40:22.399 align:start position:0%
you if you're aware do they uh is is a
 
02:40:24.190 --> 02:40:24.200 align:start position:0%
private company or an employee or
 
02:40:25.550 --> 02:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
anything like that do they have access
 
02:40:29.510 --> 02:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
to violations on a record check not that
 
02:40:31.790 --> 02:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of I I can't speak firmly on
 
02:40:33.510 --> 02:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
that sir but uh not that I'm aware of

03:32:31.870 --> 03:32:31.880 align:start position:0%
could ask everybody to find their seats
 
03:32:34.710 --> 03:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
we can settle in to start our
 
03:32:43.389 --> 03:32:43.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:50.070 --> 03:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:52.870 --> 03:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
I am opening the hearing for House Bill
 
03:32:56.790 --> 03:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
198 and I welcome the sponsor
 
03:32:56.800 --> 03:32:57.990 align:start position:0%
198 and I welcome the sponsor
representative

03:32:57.990 --> 03:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:33:00.510 --> 03:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
Sullivan introduce the
 
03:33:03.389 --> 03:33:03.399 align:start position:0%
bill hi there U Madam chair thank you
 
03:33:06.910 --> 03:33:06.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my my uh testimony and
 
03:33:09.910 --> 03:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
presentation of the bill so um for those
 
03:33:11.630 --> 03:33:11.640 align:start position:0%
of you that were here last year we all
 
03:33:13.349 --> 03:33:13.359 align:start position:0%
know there was a bit of drama and back
 
03:33:14.910 --> 03:33:14.920 align:start position:0%
and forth with respect to cannabis
 
03:33:19.389 --> 03:33:19.399 align:start position:0%
legalization in New Hampshire and so you
 
03:33:21.710 --> 03:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
know I um wanted to take the lead on
 
03:33:23.429 --> 03:33:23.439 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
03:33:25.910 --> 03:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
legalize for
 
03:33:28.150 --> 03:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
possession Legalize It In the state but
 
03:33:31.309 --> 03:33:31.319 align:start position:0%
this does not deal with the selling so
 
03:33:32.830 --> 03:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
what I learned through this journey of
 
03:33:34.750 --> 03:33:34.760 align:start position:0%
the last couple years is that many
 
03:33:37.590 --> 03:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire and in this body
 
03:33:39.269 --> 03:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
and even on the other side of the aisle
 
03:33:42.389 --> 03:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
in the Senate they they um by and large
 
03:33:44.349 --> 03:33:44.359 align:start position:0%
seem to be supportive of no longer
 
03:33:46.710 --> 03:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
arresting people and
 
03:33:48.710 --> 03:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
um essentially ruining certain people's
 
03:33:50.070 --> 03:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
lives for something that by and large
 
03:33:52.590 --> 03:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
many people in our society have grown to
 
03:33:55.110 --> 03:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
accept the the consumption of of
 
03:33:58.590 --> 03:33:58.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis by by responsible adults but it
 
03:33:59.830 --> 03:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
remains illegal in New Hampshire we're
 
03:34:02.110 --> 03:34:02.120 align:start position:0%
an island in New England and so the goal
 
03:34:03.870 --> 03:34:03.880 align:start position:0%
here is to not get caught up in what has
 
03:34:06.830 --> 03:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
been our stumbling block for the last
 
03:34:08.349 --> 03:34:08.359 align:start position:0%
well two years that I've been here but
 
03:34:10.790 --> 03:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
also prior to that is how we sell it and
 
03:34:12.870 --> 03:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
regulate it so this doesn't touch that
 
03:34:14.550 --> 03:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
the goal of this is simply to legalize
 
03:34:17.710 --> 03:34:17.720 align:start position:0%
this and allow for uh reasonable
 
03:34:19.469 --> 03:34:19.479 align:start position:0%
quantities of possession which is 2
 
03:34:22.269 --> 03:34:22.279 align:start position:0%
ounces um it's it prohibits things like
 
03:34:24.469 --> 03:34:24.479 align:start position:0%
smoking in public I spoke to some
 
03:34:26.750 --> 03:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
Senators when I was drafting this and
 
03:34:29.229 --> 03:34:29.239 align:start position:0%
they were concerned about public smoking
 
03:34:31.510 --> 03:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
so I put that in here uh hopefully that
 
03:34:33.469 --> 03:34:33.479 align:start position:0%
will appease some of the concerns that
 
03:34:35.349 --> 03:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
some people have with respect to people
 
03:34:37.750 --> 03:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
smoking and potentially secondhand smoke
 
03:34:39.750 --> 03:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
and then uh some of the concerns that
 
03:34:42.229 --> 03:34:42.239 align:start position:0%
come from that with respect to uh public
 
03:34:45.830 --> 03:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
consumption of cannabis um I think it's
 
03:34:47.750 --> 03:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
important to understand this language is
 
03:34:49.790 --> 03:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
very similar almost identical to the
 
03:34:52.070 --> 03:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
language that the house passed and sent
 
03:34:53.990 --> 03:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
to the Senate last year and then was
 
03:34:57.389 --> 03:34:57.399 align:start position:0%
sent back to us um for the concur motion
 
03:35:00.070 --> 03:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
at the end of last term uh in terms of
 
03:35:02.070 --> 03:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
the legalization bill so this this is
 
03:35:04.150 --> 03:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
very similar language with very minor
 
03:35:07.429 --> 03:35:07.439 align:start position:0%
tweaks and uh also there is precedent
 
03:35:09.229 --> 03:35:09.239 align:start position:0%
for this method where we legalize
 
03:35:11.710 --> 03:35:11.720 align:start position:0%
without without regulating how to sell
 
03:35:14.950 --> 03:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
it first Vermont did the same thing they
 
03:35:16.590 --> 03:35:16.600 align:start position:0%
they actually legalized it and a few
 
03:35:18.910 --> 03:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
years later came back with a regulatory
 
03:35:20.269 --> 03:35:20.279 align:start position:0%
framework on how they would allow
 
03:35:22.469 --> 03:35:22.479 align:start position:0%
license and then regulate the sale of
 
03:35:25.349 --> 03:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
cannabis in the state and so my goal
 
03:35:29.070 --> 03:35:29.080 align:start position:0%
here again is to stop arresting people
 
03:35:31.990 --> 03:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
and locking up people who are who are
 
03:35:34.229 --> 03:35:34.239 align:start position:0%
not committing violent crimes who are
 
03:35:36.189 --> 03:35:36.199 align:start position:0%
really just consuming something that is
 
03:35:38.830 --> 03:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
legal in every surrounding piece of land
 
03:35:41.269 --> 03:35:41.279 align:start position:0%
whether it's main Canada Vermont or
 
03:35:44.189 --> 03:35:44.199 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and is is generally
 
03:35:46.469 --> 03:35:46.479 align:start position:0%
considered by most in our Society to not
 
03:35:50.150 --> 03:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
be as harmful as uh it was thought to be
 
03:35:53.830 --> 03:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
in times past and importantly the
 
03:35:56.229 --> 03:35:56.239 align:start position:0%
majority of people in New Hampshire do
 
03:35:58.030 --> 03:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
support legalization and don't like the
 
03:36:00.590 --> 03:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
idea of locking up people for the
 
03:36:03.030 --> 03:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
possession of cannabis in New Hampshire
 
03:36:04.469 --> 03:36:04.479 align:start position:0%
so this would put an end to that
 
03:36:07.389 --> 03:36:07.399 align:start position:0%
practice and I hope that um you guys
 
03:36:09.870 --> 03:36:09.880 align:start position:0%
will uh be supportive of it and I will
 
03:36:12.670 --> 03:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:15.030 --> 03:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
03:36:15.040 --> 03:36:20.510 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony

03:36:25.870 --> 03:36:25.880 align:start position:0%
easy thank you very much see no
 
03:36:29.070 --> 03:36:29.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:36.590 --> 03:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:39.750 --> 03:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you honorable Madam chair
 
03:36:41.630 --> 03:36:41.640 align:start position:0%
and uh committee members uh thank you
 
03:36:43.710 --> 03:36:43.720 align:start position:0%
for having me back again uh my name is
 
03:36:45.550 --> 03:36:45.560 align:start position:0%
representative Heath Howard I repres
 
03:36:46.870 --> 03:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
pres the towns of straford and barington
 
03:36:49.429 --> 03:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
and straford District 4 uh I'm here in
 
03:36:52.309 --> 03:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
support of HB 198 because it legalizes
 
03:36:54.309 --> 03:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
the possession of 2 oz of cannabis for
 
03:36:56.750 --> 03:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
recreational use uh for people 21 years
 
03:36:59.750 --> 03:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
of age and older uh but it also creates
 
03:37:01.750 --> 03:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
penalties for smoking and vaping in
 
03:37:04.269 --> 03:37:04.279 align:start position:0%
public it does not legalize the sale of
 
03:37:06.349 --> 03:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
cannabis it does not allow people to
 
03:37:08.630 --> 03:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
operate Vehicles while inebriated under
 
03:37:10.469 --> 03:37:10.479 align:start position:0%
the effects of cannabis nor does it
 
03:37:13.389 --> 03:37:13.399 align:start position:0%
allow for cannabis to be grown uh
 
03:37:15.710 --> 03:37:15.720 align:start position:0%
essentially this bill is a legalization
 
03:37:18.429 --> 03:37:18.439 align:start position:0%
bill for home use only with the express
 
03:37:22.189 --> 03:37:22.199 align:start position:0%
goal of protecting people uh for simple
 
03:37:24.710 --> 03:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
possessions for uh situations like
 
03:37:27.510 --> 03:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
during traffic stops this is not my
 
03:37:29.990 --> 03:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
preferred method of legalization but it
 
03:37:32.309 --> 03:37:32.319 align:start position:0%
is a basic compromise that maintains the
 
03:37:35.189 --> 03:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
public Norms while also giving people
 
03:37:37.590 --> 03:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
new individual liberties to use on
 
03:37:40.269 --> 03:37:40.279 align:start position:0%
private property if somebody is caught
 
03:37:42.309 --> 03:37:42.319 align:start position:0%
smoking or vaping in public they can
 
03:37:44.870 --> 03:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
face a fine uh starting at $100 going
 
03:37:46.389 --> 03:37:46.399 align:start position:0%
all the way up to to a Class B
 
03:37:48.750 --> 03:37:48.760 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor depending on uh how many
 
03:37:50.429 --> 03:37:50.439 align:start position:0%
offenses there are in a three-year
 
03:37:52.750 --> 03:37:52.760 align:start position:0%
period uh that maintains the current
 
03:37:55.150 --> 03:37:55.160 align:start position:0%
status quo and personally I mean I think
 
03:37:57.750 --> 03:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit excessive but uh
 
03:37:59.710 --> 03:37:59.720 align:start position:0%
especially For Vaping where there
 
03:38:03.030 --> 03:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
there's minimal smell uh but again it's
 
03:38:05.309 --> 03:38:05.319 align:start position:0%
trying to reach out across the aisle and
 
03:38:06.790 --> 03:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
get something through so that we can
 
03:38:08.950 --> 03:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
actually legalize the substance because
 
03:38:12.550 --> 03:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
there is very minimal uh public safety
 
03:38:15.030 --> 03:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
risk uh with that being said uh I'm open
 
03:38:20.189 --> 03:38:20.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:23.830 --> 03:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
you seeing none oh change your mind
 
03:38:23.840 --> 03:38:25.269 align:start position:0%
you seeing none oh change your mind
representative

03:38:25.269 --> 03:38:25.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:38:27.950 --> 03:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
news can you talk a little bit about how
 
03:38:30.870 --> 03:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
the bill uh treats people under the age
 
03:38:33.429 --> 03:38:33.439 align:start position:0%
of 18 and and and what protections it
 
03:38:37.229 --> 03:38:37.239 align:start position:0%
includes for them yeah uh so obviously
 
03:38:39.910 --> 03:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
because this is a legalization Bill uh
 
03:38:43.389 --> 03:38:43.399 align:start position:0%
this still does have uh illegality for
 
03:38:46.750 --> 03:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
people under the age of 18 uh let me try
 
03:38:49.750 --> 03:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
and find that real quick um there might
 
03:38:51.630 --> 03:38:51.640 align:start position:0%
be somebody who could uh better talk to
 
03:38:53.269 --> 03:38:53.279 align:start position:0%
this at off the top of my head because
 
03:38:54.750 --> 03:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
it was the one thing that I didn't write
 
03:38:57.990 --> 03:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
down um any person who's under the age
 
03:39:01.389 --> 03:39:01.399 align:start position:0%
of 18 who is convicted of uh violating
 
03:39:04.910 --> 03:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh paragraph 45 shall forfeit cannabis
 
03:39:07.030 --> 03:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh and shall be subject to delinquency
 
03:39:09.550 --> 03:39:09.560 align:start position:0%
petition under RSA 169
 
03:39:14.670 --> 03:39:14.680 align:start position:0%
B6 uh so it does I I'm not sure uh off
 
03:39:16.229 --> 03:39:16.239 align:start position:0%
the top of my head how that changes the
 
03:39:16.239 --> 03:39:17.269 align:start position:0%
the top of my head how that changes the
current

03:39:17.269 --> 03:39:17.279 align:start position:0%
current
 
03:39:23.510 --> 03:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:26.070 --> 03:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
sorry so this is my fourth term and I
 
03:39:28.269 --> 03:39:28.279 align:start position:0%
haven't run into a delinquency petition
 
03:39:31.830 --> 03:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
yet uh as a potential penalty can do you
 
03:39:33.229 --> 03:39:33.239 align:start position:0%
uh do you know any more about that than
 
03:39:36.070 --> 03:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
I do uh somebody might be better uh able
 
03:39:38.349 --> 03:39:38.359 align:start position:0%
to address that thank
 
03:39:42.229 --> 03:39:42.239 align:start position:0%
you representative Sher I'll try and put
 
03:39:45.870 --> 03:39:45.880 align:start position:0%
this in the form of a question um
 
03:39:49.150 --> 03:39:49.160 align:start position:0%
so would you know that a delinquency
 
03:39:53.750 --> 03:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
petition is a um uh it's it's the
 
03:39:55.670 --> 03:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
juvenile equivalent of charging someone
 
03:39:58.790 --> 03:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
with a crime so uh if you want to charge
 
03:40:01.389 --> 03:40:01.399 align:start position:0%
a juvenile someone under the age 18 with
 
03:40:05.910 --> 03:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
a crime you file a juvenile petition um
 
03:40:08.950 --> 03:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
and it's adjudicated in that fashion
 
03:40:12.309 --> 03:40:12.319 align:start position:0%
there's more deadlines uh but that's the
 
03:40:15.429 --> 03:40:15.439 align:start position:0%
that's what a juvenile petition is well
 
03:40:17.150 --> 03:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
thank you you know
 
03:40:20.309 --> 03:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
that I I I clearly was not as prepared
 
03:40:23.469 --> 03:40:23.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:25.950 --> 03:40:25.960 align:start position:0%
sorry anyone else
 
03:40:32.309 --> 03:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:32.319 --> 03:40:37.790 align:start position:0%

03:40:40.990 --> 03:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
yes so at the age of 18 does that go
 
03:40:44.870 --> 03:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
away no uh it's confidential um it
 
03:40:46.950 --> 03:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't go away but it's confidential
 
03:40:50.110 --> 03:40:50.120 align:start position:0%
it's different than an analment
 
03:40:54.910 --> 03:40:54.920 align:start position:0%

of the Emerald Lake Village District but
 
03:42:36.070 --> 03:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
I offer comments today on my own behalf
 
03:42:39.550 --> 03:42:39.560 align:start position:0%
in support of uh House Bill 198 and
 
03:42:41.510 --> 03:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
there two things I like about uh the
 
03:42:43.870 --> 03:42:43.880 align:start position:0%
bill right off the top it doesn't create
 
03:42:46.710 --> 03:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
any new bureaucracy and it doesn't cost
 
03:42:48.670 --> 03:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayers any
 
03:42:51.229 --> 03:42:51.239 align:start position:0%
money um I think we can all agree that
 
03:42:52.670 --> 03:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire doesn't
 
03:42:55.630 --> 03:42:55.640 align:start position:0%
really like to establish or maintain
 
03:42:58.990 --> 03:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy um I mean the Department of
 
03:43:02.229 --> 03:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
Agriculture markets and uh food
 
03:43:05.269 --> 03:43:05.279 align:start position:0%
mismanaged an organic state run Organic
 
03:43:07.269 --> 03:43:07.279 align:start position:0%
certification program till it was
 
03:43:10.550 --> 03:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
finally closed down last year and as you
 
03:43:13.710 --> 03:43:13.720 align:start position:0%
may recall there was a bill last year to
 
03:43:15.469 --> 03:43:15.479 align:start position:0%
legalize cannabis that would have cost
 
03:43:17.269 --> 03:43:17.279 align:start position:0%
taxpayers $18
 
03:43:20.710 --> 03:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
million to establish a Soviet style
 
03:43:24.070 --> 03:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
statun cannabis Monopoly and I want to
 
03:43:26.510 --> 03:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for rejecting that bad idea by
 
03:43:29.229 --> 03:43:29.239 align:start position:0%
the way um but if instead of
 
03:43:31.950 --> 03:43:31.960 align:start position:0%
establishing new bureaucracy House Bill
 
03:43:34.830 --> 03:43:34.840 align:start position:0%
198 essentially raises the Cannabis
 
03:43:37.070 --> 03:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
possession limit from 3/4 of an ounce to
 
03:43:40.229 --> 03:43:40.239 align:start position:0%
2 ounces it prohibits smoking or vaping
 
03:43:42.670 --> 03:43:42.680 align:start position:0%
vaping in public and makes it clear that
 
03:43:46.229 --> 03:43:46.239 align:start position:0%
miners cannot legally possess cannabis
 
03:43:48.269 --> 03:43:48.279 align:start position:0%
and while the bill does not establish a
 
03:43:50.910 --> 03:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
legal Market or support business
 
03:43:53.309 --> 03:43:53.319 align:start position:0%
investment here in New Hampshire or
 
03:43:55.950 --> 03:43:55.960 align:start position:0%
provide a way to tax cannabis it's
 
03:43:58.590 --> 03:43:58.600 align:start position:0%
important to take a moment to uh review
 
03:44:00.429 --> 03:44:00.439 align:start position:0%
some of the experiences of states that
 
03:44:03.990 --> 03:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
have establish legal cannabis markets St
 
03:44:05.469 --> 03:44:05.479 align:start position:0%
such states have brought in tens of
 
03:44:08.630 --> 03:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars in tax revenue
 
03:44:11.510 --> 03:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
they've seen increases in jobs in
 
03:44:14.590 --> 03:44:14.600 align:start position:0%
tourism in business investment and given
 
03:44:16.830 --> 03:44:16.840 align:start position:0%
young people a reason to stay in those
 
03:44:19.349 --> 03:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
States in state after state with legal
 
03:44:23.790 --> 03:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
cannabis youth cannabis use has actually
 
03:44:25.630 --> 03:44:25.640 align:start position:0%
Fallen it's
 
03:44:28.670 --> 03:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
true along with the rates of opioid
 
03:44:32.429 --> 03:44:32.439 align:start position:0%
overdoses and deaths another interesting
 
03:44:35.950 --> 03:44:35.960 align:start position:0%
thing in Ohio which recently established
 
03:44:38.309 --> 03:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
a legal Market the Department of Public
 
03:44:41.750 --> 03:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
Safety reported a 30% decrease in
 
03:44:45.590 --> 03:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
traffic fatalities in the first year uh
 
03:44:47.950 --> 03:44:47.960 align:start position:0%
of having an adult used cannabis market
 
03:44:50.110 --> 03:44:50.120 align:start position:0%
so those are some of the real life
 
03:44:52.429 --> 03:44:52.439 align:start position:0%
impacts that are happening with legal
 
03:44:54.349 --> 03:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
cannabis in other
 
03:44:59.070 --> 03:44:59.080 align:start position:0%
states well this bill HB 198 will not
 
03:45:00.790 --> 03:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
establish a cannabis
 
03:45:03.349 --> 03:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
Market but it does recognize the fact
 
03:45:05.349 --> 03:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
that many Granite Staters purchase
 
03:45:08.269 --> 03:45:08.279 align:start position:0%
cannabis in Maine Vermont and
 
03:45:10.950 --> 03:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and bring it back to New
 
03:45:14.030 --> 03:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire now we may not want tax
 
03:45:17.110 --> 03:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
revenue or increases in tourism or
 
03:45:19.510 --> 03:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
business Investments but we can at least
 
03:45:22.429 --> 03:45:22.439 align:start position:0%
save money on unnecessary and harmful
 
03:45:25.349 --> 03:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions this is an efficient
 
03:45:27.790 --> 03:45:27.800 align:start position:0%
Bill and it needs to pass and let the
 
03:45:30.389 --> 03:45:30.399 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire live free
 
03:45:30.399 --> 03:45:32.469 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire live free
thank

03:45:32.469 --> 03:45:32.479 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:45:35.389 --> 03:45:35.399 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much or any
 
03:45:39.349 --> 03:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
03:45:51.309 --> 03:45:51.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:53.110 --> 03:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for the record
 
03:45:55.149 --> 03:45:55.159 align:start position:0%
Matt Simon I work for granite Leaf
 
03:45:57.110 --> 03:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
cannabis this bill doesn't have anything
 
03:45:58.550 --> 03:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
to do with the therapeutic cannabis
 
03:46:00.189 --> 03:46:00.199 align:start position:0%
program it wouldn't have any impact on
 
03:46:03.309 --> 03:46:03.319 align:start position:0%
the atcs uh we support it as a matter of
 
03:46:05.590 --> 03:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
principle and I'm going to make a few
 
03:46:08.429 --> 03:46:08.439 align:start position:0%
brief comments uh that come more from my
 
03:46:11.349 --> 03:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
experience working on this issue in New
 
03:46:14.950 --> 03:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and in other states so I think
 
03:46:16.389 --> 03:46:16.399 align:start position:0%
one thing New Hampshire has learned in
 
03:46:18.590 --> 03:46:18.600 align:start position:0%
the last couple years is that uh
 
03:46:22.309 --> 03:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
cannabis legalization is not a yes or no
 
03:46:25.030 --> 03:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
question we often hear it presented as a
 
03:46:27.349 --> 03:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
yes or no question in the media when a
 
03:46:29.349 --> 03:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
pollster calls somebody and asks do you
 
03:46:31.189 --> 03:46:31.199 align:start position:0%
support legalizing cannabis it's
 
03:46:33.550 --> 03:46:33.560 align:start position:0%
presented as a yes or no question but
 
03:46:36.110 --> 03:46:36.120 align:start position:0%
every actual cannabis legalization Bill
 
03:46:39.590 --> 03:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
contains typically dozens of policy
 
03:46:42.950 --> 03:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
choices some of which may be good or bad
 
03:46:45.670 --> 03:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
all of which are debatable and many
 
03:46:47.790 --> 03:46:47.800 align:start position:0%
bills get derailed over people not being
 
03:46:50.630 --> 03:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
able to agree on those dozens of policy
 
03:46:52.870 --> 03:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
choices so I had the privilege several
 
03:46:55.269 --> 03:46:55.279 align:start position:0%
years ago of working on the legalization
 
03:46:57.229 --> 03:46:57.239 align:start position:0%
campaigns in Vermont worked closely with
 
03:46:59.229 --> 03:46:59.239 align:start position:0%
the Vermont state legislature as they
 
03:47:01.710 --> 03:47:01.720 align:start position:0%
became the first state legislature to
 
03:47:04.149 --> 03:47:04.159 align:start position:0%
legalize cannabis and we went through
 
03:47:05.950 --> 03:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
this in Vermont uh there were a number
 
03:47:07.990 --> 03:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
of bills trying to regulate cannabis
 
03:47:09.630 --> 03:47:09.640 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of interests that had
 
03:47:11.309 --> 03:47:11.319 align:start position:0%
opinions about how cannabis should be
 
03:47:13.429 --> 03:47:13.439 align:start position:0%
regulated there was a lot of difficulty
 
03:47:15.990 --> 03:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
reaching in consensus on this all the
 
03:47:17.630 --> 03:47:17.640 align:start position:0%
previous States had just done it through
 
03:47:20.269 --> 03:47:20.279 align:start position:0%
ballot initiatives where those policy
 
03:47:22.149 --> 03:47:22.159 align:start position:0%
choices were made by the drafters of the
 
03:47:24.070 --> 03:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
initiative and then voters had a yes or
 
03:47:26.269 --> 03:47:26.279 align:start position:0%
no question in front of them doing it
 
03:47:28.429 --> 03:47:28.439 align:start position:0%
through the state legislature makes it a
 
03:47:31.429 --> 03:47:31.439 align:start position:0%
lot more complicated to build consensus
 
03:47:34.750 --> 03:47:34.760 align:start position:0%
so when Vermont failed a couple of bills
 
03:47:35.950 --> 03:47:35.960 align:start position:0%
they went back to the drawing board and
 
03:47:37.750 --> 03:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
said actually what do we all agree on we
 
03:47:40.030 --> 03:47:40.040 align:start position:0%
all agree that vermers should not be
 
03:47:41.510 --> 03:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
punished if they're adults for
 
03:47:44.269 --> 03:47:44.279 align:start position:0%
possessing cannabis so they passed their
 
03:47:46.269 --> 03:47:46.279 align:start position:0%
first legal Iz ation bill was very
 
03:47:48.269 --> 03:47:48.279 align:start position:0%
similar to this it did include home
 
03:47:50.790 --> 03:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
cultivation which this bill doesn't this
 
03:47:53.189 --> 03:47:53.199 align:start position:0%
bill only applies to personal possession
 
03:47:55.990 --> 03:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
but the idea was stop punishing people
 
03:47:58.710 --> 03:47:58.720 align:start position:0%
we all agree on that and once we pass
 
03:48:00.990 --> 03:48:01.000 align:start position:0%
that hopefully everybody will come to
 
03:48:02.830 --> 03:48:02.840 align:start position:0%
the table and we won't be arguing over
 
03:48:04.670 --> 03:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
legalization anymore we'll be arguing
 
03:48:07.229 --> 03:48:07.239 align:start position:0%
over how to regulate cannabis properly
 
03:48:09.309 --> 03:48:09.319 align:start position:0%
and Vermont did two years later pass
 
03:48:11.309 --> 03:48:11.319 align:start position:0%
what I consider to be the best cannabis
 
03:48:14.910 --> 03:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
regulation law in in the country uh I'm
 
03:48:16.550 --> 03:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
hopeful that New Hampshire could take
 
03:48:20.550 --> 03:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
the same path uh if this bill goes to
 
03:48:23.110 --> 03:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
the other chamber or if if a complex
 
03:48:24.550 --> 03:48:24.560 align:start position:0%
bill goes to the other chamber there
 
03:48:26.670 --> 03:48:26.680 align:start position:0%
will be dozens of policy choices that
 
03:48:29.469 --> 03:48:29.479 align:start position:0%
could derail that other Bill if this
 
03:48:31.870 --> 03:48:31.880 align:start position:0%
simple bill goes to the other chamber it
 
03:48:34.149 --> 03:48:34.159 align:start position:0%
really is a yes or no question do you
 
03:48:36.149 --> 03:48:36.159 align:start position:0%
think adults in the Live Free or dies
 
03:48:38.750 --> 03:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
date should be punished for possession
 
03:48:40.590 --> 03:48:40.600 align:start position:0%
and so I think this is a good bill both
 
03:48:44.990 --> 03:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
strategically as well as on policy
 
03:48:48.349 --> 03:48:48.359 align:start position:0%
uh turning briefly to uh the questions
 
03:48:51.870 --> 03:48:51.880 align:start position:0%
about under 21 my understanding is that
 
03:48:55.309 --> 03:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't change the existing
 
03:48:58.030 --> 03:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
policies uh I worked with this committee
 
03:48:59.830 --> 03:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
back in uh
 
03:49:02.389 --> 03:49:02.399 align:start position:0%
2017 on on the bill that ultimately
 
03:49:05.349 --> 03:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
became law decriminalizing up to 3/4 of
 
03:49:08.030 --> 03:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
an ounce of cannabis and at that time we
 
03:49:10.590 --> 03:49:10.600 align:start position:0%
had a very robust and detailed
 
03:49:12.670 --> 03:49:12.680 align:start position:0%
discussion about what that should mean
 
03:49:15.670 --> 03:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
for people under 18 and for under 21
 
03:49:17.389 --> 03:49:17.399 align:start position:0%
what is the most appropriate
 
03:49:21.149 --> 03:49:21.159 align:start position:0%
intervention if not criminalization and
 
03:49:23.630 --> 03:49:23.640 align:start position:0%
with buyin from a lot of organizations
 
03:49:25.830 --> 03:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
from a lot of different perspectives we
 
03:49:28.070 --> 03:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
reached the compromise that is now law
 
03:49:29.710 --> 03:49:29.720 align:start position:0%
and I believe it's exactly what you see
 
03:49:32.670 --> 03:49:32.680 align:start position:0%
before you that under 18 is a
 
03:49:32.680 --> 03:49:34.550 align:start position:0%
before you that under 18 is a
delinquency

03:49:34.550 --> 03:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
delinquency
 
03:49:36.750 --> 03:49:36.760 align:start position:0%
petition uh the most appropriate way of
 
03:49:40.149 --> 03:49:40.159 align:start position:0%
dealing with that and for anybody 18 and
 
03:49:43.830 --> 03:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
older it would be a violation so this
 
03:49:46.910 --> 03:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
maintains that violation for 18 19 and
 
03:49:49.750 --> 03:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
20y olds it would still be the violation
 
03:49:51.750 --> 03:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
that it currently is under DCM and it
 
03:49:54.590 --> 03:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
simply eliminates the the violation for
 
03:49:59.189 --> 03:49:59.199 align:start position:0%
people over 21 uh and changes the amount
 
03:50:01.229 --> 03:50:01.239 align:start position:0%
I believe but other than that I think
 
03:50:02.750 --> 03:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
it's pretty straightforward I think it's
 
03:50:05.269 --> 03:50:05.279 align:start position:0%
consistent with uh New Hampshire's
 
03:50:07.429 --> 03:50:07.439 align:start position:0%
decriminalization law a logical next
 
03:50:09.590 --> 03:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
step forward and preventing Granite
 
03:50:11.670 --> 03:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
Staters from being put into the criminal
 
03:50:14.229 --> 03:50:14.239 align:start position:0%
justice system for simply possessing
 
03:50:14.239 --> 03:50:15.790 align:start position:0%
justice system for simply possessing
cannabis

03:50:15.790 --> 03:50:15.800 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
03:50:17.910 --> 03:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
that's all I have happy to take any
 
03:50:20.670 --> 03:50:20.680 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
03:50:22.750 --> 03:50:22.760 align:start position:0%
PR just
 
03:50:25.830 --> 03:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
curious when I drink alcohol I pulled
 
03:50:27.710 --> 03:50:27.720 align:start position:0%
over there's a test to say whether I
 
03:50:29.830 --> 03:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
should be driving or not is there one
 
03:50:34.590 --> 03:50:34.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:37.710 --> 03:50:37.720 align:start position:0%
yeah representative pette I have a
 
03:50:39.870 --> 03:50:39.880 align:start position:0%
question that's kind of related um it
 
03:50:44.630 --> 03:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
says in here um you you know you can't
 
03:50:47.550 --> 03:50:47.560 align:start position:0%
drive under the influence so this
 
03:50:51.149 --> 03:50:51.159 align:start position:0%
clearly says that but um you know if
 
03:50:54.030 --> 03:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
you're in your car are you in your
 
03:50:56.710 --> 03:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
personal property or are you in public
 
03:50:58.710 --> 03:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
like public is a no personal property is
 
03:51:01.870 --> 03:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
a yes if you're in your car somewhere
 
03:51:03.429 --> 03:51:03.439 align:start position:0%
cuz you know we've all been there and
 
03:51:05.269 --> 03:51:05.279 align:start position:0%
then you know been somewhere driving and
 
03:51:06.870 --> 03:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
then there's you know huge puff of
 
03:51:09.670 --> 03:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
smokes coming out of the car and now
 
03:51:12.950 --> 03:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
it's in yours I mean how how does that
 
03:51:15.830 --> 03:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
work with this
 
03:51:17.750 --> 03:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
I'm going to leave that one for an
 
03:51:20.189 --> 03:51:20.199 align:start position:0%
attorney I
 
03:51:22.349 --> 03:51:22.359 align:start position:0%
will yeah I don't I don't have an easy
 
03:51:23.950 --> 03:51:23.960 align:start position:0%
answer on that I will note that New
 
03:51:25.870 --> 03:51:25.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has other laws for example
 
03:51:28.070 --> 03:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
last year the oper container law that
 
03:51:30.389 --> 03:51:30.399 align:start position:0%
passed this committee added cannabis to
 
03:51:32.630 --> 03:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
the open container statute so simply
 
03:51:34.870 --> 03:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
possessing an unsealed container of
 
03:51:37.030 --> 03:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis anywhere in a motor vehicle is
 
03:51:39.149 --> 03:51:39.159 align:start position:0%
a violation and that comes with a
 
03:51:41.790 --> 03:51:41.800 align:start position:0%
possible driver's license suspension so
 
03:51:43.510 --> 03:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
I happen to strongly disagree with that
 
03:51:45.630 --> 03:51:45.640 align:start position:0%
law but did not test against it that's
 
03:51:48.070 --> 03:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
another issue it is illegal elsewhere in
 
03:51:49.389 --> 03:51:49.399 align:start position:0%
the criminal code to drive while
 
03:51:52.030 --> 03:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
impaired on any substance we have
 
03:51:53.910 --> 03:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
breathalyzers that are trusted for
 
03:51:56.790 --> 03:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
alcohol for every other drug we do not
 
03:52:01.630 --> 03:52:01.640 align:start position:0%
have either a specific legal limit that
 
03:52:04.790 --> 03:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
is accepted by science or a specific way
 
03:52:07.269 --> 03:52:07.279 align:start position:0%
of testing for it other than a blood
 
03:52:09.710 --> 03:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
test which gets you to a conviction
 
03:52:12.309 --> 03:52:12.319 align:start position:0%
every other state has gone through this
 
03:52:14.590 --> 03:52:14.600 align:start position:0%
discussion of what impaired driving
 
03:52:17.630 --> 03:52:17.640 align:start position:0%
policies may need to change in light of
 
03:52:20.110 --> 03:52:20.120 align:start position:0%
legalization two points that I'll make
 
03:52:22.189 --> 03:52:22.199 align:start position:0%
one there is no evidence that
 
03:52:24.110 --> 03:52:24.120 align:start position:0%
prohibition has been effective in
 
03:52:26.229 --> 03:52:26.239 align:start position:0%
deterring use so New Hampshire has one
 
03:52:28.149 --> 03:52:28.159 align:start position:0%
of the highest cannabis consumption
 
03:52:30.990 --> 03:52:31.000 align:start position:0%
rates in the country and we had that
 
03:52:33.510 --> 03:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
before decrim we had that before medical
 
03:52:35.309 --> 03:52:35.319 align:start position:0%
cannabis it's because we're in New
 
03:52:37.030 --> 03:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
England and new englanders smoke more
 
03:52:39.830 --> 03:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis than people in the Southeast it
 
03:52:43.110 --> 03:52:43.120 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with policy so the
 
03:52:45.670 --> 03:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
expectation was that use would increase
 
03:52:47.790 --> 03:52:47.800 align:start position:0%
dramatically after legalization I think
 
03:52:49.590 --> 03:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
it's pretty clear that hasn't happened
 
03:52:51.830 --> 03:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
there have been modest increases in use
 
03:52:54.269 --> 03:52:54.279 align:start position:0%
that have mostly been among the older
 
03:52:57.429 --> 03:52:57.439 align:start position:0%
population the population where use has
 
03:52:58.870 --> 03:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
increased most in states that have
 
03:53:01.229 --> 03:53:01.239 align:start position:0%
tracked it it's it's the over 50 crowd
 
03:53:04.830 --> 03:53:04.840 align:start position:0%
and the over 65 crowd more than young
 
03:53:07.349 --> 03:53:07.359 align:start position:0%
people as Mr riddle said the evidence is
 
03:53:09.309 --> 03:53:09.319 align:start position:0%
overwhelming that that miners are
 
03:53:11.670 --> 03:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
actually using less cannabis uh in the
 
03:53:14.590 --> 03:53:14.600 align:start position:0%
wake of legalization so often causing
 
03:53:16.910 --> 03:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
effect or counterintuitive but it's
 
03:53:19.990 --> 03:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
already illegal to drive while impaired
 
03:53:22.389 --> 03:53:22.399 align:start position:0%
and we have a process for convi
 
03:53:24.710 --> 03:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
convicting people it involves uh
 
03:53:26.269 --> 03:53:26.279 align:start position:0%
officers who are trained as drug
 
03:53:28.550 --> 03:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
recognition experts and if somebody's
 
03:53:30.590 --> 03:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
thought to be impaired by any substance
 
03:53:34.110 --> 03:53:34.120 align:start position:0%
other than alcohol we have a process for
 
03:53:35.790 --> 03:53:35.800 align:start position:0%
getting that person convicted and off
 
03:53:37.389 --> 03:53:37.399 align:start position:0%
the roads and that will be the same
 
03:53:39.550 --> 03:53:39.560 align:start position:0%
process whether cannabis is legal or
 
03:53:42.229 --> 03:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
decriminalized or illegal uh would be
 
03:53:45.910 --> 03:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
the same thank you representative Shear
 
03:53:50.590 --> 03:53:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:50.600 --> 03:53:53.590 align:start position:0%
 
question

03:53:53.590 --> 03:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:53:56.309 --> 03:53:56.319 align:start position:0%
answer go
 
03:53:59.870 --> 03:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
you very proud of myself we so
 
03:54:03.349 --> 03:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
excited thank you is there any other
 
03:54:07.670 --> 03:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:16.750 --> 03:54:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:19.550 --> 03:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you again um for for hearing me
 
03:54:22.670 --> 03:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
today uh Joe Hannon and uh I'm not going
 
03:54:25.429 --> 03:54:25.439 align:start position:0%
to speak for very long I promise um even
 
03:54:28.590 --> 03:54:28.600 align:start position:0%
though I could but 1954 Robert
 
03:54:30.469 --> 03:54:30.479 align:start position:0%
borenstein invented the breathalyzer it
 
03:54:32.110 --> 03:54:32.120 align:start position:0%
was 21 years after prohibition was
 
03:54:34.269 --> 03:54:34.279 align:start position:0%
repealed uh just for historical
 
03:54:36.590 --> 03:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
references there uh like it's been said
 
03:54:38.750 --> 03:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
this bill has basically gotten rid of
 
03:54:40.229 --> 03:54:40.239 align:start position:0%
most of the contentious issues that had
 
03:54:42.070 --> 03:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
been a problem in the last 10 years that
 
03:54:43.510 --> 03:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
I 10 plus years that I've been doing
 
03:54:45.550 --> 03:54:45.560 align:start position:0%
this I was on the commission back in 18
 
03:54:49.110 --> 03:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
and uh the number one uh the the biggest
 
03:54:51.349 --> 03:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
issues were how are we going to get it
 
03:54:55.349 --> 03:54:55.359 align:start position:0%
to people um this does what uh you know
 
03:54:57.389 --> 03:54:57.399 align:start position:0%
it solves that problem it doesn't do it
 
03:54:58.910 --> 03:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
and I I think we should just pass this
 
03:55:00.149 --> 03:55:00.159 align:start position:0%
bill if you have any questions I'd be
 
03:55:01.429 --> 03:55:01.439 align:start position:0%
happy to answer them I'm really not
 
03:55:03.469 --> 03:55:03.479 align:start position:0%
going to talk anymore I promise unless
 
03:55:06.030 --> 03:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
he ask me a question then I'll all
 
03:55:06.040 --> 03:55:08.149 align:start position:0%

over is everybody ready to go okay I so
 
04:32:01.229 --> 04:32:01.239 align:start position:0%
I'm going to open the public hearing for
 
04:32:03.149 --> 04:32:03.159 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:32:06.910 --> 04:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
226 and recognize is there somebody here
 
04:32:07.790 --> 04:32:07.800 align:start position:0%
Representative no you're going to
 
04:32:10.469 --> 04:32:10.479 align:start position:0%
introduce the legislation for us oh it
 
04:32:13.710 --> 04:32:13.720 align:start position:0%
is your legislation Representative no I
 
04:32:13.720 --> 04:32:25.309 align:start position:0%
is your legislation Representative no I
sure

04:32:25.309 --> 04:32:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:29.030 --> 04:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
am all right thank you madam chair and
 
04:32:30.590 --> 04:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
thanks to the committee for your time
 
04:32:32.389 --> 04:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
and consideration today for the record
 
04:32:34.149 --> 04:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
my name is jod n and I represent chesher
 
04:32:37.030 --> 04:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
for and Kean some of you will remember
 
04:32:39.910 --> 04:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
this bill um that last term uh a similar
 
04:32:41.910 --> 04:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
bill was proposed we created a
 
04:32:43.550 --> 04:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
subcommittee we poured over the details
 
04:32:45.790 --> 04:32:45.800 align:start position:0%
brought in stakeholders and experts and
 
04:32:47.109 --> 04:32:47.119 align:start position:0%
ultimately passed that bill out of
 
04:32:48.790 --> 04:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
committee and through the Full House
 
04:32:50.469 --> 04:32:50.479 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that bill died in the
 
04:32:52.990 --> 04:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
Senate so here we are uh due to the
 
04:32:55.269 --> 04:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
importance though of implementing this
 
04:32:57.229 --> 04:32:57.239 align:start position:0%
policy we decided to take a really good
 
04:33:00.830 --> 04:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
look at the concerns expressed and adapt
 
04:33:02.790 --> 04:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
so this uh this is the resulting bill
 
04:33:03.949 --> 04:33:03.959 align:start position:0%
that we have here
 
04:33:06.990 --> 04:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
today it's 2025 and while we have done
 
04:33:10.029 --> 04:33:10.039 align:start position:0%
an extraordinary job uh of building out
 
04:33:12.349 --> 04:33:12.359 align:start position:0%
our uh system of substance use
 
04:33:14.310 --> 04:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
prevention treatment recovery and harm
 
04:33:16.470 --> 04:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
reduction we are still losing loved ones
 
04:33:18.551 --> 04:33:18.561 align:start position:0%
to overdose too many people have been
 
04:33:20.230 --> 04:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
lost and too many people are still
 
04:33:23.429 --> 04:33:23.439 align:start position:0%
struggling still at risk one important
 
04:33:25.349 --> 04:33:25.359 align:start position:0%
element of a comprehensive harm
 
04:33:27.551 --> 04:33:27.561 align:start position:0%
reduction strategy involves the ability
 
04:33:30.310 --> 04:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
to anal analyze substances on our
 
04:33:32.709 --> 04:33:32.719 align:start position:0%
streets in fact much of the rest of our
 
04:33:34.910 --> 04:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
system depends on a complete accurate
 
04:33:37.070 --> 04:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
and dynamic understanding of exactly
 
04:33:39.709 --> 04:33:39.719 align:start position:0%
what is on our streets and where while
 
04:33:41.789 --> 04:33:41.799 align:start position:0%
we were able to pass venal and xylazine
 
04:33:44.070 --> 04:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
test strip decriminalization last year
 
04:33:46.551 --> 04:33:46.561 align:start position:0%
this provides very limited information
 
04:33:48.029 --> 04:33:48.039 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to direct technical
 
04:33:50.629 --> 04:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
questions um to our experts who will be
 
04:33:53.269 --> 04:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
speaking after me but to briefly explain
 
04:33:55.670 --> 04:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
a test strip identifies the presidence
 
04:33:57.789 --> 04:33:57.799 align:start position:0%
the presence of a substance and only
 
04:34:00.990 --> 04:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
that one substance that it is um
 
04:34:03.830 --> 04:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
intended to identify it does not measure
 
04:34:05.551 --> 04:34:05.561 align:start position:0%
measure how much of that substance is
 
04:34:07.910 --> 04:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
present or whether any other substances
 
04:34:10.551 --> 04:34:10.561 align:start position:0%
are present fortunately uh there are
 
04:34:13.949 --> 04:34:13.959 align:start position:0%
tools for a more deep analysis this bill
 
04:34:16.990 --> 04:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
would allow for organizations registered
 
04:34:19.949 --> 04:34:19.959 align:start position:0%
with DHHS to use this equipment in order
 
04:34:21.670 --> 04:34:21.680 align:start position:0%
to gain more information about what is
 
04:34:24.109 --> 04:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
on our streets and with that help to
 
04:34:26.029 --> 04:34:26.039 align:start position:0%
Target assistance where needed
 
04:34:29.269 --> 04:34:29.279 align:start position:0%
ultimately saving precious lives so I
 
04:34:32.109 --> 04:34:32.119 align:start position:0%
thought it would be helpful um to work
 
04:34:34.269 --> 04:34:34.279 align:start position:0%
my way through the bill and kind of um
 
04:34:37.590 --> 04:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
just so we can understand what uh what
 
04:34:40.789 --> 04:34:40.799 align:start position:0%
is in here and why um so starting out
 
04:34:43.109 --> 04:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
what it um it changes it to drug
 
04:34:45.709 --> 04:34:45.719 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia um on page two lines 13
 
04:34:47.670 --> 04:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
through 16 uh what we're doing is we're
 
04:34:49.109 --> 04:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
amending in order to draw a clear
 
04:34:51.709 --> 04:34:51.719 align:start position:0%
distinction between what uses and
 
04:34:54.230 --> 04:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
intended purposes drug testing equipment
 
04:34:56.551 --> 04:34:56.561 align:start position:0%
is allowable for and what it is not
 
04:34:56.561 --> 04:34:58.590 align:start position:0%
is allowable for and what it is not
allowable

04:34:58.590 --> 04:34:58.600 align:start position:0%
allowable
 
04:35:03.910 --> 04:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
for um on page two lines 17 through 26
 
04:35:05.551 --> 04:35:05.561 align:start position:0%
um this is a bit of rearranging in order
 
04:35:08.269 --> 04:35:08.279 align:start position:0%
to uh add additional exemptions but I
 
04:35:10.510 --> 04:35:10.520 align:start position:0%
want to note that we maintain the
 
04:35:13.109 --> 04:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
language that was passed in 2023 through
 
04:35:14.349 --> 04:35:14.359 align:start position:0%
the house and through the Senate
 
04:35:16.230 --> 04:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
ultimately signed into law by the
 
04:35:18.670 --> 04:35:18.680 align:start position:0%
governor which is decriminalizing fenal
 
04:35:21.349 --> 04:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
and xylazine test test strips and adding
 
04:35:23.789 --> 04:35:23.799 align:start position:0%
the conditions uh and the conditions
 
04:35:26.910 --> 04:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
under which that exemption was made now
 
04:35:29.070 --> 04:35:29.080 align:start position:0%
apply to the rest that we are
 
04:35:32.269 --> 04:35:32.279 align:start position:0%
adding um on page two lines 30 through
 
04:35:34.709 --> 04:35:34.719 align:start position:0%
36 this is where we carve out an
 
04:35:38.629 --> 04:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
exemption for uh drug checking equipment
 
04:35:41.230 --> 04:35:41.240 align:start position:0%
um the necessary materials when used by
 
04:35:41.240 --> 04:35:42.551 align:start position:0%
um the necessary materials when used by
agents

04:35:42.551 --> 04:35:42.561 align:start position:0%
agents
 
04:35:44.590 --> 04:35:44.600 align:start position:0%
um of organizations that are explicitly
 
04:35:47.990 --> 04:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
authorized by state county municipality
 
04:35:50.551 --> 04:35:50.561 align:start position:0%
or a public health
 
04:35:53.429 --> 04:35:53.439 align:start position:0%
department um on page
 
04:35:57.390 --> 04:35:57.400 align:start position:0%
three lines 1 through 26 um at this
 
04:35:59.070 --> 04:35:59.080 align:start position:0%
point we needed to add some more uh
 
04:36:00.789 --> 04:36:00.799 align:start position:0%
further definitions including drug
 
04:36:03.551 --> 04:36:03.561 align:start position:0%
checking drug drug checking equipment
 
04:36:06.070 --> 04:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
drug checking packaging eligible
 
04:36:07.949 --> 04:36:07.959 align:start position:0%
activities and harm reduction for the
 
04:36:09.590 --> 04:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
purposes of this
 
04:36:13.150 --> 04:36:13.160 align:start position:0%
section um on page three lines 20 27
 
04:36:15.470 --> 04:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
through 36 uh here we are clarifying
 
04:36:16.990 --> 04:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
that drug checking equipment or
 
04:36:19.230 --> 04:36:19.240 align:start position:0%
materials used for this purpose would
 
04:36:21.429 --> 04:36:21.439 align:start position:0%
not be considered drug paraphernalia
 
04:36:23.910 --> 04:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
only when used by harm reduction
 
04:36:26.109 --> 04:36:26.119 align:start position:0%
programs registered with um New
 
04:36:26.119 --> 04:36:27.310 align:start position:0%
programs registered with um New
Hampshire

04:36:27.310 --> 04:36:27.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:36:32.070 --> 04:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
DHHS um on page four actually um we have
 
04:36:33.670 --> 04:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
I've put in for an amendment because
 
04:36:35.709 --> 04:36:35.719 align:start position:0%
there was uh something that we left in
 
04:36:40.510 --> 04:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
here that we wanted to um take out and
 
04:36:43.070 --> 04:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
um but this is where we affirmative
 
04:36:44.789 --> 04:36:44.799 align:start position:0%
affirmatively state that drug checking
 
04:36:47.629 --> 04:36:47.639 align:start position:0%
is permitted in this context wait
 
04:36:49.109 --> 04:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
representative can can you hold on just
 
04:36:52.750 --> 04:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:57.230 --> 04:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
to I think she got okay okay um so on
 
04:36:58.990 --> 04:36:59.000 align:start position:0%
page four this is where we affirmatively
 
04:37:01.750 --> 04:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
state that drug checking is permitted in
 
04:37:04.230 --> 04:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
this context that the state may allocate
 
04:37:07.390 --> 04:37:07.400 align:start position:0%
funding including opioid abatement funds
 
04:37:09.269 --> 04:37:09.279 align:start position:0%
um and federal funds intended for this
 
04:37:11.670 --> 04:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
purpose we clarify that no person
 
04:37:13.709 --> 04:37:13.719 align:start position:0%
engaging in drug checking under these
 
04:37:16.070 --> 04:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
circumstances and by by this we mean
 
04:37:18.429 --> 04:37:18.439 align:start position:0%
employees of the organizations that we
 
04:37:20.709 --> 04:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
explicitly State uh should be able to do
 
04:37:23.590 --> 04:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
this uh that none of them should should
 
04:37:25.310 --> 04:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
be penalized for engaging in drug
 
04:37:27.709 --> 04:37:27.719 align:start position:0%
checking work and that the results of
 
04:37:29.310 --> 04:37:29.320 align:start position:0%
drug checking analysis should not be
 
04:37:32.349 --> 04:37:32.359 align:start position:0%
used for nefarious purposes um in this
 
04:37:35.150 --> 04:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
section I just want to note let me see
 
04:37:39.869 --> 04:37:39.879 align:start position:0%
it is on page four line S uh I actually
 
04:37:42.310 --> 04:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
just put in for an amend they said if it
 
04:37:44.470 --> 04:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
wasn't ready by 2:30 that it would be
 
04:37:47.429 --> 04:37:47.439 align:start position:0%
shortly after um and what that Amendment
 
04:37:50.310 --> 04:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
would do would take out online seven on
 
04:37:53.070 --> 04:37:53.080 align:start position:0%
page four um a nominal amount of one or
 
04:37:55.349 --> 04:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
more Controlled Substances or controlled
 
04:38:00.150 --> 04:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
substance analog analoges um and we we
 
04:38:01.510 --> 04:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
didn't mean for that to be in there the
 
04:38:03.670 --> 04:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
point is that this would be uh just for
 
04:38:05.269 --> 04:38:05.279 align:start position:0%
harm reduction organizations public
 
04:38:07.109 --> 04:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
health organizations and the employees
 
04:38:10.390 --> 04:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
thereof um so we did not intend for that
 
04:38:12.310 --> 04:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
uh to be in there so we've just made a a
 
04:38:16.070 --> 04:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
quick correction to that um and I think
 
04:38:19.390 --> 04:38:19.400 align:start position:0%
um I think that's about
 
04:38:23.910 --> 04:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:26.709 --> 04:38:26.719 align:start position:0%
questionsa could you just point me there
 
04:38:28.349 --> 04:38:28.359 align:start position:0%
was something you had just said and I
 
04:38:29.789 --> 04:38:29.799 align:start position:0%
was trying to read it but I was
 
04:38:32.150 --> 04:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
highlighting something else yeah um it
 
04:38:33.910 --> 04:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
was one of the last sentences you had
 
04:38:36.629 --> 04:38:36.639 align:start position:0%
mentioned about I think it was was the
 
04:38:39.390 --> 04:38:39.400 align:start position:0%
am like the amount you said nominal yes
 
04:38:42.429 --> 04:38:42.439 align:start position:0%
so we had intended I'm sorry what was
 
04:38:43.709 --> 04:38:43.719 align:start position:0%
that the one you said you're fixing or
 
04:38:45.029 --> 04:38:45.039 align:start position:0%
that's the amendment yeah that's the one
 
04:38:47.109 --> 04:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
that we're taking out so what it is is
 
04:38:50.269 --> 04:38:50.279 align:start position:0%
that we we do want to allow for um
 
04:38:52.551 --> 04:38:52.561 align:start position:0%
employees of organizations who are
 
04:38:55.269 --> 04:38:55.279 align:start position:0%
tasked with this um to be able to
 
04:38:57.590 --> 04:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
transport so all of the things that that
 
04:38:59.109 --> 04:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
are included in in drug checking
 
04:39:01.109 --> 04:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
materials and that is included in what
 
04:39:03.390 --> 04:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
is allowable by employees of this
 
04:39:06.310 --> 04:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
organization explicitly for that purpose
 
04:39:09.230 --> 04:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
um but not for anyone not for anyone who
 
04:39:12.670 --> 04:39:12.680 align:start position:0%
is coming to have their um have tested
 
04:39:14.310 --> 04:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
thank you so I I hadn't realized that it
 
04:39:16.269 --> 04:39:16.279 align:start position:0%
wasn't it wasn't in that section that it
 
04:39:19.029 --> 04:39:19.039 align:start position:0%
wasn't only for those folks and so yeah
 
04:39:20.869 --> 04:39:20.879 align:start position:0%
so we put in an amendment for it already
 
04:39:23.629 --> 04:39:23.639 align:start position:0%
and should have it back what what
 
04:39:25.189 --> 04:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
section is that in here me just to make
 
04:39:28.551 --> 04:39:28.561 align:start position:0%
a not so that is on page four okay line
 
04:39:30.470 --> 04:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
seven starting on line seven and going
 
04:39:33.910 --> 04:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
into line eight um so it would strike um
 
04:39:36.869 --> 04:39:36.879 align:start position:0%
a nom nominal amount of one or more
 
04:39:38.788 --> 04:39:38.798 align:start position:0%
Controlled Substances or controlled
 
04:39:41.708 --> 04:39:41.718 align:start position:0%
substance analoges I see it thank you
 
04:39:44.310 --> 04:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
okay and then I just have um another
 
04:39:46.430 --> 04:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
question real fast if if I may yeah sure
 
04:39:48.230 --> 04:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking at page
 
04:39:52.910 --> 04:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
three and it is on line 11 and it's
 
04:39:55.350 --> 04:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
basically the very end be like the next
 
04:39:57.868 --> 04:39:57.878 align:start position:0%
sentence drug checking equipment does
 
04:39:59.590 --> 04:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
not include the substance being analyzed
 
04:40:01.430 --> 04:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
drug packaging or drug
 
04:40:01.440 --> 04:40:03.070 align:start position:0%
drug packaging or drug
supplies

04:40:03.070 --> 04:40:03.080 align:start position:0%
supplies
 
04:40:05.830 --> 04:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
so so can you explain how that would
 
04:40:08.550 --> 04:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
work if it's you know if this if this
 
04:40:11.948 --> 04:40:11.958 align:start position:0%
person clearly has drugs on them and
 
04:40:14.030 --> 04:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
then they have they just they have some
 
04:40:15.948 --> 04:40:15.958 align:start position:0%
drug checking equipment like what like
 
04:40:19.670 --> 04:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
what would that look like or what does
 
04:40:27.510 --> 04:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:30.430 --> 04:40:30.440 align:start position:0%
mean so right here what we're talking
 
04:40:32.590 --> 04:40:32.600 align:start position:0%
about is what fits under the the
 
04:40:35.190 --> 04:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
definition of drug checking equipment so
 
04:40:36.830 --> 04:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
it's clarifying that that does not fit
 
04:40:39.350 --> 04:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
under the definition of um drug checking
 
04:40:39.360 --> 04:40:45.110 align:start position:0%
under the definition of um drug checking
equipment

04:40:45.110 --> 04:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:47.708 --> 04:40:47.718 align:start position:0%
thank you representative okay are there
 
04:40:52.310 --> 04:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:55.190 --> 04:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
no see none thank you very much got off
 
04:40:58.270 --> 04:40:58.280 align:start position:0%
easy all right
 
04:41:06.788 --> 04:41:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:09.110 --> 04:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
celik morning or good afternoon Hello
 
04:41:10.948 --> 04:41:10.958 align:start position:0%
friends it's nice to see you again um
 
04:41:13.270 --> 04:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
for the record I am Lauren selig and I
 
04:41:15.590 --> 04:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
represent straford 10 which is the town
 
04:41:19.150 --> 04:41:19.160 align:start position:0%
of Durham New Hampshire um and one of
 
04:41:20.670 --> 04:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
the things that I think many people
 
04:41:21.948 --> 04:41:21.958 align:start position:0%
forget about when they talk about this
 
04:41:22.948 --> 04:41:22.958 align:start position:0%
committee being the committee of
 
04:41:24.628 --> 04:41:24.638 align:start position:0%
Criminal Justice is the second half of
 
04:41:26.550 --> 04:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
the name which is the public safety
 
04:41:28.830 --> 04:41:28.840 align:start position:0%
component it's criminal justice and
 
04:41:30.830 --> 04:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
Public Safety and when I think about
 
04:41:32.910 --> 04:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
Public Safety a large part of that is
 
04:41:35.230 --> 04:41:35.240 align:start position:0%
making sure that people stay alive and
 
04:41:37.830 --> 04:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
and are able to stay alive and be well
 
04:41:39.510 --> 04:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
um we know that we have people who
 
04:41:41.948 --> 04:41:41.958 align:start position:0%
unfortunately suffer from addiction and
 
04:41:43.788 --> 04:41:43.798 align:start position:0%
to various substances and in different
 
04:41:44.910 --> 04:41:44.920 align:start position:0%
kinds of
 
04:41:47.270 --> 04:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
ways and we can't help them if they're
 
04:41:49.510 --> 04:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
not alive right if they overdose and die
 
04:41:51.270 --> 04:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
there's no more that we can do to help
 
04:41:53.788 --> 04:41:53.798 align:start position:0%
them get to a space of recovery around
 
04:41:56.230 --> 04:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
their addiction or anything else so when
 
04:41:58.670 --> 04:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
I look at this bill and when we worked
 
04:42:00.350 --> 04:42:00.360 align:start position:0%
on it last year and I remember how very
 
04:42:02.310 --> 04:42:02.320 align:start position:0%
hard we worked on this bill to get it
 
04:42:05.510 --> 04:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
through um I think about that this is a
 
04:42:07.150 --> 04:42:07.160 align:start position:0%
goal intended for the public safety
 
04:42:09.150 --> 04:42:09.160 align:start position:0%
component to help people who suffer from
 
04:42:10.830 --> 04:42:10.840 align:start position:0%
addiction make sure that what they're
 
04:42:12.910 --> 04:42:12.920 align:start position:0%
using isn't filled with things that they
 
04:42:14.948 --> 04:42:14.958 align:start position:0%
aren't aware of that are likely to kill
 
04:42:16.430 --> 04:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
them or increase the likelihood of their
 
04:42:18.350 --> 04:42:18.360 align:start position:0%
dying on that particular day because if
 
04:42:19.670 --> 04:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
they live one more day we have a much
 
04:42:21.150 --> 04:42:21.160 align:start position:0%
better chance of helping them get to a
 
04:42:24.030 --> 04:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
place of being ready for Recovery um
 
04:42:25.590 --> 04:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
interestingly as I was thinking about
 
04:42:27.430 --> 04:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
what comments I wanted to make today in
 
04:42:29.350 --> 04:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
front of all of you I was also looking
 
04:42:32.030 --> 04:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
at my social media feed from a year ago
 
04:42:33.510 --> 04:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
I had posted about being proud of our
 
04:42:34.868 --> 04:42:34.878 align:start position:0%
committee for having passed this bill
 
04:42:37.110 --> 04:42:37.120 align:start position:0%
and moving forward but also on this day
 
04:42:39.310 --> 04:42:39.320 align:start position:0%
one year ago in Littleton New Hampshire
 
04:42:41.510 --> 04:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
we had three young people in their 20s
 
04:42:43.750 --> 04:42:43.760 align:start position:0%
all succumb to addiction um they
 
04:42:46.990 --> 04:42:47.000 align:start position:0%
overdosed as a group um because of a
 
04:42:49.948 --> 04:42:49.958 align:start position:0%
substance that had been in there in the
 
04:42:51.750 --> 04:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
drugs that they were using they drugs
 
04:42:53.350 --> 04:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
they were choosing to use were full of
 
04:42:54.910 --> 04:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
things they weren't aware were in there
 
04:42:57.190 --> 04:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
that led to their overdose and death and
 
04:42:59.390 --> 04:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
so I really hope that you pass this bill
 
04:43:01.190 --> 04:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
I encourage you to continue to support
 
04:43:03.990 --> 04:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
it um and to help it succeed through the
 
04:43:05.590 --> 04:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
Senate ideally this time as well so we
 
04:43:06.910 --> 04:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
can get it to the governor's desk for
 
04:43:08.830 --> 04:43:08.840 align:start position:0%
the purposes of of helping people in the
 
04:43:16.230 --> 04:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:16.240 --> 04:43:19.270 align:start position:0%
 
thank

04:43:19.270 --> 04:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:31.430 --> 04:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:33.510 --> 04:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
Muse thank you my name is uh
 
04:43:35.110 --> 04:43:35.120 align:start position:0%
representative David Muse I represent
 
04:43:37.788 --> 04:43:37.798 align:start position:0%
Rockingham uh 37 the communities of
 
04:43:40.270 --> 04:43:40.280 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth Newcastle uh and Newington
 
04:43:42.590 --> 04:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm testifying in uh in support of
 
04:43:42.600 --> 04:43:43.270 align:start position:0%
and I'm testifying in uh in support of
this

04:43:43.270 --> 04:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:43:47.150 --> 04:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
bill um in New Hampshire we've been
 
04:43:49.430 --> 04:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
dealing with an opioid crisis for much
 
04:43:53.708 --> 04:43:53.718 align:start position:0%
of the past decade and uh this is one of
 
04:43:55.868 --> 04:43:55.878 align:start position:0%
the first years I think when we've
 
04:43:58.510 --> 04:43:58.520 align:start position:0%
really been able to report um that we
 
04:44:01.628 --> 04:44:01.638 align:start position:0%
have made some sub substantial progress
 
04:44:03.788 --> 04:44:03.798 align:start position:0%
so last year according to the latest
 
04:44:06.310 --> 04:44:06.320 align:start position:0%
count that I had in 20124 we
 
04:44:08.830 --> 04:44:08.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately had 199 opioid deaths in
 
04:44:12.750 --> 04:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh in 202 two that was uh
 
04:44:14.470 --> 04:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
the the total was
 
04:44:18.430 --> 04:44:18.440 align:start position:0%
430 so in a 2-year period we actually
 
04:44:20.708 --> 04:44:20.718 align:start position:0%
managed to cut that in half which is a
 
04:44:23.150 --> 04:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
tremendous accomplishment and one of the
 
04:44:24.708 --> 04:44:24.718 align:start position:0%
things that's happened as a result is
 
04:44:26.868 --> 04:44:26.878 align:start position:0%
people are scratching their heads going
 
04:44:29.230 --> 04:44:29.240 align:start position:0%
well what's what's going on what's the
 
04:44:31.670 --> 04:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
factor what was the Silver Bullet and I
 
04:44:33.030 --> 04:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
think the conclusion that a lot of
 
04:44:36.430 --> 04:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
people are are coming to is it wasn't
 
04:44:38.830 --> 04:44:38.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily any one Silver Bullet it was
 
04:44:40.470 --> 04:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
the fact that one of the things we did
 
04:44:41.708 --> 04:44:41.718 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that was very
 
04:44:43.708 --> 04:44:43.718 align:start position:0%
successful was we adopted an all of the
 
04:44:43.718 --> 04:44:44.590 align:start position:0%
successful was we adopted an all of the
above

04:44:44.590 --> 04:44:44.600 align:start position:0%
above
 
04:44:48.510 --> 04:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
strategy so um one of the things that
 
04:44:52.030 --> 04:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
law enforcement did is it targeted um
 
04:44:55.510 --> 04:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
Mexican cartels us Distributors uh law
 
04:44:56.788 --> 04:44:56.798 align:start position:0%
enforcement community in New Hampshire
 
04:44:59.670 --> 04:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
is Tred to make life very difficult for
 
04:45:01.110 --> 04:45:01.120 align:start position:0%
individuals who want to sell people
 
04:45:03.830 --> 04:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
Fentanyl and other opioids um harm
 
04:45:07.510 --> 04:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
reduction uh Services um things like
 
04:45:10.390 --> 04:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
expansion of the availability of nxone
 
04:45:12.948 --> 04:45:12.958 align:start position:0%
uh so so more people who overdose uh
 
04:45:15.948 --> 04:45:15.958 align:start position:0%
have rapid access and in time uh to a
 
04:45:18.830 --> 04:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
drug that can save their lives um has
 
04:45:21.868 --> 04:45:21.878 align:start position:0%
has made a difference um dealers and
 
04:45:24.430 --> 04:45:24.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturers may also finally uh be
 
04:45:26.150 --> 04:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
starting to discover that killing your
 
04:45:28.350 --> 04:45:28.360 align:start position:0%
customers uh isn't a great way to
 
04:45:31.150 --> 04:45:31.160 align:start position:0%
conduct your conduct your business so
 
04:45:32.670 --> 04:45:32.680 align:start position:0%
one of the things that has been
 
04:45:36.350 --> 04:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
happening is uh the the tremendous
 
04:45:38.350 --> 04:45:38.360 align:start position:0%
amounts of fentanyl uh that were just
 
04:45:41.670 --> 04:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
commonly found in in fatal quantities
 
04:45:44.470 --> 04:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh very very commonly in the drug Supply
 
04:45:46.750 --> 04:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
still we'll find that not quite as
 
04:45:48.750 --> 04:45:48.760 align:start position:0%
common as it was a few as as it was a
 
04:45:50.190 --> 04:45:50.200 align:start position:0%
few years ago so there are a lot of
 
04:45:52.430 --> 04:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
things that are coming together to to
 
04:45:55.470 --> 04:45:55.480 align:start position:0%
make things better um I think the thing
 
04:45:56.990 --> 04:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
that we need to keep in mind is just
 
04:45:58.670 --> 04:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
because things are getting better it
 
04:46:00.708 --> 04:46:00.718 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean it's time to take our foot
 
04:46:03.230 --> 04:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
off the gas pedal um we're still in a
 
04:46:05.670 --> 04:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
crisis uh there are still people dying
 
04:46:08.470 --> 04:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
and there's plenty of work left to do so
 
04:46:10.230 --> 04:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
one of the things that this bill would
 
04:46:11.550 --> 04:46:11.560 align:start position:0%
do in particular particular that would
 
04:46:14.270 --> 04:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
be just tremendously beneficial is that
 
04:46:17.628 --> 04:46:17.638 align:start position:0%
currently when we want to legalize a new
 
04:46:19.470 --> 04:46:19.480 align:start position:0%
uh piece of drug checking equipment like
 
04:46:21.430 --> 04:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
fentanyl test strips or xylazine test
 
04:46:23.590 --> 04:46:23.600 align:start position:0%
strips like we did a couple of years ago
 
04:46:25.590 --> 04:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
the way that our statute is written we
 
04:46:28.470 --> 04:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
actually have to add that in statute so
 
04:46:30.270 --> 04:46:30.280 align:start position:0%
last year when I testified in front of
 
04:46:32.830 --> 04:46:32.840 align:start position:0%
you uh I told you about a drug called
 
04:46:35.670 --> 04:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
Zine uh which is a new fentanyl analog
 
04:46:38.230 --> 04:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
uh two to 50 times more more powerful
 
04:46:41.150 --> 04:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
than fentanyl which is not detected on
 
04:46:43.390 --> 04:46:43.400 align:start position:0%
fentanyl test strips and at the time I
 
04:46:46.590 --> 04:46:46.600 align:start position:0%
said well gee if if a a test strip was
 
04:46:48.868 --> 04:46:48.878 align:start position:0%
available for this particular drug Z
 
04:46:51.110 --> 04:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
zidine you know it it would save lives
 
04:46:52.868 --> 04:46:52.878 align:start position:0%
but the problem we're running into in
 
04:46:56.270 --> 04:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is that if we can't put it
 
04:46:58.590 --> 04:46:58.600 align:start position:0%
in our statute then some the some of the
 
04:47:00.948 --> 04:47:00.958 align:start position:0%
public health uh professionals you know
 
04:47:02.350 --> 04:47:02.360 align:start position:0%
who are doing the testing and are trying
 
04:47:04.390 --> 04:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
to get this stuff out into the community
 
04:47:06.750 --> 04:47:06.760 align:start position:0%
you know might be at risk of violating
 
04:47:11.190 --> 04:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
the law so um rather than having a
 
04:47:12.910 --> 04:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
always have to get together as a
 
04:47:14.430 --> 04:47:14.440 align:start position:0%
committee for every one of these
 
04:47:17.110 --> 04:47:17.120 align:start position:0%
innovations that comes along um one of
 
04:47:18.590 --> 04:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
the things that this bill would do is it
 
04:47:21.030 --> 04:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
would legalize uh Innovations in drug
 
04:47:24.230 --> 04:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
checking as a class so for instance if a
 
04:47:26.670 --> 04:47:26.680 align:start position:0%
new test strip was available the tested
 
04:47:30.350 --> 04:47:30.360 align:start position:0%
for Zine um then it could instantly be
 
04:47:32.708 --> 04:47:32.718 align:start position:0%
deployed in in a way that that that
 
04:47:35.070 --> 04:47:35.080 align:start position:0%
could save lives if a test STP was
 
04:47:37.548 --> 04:47:37.558 align:start position:0%
available that could test across
 
04:47:40.548 --> 04:47:40.558 align:start position:0%
multiple drugs uh and and show a return
 
04:47:42.230 --> 04:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
we would be able to deploy that
 
04:47:44.548 --> 04:47:44.558 align:start position:0%
instantaneously without worrying about
 
04:47:46.868 --> 04:47:46.878 align:start position:0%
uh any potential violations of the law
 
04:47:49.110 --> 04:47:49.120 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that it just does
 
04:47:52.230 --> 04:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
is it makes our statute easier easier to
 
04:47:54.830 --> 04:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
work with and more responsive to to
 
04:47:54.840 --> 04:47:55.830 align:start position:0%
work with and more responsive to to
Scientific

04:47:55.830 --> 04:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
Scientific
 
04:47:58.350 --> 04:47:58.360 align:start position:0%
Innovations one of the other things that
 
04:48:01.830 --> 04:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
this particular Bill does is is it also
 
04:48:03.990 --> 04:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
would legalize opioid reversal agents as
 
04:48:07.430 --> 04:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
a class so nxone is an opioid reversal
 
04:48:10.110 --> 04:48:10.120 align:start position:0%
agent it it's very effective uh against
 
04:48:12.670 --> 04:48:12.680 align:start position:0%
Fentanyl and other types of opioids less
 
04:48:15.708 --> 04:48:15.718 align:start position:0%
effective uh with with other drugs there
 
04:48:19.310 --> 04:48:19.320 align:start position:0%
are uh new opioid reversal a uh opioid
 
04:48:22.350 --> 04:48:22.360 align:start position:0%
reversal agents that are uh currently uh
 
04:48:24.390 --> 04:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
under FDA testing that are just about
 
04:48:26.788 --> 04:48:26.798 align:start position:0%
ready to be released uh that could make
 
04:48:28.510 --> 04:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
a difference there there are some people
 
04:48:31.030 --> 04:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
who might not be able to be revived with
 
04:48:35.350 --> 04:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
no oxone um so one of the things that
 
04:48:37.510 --> 04:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
again we're trying to do is as these
 
04:48:40.948 --> 04:48:40.958 align:start position:0%
Innovations become available we want our
 
04:48:43.670 --> 04:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
of law to be a facilitator uh and not a
 
04:48:46.110 --> 04:48:46.120 align:start position:0%
barrier when it when it comes to saving
 
04:48:49.070 --> 04:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
lives um the addition the issue that we
 
04:48:51.230 --> 04:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
had last year with a with a nominal
 
04:48:52.750 --> 04:48:52.760 align:start position:0%
amount was something that we kind of
 
04:48:54.868 --> 04:48:54.878 align:start position:0%
work through in this committee it proved
 
04:48:56.590 --> 04:48:56.600 align:start position:0%
to be a showstopper over in the Senate
 
04:48:59.110 --> 04:48:59.120 align:start position:0%
and I know there's been a lot of uh a
 
04:49:00.628 --> 04:49:00.638 align:start position:0%
lot of issues with it on the part of the
 
04:49:02.670 --> 04:49:02.680 align:start position:0%
law enforcement Community but when we
 
04:49:04.830 --> 04:49:04.840 align:start position:0%
talk about a la a nominal amount it's
 
04:49:07.510 --> 04:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
it's the idea that uh what are you
 
04:49:10.750 --> 04:49:10.760 align:start position:0%
putting on that fenal test strip um and
 
04:49:14.030 --> 04:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
and and so and so last year the idea was
 
04:49:16.110 --> 04:49:16.120 align:start position:0%
well gee what we'll what we'll do is
 
04:49:19.030 --> 04:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
we'll just we you know we won't include
 
04:49:21.948 --> 04:49:21.958 align:start position:0%
that for prosecution uh it's like a like
 
04:49:25.070 --> 04:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
a 10 milligram or less thing we we went
 
04:49:27.230 --> 04:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
back and forth should we Define it how
 
04:49:29.470 --> 04:49:29.480 align:start position:0%
do we Define it and and and the problem
 
04:49:33.430 --> 04:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
was is um the reality is you need some
 
04:49:36.110 --> 04:49:36.120 align:start position:0%
level of these drugs to test but I think
 
04:49:38.030 --> 04:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
the issue is is we don't want to be in a
 
04:49:41.230 --> 04:49:41.240 align:start position:0%
position where we're ever really
 
04:49:43.470 --> 04:49:43.480 align:start position:0%
legalizing any amount of a controlled
 
04:49:46.230 --> 04:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
controlled substance so one of the
 
04:49:47.910 --> 04:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
things that we're doing you know that we
 
04:49:50.670 --> 04:49:50.680 align:start position:0%
want to try to do this year is to uh is
 
04:49:53.708 --> 04:49:53.718 align:start position:0%
to uh to amend the bill so that
 
04:49:56.750 --> 04:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
essentially uh people who actually work
 
04:49:58.628 --> 04:49:58.638 align:start position:0%
in testing so public health
 
04:50:01.150 --> 04:50:01.160 align:start position:0%
professionals um they won't have any
 
04:50:03.310 --> 04:50:03.320 align:start position:0%
legal exposure for testing the drug same
 
04:50:05.310 --> 04:50:05.320 align:start position:0%
as like people in our State Police lab
 
04:50:07.190 --> 04:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
we don't want them to have exposure if
 
04:50:10.270 --> 04:50:10.280 align:start position:0%
they're testing drugs either uh on the
 
04:50:13.990 --> 04:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
on the other hand um uh one of the
 
04:50:16.350 --> 04:50:16.360 align:start position:0%
things that sometimes you have to kind
 
04:50:20.548 --> 04:50:20.558 align:start position:0%
of uh uh agree to disagree or or um
 
04:50:22.070 --> 04:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
that's probably not the best way to the
 
04:50:23.708 --> 04:50:23.718 align:start position:0%
best way to put it but I think I think
 
04:50:25.470 --> 04:50:25.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes you just have to come to a
 
04:50:29.628 --> 04:50:29.638 align:start position:0%
realization um that uh that a small
 
04:50:31.270 --> 04:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
Minor Detail that you think might make
 
04:50:33.190 --> 04:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
the law better and more descriptive
 
04:50:34.670 --> 04:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes can be a showstopper and the
 
04:50:37.670 --> 04:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
best thing to do is to take it out so
 
04:50:39.750 --> 04:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
legalizing any kind of nominal amount
 
04:50:41.190 --> 04:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
for possession on the a part of an
 
04:50:43.510 --> 04:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
individual who is not part of testing is
 
04:50:45.270 --> 04:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
not something that this bill will do
 
04:50:47.868 --> 04:50:47.878 align:start position:0%
anymore as as a practical matter I don't
 
04:50:49.990 --> 04:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
think we're going to see uh police
 
04:50:52.910 --> 04:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
arresting people for what's on a fenel
 
04:50:56.190 --> 04:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
test strip um so as a practical matter I
 
04:50:58.190 --> 04:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
don't think it it's an issue I think the
 
04:51:02.350 --> 04:51:02.360 align:start position:0%
law enforcement Community um uh is
 
04:51:05.030 --> 04:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
behind the effort of of saving lives I
 
04:51:07.470 --> 04:51:07.480 align:start position:0%
mean this this is something uh a lot of
 
04:51:09.030 --> 04:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
people in the law enforcement Community
 
04:51:11.270 --> 04:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
are are the people who are administering
 
04:51:14.708 --> 04:51:14.718 align:start position:0%
the lock Zone and Reviving people so so
 
04:51:17.030 --> 04:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
I think in this I think what we're
 
04:51:20.948 --> 04:51:20.958 align:start position:0%
really you know trying to do here is to
 
04:51:23.990 --> 04:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh is to really work with the law
 
04:51:25.430 --> 04:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement community and one of the
 
04:51:27.708 --> 04:51:27.718 align:start position:0%
things that I know we wanted to talk to
 
04:51:29.510 --> 04:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh the chair about was forming a
 
04:51:32.110 --> 04:51:32.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um we've talked with uh
 
04:51:34.788 --> 04:51:34.798 align:start position:0%
with Beth Sergeant um and kind of
 
04:51:36.670 --> 04:51:36.680 align:start position:0%
reviewed in principle some of the things
 
04:51:39.430 --> 04:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
that uh we're trying to do in the bill
 
04:51:42.390 --> 04:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that uh that uh
 
04:51:44.670 --> 04:51:44.680 align:start position:0%
she's indicated to us is you know a
 
04:51:46.310 --> 04:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
willingness to work with us to kind of
 
04:51:48.548 --> 04:51:48.558 align:start position:0%
get something through whether or not we
 
04:51:50.110 --> 04:51:50.120 align:start position:0%
can get something through remains to be
 
04:51:53.070 --> 04:51:53.080 align:start position:0%
seen uh whether or not we can agree on
 
04:51:55.390 --> 04:51:55.400 align:start position:0%
something you know in final form I I
 
04:51:56.910 --> 04:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
think it would be fairly easy to do but
 
04:52:00.070 --> 04:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
I never want to I never want to suppose
 
04:52:01.990 --> 04:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
um but the bottom line is is we got this
 
04:52:03.628 --> 04:52:03.638 align:start position:0%
through this committee last year we got
 
04:52:06.270 --> 04:52:06.280 align:start position:0%
it through the house um it's really
 
04:52:09.910 --> 04:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
worth trying to do uh and uh and I would
 
04:52:11.270 --> 04:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
urge uh
 
04:52:12.868 --> 04:52:12.878 align:start position:0%
uh you know I
 
04:52:15.788 --> 04:52:15.798 align:start position:0%
would just urge you to consider it and
 
04:52:19.548 --> 04:52:19.558 align:start position:0%
support it thank you thank you
 
04:52:21.270 --> 04:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
representative any questions
 
04:52:21.280 --> 04:52:22.670 align:start position:0%
representative any questions
representative

04:52:22.670 --> 04:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:52:26.628 --> 04:52:26.638 align:start position:0%
Newman yeah I just have a question um so
 
04:52:28.788 --> 04:52:28.798 align:start position:0%
people can have test strips they can
 
04:52:31.830 --> 04:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
test with the test strips and then do
 
04:52:34.830 --> 04:52:34.840 align:start position:0%
how I'm con concerned about how do how
 
04:52:37.868 --> 04:52:37.878 align:start position:0%
does that get to the organization that
 
04:52:39.750 --> 04:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
can test it do they bring a test strip
 
04:52:41.110 --> 04:52:41.120 align:start position:0%
to the organization
 
04:52:44.190 --> 04:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
I thinkes we do have people coming after
 
04:52:46.030 --> 04:52:46.040 align:start position:0%
me who can probably describe that
 
04:52:48.150 --> 04:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
process in in in better detail but there
 
04:52:50.590 --> 04:52:50.600 align:start position:0%
there's more to it than just individual
 
04:52:52.430 --> 04:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
uh drug users using test strips and
 
04:52:54.310 --> 04:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
things like that there are also Public
 
04:52:57.150 --> 04:52:57.160 align:start position:0%
Health uh agencies that are that are out
 
04:53:00.628 --> 04:53:00.638 align:start position:0%
there um you know testing uh you know
 
04:53:02.390 --> 04:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
testing drugs that are that are coming
 
04:53:05.670 --> 04:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
in that people will bring in sometimes
 
04:53:07.990 --> 04:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
so they're I think uh they'll be
 
04:53:09.628 --> 04:53:09.638 align:start position:0%
prepared to talk a little bit more about
 
04:53:09.638 --> 04:53:12.830 align:start position:0%
prepared to talk a little bit more about
that

04:53:12.830 --> 04:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:16.310 --> 04:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you right anyone else thank
 
04:53:19.788 --> 04:53:19.798 align:start position:0%

just wanted to be real brief I think the
 
04:53:39.230 --> 04:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
representative from Durham hit all my
 
04:53:40.788 --> 04:53:40.798 align:start position:0%
points about Public Safety I just wanted
 
04:53:42.670 --> 04:53:42.680 align:start position:0%
to mention like the the entire purpose
 
04:53:44.948 --> 04:53:44.958 align:start position:0%
of like uh alleged purpose of the War on
 
04:53:47.750 --> 04:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
Drugs is to save lives and sometimes uh
 
04:53:49.670 --> 04:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
these state laws get so hamstrung that
 
04:53:51.470 --> 04:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
you end up like uh costing lives in the
 
04:53:53.590 --> 04:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
process of like outlawing test strips
 
04:53:55.390 --> 04:53:55.400 align:start position:0%
things along those lines that could do a
 
04:53:58.548 --> 04:53:58.558 align:start position:0%
lot of good a lot good for the people um
 
04:54:00.830 --> 04:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
so with that I mean I think all all my
 
04:54:02.948 --> 04:54:02.958 align:start position:0%
points got handled but if you have any
 
04:54:06.670 --> 04:54:06.680 align:start position:0%

individual who are unhoused and in

chaotic use um I've also worked
 
04:57:15.990 --> 04:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
alongside folks in long-term recovery
 
04:57:17.830 --> 04:57:17.840 align:start position:0%

04:57:29.548 --> 04:57:29.558 align:start position:0%

prevention and response training for our
 
04:57:33.910 --> 04:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
organization um and in that I get asked
 
04:57:36.110 --> 04:57:36.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of questions about what is
 
04:57:38.628 --> 04:57:38.638 align:start position:0%
currently in our illicit drug Supply in
 
04:57:40.830 --> 04:57:40.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and how can gr Staters
 
04:57:45.830 --> 04:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
stay safe um and I do hate the idea of
 
04:57:49.310 --> 04:57:49.320 align:start position:0%
not being able to give anyone a exact
 
04:57:51.350 --> 04:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
answer because unfortunately we just do
 
04:57:53.990 --> 04:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
not have the information we can make um
 
04:57:56.030 --> 04:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
anecdotal uh stories and evidence but we
 
04:57:59.788 --> 04:57:59.798 align:start position:0%
don't have the direct data in front of
 
04:57:59.798 --> 04:58:05.868 align:start position:0%
don't have the direct data in front of
us

04:58:05.868 --> 04:58:05.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:10.190 --> 04:58:10.200 align:start position:0%
um um well of course we should be
 
04:58:13.390 --> 04:58:13.400 align:start position:0%
worried about the presence of um
 
04:58:15.510 --> 04:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
synthetic opioids and their various
 
04:58:17.868 --> 04:58:17.878 align:start position:0%
analoges there are other adulterants
 
04:58:19.948 --> 04:58:19.958 align:start position:0%
that are being found in the drug Supply
 
04:58:22.708 --> 04:58:22.718 align:start position:0%
such as xylazine which is a tranquilizer
 
04:58:25.390 --> 04:58:25.400 align:start position:0%
um and the one that worries me the most
 
04:58:27.948 --> 04:58:27.958 align:start position:0%
is various kinds of bzo
 
04:58:32.350 --> 04:58:32.360 align:start position:0%
diazines um who are using drugs um when
 
04:58:34.190 --> 04:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
they are looking for treatment and
 
04:58:36.910 --> 04:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
Recovery if they are not intentionally
 
04:58:39.390 --> 04:58:39.400 align:start position:0%
using benzodiazapines but they come up
 
04:58:41.190 --> 04:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
on their drug scream prior to entering
 
04:58:43.270 --> 04:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
treatment um they can be barred from
 
04:58:44.750 --> 04:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
that because they need to go through
 
04:58:47.150 --> 04:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
detox and unfortunately we know in our
 
04:58:48.548 --> 04:58:48.558 align:start position:0%
Granite State we do not have enough
 
04:58:50.868 --> 04:58:50.878 align:start position:0%
detox Bots for folks so somebody who is
 
04:58:52.990 --> 04:58:53.000 align:start position:0%
ready to go into treatment is not able
 
04:58:55.390 --> 04:58:55.400 align:start position:0%
to do so because they need that benzo
 
04:58:58.190 --> 04:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
dipene detox instead of just thinking
 
04:59:00.110 --> 04:59:00.120 align:start position:0%
that they used uh
 
04:59:03.868 --> 04:59:03.878 align:start position:0%
opioids um so I think it's also
 
04:59:05.628 --> 04:59:05.638 align:start position:0%
important to note that this bill is not
 
04:59:08.990 --> 04:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
legalizing any of the technology talking
 
04:59:12.230 --> 04:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
about in the bill um what it I mean
 
04:59:14.510 --> 04:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
anyone with an ebay account in the cash
 
04:59:17.470 --> 04:59:17.480 align:start position:0%
can go and buy an ftri machine online um
 
04:59:20.310 --> 04:59:20.320 align:start position:0%
I actually did the work and found about
 
04:59:22.350 --> 04:59:22.360 align:start position:0%
12 pages of ftiri machines that if you
 
04:59:24.270 --> 04:59:24.280 align:start position:0%
have a grand in your pocket you can buy
 
04:59:26.190 --> 04:59:26.200 align:start position:0%
and you can start testing any
 
04:59:30.350 --> 04:59:30.360 align:start position:0%
drug um but when we are able to put this
 
04:59:32.310 --> 04:59:32.320 align:start position:0%
technology and the ability into the
 
04:59:34.948 --> 04:59:34.958 align:start position:0%
hands of Public Health officials um it
 
04:59:36.830 --> 04:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
does put us a step ahead in the illicit
 
04:59:40.548 --> 04:59:40.558 align:start position:0%
Market um so a major worry is of course
 
04:59:44.510 --> 04:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
college students um in 2023 the DEA
 
04:59:47.230 --> 04:59:47.240 align:start position:0%
seized over 29 million fake pills that
 
04:59:47.240 --> 04:59:48.190 align:start position:0%
seized over 29 million fake pills that
contained

04:59:48.190 --> 04:59:48.200 align:start position:0%
contained
 
04:59:51.350 --> 04:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
lanol um which was a 33% increase from
 
04:59:53.788 --> 04:59:53.798 align:start position:0%
the year before um college students are
 
04:59:55.708 --> 04:59:55.718 align:start position:0%
looking for press pills because they are
 
04:59:58.070 --> 04:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
looking for things like Aderall um
 
05:00:00.830 --> 05:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
oxycodone and those are usually not just
 
05:00:03.470 --> 05:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
to quote unquote have parties with but
 
05:00:06.990 --> 05:00:07.000 align:start position:0%
those are usually to um stay awake so
 
05:00:08.868 --> 05:00:08.878 align:start position:0%
that they're able to study finish their
 
05:00:11.030 --> 05:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
papers things like that Unfortunately
 
05:00:13.708 --> 05:00:13.718 align:start position:0%
they are getting things that um have
 
05:00:16.190 --> 05:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
opioids in them and they're unable to
 
05:00:18.110 --> 05:00:18.120 align:start position:0%
reverse an opioid overdose if they are
 
05:00:21.670 --> 05:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
by themselves um in other states that do
 
05:00:24.750 --> 05:00:24.760 align:start position:0%
have drug checking policies uh they are
 
05:00:27.590 --> 05:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
seeing things like gp1s or we know them
 
05:00:32.030 --> 05:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
OIC in their drug Supply um so a lot of
 
05:00:34.150 --> 05:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
compounding pharmacies do not have the
 
05:00:38.750 --> 05:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
oversight that we need to be able um to
 
05:00:41.910 --> 05:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
keep these specific drugs out of those
 
05:00:44.110 --> 05:00:44.120 align:start position:0%
supplies and also for folks who are
 
05:00:46.788 --> 05:00:46.798 align:start position:0%
using gp1s they would have the ability
 
05:00:48.868 --> 05:00:48.878 align:start position:0%
in this bill to come to a drug checking
 
05:00:50.350 --> 05:00:50.360 align:start position:0%
program and see what is in their
 
05:00:52.628 --> 05:00:52.638 align:start position:0%
thirdparty glp1 so if they're buying
 
05:00:55.590 --> 05:00:55.600 align:start position:0%
something off of an online pharmacy um
 
05:00:57.670 --> 05:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
which the DEA last year in October did
 
05:00:59.470 --> 05:00:59.480 align:start position:0%
release a public service announcement
 
05:01:01.670 --> 05:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
stating that online pharmacy purchasing
 
05:01:06.230 --> 05:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
for medications is risky um and can have
 
05:01:08.510 --> 05:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
various analoges and completely unknowns
 
05:01:10.868 --> 05:01:10.878 align:start position:0%
to us um
 
05:01:13.390 --> 05:01:13.400 align:start position:0%
during my time in this work I've watched
 
05:01:13.400 --> 05:01:14.548 align:start position:0%
during my time in this work I've watched
countless

05:01:14.548 --> 05:01:14.558 align:start position:0%
countless
 
05:01:17.868 --> 05:01:17.878 align:start position:0%
participants pass away doing uh because
 
05:01:20.430 --> 05:01:20.440 align:start position:0%
they were not able to continue getting
 
05:01:22.150 --> 05:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
their suboxin prescription which is
 
05:01:23.708 --> 05:01:23.718 align:start position:0%
their medical assisted treatment or
 
05:01:27.190 --> 05:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
methadone and this is because they miss
 
05:01:29.788 --> 05:01:29.798 align:start position:0%
an insurance there's a Litany of reasons
 
05:01:32.350 --> 05:01:32.360 align:start position:0%
um but because they're unable to get
 
05:01:35.110 --> 05:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
that they then have to unfortunately
 
05:01:38.510 --> 05:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
turn to a street supply of suboxin and a
 
05:01:40.270 --> 05:01:40.280 align:start position:0%
lot of the times that does contain
 
05:01:42.590 --> 05:01:42.600 align:start position:0%
Fentanyl and they unfortunately overdose
 
05:01:45.590 --> 05:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
and pass away
 
05:01:49.030 --> 05:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
um I think that this drug checking Bill
 
05:01:51.510 --> 05:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
not only shows you what is in the supply
 
05:01:54.910 --> 05:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
so you can proceed with caution um but
 
05:01:59.110 --> 05:01:59.120 align:start position:0%
it also uh brings folks in who maybe
 
05:02:01.230 --> 05:02:01.240 align:start position:0%
lost their prescription for suboxin
 
05:02:03.470 --> 05:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
Methadone anything um who are still
 
05:02:05.070 --> 05:02:05.080 align:start position:0%
trying to look for connection so that
 
05:02:07.590 --> 05:02:07.600 align:start position:0%
they can continue to use the med um but
 
05:02:08.868 --> 05:02:08.878 align:start position:0%
they're able to connect with public
 
05:02:10.708 --> 05:02:10.718 align:start position:0%
health officials who can get them
 
05:02:13.430 --> 05:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
connected to that prescription again so
 
05:02:15.030 --> 05:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
that they're able to use that completely
 
05:02:17.670 --> 05:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
safe Supply um we say a lot of the time
 
05:02:20.628 --> 05:02:20.638 align:start position:0%
in syringe service programs that um you
 
05:02:22.470 --> 05:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
know the needle is the point because it
 
05:02:24.110 --> 05:02:24.120 align:start position:0%
is the point of Engagement for us to
 
05:02:26.910 --> 05:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
bring folks in for them to trust us uh
 
05:02:28.510 --> 05:02:28.520 align:start position:0%
folks who are using illicit drugs don't
 
05:02:31.030 --> 05:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
have a lot of trust with providers um so
 
05:02:33.430 --> 05:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
it's our job to provide that again to
 
05:02:38.948 --> 05:02:38.958 align:start position:0%
them um and overall I would say that um
 
05:02:42.868 --> 05:02:42.878 align:start position:0%
folks are are not necessarily looking
 
05:02:46.590 --> 05:02:46.600 align:start position:0%
for the highest potency uh substance
 
05:02:48.430 --> 05:02:48.440 align:start position:0%
they are looking to maintain and stay
 
05:02:51.628 --> 05:02:51.638 align:start position:0%
consistent so that they're not sick um I
 
05:02:53.270 --> 05:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
am someone personally who suffers with
 
05:02:54.788 --> 05:02:54.798 align:start position:0%
chronic pain and while I don't use
 
05:02:56.948 --> 05:02:56.958 align:start position:0%
opioids to manage it I know that if my
 
05:02:59.470 --> 05:02:59.480 align:start position:0%
medication went away tomorrow I would be
 
05:03:01.270 --> 05:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
unable to be a Community member I would
 
05:03:04.030 --> 05:03:04.040 align:start position:0%
be unable to be a partner and a parent
 
05:03:06.470 --> 05:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
um and the fact that people are so
 
05:03:09.110 --> 05:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
terrified of opioid detox because of the
 
05:03:11.628 --> 05:03:11.638 align:start position:0%
physical with draw pain should tell us
 
05:03:15.628 --> 05:03:15.638 align:start position:0%
something um and of course I Leave
 
05:03:17.270 --> 05:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
Myself open for any questions but I will
 
05:03:19.548 --> 05:03:19.558 align:start position:0%
pass it over to Dr
 
05:03:22.510 --> 05:03:22.520 align:start position:0%
Noti um well the the benefit of having
 
05:03:24.830 --> 05:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
Liz go first was that she spoke to many
 
05:03:27.670 --> 05:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
of my points here last for me um I'm Dr
 
05:03:29.948 --> 05:03:29.958 align:start position:0%
Carrie Niti um I am a family nurse
 
05:03:31.910 --> 05:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
practitioner in community health where I
 
05:03:34.190 --> 05:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
conduct healthcare for the homeless um
 
05:03:36.830 --> 05:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
in a mobile setting in mobile settings
 
05:03:38.510 --> 05:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm also the chair of the nursing
 
05:03:39.948 --> 05:03:39.958 align:start position:0%
department at the University of New
 
05:03:41.788 --> 05:03:41.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and an associate professor
 
05:03:45.190 --> 05:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
there um and my research focuses at the
 
05:03:47.750 --> 05:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
University on um reducing drug rated
 
05:03:50.510 --> 05:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
harms including overdose and infection
 
05:03:53.190 --> 05:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
um I speak for myself as a member of
 
05:03:55.868 --> 05:03:55.878 align:start position:0%
this community um and not necessarily my
 
05:03:58.750 --> 05:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
employers um just to put that caveat out
 
05:04:01.510 --> 05:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
there I did submit written testimony to
 
05:04:04.070 --> 05:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
the committee um just a few minutes ago
 
05:04:05.430 --> 05:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
through the portal I don't know when
 
05:04:07.510 --> 05:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
that gets to you um but you'll have
 
05:04:09.190 --> 05:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
other resources and links there if you
 
05:04:12.230 --> 05:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
want to look more um into this I also
 
05:04:14.750 --> 05:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
provided paper copies of a resource that
 
05:04:17.070 --> 05:04:17.080 align:start position:0%
was developed um for New Hampshire
 
05:04:19.270 --> 05:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
decision makers about two years ago or
 
05:04:22.708 --> 05:04:22.718 align:start position:0%
began two years ago um and it I just
 
05:04:24.868 --> 05:04:24.878 align:start position:0%
encourage you in your Public Safety
 
05:04:27.070 --> 05:04:27.080 align:start position:0%
capacity to look at that understand more
 
05:04:29.390 --> 05:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
about harm reduction um there's a
 
05:04:32.628 --> 05:04:32.638 align:start position:0%
variety of strategies in harm reduction
 
05:04:34.628 --> 05:04:34.638 align:start position:0%
um and if I can call your attention to
 
05:04:37.990 --> 05:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
page 12 and 13 it outlines a variety of
 
05:04:40.708 --> 05:04:40.718 align:start position:0%
different strategies and so I see New
 
05:04:42.990 --> 05:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire sort of as a late adopter of
 
05:04:45.350 --> 05:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
many of these strategies but we have
 
05:04:47.670 --> 05:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
comprehensive overdose education in the
 
05:04:49.990 --> 05:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
lock Zone distribution we established
 
05:04:51.788 --> 05:04:51.798 align:start position:0%
syringe services in
 
05:04:55.070 --> 05:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
2017 um this committee um established
 
05:04:58.030 --> 05:04:58.040 align:start position:0%
drug checking with rapid test strips um
 
05:05:00.590 --> 05:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
in 20 what's the year now
 
05:05:03.670 --> 05:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
2023 um and so what we're looking to is
 
05:05:05.750 --> 05:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
this next level of comprehensive drug
 
05:05:08.868 --> 05:05:08.878 align:start position:0%
checking um one of the one of the things
 
05:05:11.390 --> 05:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
that came up about drug legalization and
 
05:05:14.510 --> 05:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
past iterations um you know I hope that
 
05:05:16.430 --> 05:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
this resource helps you to understand
 
05:05:18.628 --> 05:05:18.638 align:start position:0%
but explain to your colleagues that
 
05:05:21.230 --> 05:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not looking this has
 
05:05:23.788 --> 05:05:23.798 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with Shooting Gallery safe
 
05:05:25.708 --> 05:05:25.718 align:start position:0%
injection sites overdose prevention
 
05:05:28.830 --> 05:05:28.840 align:start position:0%
sites which as a as an academic I will
 
05:05:31.948 --> 05:05:31.958 align:start position:0%
say have great evidence but I don't want
 
05:05:35.910 --> 05:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
any I don't want the conversation um to
 
05:05:38.628 --> 05:05:38.638 align:start position:0%
um cut this bill off because there's um
 
05:05:40.510 --> 05:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
more kind of fear mongering that has
 
05:05:44.270 --> 05:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
happened in past sessions I commend this
 
05:05:47.868 --> 05:05:47.878 align:start position:0%
committee and I um on all of this work
 
05:05:51.390 --> 05:05:51.400 align:start position:0%
um in from introduction in 2023 to
 
05:05:54.548 --> 05:05:54.558 align:start position:0%
retaining it and truly retaining it and
 
05:05:56.470 --> 05:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
um you know pushing through some of the
 
05:05:58.990 --> 05:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
language changes and things like that I
 
05:06:01.628 --> 05:06:01.638 align:start position:0%
think um one of the points that Liz made
 
05:06:03.910 --> 05:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
that's really important and is that
 
05:06:06.510 --> 05:06:06.520 align:start position:0%
we're seeing more and more of an illicit
 
05:06:09.788 --> 05:06:09.798 align:start position:0%
drug Market that are not opiates what
 
05:06:12.830 --> 05:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
are weight loss medications um and these
 
05:06:15.070 --> 05:06:15.080 align:start position:0%
are not coming from non FDA approved
 
05:06:17.868 --> 05:06:17.878 align:start position:0%
sources they're being imported and so if
 
05:06:21.150 --> 05:06:21.160 align:start position:0%
tomorrow suddenly we had an outbreak of
 
05:06:23.670 --> 05:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
um seizures and sinkable episodes while
 
05:06:26.070 --> 05:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
driving really and we found a common
 
05:06:28.868 --> 05:06:28.878 align:start position:0%
cause you know we don't have the ability
 
05:06:31.750 --> 05:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
in this state to address it rapidly in
 
05:06:33.788 --> 05:06:33.798 align:start position:0%
ways that other public health um
 
05:06:36.510 --> 05:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
departments do so I think the primary
 
05:06:39.628 --> 05:06:39.638 align:start position:0%
driver of this should be wanting um to
 
05:06:42.230 --> 05:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
prevent overdose and getting people into
 
05:06:44.830 --> 05:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
recovery um and I will just share
 
05:06:46.910 --> 05:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
personally this deeply affects me on a
 
05:06:49.548 --> 05:06:49.558 align:start position:0%
personal level the third author on the
 
05:06:52.150 --> 05:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
resource that we developed um
 
05:06:54.750 --> 05:06:54.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um was having a lot of
 
05:06:56.750 --> 05:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
struggles had been in long-term recovery
 
05:06:58.750 --> 05:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
and um didn't show up to a meeting and
 
05:07:00.548 --> 05:07:00.558 align:start position:0%
after checking on him I found one of my
 
05:07:04.030 --> 05:07:04.040 align:start position:0%
best friends dead um from an overdose um
 
05:07:07.990 --> 05:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
he had been um using um a substance in
 
05:07:10.110 --> 05:07:10.120 align:start position:0%
order to sort of get him through through
 
05:07:12.750 --> 05:07:12.760 align:start position:0%
it was not an opiate he had not um gone
 
05:07:15.830 --> 05:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
back to using opiates ever um but that
 
05:07:18.430 --> 05:07:18.440 align:start position:0%
the substance he was using did um was
 
05:07:20.110 --> 05:07:20.120 align:start position:0%
eventually confirmed to have fentanyl in
 
05:07:22.868 --> 05:07:22.878 align:start position:0%
it and that was his cause of death so he
 
05:07:25.750 --> 05:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
would be here advocating for this exact
 
05:07:28.910 --> 05:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
legislation um and I if he was here to
 
05:07:32.070 --> 05:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
be here um so I think that the other
 
05:07:33.868 --> 05:07:33.878 align:start position:0%
component and again there's more in the
 
05:07:36.270 --> 05:07:36.280 align:start position:0%
written testimony but is just to talk
 
05:07:39.590 --> 05:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
about what this looks like um I you know
 
05:07:41.750 --> 05:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
it currently there's syringe Services
 
05:07:44.350 --> 05:07:44.360 align:start position:0%
across the state not everywhere but in
 
05:07:46.310 --> 05:07:46.320 align:start position:0%
these programs these are Anonymous
 
05:07:48.990 --> 05:07:49.000 align:start position:0%
confidential Services where people
 
05:07:52.070 --> 05:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
engage with Public Health Providers um
 
05:07:54.030 --> 05:07:54.040 align:start position:0%
around getting safer supplies getting
 
05:07:56.510 --> 05:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
education and testing for HIV HPC
 
05:07:58.990 --> 05:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
referrals to treatment things like that
 
05:08:01.070 --> 05:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
we see these programs as then just being
 
05:08:03.230 --> 05:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
embedded in already existing programs
 
05:08:04.910 --> 05:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
there's not going to be a drug checking
 
05:08:07.310 --> 05:08:07.320 align:start position:0%
shop popping up um there's not going to
 
05:08:09.030 --> 05:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
be anything like that and so the changes
 
05:08:12.390 --> 05:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
in leg ation also really specify the T
 
05:08:16.788 --> 05:08:16.798 align:start position:0%
the tailoring of this bill to um to harm
 
05:08:18.868 --> 05:08:18.878 align:start position:0%
reduction programs that already exist
 
05:08:21.470 --> 05:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
because as Li Liz noted we can all go
 
05:08:23.230 --> 05:08:23.240 align:start position:0%
out on Amazon and buy one of these
 
05:08:25.470 --> 05:08:25.480 align:start position:0%
devices it's that we are currently
 
05:08:27.390 --> 05:08:27.400 align:start position:0%
missing Federal funding that is
 
05:08:29.750 --> 05:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
earmarked for this service and these
 
05:08:32.390 --> 05:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
Services um that are provided and are is
 
05:08:34.030 --> 05:08:34.040 align:start position:0%
being obtained from many other states
 
05:08:36.110 --> 05:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
because we don't have a legal route in
 
05:08:38.788 --> 05:08:38.798 align:start position:0%
order to conduct this um one of the
 
05:08:40.590 --> 05:08:40.600 align:start position:0%
other and I pass them all out so I don't
 
05:08:42.868 --> 05:08:42.878 align:start position:0%
have it in front of me um but we've had
 
05:08:44.470 --> 05:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of conversation in this Committee
 
05:08:46.990 --> 05:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
in the past around the amount and what
 
05:08:49.628 --> 05:08:49.638 align:start position:0%
constitutes a fatal overdose and we've
 
05:08:52.350 --> 05:08:52.360 align:start position:0%
we've talked about that we have um these
 
05:08:55.390 --> 05:08:55.400 align:start position:0%
little measurement spoons um that just
 
05:08:57.750 --> 05:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
give you an example of the small amount
 
05:08:59.590 --> 05:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
that is needed for comprehensive drug
 
05:09:02.310 --> 05:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
checking and what we're finding in
 
05:09:05.310 --> 05:09:05.320 align:start position:0%
states that are doing it is not this has
 
05:09:08.510 --> 05:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
heroin and Fentanyl but this has heroin
 
05:09:10.910 --> 05:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
Fentanyl Quil anti-depressants
 
05:09:12.868 --> 05:09:12.878 align:start position:0%
Veterinary meds like some of these
 
05:09:16.110 --> 05:09:16.120 align:start position:0%
samples have six different drugs and so
 
05:09:19.030 --> 05:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
the the trends around rapid test strips
 
05:09:21.390 --> 05:09:21.400 align:start position:0%
which are only developed for a specific
 
05:09:24.030 --> 05:09:24.040 align:start position:0%
drug do not keep up with this and this
 
05:09:26.548 --> 05:09:26.558 align:start position:0%
is passing this would enable us to
 
05:09:29.590 --> 05:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
develop the infrastructure to develop
 
05:09:32.350 --> 05:09:32.360 align:start position:0%
those resources we there's no budget
 
05:09:34.510 --> 05:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
mark on this we're not seeking funding
 
05:09:36.750 --> 05:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
for this project or program um this
 
05:09:38.628 --> 05:09:38.638 align:start position:0%
would all be up to the New Hampshire
 
05:09:40.788 --> 05:09:40.798 align:start position:0%
harm reduction Coalition and other
 
05:09:43.510 --> 05:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
partners in order to obtain funding for
 
05:09:47.030 --> 05:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
this with that I'm one other mention I'm
 
05:09:49.030 --> 05:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
sorry um the other mention that we had
 
05:09:50.830 --> 05:09:50.840 align:start position:0%
talked about before was xylazine
 
05:09:54.670 --> 05:09:54.680 align:start position:0%
xylazine um is more and more um in our
 
05:09:58.070 --> 05:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
drug Supply um in the last year it was
 
05:10:02.110 --> 05:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
associated with was seen in 34 overdoses
 
05:10:04.070 --> 05:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
and as you know the medical examiner is
 
05:10:07.350 --> 05:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
well behind in analyzing samples so that
 
05:10:09.310 --> 05:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
number is as of December I would
 
05:10:11.150 --> 05:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
expected to be much higher once final
 
05:10:13.708 --> 05:10:13.718 align:start position:0%
reports come out the issue from a
 
05:10:15.430 --> 05:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
healthcare provider perspective with
 
05:10:18.030 --> 05:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
xylazine is it is used as a Veterinary
 
05:10:21.628 --> 05:10:21.638 align:start position:0%
tranquilizer when used um when snorted
 
05:10:25.750 --> 05:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
or injected by humans um it causes um
 
05:10:27.830 --> 05:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
massive ugly wounds that are similar to
 
05:10:31.670 --> 05:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
Burns and take a long time to heal um so
 
05:10:34.390 --> 05:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
people will not use medication will not
 
05:10:36.270 --> 05:10:36.280 align:start position:0%
use substances with xylazine if they
 
05:10:39.070 --> 05:10:39.080 align:start position:0%
know the presence another huge barrier
 
05:10:41.708 --> 05:10:41.718 align:start position:0%
and a huge issue with xylazine use is
 
05:10:43.750 --> 05:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
that our current um substance use
 
05:10:46.750 --> 05:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
treatment infrastructure um does not is
 
05:10:49.670 --> 05:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
not integrated with medical care and so
 
05:10:53.110 --> 05:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
one of the qualifying factors for hey I
 
05:10:55.310 --> 05:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
want to get into recovery please get me
 
05:10:57.788 --> 05:10:57.798 align:start position:0%
in into inpatient is do you have any
 
05:11:01.270 --> 05:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
open wounds so we now have a drug Supply
 
05:11:02.830 --> 05:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
that's creating more and more open
 
05:11:06.470 --> 05:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
wounds and it becomes a a key barrier to
 
05:11:08.628 --> 05:11:08.638 align:start position:0%
people seeking recovery and treatment as
 
05:11:10.110 --> 05:11:10.120 align:start position:0%
they can't get into those treatment
 
05:11:12.310 --> 05:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
facilities because they're not a Medical
 
05:11:15.110 --> 05:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
Care Facility they specifically focus on
 
05:11:18.030 --> 05:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
addiction treatment and with that I'm
 
05:11:19.948 --> 05:11:19.958 align:start position:0%
we're happy I I appreciate the
 
05:11:22.948 --> 05:11:22.958 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be together um one of us
 
05:11:24.548 --> 05:11:24.558 align:start position:0%
can probably answer most of your
 
05:11:27.390 --> 05:11:27.400 align:start position:0%
questions um but both of us together is
 
05:11:31.190 --> 05:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:35.708 --> 05:11:35.718 align:start position:0%
um two is better than one so if if I may
 
05:11:38.150 --> 05:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
I my my clerk was kind enough to tell me
 
05:11:39.430 --> 05:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
when she passed this out this is this is
 
05:11:41.150 --> 05:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
what you this is like what you guys were
 
05:11:45.670 --> 05:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
ref referencing okay so is this little
 
05:11:47.750 --> 05:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
spoon feel like I'm going to feed a
 
05:11:52.590 --> 05:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
little bird or something um is is that
 
05:11:56.430 --> 05:11:56.440 align:start position:0%
amount is that enough to a flat little
 
05:12:00.910 --> 05:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
teeny spoon here is enough to do
 
05:12:00.920 --> 05:12:03.270 align:start position:0%
teeny spoon here is enough to do
comprehensive

05:12:03.270 --> 05:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
comprehensive
 
05:12:06.070 --> 05:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
checking okay thank you but is that if a
 
05:12:08.270 --> 05:12:08.280 align:start position:0%
person H if a person would have that
 
05:12:10.230 --> 05:12:10.240 align:start position:0%
much of one of these drugs that we're
 
05:12:11.948 --> 05:12:11.958 align:start position:0%
talking about is that enough is that a
 
05:12:16.868 --> 05:12:16.878 align:start position:0%
fatal dose so the um answer is probably
 
05:12:21.750 --> 05:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
not the the this is 10 milligrams um so
 
05:12:23.868 --> 05:12:23.878 align:start position:0%
there's two different pieces there's
 
05:12:26.110 --> 05:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
potency of medication and there's weight
 
05:12:28.430 --> 05:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
so this is a physical measurement of
 
05:12:32.470 --> 05:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
weight or or of a substance um in
 
05:12:38.310 --> 05:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
general for um for the potency all a lot
 
05:12:41.788 --> 05:12:41.798 align:start position:0%
of what we've heard is within a grain of
 
05:12:44.590 --> 05:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
rice within a little speck within you
 
05:12:48.190 --> 05:12:48.200 align:start position:0%
know one grain can um lead to an
 
05:12:49.510 --> 05:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
elephant to overdose I don't know I'm
 
05:12:52.510 --> 05:12:52.520 align:start position:0%
making them up now but um there has not
 
05:12:54.470 --> 05:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
been scientific literature that has
 
05:12:57.310 --> 05:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
supported all of that there's a lot of
 
05:13:00.270 --> 05:13:00.280 align:start position:0%
factors within that I know that it's one
 
05:13:03.150 --> 05:13:03.160 align:start position:0%
of those potential um I can't say that
 
05:13:05.830 --> 05:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
it's impossible but there's nothing
 
05:13:08.868 --> 05:13:08.878 align:start position:0%
scientifically to support that this size
 
05:13:11.350 --> 05:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
um accidentally encountered could you
 
05:13:13.030 --> 05:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
know lead to an
 
05:13:15.270 --> 05:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
overdose in general what you would be
 
05:13:18.868 --> 05:13:18.878 align:start position:0%
seeing would be use of 100 times this
 
05:13:21.150 --> 05:13:21.160 align:start position:0%
amount in a single use as far as like a
 
05:13:23.910 --> 05:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
physical measure and we don't see
 
05:13:27.590 --> 05:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
everyone using that amount overdosing so
 
05:13:30.070 --> 05:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
did I get to your question or no I I
 
05:13:32.070 --> 05:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
think so but I I actually have um a
 
05:13:34.030 --> 05:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
couple questions I'm I'm actually trying
 
05:13:35.230 --> 05:13:35.240 align:start position:0%
to learn something here so if you don't
 
05:13:37.628 --> 05:13:37.638 align:start position:0%
mind bear in with me okay all right so
 
05:13:39.990 --> 05:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
if if this my understanding from you're
 
05:13:41.830 --> 05:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
saying though so that this is what you
 
05:13:43.590 --> 05:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
could use this amount to
 
05:13:47.350 --> 05:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
test to to test this drug right okay so
 
05:13:47.360 --> 05:13:48.350 align:start position:0%
test to to test this drug right okay so
then

05:13:48.350 --> 05:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:13:52.830 --> 05:13:52.840 align:start position:0%
how what would be considered no
 
05:13:56.190 --> 05:13:56.200 align:start position:0%
longer used for testing because I I
 
05:13:58.230 --> 05:13:58.240 align:start position:0%
think Representative no was trying to
 
05:13:59.788 --> 05:13:59.798 align:start position:0%
was touching on that but I wasn't able
 
05:14:00.948 --> 05:14:00.958 align:start position:0%
to find it because there was a lot of
 
05:14:02.548 --> 05:14:02.558 align:start position:0%
pages and it looked like the first page
 
05:14:04.030 --> 05:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't really the bill it was more
 
05:14:06.230 --> 05:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
statistics unless I didn't read that
 
05:14:08.350 --> 05:14:08.360 align:start position:0%
right so I kind of got a little bit lost
 
05:14:10.110 --> 05:14:10.120 align:start position:0%
with the number
 
05:14:13.670 --> 05:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
so is there an amount that is that is no
 
05:14:15.430 --> 05:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
longer considered to
 
05:14:19.030 --> 05:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
be checking and it's actually the the
 
05:14:21.788 --> 05:14:21.798 align:start position:0%
person has illegal drugs for illegal
 
05:14:23.948 --> 05:14:23.958 align:start position:0%
reasons like where is that line yeah so
 
05:14:26.310 --> 05:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
one of the changes from prior iterations
 
05:14:28.350 --> 05:14:28.360 align:start position:0%
is that we're not we're not looking for
 
05:14:30.788 --> 05:14:30.798 align:start position:0%
any exemption for people bringing drugs
 
05:14:33.628 --> 05:14:33.638 align:start position:0%
to drug drug checking meaning like this
 
05:14:35.830 --> 05:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
is for protection of Public Health
 
05:14:39.110 --> 05:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
officials doing the testing the the
 
05:14:42.150 --> 05:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
issue with why would there be an amount
 
05:14:45.910 --> 05:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
is you know if we test rapidly um this
 
05:14:48.788 --> 05:14:48.798 align:start position:0%
small size part of best practice is to
 
05:14:51.628 --> 05:14:51.638 align:start position:0%
intermittently do confirmatory testing
 
05:14:53.190 --> 05:14:53.200 align:start position:0%
in which we would have to take that
 
05:14:56.628 --> 05:14:56.638 align:start position:0%
scoop and put it in a secure safe baggie
 
05:14:59.750 --> 05:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
and send it to an external lab and so in
 
05:15:02.070 --> 05:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
that time it would be in possession
 
05:15:05.350 --> 05:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
possession by the drug Checker by the
 
05:15:08.628 --> 05:15:08.638 align:start position:0%
you know person providing the service
 
05:15:10.470 --> 05:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
Okay so that would go where where
 
05:15:12.830 --> 05:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
representative n was saying about taking
 
05:15:15.270 --> 05:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
the the amount out because there was
 
05:15:17.270 --> 05:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
like no right or wrong or kind of got
 
05:15:21.310 --> 05:15:21.320 align:start position:0%
con convoluted in with that that's not
 
05:15:23.230 --> 05:15:23.240 align:start position:0%
so the one that's being taken out on
 
05:15:27.708 --> 05:15:27.718 align:start position:0%
page that was one coming in foresting
 
05:15:31.548 --> 05:15:31.558 align:start position:0%
okay but it is still in
 
05:15:40.830 --> 05:15:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:43.868 --> 05:15:43.878 align:start position:0%
So ba so basically there's there's not
 
05:15:46.750 --> 05:15:46.760 align:start position:0%
an amount there's not an
 
05:15:50.230 --> 05:15:50.240 align:start position:0%
amount or there is an amount I'm sorry
 
05:15:53.470 --> 05:15:53.480 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry no I the I believe there is
 
05:15:55.270 --> 05:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
not an amount but I'm just looking for
 
05:15:57.750 --> 05:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
clarification on the terminology but
 
05:16:01.030 --> 05:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
that was for the center right like
 
05:16:03.670 --> 05:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
like to be able to do confirmatory
 
05:16:03.680 --> 05:16:09.070 align:start position:0%
like to be able to do confirmatory
testing

05:16:09.070 --> 05:16:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:13.350 --> 05:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:13.360 --> 05:16:15.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:16:15.310 --> 05:16:15.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:16:19.030 --> 05:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
okay okay and then I um
 
05:16:21.868 --> 05:16:21.878 align:start position:0%
one one other question that that I have
 
05:16:21.878 --> 05:16:23.670 align:start position:0%
one one other question that that I have
is

05:16:23.670 --> 05:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:16:26.030 --> 05:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
so so we're you know there's a lot of
 
05:16:28.628 --> 05:16:28.638 align:start position:0%
talk about what what this is done and
 
05:16:31.350 --> 05:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
the intention of that which is not lost
 
05:16:33.948 --> 05:16:33.958 align:start position:0%
of me so my my question is though what
 
05:16:37.030 --> 05:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
what where's the deterrent like is is
 
05:16:39.670 --> 05:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
that part of this program anywhere cuz I
 
05:16:41.788 --> 05:16:41.798 align:start position:0%
I haven't heard that but I don't I don't
 
05:16:43.788 --> 05:16:43.798 align:start position:0%
know it might might be in here it might
 
05:16:46.270 --> 05:16:46.280 align:start position:0%
just got lost on me because I was trying
 
05:16:47.430 --> 05:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
like to find a where that you guys were
 
05:16:49.910 --> 05:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
saying this stuff the deterrent to drug
 
05:16:51.670 --> 05:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
use in particular you mean well
 
05:16:52.948 --> 05:16:52.958 align:start position:0%
specifically right so like at the
 
05:16:54.750 --> 05:16:54.760 align:start position:0%
schools you know like you have like we
 
05:16:55.948 --> 05:16:55.958 align:start position:0%
did this last
 
05:16:58.190 --> 05:16:58.200 align:start position:0%
year and I remember we passed it and
 
05:16:59.590 --> 05:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
then I went to the school and there are
 
05:17:01.230 --> 05:17:01.240 align:start position:0%
posters like everywhere that say about
 
05:17:03.430 --> 05:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
you know there's no no safe experience
 
05:17:05.310 --> 05:17:05.320 align:start position:0%
and like that like this should not be
 
05:17:08.270 --> 05:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
relied upon but I feel like we're going
 
05:17:10.548 --> 05:17:10.558 align:start position:0%
that direction so is there like
 
05:17:13.350 --> 05:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
deterrence with this or what is that
 
05:17:16.230 --> 05:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
public deterrent instead of check your
 
05:17:17.910 --> 05:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
drugs is
 
05:17:20.628 --> 05:17:20.638 align:start position:0%
there is there the deterrent Factor like
 
05:17:23.350 --> 05:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
like the funding for that part or is is
 
05:17:24.910 --> 05:17:24.920 align:start position:0%
this where is this the trend that
 
05:17:27.510 --> 05:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to I'm I'm not totally
 
05:17:28.948 --> 05:17:28.958 align:start position:0%
sure but I'll try to answer and then
 
05:17:32.990 --> 05:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
tell me if I misinterpreted um I think
 
05:17:36.390 --> 05:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
that part of part of the
 
05:17:39.270 --> 05:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
um the way that we know these Services
 
05:17:40.990 --> 05:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
work and harm reduction services in
 
05:17:44.310 --> 05:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
general is that engagement in protecting
 
05:17:47.548 --> 05:17:47.558 align:start position:0%
your health and safety is one step in
 
05:17:51.030 --> 05:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
moving up in other ways of protecting
 
05:17:53.230 --> 05:17:53.240 align:start position:0%
your health and safety including getting
 
05:17:56.350 --> 05:17:56.360 align:start position:0%
into treatment and recovery and so in
 
05:17:58.788 --> 05:17:58.798 align:start position:0%
general we know that harm Ru engagement
 
05:18:00.670 --> 05:18:00.680 align:start position:0%
with harm reduction services like drug
 
05:18:04.868 --> 05:18:04.878 align:start position:0%
checking and needle exchange um lead to
 
05:18:08.150 --> 05:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
seven times greater um entrance sorry
 
05:18:10.190 --> 05:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
it's in the pack somewhere but um you
 
05:18:14.910 --> 05:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
know lead to seven times more um seven
 
05:18:16.430 --> 05:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
times greater likelihood that people
 
05:18:18.750 --> 05:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
will engage in treatment and recovery
 
05:18:21.948 --> 05:18:21.958 align:start position:0%
and part of it is that we now
 
05:18:24.070 --> 05:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that it's trauma is the
 
05:18:28.070 --> 05:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
gateway to substance use um and that
 
05:18:29.590 --> 05:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
within that and getting into
 
05:18:31.510 --> 05:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
comprehensive treatment there's a lot of
 
05:18:34.030 --> 05:18:34.040 align:start position:0%
self- stigma that people who use drugs
 
05:18:37.510 --> 05:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
possess in um making those small steps
 
05:18:39.670 --> 05:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
just with any other chronic condition is
 
05:18:41.750 --> 05:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
really important to get them into
 
05:18:45.310 --> 05:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
treatment um it's not people who engage
 
05:18:47.628 --> 05:18:47.638 align:start position:0%
in drug checking sign into treatment the
 
05:18:51.510 --> 05:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
next day it's more of a um General
 
05:18:52.788 --> 05:18:52.798 align:start position:0%
understanding that's been developed over
 
05:18:55.750 --> 05:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years in addiction medicine
 
05:18:58.548 --> 05:18:58.558 align:start position:0%
okay does that help did that get there
 
05:19:00.670 --> 05:19:00.680 align:start position:0%
yeah okay and then what would happen so
 
05:19:02.990 --> 05:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
if a person were to if this drug is
 
05:19:05.150 --> 05:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
checked and then it and it is bad like
 
05:19:08.948 --> 05:19:08.958 align:start position:0%
is there any kind of a statistic that
 
05:19:08.958 --> 05:19:10.110 align:start position:0%
is there any kind of a statistic that
that

05:19:10.110 --> 05:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:19:12.868 --> 05:19:12.878 align:start position:0%
says like what does a person do in that
 
05:19:15.628 --> 05:19:15.638 align:start position:0%
situation right like oh nope that's bad
 
05:19:18.150 --> 05:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
yeah are they likely to take
 
05:19:18.160 --> 05:19:19.910 align:start position:0%
yeah are they likely to take
less

05:19:19.910 --> 05:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
less
 
05:19:23.548 --> 05:19:23.558 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't have an exact statistic but
 
05:19:25.150 --> 05:19:25.160 align:start position:0%
what happens in many drug checking
 
05:19:27.628 --> 05:19:27.638 align:start position:0%
programs across the US is that usually
 
05:19:29.788 --> 05:19:29.798 align:start position:0%
participants after they get their result
 
05:19:32.030 --> 05:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
go into direct counseling with a harm
 
05:19:34.670 --> 05:19:34.680 align:start position:0%
reduction Specialist or um a public
 
05:19:36.190 --> 05:19:36.200 align:start position:0%
health professional and they have a
 
05:19:39.548 --> 05:19:39.558 align:start position:0%
conversation about what are the risks of
 
05:19:40.948 --> 05:19:40.958 align:start position:0%
this substance now that you know
 
05:19:43.070 --> 05:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
everything that it's in it um and a lot
 
05:19:46.230 --> 05:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
of folks when that happens are able to
 
05:19:48.150 --> 05:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
toss out their drugs um because they're
 
05:19:49.788 --> 05:19:49.798 align:start position:0%
not interested in taking xylazine
 
05:19:51.070 --> 05:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
they're not interested in having
 
05:19:54.390 --> 05:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
benzodiazapines or anything baby powder
 
05:19:56.868 --> 05:19:56.878 align:start position:0%
in their system um injecting that into
 
05:20:01.910 --> 05:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
themselves so they're they're able to um
 
05:20:04.190 --> 05:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
really I just totally lost my train of
 
05:20:06.190 --> 05:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
thought but yeah I I think what we know
 
05:20:09.470 --> 05:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
is that that we do see that you know
 
05:20:11.430 --> 05:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
preliminary numbers have been about 50%
 
05:20:14.150 --> 05:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
of people take measures to reduce their
 
05:20:16.070 --> 05:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
risk based on those conversations that
 
05:20:19.190 --> 05:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
Liz is describing so they don't use the
 
05:20:22.310 --> 05:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
drug they use less of the drug they um
 
05:20:24.670 --> 05:20:24.680 align:start position:0%
use in a different way that's less
 
05:20:26.910 --> 05:20:26.920 align:start position:0%
likely to result in overdose wounds
 
05:20:31.070 --> 05:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
things like that um thank thank you
 
05:20:33.070 --> 05:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for answering my questions I
 
05:20:35.510 --> 05:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
hope I didn't they were great questions
 
05:20:37.670 --> 05:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
I tried to learn something there um or
 
05:20:40.350 --> 05:20:40.360 align:start position:0%
representative pette
 
05:20:43.948 --> 05:20:43.958 align:start position:0%
hi um can you just clarify for me who I
 
05:20:44.990 --> 05:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm just not really
 
05:20:46.230 --> 05:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
understanding who would have this
 
05:20:48.470 --> 05:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
equipment in in their hands like who
 
05:20:51.910 --> 05:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
would be you who would have this and how
 
05:20:54.788 --> 05:20:54.798 align:start position:0%
are the people that need this
 
05:20:58.270 --> 05:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
service utilizing it like how are they
 
05:21:03.030 --> 05:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:06.788 --> 05:21:06.798 align:start position:0%
equipment um I can try and say that uh
 
05:21:08.270 --> 05:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
you know implementation would definitely
 
05:21:10.470 --> 05:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
have to take a little bit for any kind
 
05:21:12.548 --> 05:21:12.558 align:start position:0%
of drug checking program for the
 
05:21:15.230 --> 05:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
Coalition but it would be Public Health
 
05:21:19.350 --> 05:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
officials um it would be those who are
 
05:21:22.350 --> 05:21:22.360 align:start position:0%
uh SSP workers har reduction Specialists
 
05:21:27.030 --> 05:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
um and most likely we would uh share
 
05:21:29.430 --> 05:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
this kind of Technology the same way
 
05:21:32.548 --> 05:21:32.558 align:start position:0%
that we share um how folks can get to an
 
05:21:34.548 --> 05:21:34.558 align:start position:0%
SSP or come and get those harm reduction
 
05:21:36.830 --> 05:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
Services through Word of Mouth um
 
05:21:38.948 --> 05:21:38.958 align:start position:0%
through various advertisements on on
 
05:21:41.070 --> 05:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
social media newspapers all those things
 
05:21:44.510 --> 05:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
but um it would be targeted at folks who
 
05:21:46.868 --> 05:21:46.878 align:start position:0%
are probably already using the exchanges
 
05:21:49.190 --> 05:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
and participating in harm reduction um
 
05:21:51.110 --> 05:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
because it is something that they ask at
 
05:21:53.750 --> 05:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
every single SSP how do I know what's in
 
05:21:55.830 --> 05:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
my Supply because if xylazine in it I do
 
05:21:59.150 --> 05:21:59.160 align:start position:0%
not want it okay and I will just say one
 
05:22:01.788 --> 05:22:01.798 align:start position:0%
of the other populations of of Interest
 
05:22:04.990 --> 05:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
into Target is around we see less
 
05:22:06.910 --> 05:22:06.920 align:start position:0%
engagement in harm reduction services
 
05:22:09.310 --> 05:22:09.320 align:start position:0%
around like say college age youth
 
05:22:12.190 --> 05:22:12.200 align:start position:0%
um but we know that substance use is um
 
05:22:15.230 --> 05:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
is happening and so this becomes another
 
05:22:18.070 --> 05:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
tool when when people are you know
 
05:22:20.070 --> 05:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
buying pressed pills in order to get
 
05:22:22.868 --> 05:22:22.878 align:start position:0%
through finals um which yes I can
 
05:22:24.910 --> 05:22:24.920 align:start position:0%
acknowledge we don't want them to do but
 
05:22:28.190 --> 05:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
um they then engage in services that are
 
05:22:29.750 --> 05:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
disconnected from their parents health
 
05:22:32.230 --> 05:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
insurance disconnected from their school
 
05:22:34.430 --> 05:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
that they may face repercussions it
 
05:22:36.868 --> 05:22:36.878 align:start position:0%
gives them a confidential source to
 
05:22:39.270 --> 05:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
engage with drug checking and also then
 
05:22:41.548 --> 05:22:41.558 align:start position:0%
to support if they want to get into
 
05:22:42.750 --> 05:22:42.760 align:start position:0%
treatment or they need to get into
 
05:22:44.350 --> 05:22:44.360 align:start position:0%
treatment or taking other steps to
 
05:22:46.150 --> 05:22:46.160 align:start position:0%
improve their
 
05:22:50.548 --> 05:22:50.558 align:start position:0%
safety okay uh follow up sure follow up
 
05:22:53.628 --> 05:22:53.638 align:start position:0%
um so we we have an engagement Center so
 
05:22:55.708 --> 05:22:55.718 align:start position:0%
where I'm at like we have a shelter with
 
05:22:57.628 --> 05:22:57.638 align:start position:0%
engagement Center so and there's harm
 
05:22:59.948 --> 05:22:59.958 align:start position:0%
reduction Services there as far as I'm I
 
05:23:03.230 --> 05:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
know so it would be somebody there that
 
05:23:05.470 --> 05:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
works within harm harm reduction that
 
05:23:08.110 --> 05:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
would be utilizing that equipment may
 
05:23:11.510 --> 05:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
ask you are Manchester Manchester yes so
 
05:23:14.670 --> 05:23:14.680 align:start position:0%
it would be the overdose um prevention
 
05:23:16.990 --> 05:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
coordinator it could be Public Health
 
05:23:18.788 --> 05:23:18.798 align:start position:0%
officials it could be something where
 
05:23:20.430 --> 05:23:20.440 align:start position:0%
people are doing I mean they're already
 
05:23:24.350 --> 05:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
doing HIV and hepatitis C testing in
 
05:23:26.310 --> 05:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
collaboration with harm reduction
 
05:23:29.470 --> 05:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
Services mobile van we have mobile Vans
 
05:23:31.190 --> 05:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
um or we I don't I'm not with the
 
05:23:33.350 --> 05:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
organization I just they let me hang out
 
05:23:36.350 --> 05:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
with them um you know so it would be
 
05:23:38.030 --> 05:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
those same services this wouldn't be a
 
05:23:39.510 --> 05:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
new service it would just be another
 
05:23:41.750 --> 05:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
tool in currently existing Services okay
 
05:23:41.760 --> 05:23:43.430 align:start position:0%
tool in currently existing Services okay
thank

05:23:43.430 --> 05:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:23:46.868 --> 05:23:46.878 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:23:49.868 --> 05:23:49.878 align:start position:0%
Newman it sounds like I mean reading
 
05:23:53.590 --> 05:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
this um that you do portable drug
 
05:23:53.600 --> 05:23:55.070 align:start position:0%
this um that you do portable drug
checking

05:23:55.070 --> 05:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
checking
 
05:23:57.430 --> 05:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
now is that what I maybe I
 
05:24:00.110 --> 05:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted yeah no not not in the
 
05:24:02.470 --> 05:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
state um at least the New Hampshire har
 
05:24:03.990 --> 05:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
reduction Coalition or myself as a
 
05:24:06.310 --> 05:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
researcher we are unable to do that at
 
05:24:08.708 --> 05:24:08.718 align:start position:0%
this time um we just work with
 
05:24:10.110 --> 05:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
collaborate with a lot of folks in
 
05:24:13.708 --> 05:24:13.718 align:start position:0%
Vermont Massachusetts that do this offer
 
05:24:16.270 --> 05:24:16.280 align:start position:0%
this service regularly and and we do
 
05:24:20.070 --> 05:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
offer test strips oh yes follow up
 
05:24:22.390 --> 05:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
follow up so would is that one of the
 
05:24:24.390 --> 05:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
benefits of this bill that it would
 
05:24:27.868 --> 05:24:27.878 align:start position:0%
allow you to do that without Li take the
 
05:24:30.150 --> 05:24:30.160 align:start position:0%
liability away is that yeah that's the
 
05:24:32.788 --> 05:24:32.798 align:start position:0%
express purpose and and to be honest if
 
05:24:35.030 --> 05:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
if we could I I think that it it's
 
05:24:38.830 --> 05:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
really being able to fund these services
 
05:24:40.788 --> 05:24:40.798 align:start position:0%
not through State funding but rather
 
05:24:43.830 --> 05:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
there are federal grants um that we are
 
05:24:47.350 --> 05:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
unable to obtain because it is not
 
05:24:49.310 --> 05:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
expressly legal in New Hampshire
 
05:24:51.510 --> 05:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
legislation thank
 
05:24:54.628 --> 05:24:54.638 align:start position:0%
you there any any other questions we're
 
05:25:00.788 --> 05:25:00.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:16.990 --> 05:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:19.030 --> 05:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Kate fry I'm
 
05:25:20.910 --> 05:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
the vice president of advocacy at new
 
05:25:24.910 --> 05:25:24.920 align:start position:0%
futures um we are in support of HB 226
 
05:25:26.788 --> 05:25:26.798 align:start position:0%
um I don't think I have much more to add
 
05:25:28.548 --> 05:25:28.558 align:start position:0%
because all of my points have been said
 
05:25:30.430 --> 05:25:30.440 align:start position:0%
but I will leave you with my written
 
05:25:34.470 --> 05:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
testimony as well as um a document from
 
05:25:36.910 --> 05:25:36.920 align:start position:0%
the new uh Network for public health law
 
05:25:38.910 --> 05:25:38.920 align:start position:0%
that really talks about this issue and
 
05:25:41.190 --> 05:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
it's a survey of other states because
 
05:25:43.190 --> 05:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
we're not alone in this um a lot of
 
05:25:45.670 --> 05:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
other states are looking to address the
 
05:25:47.470 --> 05:25:47.480 align:start position:0%
um issue as well so this will give you
 
05:25:49.750 --> 05:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
an idea of what other states are doing
 
05:25:51.750 --> 05:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
um I do just want to underscore
 
05:25:54.948 --> 05:25:54.958 align:start position:0%
representative musa's point I think one
 
05:25:57.948 --> 05:25:57.958 align:start position:0%
of the main reasons that we uh New
 
05:26:00.670 --> 05:26:00.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has been um successful as far
 
05:26:04.708 --> 05:26:04.718 align:start position:0%
as like slowing down the um overdoses is
 
05:26:07.310 --> 05:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
that we tried a little bit of everything
 
05:26:08.788 --> 05:26:08.798 align:start position:0%
um and
 
05:26:10.430 --> 05:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
uh we've been involved in things like
 
05:26:13.590 --> 05:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
the Good Samaritan law um Narcan
 
05:26:15.750 --> 05:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
distribution and we look at this as one
 
05:26:19.670 --> 05:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
more tool in the toolbox and um although
 
05:26:22.510 --> 05:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
we have an exception for xylazine and
 
05:26:25.190 --> 05:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
fenal strips this is a comprehensive
 
05:26:27.548 --> 05:26:27.558 align:start position:0%
drug checking program and we really
 
05:26:30.190 --> 05:26:30.200 align:start position:0%
support taking the next steps because as
 
05:26:32.470 --> 05:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
we know uh the people who put the drug
 
05:26:34.910 --> 05:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
Supply out there they they're very smart
 
05:26:37.430 --> 05:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
things change all the time we need to be
 
05:26:41.310 --> 05:26:41.320 align:start position:0%
um equipped to be very um Nimble as well
 
05:26:45.788 --> 05:26:45.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:47.750 --> 05:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you very much are there
 
05:26:49.708 --> 05:26:49.718 align:start position:0%
any anybody have any questions we're all
 
05:26:56.868 --> 05:26:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:00.230 --> 05:27:00.240 align:start position:0%

05:27:03.948 --> 05:27:03.958 align:start position:0%
Captain Major D I knew I was going to I
 
05:27:03.958 --> 05:27:05.350 align:start position:0%
Captain Major D I knew I was going to I
knew

05:27:05.350 --> 05:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
knew
 
05:27:07.628 --> 05:27:07.638 align:start position:0%
that can I have a can I have a do over
 
05:27:11.030 --> 05:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:13.390 --> 05:27:13.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not titles but uh my name is Bill
 
05:27:15.190 --> 05:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
brigh I am a a major with the state
 
05:27:17.030 --> 05:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
police I oversee our Investigative
 
05:27:20.390 --> 05:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
Services Bureau um and I've listened to
 
05:27:22.948 --> 05:27:22.958 align:start position:0%
uh all the testimony today about this um
 
05:27:26.910 --> 05:27:26.920 align:start position:0%
Bill and um you know as has been said
 
05:27:29.548 --> 05:27:29.558 align:start position:0%
law enforcement is just as much invested
 
05:27:31.628 --> 05:27:31.638 align:start position:0%
in Saving Lives as as everybody else
 
05:27:35.628 --> 05:27:35.638 align:start position:0%
that has been at this table today um the
 
05:27:38.788 --> 05:27:38.798 align:start position:0%
part of my uh purpose in being here and
 
05:27:42.750 --> 05:27:42.760 align:start position:0%
part of my job I think is to um with my
 
05:27:45.030 --> 05:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
experience look at a bill like this or
 
05:27:47.548 --> 05:27:47.558 align:start position:0%
or a law and try and and try and think
 
05:27:48.990 --> 05:27:49.000 align:start position:0%
okay is there a way that something like
 
05:27:51.548 --> 05:27:51.558 align:start position:0%
this could be exploited by uh somebody
 
05:27:54.548 --> 05:27:54.558 align:start position:0%
that has bad intentions um one thing
 
05:27:56.590 --> 05:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
that I'll just say right now is as this
 
05:27:58.110 --> 05:27:58.120 align:start position:0%
is written and I understand that there
 
05:28:00.070 --> 05:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
may be an amendment uh coming so there
 
05:28:01.910 --> 05:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
might be uh you know some answers to
 
05:28:04.110 --> 05:28:04.120 align:start position:0%
some of these things but as this is
 
05:28:06.670 --> 05:28:06.680 align:start position:0%
written it's it is very broad um
 
05:28:08.910 --> 05:28:08.920 align:start position:0%
thinking about page four
 
05:28:11.670 --> 05:28:11.680 align:start position:0%
specifically um you know at at the top
 
05:28:14.430 --> 05:28:14.440 align:start position:0%
of the page uh line four it says a
 
05:28:16.750 --> 05:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
person um I know it's been said that it
 
05:28:18.708 --> 05:28:18.718 align:start position:0%
will be you know that this will only be
 
05:28:22.868 --> 05:28:22.878 align:start position:0%
employees of these facilities um but the
 
05:28:24.510 --> 05:28:24.520 align:start position:0%
way this bill is written right now it
 
05:28:27.390 --> 05:28:27.400 align:start position:0%
does not specify that um it says any
 
05:28:30.110 --> 05:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
person who possesses transports delivers
 
05:28:34.030 --> 05:28:34.040 align:start position:0%
or provides uh a nominal amount and I
 
05:28:35.590 --> 05:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
understand that that may be that wording
 
05:28:38.230 --> 05:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
may be taken out but the question still
 
05:28:42.110 --> 05:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
remains is how does somebody bring uh an
 
05:28:45.230 --> 05:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
illegal dangerous narcotic drug uh
 
05:28:47.150 --> 05:28:47.160 align:start position:0%
somewhere safely in order to get it
 
05:28:49.270 --> 05:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
checked I don't have that answer I don't
 
05:28:52.868 --> 05:28:52.878 align:start position:0%
know what the answer is to that um but
 
05:28:55.230 --> 05:28:55.240 align:start position:0%
that is one concern that I have um you
 
05:28:58.750 --> 05:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
know how how does that actually happen
 
05:29:02.270 --> 05:29:02.280 align:start position:0%
um and would they be responsible if they
 
05:29:04.470 --> 05:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
had more than whatever this amount is
 
05:29:08.110 --> 05:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
that seems like should be established um
 
05:29:11.270 --> 05:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
on the flip side of that if a uh you
 
05:29:13.910 --> 05:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
know if an employee of the harm
 
05:29:18.230 --> 05:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
reduction site takes in uh you know a
 
05:29:20.390 --> 05:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
small bag from somebody that is more
 
05:29:23.270 --> 05:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
than they need in order to do the to
 
05:29:24.910 --> 05:29:24.920 align:start position:0%
check like what's the what's the
 
05:29:26.948 --> 05:29:26.958 align:start position:0%
procedure what's the process for that
 
05:29:29.150 --> 05:29:29.160 align:start position:0%
are are they disposing of the rest of it
 
05:29:31.548 --> 05:29:31.558 align:start position:0%
are they giving it back I I just think
 
05:29:33.390 --> 05:29:33.400 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of questions that
 
05:29:36.590 --> 05:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
that need to be answered uh in something
 
05:29:38.868 --> 05:29:38.878 align:start position:0%
like this and it doesn't mean that um
 
05:29:41.830 --> 05:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
you know we we wouldn't be willing to uh
 
05:29:44.030 --> 05:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
you know to work with a committee if one
 
05:29:46.670 --> 05:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
was established or um Representatives
 
05:29:48.470 --> 05:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
that are that are trying to to work on
 
05:29:50.190 --> 05:29:50.200 align:start position:0%
this I I certainly can't say that we
 
05:29:52.750 --> 05:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
would support it um as of now we oppose
 
05:29:55.470 --> 05:29:55.480 align:start position:0%
this bill um the way it's written um if
 
05:30:00.070 --> 05:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
you look further down on page four um
 
05:30:05.190 --> 05:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
sections uh four and five I mean it
 
05:30:06.868 --> 05:30:06.878 align:start position:0%
we're offering subject to revocation and
 
05:30:09.510 --> 05:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
probation parle or pre-trial release
 
05:30:11.030 --> 05:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
subject to civil disciplinary or
 
05:30:13.110 --> 05:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
administrative action subject to the
 
05:30:15.070 --> 05:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
loss of one or more dependents subject
 
05:30:17.390 --> 05:30:17.400 align:start position:0%
to the loss of housing or result in any
 
05:30:19.470 --> 05:30:19.480 align:start position:0%
other punitive action or penalty taken
 
05:30:22.510 --> 05:30:22.520 align:start position:0%
against the person um and the only
 
05:30:24.990 --> 05:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
qualifier is that um you know that
 
05:30:27.070 --> 05:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
they're engaging in any act authorized
 
05:30:28.670 --> 05:30:28.680 align:start position:0%
under this section and I just think that
 
05:30:30.230 --> 05:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of questions that need to
 
05:30:33.590 --> 05:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
be answered um you know throughout this
 
05:30:35.628 --> 05:30:35.638 align:start position:0%
process how how it actually takes place
 
05:30:38.190 --> 05:30:38.200 align:start position:0%
before you could even consider offering
 
05:30:40.868 --> 05:30:40.878 align:start position:0%
that that type of immunity um you know
 
05:30:43.270 --> 05:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
and who who is vetting the people that
 
05:30:44.868 --> 05:30:44.878 align:start position:0%
that will be handling the drugs to do
 
05:30:46.830 --> 05:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
the checking
 
05:30:49.868 --> 05:30:49.878 align:start position:0%
um all of those things are questions in
 
05:30:51.470 --> 05:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
my mind and and I believe that they
 
05:30:52.750 --> 05:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
should be questions in the committee's
 
05:30:54.510 --> 05:30:54.520 align:start position:0%
mind if you're considering uh pushing
 
05:30:54.520 --> 05:31:00.510 align:start position:0%
mind if you're considering uh pushing
this

05:31:00.510 --> 05:31:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:04.910 --> 05:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:08.270 --> 05:31:08.280 align:start position:0%
bra representative Sher
 
05:31:13.708 --> 05:31:13.718 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm curious uh exactly I guess I
 
05:31:15.628 --> 05:31:15.638 align:start position:0%
need more detail about what your
 
05:31:19.430 --> 05:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
concerns are on on page four on the
 
05:31:22.030 --> 05:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
section entitled a person
 
05:31:26.070 --> 05:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
may uh what are you worried about if
 
05:31:28.750 --> 05:31:28.760 align:start position:0%
somebody brings with them more drugs
 
05:31:31.948 --> 05:31:31.958 align:start position:0%
than are needed for the testing and then
 
05:31:34.750 --> 05:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
the testing is done uh what are you
 
05:31:38.670 --> 05:31:38.680 align:start position:0%
what's the specific worry you have well
 
05:31:40.310 --> 05:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
narcotics that we're testing in this
 
05:31:44.030 --> 05:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
case fentanyl most likely um and it
 
05:31:46.110 --> 05:31:46.120 align:start position:0%
could be a multitude of other drugs are
 
05:31:48.590 --> 05:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
extremely dangerous narcotics they cause
 
05:31:52.270 --> 05:31:52.280 align:start position:0%
harm to uh the people that use them um
 
05:31:54.910 --> 05:31:54.920 align:start position:0%
up up until death so that would be my
 
05:31:56.628 --> 05:31:56.638 align:start position:0%
concern is if there's if there's an
 
05:31:58.868 --> 05:31:58.878 align:start position:0%
excessive amount that's brought in
 
05:32:00.470 --> 05:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
what's happening to that are we giving
 
05:32:02.110 --> 05:32:02.120 align:start position:0%
it back to the person to take back and
 
05:32:03.510 --> 05:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
use and I think that there's probably
 
05:32:06.910 --> 05:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
some risk and liability in doing that U
 
05:32:09.070 --> 05:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
what would you have happened
 
05:32:16.788 --> 05:32:16.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:19.150 --> 05:32:19.160 align:start position:0%
followup I'm not challenging I'm I'm
 
05:32:21.670 --> 05:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
just representative Sher please be very
 
05:32:23.350 --> 05:32:23.360 align:start position:0%
careful just to ask questions and not to
 
05:32:25.548 --> 05:32:25.558 align:start position:0%
challenge the
 
05:32:29.670 --> 05:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
witness my question is what would you
 
05:32:32.270 --> 05:32:32.280 align:start position:0%
have happen in that circumstance well I
 
05:32:34.070 --> 05:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
certainly don't claim to have all the
 
05:32:36.070 --> 05:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
answers to this problem that we have in
 
05:32:39.788 --> 05:32:39.798 align:start position:0%
the state my solution would be no no
 
05:32:42.788 --> 05:32:42.798 align:start position:0%
tolerance at all but getting there is
 
05:32:44.510 --> 05:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
how do we get there that's that's the
 
05:32:47.110 --> 05:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
big question law enforcement we do our
 
05:32:49.350 --> 05:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
we do our job that we've been given to
 
05:32:51.190 --> 05:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
enforce the laws that we have
 
05:32:52.590 --> 05:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
established on the book so when there's
 
05:32:56.788 --> 05:32:56.798 align:start position:0%
a new law I look at it how will this
 
05:32:59.310 --> 05:32:59.320 align:start position:0%
affect the Community First how will it
 
05:33:01.628 --> 05:33:01.638 align:start position:0%
affect uh law enforcement and how we
 
05:33:04.030 --> 05:33:04.040 align:start position:0%
perform that job so to answer that
 
05:33:06.150 --> 05:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
question my my answer would be is that I
 
05:33:08.708 --> 05:33:08.718 align:start position:0%
wouldn't allow it is I wouldn't allow
 
05:33:11.430 --> 05:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
that to happen I I don't see any place
 
05:33:14.070 --> 05:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
where it would be acceptable for me or
 
05:33:16.150 --> 05:33:16.160 align:start position:0%
anybody else to hand an amount of drugs
 
05:33:18.910 --> 05:33:18.920 align:start position:0%
back to somebody and say um it's okay to
 
05:33:20.750 --> 05:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
use this because it it just tested for
 
05:33:20.760 --> 05:33:21.910 align:start position:0%
use this because it it just tested for
these

05:33:21.910 --> 05:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
these
 
05:33:25.270 --> 05:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:28.628 --> 05:33:28.638 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:33:32.470 --> 05:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
Newman yeah I just have a question about
 
05:33:34.750 --> 05:33:34.760 align:start position:0%
going on to his question where it
 
05:33:37.150 --> 05:33:37.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't only say a person may it it
 
05:33:39.670 --> 05:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
starts out with the title that says use
 
05:33:42.470 --> 05:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
of drug J um checking equipment so I
 
05:33:45.310 --> 05:33:45.320 align:start position:0%
imagine it would be a person that is
 
05:33:49.350 --> 05:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
using drug checking Equipment May and
 
05:33:50.948 --> 05:33:50.958 align:start position:0%
would that make any difference in what
 
05:33:53.830 --> 05:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
what you've said just in the past I
 
05:33:56.470 --> 05:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
don't know I like I say I'm not an
 
05:33:59.230 --> 05:33:59.240 align:start position:0%
expert on on the all the wording in this
 
05:34:01.270 --> 05:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
bill uh there may be some answers to
 
05:34:02.910 --> 05:34:02.920 align:start position:0%
some of those things maybe it maybe it
 
05:34:06.590 --> 05:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't um apply um but I just look at
 
05:34:08.430 --> 05:34:08.440 align:start position:0%
this at from a law enforcement
 
05:34:10.990 --> 05:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
perspective and if I read this uh bill
 
05:34:15.310 --> 05:34:15.320 align:start position:0%
right now it looks to me like any person
 
05:34:17.990 --> 05:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
may do these things and it doesn't it
 
05:34:19.830 --> 05:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't Define that that's okay that's
 
05:34:22.670 --> 05:34:22.680 align:start position:0%
an employee of whatever the harm
 
05:34:25.628 --> 05:34:25.638 align:start position:0%
reduction site is how many employees
 
05:34:28.030 --> 05:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
there are in the state where those you
 
05:34:32.190 --> 05:34:32.200 align:start position:0%
know are located um or if it's just any
 
05:34:34.430 --> 05:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
individual that has drug checking
 
05:34:37.990 --> 05:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
equipment they're allowed to to possess
 
05:34:39.390 --> 05:34:39.400 align:start position:0%
I I don't know the answers to all of
 
05:34:41.430 --> 05:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
that I I just think that it needs to be
 
05:34:45.110 --> 05:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:50.788 --> 05:34:50.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:54.150 --> 05:34:54.160 align:start position:0%
r i think my question actually needs to
 
05:34:55.470 --> 05:34:55.480 align:start position:0%
go back
 
05:35:00.030 --> 05:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
to I forget Dr No I know never mind for
 
05:35:01.948 --> 05:35:01.958 align:start position:0%
you I don't think you can answer what I
 
05:35:04.150 --> 05:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
want answer right now and that's
 
05:35:08.430 --> 05:35:08.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:09.430 --> 05:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
representative do you think that it's
 
05:35:11.230 --> 05:35:11.240 align:start position:0%
something you could that you that you
 
05:35:14.190 --> 05:35:14.200 align:start position:0%
could just go ask them no I think it's
 
05:35:16.470 --> 05:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
everybody want to know can we they come
 
05:35:21.110 --> 05:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
back after we finish this please thank
 
05:35:23.110 --> 05:35:23.120 align:start position:0%

do you guys mind come do you guys mind
 
05:35:51.470 --> 05:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:51.480 --> 05:35:55.510 align:start position:0%
 
question

05:35:55.510 --> 05:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:57.990 --> 05:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
okay I don't know if that's a if that's
 
05:36:08.470 --> 05:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:10.110 --> 05:36:10.120 align:start position:0%
um if the if the committee wishes I
 
05:36:12.270 --> 05:36:12.280 align:start position:0%
might be able to walk through where
 
05:36:15.390 --> 05:36:15.400 align:start position:0%
these amendments hit to explain the
 
05:36:17.628 --> 05:36:17.638 align:start position:0%
conversation that just came up well I
 
05:36:19.430 --> 05:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
think we one thing we have to be very
 
05:36:22.548 --> 05:36:22.558 align:start position:0%
careful of is we generally do not have
 
05:36:24.470 --> 05:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
people come back up and you know ret
 
05:36:27.390 --> 05:36:27.400 align:start position:0%
testify or do any cleanup if you will
 
05:36:29.270 --> 05:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
and in all fairness that that really
 
05:36:30.430 --> 05:36:30.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be fair because there a lot of
 
05:36:33.070 --> 05:36:33.080 align:start position:0%
people that like to do that um but it
 
05:36:34.788 --> 05:36:34.798 align:start position:0%
did sound like representative GA R had a
 
05:36:36.670 --> 05:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
question that that kind of came up later
 
05:36:38.628 --> 05:36:38.638 align:start position:0%
so I am making exception for her so if
 
05:36:40.190 --> 05:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
we could just please stick to that so
 
05:36:41.670 --> 05:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
that we don't have any problems going
 
05:36:43.628 --> 05:36:43.638 align:start position:0%
down the line with that thank you
 
05:36:45.190 --> 05:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
representative gther thank you for
 
05:36:49.110 --> 05:36:49.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question um in in reading this
 
05:36:51.310 --> 05:36:51.320 align:start position:0%
again and this this this piece here
 
05:36:53.150 --> 05:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
about use of drug checking equipment
 
05:36:57.750 --> 05:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
permitted a person may um as I remember
 
05:37:00.230 --> 05:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
I thought it was uh the person that's
 
05:37:02.470 --> 05:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
doing the drugs or purchase the drugs
 
05:37:05.230 --> 05:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
was going to do the testing I I think I
 
05:37:08.708 --> 05:37:08.718 align:start position:0%
heard something different today m that
 
05:37:10.230 --> 05:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
um a health provider or someone like
 
05:37:12.230 --> 05:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
that would be doing the testing so that
 
05:37:14.190 --> 05:37:14.200 align:start position:0%
means that we weren't talking about
 
05:37:17.310 --> 05:37:17.320 align:start position:0%
equipment that um the user would be
 
05:37:20.390 --> 05:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
purchasing the test for themselves I'm
 
05:37:23.110 --> 05:37:23.120 align:start position:0%
just asking yeah this would be related
 
05:37:28.270 --> 05:37:28.280 align:start position:0%
to a service um so I I think the the
 
05:37:31.390 --> 05:37:31.400 align:start position:0%
amendment comes to specifically Define
 
05:37:34.230 --> 05:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
the scope of drug checking in page four
 
05:37:37.070 --> 05:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
that is a followup to the bottom of page
 
05:37:37.080 --> 05:37:38.110 align:start position:0%
that is a followup to the bottom of page
three

05:37:38.110 --> 05:37:38.120 align:start position:0%
three
 
05:37:44.190 --> 05:37:44.200 align:start position:0%
which amends RSA 318 B2 to insert that
 
05:37:48.390 --> 05:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:50.708 --> 05:37:50.718 align:start position:0%
checking and that specifically States
 
05:37:52.788 --> 05:37:52.798 align:start position:0%
conducted by harm reduction programs
 
05:37:53.990 --> 05:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
registered within New Hampshire
 
05:37:56.030 --> 05:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
05:37:57.910 --> 05:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
so that was a change from prior
 
05:38:00.910 --> 05:38:00.920 align:start position:0%
iterations to address these concerns
 
05:38:04.110 --> 05:38:04.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much I missed that
 
05:38:06.708 --> 05:38:06.718 align:start position:0%
yes represent we're not opening we're
 
05:38:08.350 --> 05:38:08.360 align:start position:0%
not reopening question questions up for
 
05:38:10.548 --> 05:38:10.558 align:start position:0%
that we made an exception for for the
 
05:38:10.558 --> 05:38:12.150 align:start position:0%
that we made an exception for for the
question

05:38:12.150 --> 05:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:38:15.270 --> 05:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
if if if you could they're I think that
 
05:38:17.548 --> 05:38:17.558 align:start position:0%
they're probably more than happy
 
05:38:22.230 --> 05:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
to right yeah thank you very much is
 
05:38:23.670 --> 05:38:23.680 align:start position:0%

05:39:18.670 --> 05:39:18.680 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind just give a second for
 
05:39:19.910 --> 05:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
settle in it looks like something's

penalties under state law revocation of
 
05:40:31.708 --> 05:40:31.718 align:start position:0%
their registry identification card so
 
05:40:34.430 --> 05:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
according to RSA
 
05:40:37.948 --> 05:40:37.958 align:start position:0%
126x colon 3 section
 
05:40:40.390 --> 05:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
um six if a qualifying parent or
 
05:40:43.150 --> 05:40:43.160 align:start position:0%
caregiver patient or care is found to
 
05:40:45.990 --> 05:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
have sold cannabis to an unauthorized
 
05:40:48.150 --> 05:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
individual the New Hampshire Department
 
05:40:50.150 --> 05:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services revokes
 
05:40:53.270 --> 05:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
their registry identification card and
 
05:40:56.030 --> 05:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
the revocation removes the individual's
 
05:40:58.590 --> 05:40:58.600 align:start position:0%
legal authorization to possess and use
 
05:41:00.708 --> 05:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
therapeutic can cannabis and this is
 
05:41:03.788 --> 05:41:03.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:07.910 --> 05:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
law also there's a first f pel penalty
 
05:41:11.150 --> 05:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
under the controlled Drug Act and under
 
05:41:15.910 --> 05:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
RSA 318-b colon26 any individual who
 
05:41:17.868 --> 05:41:17.878 align:start position:0%
sells a controlled drug including
 
05:41:20.510 --> 05:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis without proper authorization is
 
05:41:22.708 --> 05:41:22.718 align:start position:0%
guilty of a class B
 
05:41:26.310 --> 05:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
felony a conviction under this provision
 
05:41:30.868 --> 05:41:30.878 align:start position:0%
may result in imprisonment of up to 7
 
05:41:33.590 --> 05:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
years a fine of up to
 
05:41:35.750 --> 05:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
$25,000 or
 
05:41:38.750 --> 05:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
both the second felony is the one that
 
05:41:41.468 --> 05:41:41.478 align:start position:0%
the bill addresses and that's specific
 
05:41:44.390 --> 05:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
to the therapeutic cannabis program so
 
05:41:46.590 --> 05:41:46.600 align:start position:0%
according to RSA
 
05:41:52.190 --> 05:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
315b 26 9-a which is an additional
 
05:41:54.868 --> 05:41:54.878 align:start position:0%
section A therapeutic cannabis program
 
05:41:56.948 --> 05:41:56.958 align:start position:0%
participant patient or caregiver who
 
05:42:00.868 --> 05:42:00.878 align:start position:0%
sells cannabis to a non-qualifying
 
05:42:03.948 --> 05:42:03.958 align:start position:0%
individual commits an additional offense
 
05:42:07.948 --> 05:42:07.958 align:start position:0%
classified as an second class B found
 
05:42:09.948 --> 05:42:09.958 align:start position:0%
and the penalties for that
 
05:42:13.830 --> 05:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
offense include imprisonment of up to 7
 
05:42:16.590 --> 05:42:16.600 align:start position:0%
years and a fine of
 
05:42:20.070 --> 05:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
$300,000 or both so summarizing the
 
05:42:21.990 --> 05:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
consequences the revocation of the
 
05:42:24.788 --> 05:42:24.798 align:start position:0%
registry identification card and two
 
05:42:28.350 --> 05:42:28.360 align:start position:0%
separate class B felony charges each
 
05:42:31.628 --> 05:42:31.638 align:start position:0%
carrying potential prison time of up to
 
05:42:34.270 --> 05:42:34.280 align:start position:0%
14 years and
 
05:42:38.948 --> 05:42:38.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:41.510 --> 05:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
so the double jeopardy effect is what
 
05:42:43.548 --> 05:42:43.558 align:start position:0%
the bill is trying to address because
 
05:42:45.788 --> 05:42:45.798 align:start position:0%
patients and caregivers are already
 
05:42:48.590 --> 05:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
subject to General drug distribution
 
05:42:52.350 --> 05:42:52.360 align:start position:0%
laws and those impose significant and
 
05:42:56.430 --> 05:42:56.440 align:start position:0%
severe penalties for unauthorized
 
05:42:59.150 --> 05:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
sales one of the arguments I have is
 
05:43:02.310 --> 05:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
that the penalties for unauthorized
 
05:43:05.150 --> 05:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
distribution are severe and they add
 
05:43:07.590 --> 05:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
another felony specific to the program
 
05:43:10.230 --> 05:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
that might discourage eligible patients
 
05:43:13.548 --> 05:43:13.558 align:start position:0%
from participating due to fear of harsh
 
05:43:13.558 --> 05:43:15.310 align:start position:0%
from participating due to fear of harsh
legal

05:43:15.310 --> 05:43:15.320 align:start position:0%
legal
 
05:43:19.190 --> 05:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
repercussions um patients are vulnerable
 
05:43:21.510 --> 05:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
and this is about the patients and I'm
 
05:43:24.708 --> 05:43:24.718 align:start position:0%
here to advocate for them many program
 
05:43:27.548 --> 05:43:27.558 align:start position:0%
participants have chronic illnesses and
 
05:43:28.948 --> 05:43:28.958 align:start position:0%
this is just not something that's
 
05:43:31.830 --> 05:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
occurring with them if they were to
 
05:43:34.110 --> 05:43:34.120 align:start position:0%
somehow make a mistake and get caught up
 
05:43:37.628 --> 05:43:37.638 align:start position:0%
in this felony that kind of time
 
05:43:40.628 --> 05:43:40.638 align:start position:0%
is really expensive and I don't mean to
 
05:43:44.708 --> 05:43:44.718 align:start position:0%
put a a cost on anything but as you know
 
05:43:46.830 --> 05:43:46.840 align:start position:0%
I know from working with the Hillsboro
 
05:43:46.840 --> 05:43:48.590 align:start position:0%
I know from working with the Hillsboro
County

05:43:48.590 --> 05:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
County
 
05:43:51.788 --> 05:43:51.798 align:start position:0%
um system and working with their budget
 
05:43:54.390 --> 05:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
that the medical cost of having somebody
 
05:43:57.548 --> 05:43:57.558 align:start position:0%
with a chronic condition in the jail is
 
05:44:01.070 --> 05:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
just skyrocketing and it is an issue
 
05:44:03.788 --> 05:44:03.798 align:start position:0%
when you have people who are nonviolent
 
05:44:05.628 --> 05:44:05.638 align:start position:0%
and they're in a non-violent type of
 
05:44:09.468 --> 05:44:09.478 align:start position:0%
crime doing time time and being not able
 
05:44:11.910 --> 05:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
to get their therapeutic cannabis they
 
05:44:13.270 --> 05:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
would have
 
05:44:15.830 --> 05:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
difficulty surviving
 
05:44:18.310 --> 05:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
without a number of pharmaceutical
 
05:44:20.708 --> 05:44:20.718 align:start position:0%
medications that are required to manage
 
05:44:22.750 --> 05:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
these DEC these conditions in the
 
05:44:24.670 --> 05:44:24.680 align:start position:0%
absence of using the therapeutic
 
05:44:28.270 --> 05:44:28.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis so to get back on track
 
05:44:31.750 --> 05:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
um patients can already sell in exchange
 
05:44:34.548 --> 05:44:34.558 align:start position:0%
to another patient and
 
05:44:37.350 --> 05:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
caregiver but this penalty assumes that
 
05:44:39.910 --> 05:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
a person who is in the program is
 
05:44:42.510 --> 05:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
transferring or selling cannabis that is
 
05:44:45.590 --> 05:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:48.430 --> 05:44:48.440 align:start position:0%
program so an example of circumstances
 
05:44:51.110 --> 05:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
that could happen for the patient is um
 
05:44:54.708 --> 05:44:54.718 align:start position:0%
a certified person sells or transfers 2
 
05:44:56.628 --> 05:44:56.638 align:start position:0%
ounces or less to someone who was
 
05:44:56.638 --> 05:44:57.910 align:start position:0%
ounces or less to someone who was
formally

05:44:57.910 --> 05:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
formally
 
05:45:00.548 --> 05:45:00.558 align:start position:0%
certified but has recently had an
 
05:45:03.230 --> 05:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
expiration of their certification where
 
05:45:05.390 --> 05:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
the buyer knows they need they may or
 
05:45:09.708 --> 05:45:09.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:12.468 --> 05:45:12.478 align:start position:0%
not a certified patient can come from
 
05:45:15.350 --> 05:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
another state and doesn't know the full
 
05:45:18.788 --> 05:45:18.798 align:start position:0%
extent of the rest restrictions in man
 
05:45:21.750 --> 05:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and I dare say they
 
05:45:25.948 --> 05:45:25.958 align:start position:0%
wouldn't expect things to be as serious
 
05:45:29.270 --> 05:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
with the second F uh felony that's put
 
05:45:33.110 --> 05:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:36.230 --> 05:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
patient and then I have another example
 
05:45:38.070 --> 05:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
if a patient gives the Cannabis to a
 
05:45:40.910 --> 05:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
friend or family who has previously
 
05:45:43.948 --> 05:45:43.958 align:start position:0%
acted as a caregiver that's another
 
05:45:46.548 --> 05:45:46.558 align:start position:0%
complication I just believe that
 
05:45:49.990 --> 05:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
patients don't always know exactly the
 
05:45:53.350 --> 05:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
full extent of the um the penalties
 
05:45:56.230 --> 05:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
involved and I personally did not know
 
05:45:59.548 --> 05:45:59.558 align:start position:0%
the full extent of the penalties when I
 
05:46:04.310 --> 05:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
became a patient and had I been I just
 
05:46:06.910 --> 05:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
would feel like this kind of scrutiny is
 
05:46:08.868 --> 05:46:08.878 align:start position:0%
excessively harsh and I would I would
 
05:46:12.750 --> 05:46:12.760 align:start position:0%
really think about it twice um and to
 
05:46:16.030 --> 05:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
you know it's safer to legally
 
05:46:19.190 --> 05:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
take opiates to manage some of these
 
05:46:21.830 --> 05:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
conditions and we don't want to be able
 
05:46:23.788 --> 05:46:23.798 align:start position:0%
to say that
 
05:46:26.830 --> 05:46:26.840 align:start position:0%
because it's not safer if someone faces
 
05:46:30.868 --> 05:46:30.878 align:start position:0%
up to 14 years in prison and a
 
05:46:34.548 --> 05:46:34.558 align:start position:0%
$325,000 fine so um finally I just
 
05:46:37.548 --> 05:46:37.558 align:start position:0%
wanted to say that um
 
05:46:40.030 --> 05:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
patients are already held accountable
 
05:46:41.910 --> 05:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
it's very unlikely that someone who has
 
05:46:45.110 --> 05:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
a chronic condition is going to
 
05:46:48.270 --> 05:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
maliciously or deliberately transfer
 
05:46:50.548 --> 05:46:50.558 align:start position:0%
what they have for cannabis there's a
 
05:46:53.510 --> 05:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
lot of limitations on how much they can
 
05:46:55.830 --> 05:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
possess in the first place and it is
 
05:46:59.030 --> 05:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
expensive to participate in the program
 
05:47:01.230 --> 05:47:01.240 align:start position:0%
it's not something that would be at all
 
05:47:04.548 --> 05:47:04.558 align:start position:0%
economical for the person in the program
 
05:47:06.270 --> 05:47:06.280 align:start position:0%
and then they also lose their access
 
05:47:06.280 --> 05:47:07.590 align:start position:0%
and then they also lose their access
completely

05:47:07.590 --> 05:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
completely
 
05:47:11.350 --> 05:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
and faced some pretty stiff penalties so
 
05:47:13.310 --> 05:47:13.320 align:start position:0%
I may have just said this in beginning
 
05:47:18.590 --> 05:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
and skip this link uh lengthy speech but
 
05:47:20.670 --> 05:47:20.680 align:start position:0%
House Bill 20
 
05:47:23.910 --> 05:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
1295 was word for word the same as this
 
05:47:25.788 --> 05:47:25.798 align:start position:0%
bill and it passed through this
 
05:47:29.628 --> 05:47:29.638 align:start position:0%
committee on um a consent calendar I
 
05:47:33.230 --> 05:47:33.240 align:start position:0%
believe it was unanimous and it went on
 
05:47:35.788 --> 05:47:35.798 align:start position:0%
the floor and was passed by the house on
 
05:47:37.590 --> 05:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar so there it was
 
05:47:39.750 --> 05:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
unanimous as well so I hope that the
 
05:47:42.310 --> 05:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
committee will take another look at this
 
05:47:45.788 --> 05:47:45.798 align:start position:0%
and find that it is acceptable um and
 
05:47:49.910 --> 05:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:51.948 --> 05:47:51.958 align:start position:0%
have thank you representative so
 
05:47:53.230 --> 05:47:53.240 align:start position:0%
basically what you're saying is you're
 
05:47:56.030 --> 05:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
you're okay with the first the the first
 
05:47:58.030 --> 05:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
charge you just you don't like the
 
05:48:00.788 --> 05:48:00.798 align:start position:0%
subsequent is that is is that like the
 
05:48:03.628 --> 05:48:03.638 align:start position:0%
wrap up what you were saying yes and
 
05:48:05.750 --> 05:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
that is a very good synopsis of what I'm
 
05:48:08.948 --> 05:48:08.958 align:start position:0%
saying really to me it's it's just it
 
05:48:11.830 --> 05:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen in other states other
 
05:48:14.030 --> 05:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
states we're talking about a misdemeanor
 
05:48:16.230 --> 05:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
and those that have you know states that
 
05:48:17.990 --> 05:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
have other conditions such as they have
 
05:48:20.670 --> 05:48:20.680 align:start position:0%
legal cannabis
 
05:48:25.030 --> 05:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:27.510 --> 05:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
Muse thanks for taking my question are
 
05:48:29.270 --> 05:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
you aware of anyone who's been
 
05:48:32.788 --> 05:48:32.798 align:start position:0%
prosecuted under the full extent of the
 
05:48:41.350 --> 05:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:44.150 --> 05:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
good all right see no further questions
 
05:48:44.160 --> 05:48:47.430 align:start position:0%
good all right see no further questions
thank

05:48:47.430 --> 05:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:47.440 --> 05:48:57.230 align:start position:0%
 
you

05:48:57.230 --> 05:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:02.030 --> 05:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
Canon hello um thank you Joe Hannon
 
05:49:05.788 --> 05:49:05.798 align:start position:0%
thanks um so I'm in favor of this bill I
 
05:49:07.390 --> 05:49:07.400 align:start position:0%
do not think it goes far enough but I
 
05:49:08.670 --> 05:49:08.680 align:start position:0%
think it goes far enough for our
 
05:49:11.270 --> 05:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
purposes today um you've heard that it's
 
05:49:12.670 --> 05:49:12.680 align:start position:0%
you're being punished twice for
 
05:49:14.150 --> 05:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
something and it's something that's
 
05:49:16.390 --> 05:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
considered um more dangerous than
 
05:49:18.430 --> 05:49:18.440 align:start position:0%
selling something on the street I mean
 
05:49:19.830 --> 05:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
someone is getting an unknown substance
 
05:49:21.510 --> 05:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
that's not tested come from an elicit
 
05:49:23.270 --> 05:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
dealer could be could be laced could not
 
05:49:25.270 --> 05:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
be versus something that's a tested
 
05:49:27.670 --> 05:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
product from dispens medical dispensary
 
05:49:29.548 --> 05:49:29.558 align:start position:0%
I I think it's it's silly that you have
 
05:49:32.750 --> 05:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
that comparison and also uh article 18
 
05:49:34.390 --> 05:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
of our constitution penalties to be
 
05:49:35.788 --> 05:49:35.798 align:start position:0%
proportioned to offense is the true
 
05:49:37.310 --> 05:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
design of all punishment
 
05:49:40.310 --> 05:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
I'm sure most of you know this but um
 
05:49:42.350 --> 05:49:42.360 align:start position:0%
basically uh I I don't want to read the
 
05:49:45.948 --> 05:49:45.958 align:start position:0%
whole thing but no wise legislature will
 
05:49:47.468 --> 05:49:47.478 align:start position:0%
affix the same punishment to the crimes
 
05:49:49.190 --> 05:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
of theft forgery and the like for which
 
05:49:51.150 --> 05:49:51.160 align:start position:0%
they do those of murder and
 
05:49:51.160 --> 05:49:52.670 align:start position:0%
they do those of murder and
treason

05:49:52.670 --> 05:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
treason
 
05:49:56.150 --> 05:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
um you know we basically have laws in
 
05:49:58.948 --> 05:49:58.958 align:start position:0%
the state for for a reason but if you
 
05:50:01.990 --> 05:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
have a felony for uh aggravated sexual
 
05:50:04.590 --> 05:50:04.600 align:start position:0%
assault you know someone has sex with a
 
05:50:06.750 --> 05:50:06.760 align:start position:0%
13-year-old that person is going to have
 
05:50:08.868 --> 05:50:08.878 align:start position:0%
the same penalty two times over for
 
05:50:10.990 --> 05:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
selling medical cannabis that's not
 
05:50:12.868 --> 05:50:12.878 align:start position:0%
proportion that's not Affair that's
 
05:50:14.830 --> 05:50:14.840 align:start position:0%
that's unconstitutional and I even
 
05:50:16.430 --> 05:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
believe that selling of a medical grade
 
05:50:18.070 --> 05:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
cannabis now if someone's selling it to
 
05:50:19.150 --> 05:50:19.160 align:start position:0%
a child I think obviously there's
 
05:50:20.390 --> 05:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
different circumstances but say someone
 
05:50:21.628 --> 05:50:21.638 align:start position:0%
is in the medical program and they get
 
05:50:23.190 --> 05:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
caught selling it to someone who isn't
 
05:50:24.350 --> 05:50:24.360 align:start position:0%
in the medical program because they
 
05:50:26.030 --> 05:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
didn't get a card but wants to but
 
05:50:28.390 --> 05:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
they're just afraid to get a card now is
 
05:50:31.230 --> 05:50:31.240 align:start position:0%
that person really causing a society a
 
05:50:32.468 --> 05:50:32.478 align:start position:0%
problem that New Hampshire deems it
 
05:50:33.868 --> 05:50:33.878 align:start position:0%
necessary to give them an additional
 
05:50:35.830 --> 05:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
second class B felony I think it's it's
 
05:50:37.190 --> 05:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
wrong with whether you agree with
 
05:50:38.708 --> 05:50:38.718 align:start position:0%
cannabis or not this has nothing to do
 
05:50:40.948 --> 05:50:40.958 align:start position:0%
with that this has to do with uh what's
 
05:50:42.310 --> 05:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
what's legal and constitutional and
 
05:50:44.990 --> 05:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
what's fair and I don't think it
 
05:50:47.750 --> 05:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
is thank
 
05:50:51.270 --> 05:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
you thank you Dr Hannah are there any
 
05:50:53.868 --> 05:50:53.878 align:start position:0%
questions all set looks like you're all
 
05:50:58.990 --> 05:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:08.110 --> 05:51:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:08.120 --> 05:51:09.270 align:start position:0%
 
hi

05:51:09.270 --> 05:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
hi
 
05:51:12.948 --> 05:51:12.958 align:start position:0%
again um so um yeah my name is Christine
 
05:51:15.948 --> 05:51:15.958 align:start position:0%
cybert I'm from Manchester Ward one um
 
05:51:19.190 --> 05:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro district 21 um I was just
 
05:51:22.390 --> 05:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to voice my support um for this
 
05:51:26.310 --> 05:51:26.320 align:start position:0%
legislation um truly I think the reason
 
05:51:28.430 --> 05:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
it seems to me the reason that we made
 
05:51:31.670 --> 05:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
this um you know the medicinal purposes
 
05:51:36.628 --> 05:51:36.638 align:start position:0%
for cannabis use um legal is so we you
 
05:51:39.670 --> 05:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
know maybe don't get charged as harshly
 
05:51:43.390 --> 05:51:43.400 align:start position:0%
for it um and so I see this as being
 
05:51:45.830 --> 05:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
equal to having say like a mandatory
 
05:51:48.430 --> 05:51:48.440 align:start position:0%
minimum for certain crimes like they've
 
05:51:51.070 --> 05:51:51.080 align:start position:0%
tried to do in the past seem not to work
 
05:51:53.270 --> 05:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
I definitely see it as a deterrent when
 
05:51:56.708 --> 05:51:56.718 align:start position:0%
a lot of people find this um this uh
 
05:52:00.788 --> 05:52:00.798 align:start position:0%
method or this this form of I guess
 
05:52:03.788 --> 05:52:03.798 align:start position:0%
medication versus taking other dangerous
 
05:52:05.990 --> 05:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
medications such as opioids that's
 
05:52:07.750 --> 05:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
probably one of the number one reasons
 
05:52:10.788 --> 05:52:10.798 align:start position:0%
it helps them with chronic pain um I
 
05:52:13.350 --> 05:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
think that just throwing people in jail
 
05:52:16.430 --> 05:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
is um especially if they are have
 
05:52:18.150 --> 05:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
chronic pain they've gone through all of
 
05:52:20.990 --> 05:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
the legal ramifications that or all the
 
05:52:22.990 --> 05:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
steps that they need which is very
 
05:52:25.548 --> 05:52:25.558 align:start position:0%
rigorous um it's also difficult quite
 
05:52:27.510 --> 05:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
honestly for them to buy the amount to
 
05:52:29.788 --> 05:52:29.798 align:start position:0%
be able to like sell that much that
 
05:52:33.070 --> 05:52:33.080 align:start position:0%
would you know whatever um but either
 
05:52:35.590 --> 05:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
way I think that stacking two different
 
05:52:39.468 --> 05:52:39.478 align:start position:0%
felony um counts on them um there's
 
05:52:42.230 --> 05:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
already like they said R rigorous harsh
 
05:52:45.830 --> 05:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
penalties for such a thing um so I
 
05:52:47.868 --> 05:52:47.878 align:start position:0%
believe there's enough barriers in place
 
05:52:52.030 --> 05:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
where um this should definitely be a
 
05:52:57.750 --> 05:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:02.030 --> 05:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:04.830 --> 05:53:04.840 align:start position:0%
questions Sor I kind of winged that I
 
05:53:07.670 --> 05:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
didn't really write anything down
 
05:53:07.680 --> 05:53:17.030 align:start position:0%
didn't really write anything down
thank

05:53:17.030 --> 05:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:27.590 --> 05:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:30.910 --> 05:53:30.920 align:start position:0%
now good afternoon and once again thank
 
05:53:35.070 --> 05:53:35.080 align:start position:0%
you for listening to me um also I would
 
05:53:37.510 --> 05:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
like to let you know that represent
 
05:53:40.468 --> 05:53:40.478 align:start position:0%
former representative kerk sends his
 
05:53:42.670 --> 05:53:42.680 align:start position:0%
best but unfortunately he could not be
 
05:53:46.788 --> 05:53:46.798 align:start position:0%
here uh he did however want me to hand
 
05:53:57.468 --> 05:53:57.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:00.590 --> 05:54:00.600 align:start position:0%
himself and as for the record my name is
 
05:54:02.750 --> 05:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
Heather Marie Brown I am the alternate
 
05:54:05.468 --> 05:54:05.478 align:start position:0%
chair on the New Hampshire therapeutic
 
05:54:08.110 --> 05:54:08.120 align:start position:0%
cannabis Medical oversight board I serve
 
05:54:10.270 --> 05:54:10.280 align:start position:0%
as the patient representative so it is
 
05:54:13.510 --> 05:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
literally my job to represent the 15,000
 
05:54:16.868 --> 05:54:16.878 align:start position:0%
plus patients in this state and I try to
 
05:54:20.708 --> 05:54:20.718 align:start position:0%
do the best job I possibly can um quite
 
05:54:23.990 --> 05:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
frankly um I will tell you that in my
 
05:54:26.990 --> 05:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
opinion that little section of the
 
05:54:29.868 --> 05:54:29.878 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis law is literally
 
05:54:31.830 --> 05:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
the exact definition of what
 
05:54:34.670 --> 05:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
discrimination is the definition of
 
05:54:37.430 --> 05:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
discrimination is unjust or
 
05:54:39.510 --> 05:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
prejudicial treatment of different
 
05:54:41.868 --> 05:54:41.878 align:start position:0%
categories of people especially on the
 
05:54:46.270 --> 05:54:46.280 align:start position:0%
grounds of ethnic ethn ethnicity sorry
 
05:54:50.510 --> 05:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
about that age sex or disability
 
05:54:53.468 --> 05:54:53.478 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis patients are all
 
05:54:57.270 --> 05:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
individuals that have some kind of
 
05:55:00.590 --> 05:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
condition disability or qualifying
 
05:55:04.150 --> 05:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
Factor therefore that little piece of
 
05:55:08.150 --> 05:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
the law literally discriminates it not
 
05:55:11.270 --> 05:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
only provides a harsher punishment for a
 
05:55:14.510 --> 05:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
person who is a therapeutic cannabis
 
05:55:17.350 --> 05:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
patient but it completely puts them into
 
05:55:19.510 --> 05:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
a category where they suffer
 
05:55:22.628 --> 05:55:22.638 align:start position:0%
discrimination um I do work with people
 
05:55:25.150 --> 05:55:25.160 align:start position:0%
that are not patients as well but that
 
05:55:27.590 --> 05:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
would like to be patients and I can tell
 
05:55:30.350 --> 05:55:30.360 align:start position:0%
you that one little section of the law
 
05:55:32.390 --> 05:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
even though they have absolutely no
 
05:55:35.788 --> 05:55:35.798 align:start position:0%
intentions of violating it whatsoever is
 
05:55:37.430 --> 05:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
what keeps them from getting a
 
05:55:39.468 --> 05:55:39.478 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis card and still
 
05:55:43.548 --> 05:55:43.558 align:start position:0%
seeking out ulterior incentives and ways
 
05:55:47.150 --> 05:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
to take care of their own health um and
 
05:55:49.430 --> 05:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of it is fear because it then
 
05:55:52.468 --> 05:55:52.478 align:start position:0%
creates fear well if they can do this if
 
05:55:54.750 --> 05:55:54.760 align:start position:0%
I sell my cannabis well what can they do
 
05:55:56.830 --> 05:55:56.840 align:start position:0%
if they catch me smoking with somebody
 
05:55:59.030 --> 05:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
or what can they do if they catch me
 
05:56:01.628 --> 05:56:01.638 align:start position:0%
exchanging with another patient or what
 
05:56:04.910 --> 05:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
can they do and it just it adds another
 
05:56:07.110 --> 05:56:07.120 align:start position:0%
layer of fear
 
05:56:09.390 --> 05:56:09.400 align:start position:0%
um to the whole equation and I don't
 
05:56:12.070 --> 05:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
think that's right and I don't really
 
05:56:14.070 --> 05:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
believe that that's the kind of message
 
05:56:16.310 --> 05:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire wants to send to some
 
05:56:18.670 --> 05:56:18.680 align:start position:0%
of the most weak and V vulnerable
 
05:56:22.390 --> 05:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
individuals that they have um I also
 
05:56:24.708 --> 05:56:24.718 align:start position:0%
would like to tell you that therapeutic
 
05:56:27.990 --> 05:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis is entirely way too expensive
 
05:56:30.310 --> 05:56:30.320 align:start position:0%
for someone to have any interest
 
05:56:32.670 --> 05:56:32.680 align:start position:0%
whatsoever in selling it to another
 
05:56:36.230 --> 05:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
human being it just would not be
 
05:56:39.670 --> 05:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
feasible or plausible or make any sense
 
05:56:43.150 --> 05:56:43.160 align:start position:0%
whatsoever um so I believe that at the
 
05:56:46.070 --> 05:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
time that this law was written and that
 
05:56:48.788 --> 05:56:48.798 align:start position:0%
you know that was put in there that
 
05:56:50.910 --> 05:56:50.920 align:start position:0%
there was fear around the fact that
 
05:56:53.548 --> 05:56:53.558 align:start position:0%
cannabis wasn't as readily available as
 
05:56:56.708 --> 05:56:56.718 align:start position:0%
what it is now now you can get it from
 
05:56:58.910 --> 05:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
the streets you can get it from Maine
 
05:57:02.190 --> 05:57:02.200 align:start position:0%
Vermont Massachusetts you literally I
 
05:57:04.510 --> 05:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
can drive 30 minutes from my house cross
 
05:57:06.830 --> 05:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
the borders and there are are eight
 
05:57:09.910 --> 05:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
stores within a six mile radius of one
 
05:57:13.430 --> 05:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
another um so I I think
 
05:57:18.030 --> 05:57:18.040 align:start position:0%
that that section of the law is really
 
05:57:21.590 --> 05:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
entirely outdated and you know again as
 
05:57:23.310 --> 05:57:23.320 align:start position:0%
I said it's also
 
05:57:25.548 --> 05:57:25.558 align:start position:0%
discriminative um and I believe that
 
05:57:28.270 --> 05:57:28.280 align:start position:0%
it's time for it to be removed and I
 
05:57:31.110 --> 05:57:31.120 align:start position:0%
believe that it's time for us to take
 
05:57:34.150 --> 05:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
away that aspect of fear
 
05:57:36.788 --> 05:57:36.798 align:start position:0%
from a wonderful program
 
05:57:42.750 --> 05:57:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:44.670 --> 05:57:44.680 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
05:57:47.750 --> 05:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:03.788 --> 05:58:03.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:06.430 --> 05:58:06.440 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you madam chair one more
 
05:58:08.230 --> 05:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
time for the record Matt Simon Granite
 
05:58:09.230 --> 05:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
Lea of
 
05:58:12.468 --> 05:58:12.478 align:start position:0%
cannabis uh we do support this
 
05:58:17.230 --> 05:58:17.240 align:start position:0%
bill uh long time ago uh from 2009 to
 
05:58:20.468 --> 05:58:20.478 align:start position:0%
2013 I had the privilege of being one of
 
05:58:22.070 --> 05:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
the leaders in the fight to pass the
 
05:58:25.270 --> 05:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis law uh the biggest
 
05:58:26.788 --> 05:58:26.798 align:start position:0%
concern that we heard in this
 
05:58:29.270 --> 05:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
legislature throughout that process from
 
05:58:32.590 --> 05:58:32.600 align:start position:0%
opponents and Skeptics was the fear of
 
05:58:34.750 --> 05:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
diversion uh there were some opponents
 
05:58:36.628 --> 05:58:36.638 align:start position:0%
who tried to paint a picture that all of
 
05:58:38.868 --> 05:58:38.878 align:start position:0%
these patients were really just seeking
 
05:58:41.270 --> 05:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis for recreational use and that
 
05:58:43.270 --> 05:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
they were fundamentally immoral people
 
05:58:46.230 --> 05:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
who would want to purchase cannabis from
 
05:58:48.670 --> 05:58:48.680 align:start position:0%
the dispensaries and then sell it on the
 
05:58:51.310 --> 05:58:51.320 align:start position:0%
playground or to their friends and uh
 
05:58:53.350 --> 05:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
there there was a lot of that talk uh a
 
05:58:57.548 --> 05:58:57.558 align:start position:0%
long time ago so in response to those
 
05:58:59.708 --> 05:58:59.718 align:start position:0%
talking points I repeatedly pointed out
 
05:59:02.830 --> 05:59:02.840 align:start position:0%
that selling cannabis or even dispensing
 
05:59:06.628 --> 05:59:06.638 align:start position:0%
it without sale is already a felony in
 
05:59:09.070 --> 05:59:09.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh it's clearly spelled
 
05:59:11.628 --> 05:59:11.638 align:start position:0%
out in RSA
 
05:59:11.638 --> 05:59:13.310 align:start position:0%
out in RSA
318b

05:59:13.310 --> 05:59:13.320 align:start position:0%
318b
 
05:59:17.350 --> 05:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
and that is a pretty big detriment or
 
05:59:19.468 --> 05:59:19.478 align:start position:0%
deterrent that something is a
 
05:59:21.948 --> 05:59:21.958 align:start position:0%
felony and we don't need more than that
 
05:59:24.230 --> 05:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
that was enough unfortunately in order
 
05:59:27.350 --> 05:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
to get the law passed in 2013 uh we had
 
05:59:29.430 --> 05:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
to concede on that point and add this
 
05:59:32.390 --> 05:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
extra felony to RSA
 
05:59:37.070 --> 05:59:37.080 align:start position:0%
126x so it is just that an extra felony
 
05:59:39.708 --> 05:59:39.718 align:start position:0%
without that felony I would argue that
 
05:59:41.868 --> 05:59:41.878 align:start position:0%
police and prosecutors
 
05:59:45.230 --> 05:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
have plenty of authority to prosecute
 
05:59:49.990 --> 05:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
anybody who sells or dispenses marijuana
 
05:59:51.868 --> 05:59:51.878 align:start position:0%
as it's called in RSA
 
05:59:55.750 --> 05:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
318b to an unauthorized person so we do
 
05:59:58.548 --> 05:59:58.558 align:start position:0%
not need this redundant extra felony in
 
05:59:58.558 --> 06:00:00.150 align:start position:0%
not need this redundant extra felony in
oursa

06:00:00.150 --> 06:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
oursa
 
06:00:02.670 --> 06:00:02.680 align:start position:0%
126x and I do think it is a deterrent to
 
06:00:04.270 --> 06:00:04.280 align:start position:0%
participation in the program because
 
06:00:05.788 --> 06:00:05.798 align:start position:0%
when patients fill out the paperwork for
 
06:00:08.350 --> 06:00:08.360 align:start position:0%
the program they have to sign a
 
06:00:10.070 --> 06:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
statement that they know about this
 
06:00:12.150 --> 06:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
extra felony and that they're putting
 
06:00:13.670 --> 06:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
them they're setting themselves up for
 
06:00:16.788 --> 06:00:16.798 align:start position:0%
this extra potential scrutiny so I hope
 
06:00:18.230 --> 06:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
this will be the year that the extra
 
06:00:21.990 --> 06:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
felony goes away happy to take any
 
06:00:24.030 --> 06:00:24.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much do we have
 
06:00:24.040 --> 06:00:25.350 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much do we have

similar to what you've heard uh already
 
06:01:26.150 --> 06:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
but uh if I would like to proceed um
 
06:01:28.230 --> 06:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
three House Bill 380 proposes to remove
 
06:01:30.390 --> 06:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
the an enhanced penalty for the sale of
 
06:01:32.670 --> 06:01:32.680 align:start position:0%
cannabis by a registered patient or
 
06:01:35.030 --> 06:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
caregiver um to someone who's not
 
06:01:36.670 --> 06:01:36.680 align:start position:0%
authorized to possess basically to
 
06:01:38.310 --> 06:01:38.320 align:start position:0%
another a person who's not a registered
 
06:01:40.910 --> 06:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
patient or caregiver uh as you may know
 
06:01:42.030 --> 06:01:42.040 align:start position:0%
in what I've just passed out New
 
06:01:44.990 --> 06:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire penalty is established in 318
 
06:01:48.628 --> 06:01:48.638 align:start position:0%
b26 for a person convicted of selling
 
06:01:50.070 --> 06:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
cannabis are based on the amount of
 
06:01:52.190 --> 06:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
cannabis so less than 1 ounce the
 
06:01:53.910 --> 06:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
penalty is three years in prison a
 
06:01:57.750 --> 06:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
$225,000 fine 1 ounce or more is seven
 
06:02:00.868 --> 06:02:00.878 align:start position:0%
years in prison or a $100,000
 
06:02:04.548 --> 06:02:04.558 align:start position:0%
fine5 or more is 20 years in prison and
 
06:02:06.910 --> 06:02:06.920 align:start position:0%
a $300,000 fine
 
06:02:09.948 --> 06:02:09.958 align:start position:0%
if a registered patient or designated
 
06:02:11.990 --> 06:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
caregiver is convicted of selling
 
06:02:14.948 --> 06:02:14.958 align:start position:0%
cannabis in any amount they are subject
 
06:02:17.310 --> 06:02:17.320 align:start position:0%
to an additional penalty they are
 
06:02:18.708 --> 06:02:18.718 align:start position:0%
subject to the penalties that I've just
 
06:02:21.430 --> 06:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
listed and an additional class B felony
 
06:02:23.230 --> 06:02:23.240 align:start position:0%
with the following additional penalties
 
06:02:24.750 --> 06:02:24.760 align:start position:0%
7 years in
 
06:02:27.948 --> 06:02:27.958 align:start position:0%
prison $300,000
 
06:02:31.030 --> 06:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
fine so the legislative intent for this
 
06:02:33.750 --> 06:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
extra penalty um perhaps made some sense
 
06:02:36.110 --> 06:02:36.120 align:start position:0%
in 2013 when the therapeutic can Canabis
 
06:02:38.510 --> 06:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
law was first passed uh at that time
 
06:02:40.788 --> 06:02:40.798 align:start position:0%
there were no legal means for adults to
 
06:02:42.590 --> 06:02:42.600 align:start position:0%
purchase cannabis outside a State
 
06:02:42.600 --> 06:02:43.750 align:start position:0%
purchase cannabis outside a State
medical

06:02:43.750 --> 06:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
medical
 
06:02:45.788 --> 06:02:45.798 align:start position:0%
program no State at least in the
 
06:02:47.390 --> 06:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
Northeast had legalized cannabis for
 
06:02:50.030 --> 06:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
adult use uh Colorado and Washington had
 
06:02:53.350 --> 06:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
legalized it in 2012 uh so in 2013
 
06:02:55.390 --> 06:02:55.400 align:start position:0%
medical access to cannabis was believed
 
06:02:57.830 --> 06:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
to be a primary source and cause of
 
06:02:59.868 --> 06:02:59.878 align:start position:0%
diversion uh the concern that patients
 
06:03:01.750 --> 06:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
would purchase it legally from their
 
06:03:04.030 --> 06:03:04.040 align:start position:0%
medical dispensary and sell it to
 
06:03:07.390 --> 06:03:07.400 align:start position:0%
recreational users um at a profit uh at
 
06:03:09.510 --> 06:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
that time uh pricing of medical cannabis
 
06:03:12.310 --> 06:03:12.320 align:start position:0%
was intentionally set um at black market
 
06:03:15.948 --> 06:03:15.958 align:start position:0%
prices to discourage um uh diversion and
 
06:03:19.070 --> 06:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
in 2013 access to therapeutic cannabis
 
06:03:21.390 --> 06:03:21.400 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire came with great
 
06:03:24.468 --> 06:03:24.478 align:start position:0%
responsibility uh not to divert it um
 
06:03:26.070 --> 06:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
and it was believed at the time of
 
06:03:28.030 --> 06:03:28.040 align:start position:0%
writing that an enhanced penalty would
 
06:03:31.548 --> 06:03:31.558 align:start position:0%
do the trick to to deter any potential
 
06:03:34.788 --> 06:03:34.798 align:start position:0%
diversion fast forward to 2025 um the
 
06:03:36.750 --> 06:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
situation is very different legal
 
06:03:39.910 --> 06:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis is legally sold everywhere um
 
06:03:43.590 --> 06:03:43.600 align:start position:0%
in uh in New England um except New
 
06:03:46.190 --> 06:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Pennsylvania um in terms
 
06:03:47.948 --> 06:03:47.958 align:start position:0%
of the Northeast New Hampshire adults
 
06:03:50.670 --> 06:03:50.680 align:start position:0%
have easy access uh to Legal cannabis
 
06:03:53.190 --> 06:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
within uh with a short drive across
 
06:03:55.708 --> 06:03:55.718 align:start position:0%
state borders in any direction um and as
 
06:03:58.230 --> 06:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
you know cannabis brought back into New
 
06:03:59.468 --> 06:03:59.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legally bought in another
 
06:04:01.788 --> 06:04:01.798 align:start position:0%
state has been decriminalized up to
 
06:04:05.270 --> 06:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
amount of three4 of an ounce um because
 
06:04:06.590 --> 06:04:06.600 align:start position:0%
of this
 
06:04:08.830 --> 06:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
Regional legal access the risk of
 
06:04:11.510 --> 06:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
diversion for profit from therapeutic
 
06:04:13.350 --> 06:04:13.360 align:start position:0%
cannabis patients has been greatly
 
06:04:15.310 --> 06:04:15.320 align:start position:0%
reduced some might argue it is
 
06:04:15.320 --> 06:04:16.548 align:start position:0%
reduced some might argue it is
practically

06:04:16.548 --> 06:04:16.558 align:start position:0%
practically
 
06:04:18.750 --> 06:04:18.760 align:start position:0%
non-existent um medical patients no
 
06:04:21.708 --> 06:04:21.718 align:start position:0%
longer have special access to this uh to
 
06:04:26.670 --> 06:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
this uh to to cannabis um and and as as
 
06:04:29.070 --> 06:04:29.080 align:start position:0%
has been testified um diversion by
 
06:04:31.150 --> 06:04:31.160 align:start position:0%
patients doesn't make any Financial
 
06:04:33.628 --> 06:04:33.638 align:start position:0%
sense because adulted recreational
 
06:04:37.270 --> 06:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
Cannabis sold in other states
 
06:04:40.110 --> 06:04:40.120 align:start position:0%
cost less than therapeutic cannabis
 
06:04:42.590 --> 06:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
costs here in New Hampshire there's no
 
06:04:45.390 --> 06:04:45.400 align:start position:0%
Financial incentive to divert uh so to
 
06:04:47.548 --> 06:04:47.558 align:start position:0%
be clear selling cannabis is a crime
 
06:04:49.990 --> 06:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
it's still a crime um it would be still
 
06:04:52.628 --> 06:04:52.638 align:start position:0%
be a crime after this bill passes if
 
06:04:54.670 --> 06:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
this bill passes for everyone in New
 
06:04:58.590 --> 06:04:58.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh the penalties in 318b 26
 
06:05:01.310 --> 06:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
would remain this is an old law it's no
 
06:05:03.948 --> 06:05:03.958 align:start position:0%
longer necessary uh register patients
 
06:05:06.030 --> 06:05:06.040 align:start position:0%
who happen to make a poor life choice or
 
06:05:08.788 --> 06:05:08.798 align:start position:0%
a mistake uh and are caught and
 
06:05:10.948 --> 06:05:10.958 align:start position:0%
convicted of selling cannabis to someone
 
06:05:13.110 --> 06:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
not authorized to possess it should be
 
06:05:15.350 --> 06:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
treated the same as someone who's not a
 
06:05:18.910 --> 06:05:18.920 align:start position:0%
registered patient um I want to thank
