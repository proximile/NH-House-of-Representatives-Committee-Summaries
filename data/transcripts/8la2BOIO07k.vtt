00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 align:start position:0%
it's 10 o'clock welcome commissioner
 
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 align:start position:0%
so um before we get into too much of a
 
00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:45.709 align:start position:0%
so um before we get into too much of a
formal

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:45.719 align:start position:0%
formal
 
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 align:start position:0%
presentation um I'd like us to look at
 
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
507 and
 
00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 align:start position:0%
um what you can see here is except
 
00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 align:start position:0%
possibly for federal funds it looks
 
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
really good right because on paper it
 
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
looks like we're going to be spending
 
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 align:start position:0%
we're we're we're allocating um roughly
 
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 align:start position:0%
the same as as was spent in fiscal year
 
00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 align:start position:0%
2024 which is kind of what we need um so
 
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
that looks really good um before I get
 
00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 align:start position:0%
to the next comment let's let's just
 
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 align:start position:0%
talk about what happened to federal
 
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 align:start position:0%
funds uh thank you and so for the record
 
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 align:start position:0%
Helen Hanks commissioner of the
 
00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections to my right is
 
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 align:start position:0%
Lisa Stone our director of
 
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
administration and I'll let her triage
 
00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 align:start position:0%
that sure um so if you go to our handout
 
00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:42.159 align:start position:0%
on page three I kind of um look at that
 
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 align:start position:0%
so what happened is in fiscal year 23 we
 
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
had significant arpa expenditures and we
 
00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
actually received that Revenue in 24 so
 
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
it understates our fiscal year 24 spend
 
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
what would have typically been General
 
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 align:start position:0%
funds so if you take into account for
 
00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
that and then we did actually have about
 
00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
a half a million dollars in arpa
 
00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
expenditures that we didn't receive
 
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
revenue for in 24 in addition to about
 
00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 align:start position:0%
$100,000 in other Revenue under other
 
00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
funds so when you net all of that out in
 
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 align:start position:0%
the correctional Industries loss our
 
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
general fund spend should have been
 
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 align:start position:0%
about 169 million 701 okay all right so
 
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
basically um this wasn't like you got a
 
00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
Federal grant specifically to do such
 
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
and such this was the state redirected
 
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
some of their arpa funds to you which
 
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 align:start position:0%
replaced General funds at the time is
 
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 align:start position:0%
that kind of it was for um essentially
 
00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention incentives
 
00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:33.879 align:start position:0%
that were paid in fiscal year 23 Revenue
 
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
received later but if you hadn't had the
 
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
federal funds and still did that work it
 
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 align:start position:0%
would have been General funds yeah
 
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
that's correct if the initiative was
 
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
funded through General funds you're
 
00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
correct okay so then so that looks great
 
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
but going into the the main
 
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 align:start position:0%
budget I'm I'm worried that what we see
 
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 align:start position:0%
is not
 
00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
realistic because what we see there is
 
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 align:start position:0%
all the overtime lines going to zero or
 
00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:06.159 align:start position:0%
near zero and the the full-time lines
 
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
having more funds right but
 
00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 align:start position:0%
traditionally you haven't worked that
 
00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 align:start position:0%
way right you've had tons of overtime so
 
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 align:start position:0%
I'm worried that what we're what's
 
00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 align:start position:0%
actually in the budget that adds up to
 
00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 align:start position:0%
these great numbers isn't right so let's
 
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 align:start position:0%
talk about that yeah thank you for that
 
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
question with the footnotes that we've
 
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
asked for which would allow us to take
 
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
the funding from vac positions that are
 
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
not filled those filled positions would
 
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
reduce the overtime and continuing to
 
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
use that methodology um that's what
 
00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 align:start position:0%
we're leaning into and then to your
 
00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 align:start position:0%
point if that's not enough so if things
 
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
that we can't forecast today happen uh
 
00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 align:start position:0%
some increased number of retirements or
 
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
a decrease in recruitment there we did
 
00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
add the additional component that we
 
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
would come before fiscal uh for an
 
00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 align:start position:0%
additional request or appropriation that
 
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 align:start position:0%
isn't otherwise funded through the
 
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
vacancy Lines within the agency trying
 
00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
to use what has been a tool in the past
 
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 align:start position:0%
but then also uh recognize we will
 
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 align:start position:0%
potentially need a safety net again for
 
00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 align:start position:0%
things that we didn't forecast uh that
 
00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:16.759 align:start position:0%
happen in three years from
 
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
now yeah so do you really think well so
 
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 align:start position:0%
let's talk about recruitment so how many
 
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
people are working now versus two years
 
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
ago so there in the enforcement ranks
 
00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
which uh strike us the most we have a
 
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
42% vacancy rate whereas we had a 50
 
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:41.420 align:start position:0%
what did I send to you the last time a
 
00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:42.790 align:start position:0%
what did I send to you the last time a
[Music]

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 align:start position:0%
mic it's on this page 51% vacancy rate
 
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
so we had a 51% vacancy rate in January
 
00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
of 2023 in those lines of effort and now
 
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
we have a 42% vacancy rate in December
 
00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
2024 and that rate is still current uh
 
00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:05.639 align:start position:0%
we have uh 28 new officers going to our
 
00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:07.639 align:start position:0%
next Corrections Academy uh that's a
 
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
wonderful number to have um and the
 
00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
track it is and the tracking and
 
00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 align:start position:0%
trending of our recruitment to date even
 
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 align:start position:0%
when I gave you um I'll show you the
 
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 align:start position:0%
graphic uh this graphic I had 30 new
 
00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639 align:start position:0%
hires now I have 33 um and I still have
 
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
more coming so that is a wonderful
 
00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 align:start position:0%
number for the Department okay so our
 
00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
recruitment efforts are working uh we
 
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
need to continue to lean in our
 
00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:32.759 align:start position:0%
retention efforts again I don't uh
 
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
control the retirement decisions of the
 
00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:36.199 align:start position:0%
state those will obviously potentially
 
00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
impact this agency um and uh and I do
 
00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
think this is an appropriate strategy
 
00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:44.919 align:start position:0%
given the state of the uh finances of
 
00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 align:start position:0%
the representative
 
00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
wer dug out the piece that came from the
 
00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
uh treasury the number of paychecks that
 
00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
were actually issued and I'm looking at
 
00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 align:start position:0%
a year they were like January 2024 820
 
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
then it went gradually up 830 850 88 so
 
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
you've been gaining all most most of the
 
00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:09.759 align:start position:0%
last year thankfully we ended up with
 
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:15.080 align:start position:0%
848 last December paychecks so yeah we
 
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
we have other ways of tracking this yeah
 
00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:18.680 align:start position:0%
but people that don't want to tell us
 
00:07:21.309 --> 00:07:21.319 align:start position:0%
the real vacancies oh I appreciate the
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
validation sir thank you you're welcome
 
00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:25.710 align:start position:0%
validation sir thank you you're welcome
so

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
is I don't know 40 hours of a of a
 
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
full-time and 40 hours of overtime sort
 
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:35.800 align:start position:0%
of roughly the same cost because a
 
00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
full-time person you there's a whole
 
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
bunch of benefits and overtime is like
 
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
double time or something so therefore
 
00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a wash more or less is that
 
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
true or not really I would I would defer
 
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
I I'm going to suspect but I'll defer to
 
00:07:54.189 --> 00:07:54.199 align:start position:0%
her that the overtime costs more but so
 
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
it takes about 11 months to break even
 
00:07:59.189 --> 00:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
if for a new H verse um using overtime
 
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
so so and it also depends on the new
 
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
hire if they're the family plan for
 
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:05.800 align:start position:0%
health insurance um single single are
 
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
you just saying because a new hire is
 
00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:10.520 align:start position:0%
unproductive is that what you mean or I
 
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
mean all I mean they're in training and
 
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
all this sort of stuff right it's there
 
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
it's the certification process getting
 
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
them fully individualized and certified
 
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
well that's not quite what I meant I
 
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
meant um just assume it was you had a
 
00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.070 align:start position:0%
meant um just assume it was you had a
full-time

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
full-time
 
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
person right so a regular full-time
 
00:08:32.029 --> 00:08:32.039 align:start position:0%
correct officer of the same level as
 
00:08:35.509 --> 00:08:35.519 align:start position:0%
somebody working overtime right is is
 
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
the cost
 
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.990 align:start position:0%
the cost
of

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
um is the cost per hour of the regular
 
00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.389 align:start position:0%
um is the cost per hour of the regular
full-time

00:08:45.389 --> 00:08:45.399 align:start position:0%
full-time
 
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
person sort of similar to the cost per
 
00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:52.120 align:start position:0%
hour of of that overtime
 
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:54.760 align:start position:0%
hour so it I mean the hourly rate is
 
00:08:57.269 --> 00:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
double and the benefit rates on overtime
 
00:08:59.509 --> 00:08:59.519 align:start position:0%
is going to be the same it's just really
 
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
the health insurance is benefits charged
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
per hour is that yeah um for retirement
 
00:09:07.829 --> 00:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
in Medicare gotcha so so it's worse so
 
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
overtime is worse yeah yes okay it's 60%
 
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
benefits so you know so that's what I
 
00:09:19.269 --> 00:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
didn't realize because I
 
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:22.600 align:start position:0%
thought in in my industry right if you
 
00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:25.519 align:start position:0%
work overtime you only get salary more
 
00:09:27.069 --> 00:09:27.079 align:start position:0%
you don't get more health insurance or
 
00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:30.200 align:start position:0%
something right so it's
 
00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:32.600 align:start position:0%
right so anyways go ahead repres
 
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:35.240 align:start position:0%
representative camell thank you Mr chair
 
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
So based on that strategy how many
 
00:09:39.509 --> 00:09:39.519 align:start position:0%
vacant positions would you need to leave
 
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
open to cover all the overtime uh in a
 
00:09:45.509 --> 00:09:45.519 align:start position:0%
typical year I know that you won't know
 
00:09:46.949 --> 00:09:46.959 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that question actually the
 
00:09:49.949 --> 00:09:49.959 align:start position:0%
goal is to fill those so that we don't
 
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
uh need to lean in on overtime so we
 
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
won't do an attempt to hold things to
 
00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:57.720 align:start position:0%
fund overtime our goal is to recruit
 
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
people so we don't use overtime I think
 
00:10:02.949 --> 00:10:02.959 align:start position:0%
the other part I would share uh just for
 
00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:04.959 align:start position:0%
we've been tracking again I we look to
 
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
this page I'm showing it to you
 
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:09.240 align:start position:0%
graphically the cost per hour so we
 
00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:11.240 align:start position:0%
understand what we've uh the cost in
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
2024 and then the cost in 2025 and so
 
00:10:16.269 --> 00:10:16.279 align:start position:0%
the number of hours does costs more but
 
00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:18.680 align:start position:0%
we're also tracking how many new people
 
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
we bring on so again it's it's a
 
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
multiple faceted strategy and then I did
 
00:10:25.829 --> 00:10:25.839 align:start position:0%
share with State fiscal for those that
 
00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:29.480 align:start position:0%
sit on that um committee the other area
 
00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
that we do uh lean into is to reduce the
 
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
number of people appropriately to Public
 
00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
Safety that are actually incarcerated
 
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:38.200 align:start position:0%
and so from the perspective that we've
 
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
reduced our recidivism rate by 8% over
 
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
seven years that's 200 less people that
 
00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
are incarcerated and so that has saved
 
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
the state approximately using the right
 
00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:50.360 align:start position:0%
number representative McGuire uh4
 
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
million over seven seven years so it is
 
00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
both a recruitment strategy but also a
 
00:10:59.629 --> 00:10:59.639 align:start position:0%
for those appropriate individuals uh to
 
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
try to keep them in the community and
 
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:03.880 align:start position:0%
under community supervision at $2 a day
 
00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:06.959 align:start position:0%
instead of $250 plus dollars a day thank
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome okay so um let's talk
 
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
about uh numbers of of um so that you
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
keep a track of both inmates and number
 
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
supervised right is that the way you
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
think about it well sure yeah and and so
 
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
the inmates are roughly 2100 Today is
 
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
that they're in custody in the state of
 
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:30.829 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
is

00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:30.839 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
1,970 is in uh inmates in our facilities
 
00:11:37.389 --> 00:11:37.399 align:start position:0%
and then supervised out in the community
 
00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:40.120 align:start position:0%
under probation and parole is just over
 
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
4,000 there's a higher probation case
 
00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:45.839 align:start position:0%
load than parole case load um and those
 
00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
are by factors of the Judiciary okay
 
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I wasn't sure if the if the 4,000
 
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:54.200 align:start position:0%
included the 1900 or no no they separate
 
00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
okay so total of close to 6,000 right
 
00:11:59.550 --> 00:11:59.560 align:start position:0%
that we are responsible for the state of
 
00:12:04.269 --> 00:12:04.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire gotcha and um the the 2000
 
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
number or 1970 is that that's a little
 
00:12:11.069 --> 00:12:11.079 align:start position:0%
lower than it was two years ago yes is
 
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
it it is from two years ago it's been
 
00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
static the last two years I would call
 
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:19.160 align:start position:0%
it static um so we are leaning into the
 
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:20.600 align:start position:0%
why is there anything we can do
 
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:23.480 align:start position:0%
differently to help that number reduce
 
00:12:25.389 --> 00:12:25.399 align:start position:0%
uh several years ago at the point in
 
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
which I saw a natural uh major decline
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
because at one point we had 20 700
 
00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
people uh in the facilities and now when
 
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
you compare that from 2010 and 11 to
 
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
where we are now uh I afforded the
 
00:12:39.389 --> 00:12:39.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity watching population
 
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
reduction to shut down a whole second
 
00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
floor of our largest uh general
 
00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
population unit and so that saves us 14
 
00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
posts we don't fill every single day
 
00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:51.240 align:start position:0%
right yeah and I was thinking that um
 
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
the population's still aging so we would
 
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
expect crime to be decreasing right so
 
00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:58.720 align:start position:0%
you know yeah I'll I'll let the national
 
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
statistics speak for itself New
 
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is rated number one both in
 
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
safety and in Corrections for the work
 
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:06.440 align:start position:0%
that we do here and it's both for the
 
00:13:08.829 --> 00:13:08.839 align:start position:0%
reduction of violent crime uh and the
 
00:13:10.829 --> 00:13:10.839 align:start position:0%
reduction in our our incarcerated
 
00:13:13.189 --> 00:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
population there are numerous National
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
Advocates talking about a rise in
 
00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
incarcerated populations across the
 
00:13:20.189 --> 00:13:20.199 align:start position:0%
country and we uh shine in a good way on
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
that map as ours is not um increasing at
 
00:13:25.629 --> 00:13:25.639 align:start position:0%
the rate other states are and I would
 
00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:27.160 align:start position:0%
say that again under former Governor
 
00:13:30.189 --> 00:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
suoo we didn't engage in Mass releases
 
00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic we kept people
 
00:13:33.949 --> 00:13:33.959 align:start position:0%
incarcerated and safe and we ranked
 
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:36.160 align:start position:0%
number two for best outcomes both for
 
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
wellness during incarceration and
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
wellness for our staff we've done an
 
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
amazing job on behalf of the state and
 
00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
very proud of the work that we do with
 
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
the Department of Corrections
 
00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
congratulations yeah very nice
 
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
um so but possibly the recession is
 
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:55.480 align:start position:0%
causes more crime is that possible
 
00:13:58.110 --> 00:13:58.120 align:start position:0%
represent McGuire I think we can we can
 
00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
uh look different things like that it's
 
00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:02.440 align:start position:0%
I mean so one one aspect is pushing
 
00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
things down and something else is
 
00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:05.480 align:start position:0%
pushing it up some MERS of my team that
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
have been with us for 20 uh plus years
 
00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:09.959 align:start position:0%
look toward a recession because they uh
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
believe it will increase our recruitment
 
00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
so there are a lot of factors we look at
 
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
when the economy becomes a okay now in
 
00:14:20.189 --> 00:14:20.199 align:start position:0%
terms of your overall budget what
 
00:14:22.949 --> 00:14:22.959 align:start position:0%
fraction is for the incarcerated
 
00:14:25.389 --> 00:14:25.399 align:start position:0%
population and what fraction is for the
 
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
supervised population so
 
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
you're talking about if I pull out field
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
services for our overall budget
 
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
percentage Yeah I mean let's call your
 
00:14:43.949 --> 00:14:43.959 align:start position:0%
budget 165 million a year okay so is it
 
00:14:48.509 --> 00:14:48.519 align:start position:0%
100 for the incarcerated and 65 for the
 
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
for the I mean you know you'd have to
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
split your time a little bit and things
 
00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
like that but I mean I'm just in in the
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
big picture kind of I appreciate that
 
00:14:57.629 --> 00:14:57.639 align:start position:0%
question I've never formulated what that
 
00:14:59.870 --> 00:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
would look like as a percentage
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
um and I'm happy to get that back to you
 
00:15:04.189 --> 00:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
I think right now I would be I'd be
 
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
throwing a dart at what that represents
 
00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:07.959 align:start position:0%
because I know that being under
 
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
Supervision in the community is $2 a day
 
00:15:13.949 --> 00:15:13.959 align:start position:0%
and so representing that 4,000 costs $2
 
00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:17.320 align:start position:0%
a day and then knowing 40% of of the
 
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
inmates in our facilities today are back
 
00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
on parole
 
00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
violations so that's important
 
00:15:25.629 --> 00:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
information it used to be 40% 40% it
 
00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
used to be 48% now it's 40% so as we can
 
00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
decrease that percentage again balanced
 
00:15:35.069 --> 00:15:35.079 align:start position:0%
by safety we wouldn't do that just to
 
00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:36.680 align:start position:0%
save money we would only do it if it was
 
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
a safe choice that makes a difference so
 
00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:41.839 align:start position:0%
800 of the
 
00:15:45.309 --> 00:15:45.319 align:start position:0%
2,000 are in parole violation yes of
 
00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:46.959 align:start position:0%
varying types whether they have been
 
00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:49.240 align:start position:0%
under parole and engaged in new criminal
 
00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:50.680 align:start position:0%
activity that has both brought them back
 
00:15:53.189 --> 00:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
in their pending charges or it's uh
 
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
repeat non-compliance with their parole
 
00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
uh requirements and you said that's
 
00:15:59.749 --> 00:15:59.759 align:start position:0%
lower than in the past 100% it's 8%
 
00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:02.440 align:start position:0%
lower than 7 years ago I see what about
 
00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
nationally nationally we are under the
 
00:16:08.269 --> 00:16:08.279 align:start position:0%
50% standard there are some states that
 
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh I wonder what their measure is uh for
 
00:16:14.309 --> 00:16:14.319 align:start position:0%
measuring recidivism they tout a 2%
 
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
recidivism rate um I don't want to
 
00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:19.160 align:start position:0%
disparage my counterparts but I'm just
 
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
not sure where that comes from
 
00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.550 align:start position:0%
not sure where that comes from
represented

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:21.560 align:start position:0%
represented
 
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
months thank you Mr chair
 
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
um the um
 
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
where do you have the biggest issue with
 
00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
um recruitment is it for uh the staff
 
00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:39.880 align:start position:0%
that supervis that are in charge of the
 
00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
supervised population or the inmate
 
00:16:44.309 --> 00:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
population it's the inmate population uh
 
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
is that where most of the people are the
 
00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:47.240 align:start position:0%
inmate population they're the most
 
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
expensive okay so I would share with you
 
00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:52.120 align:start position:0%
that there is a normal career path
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
progression in the department to become
 
00:16:55.749 --> 00:16:55.759 align:start position:0%
a corrections officer and over the time
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
promote into a paration PE officer
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
whenever we have a vacan and our
 
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
probation appr Pro ranks it's filled
 
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
very quickly okay what what is I mean to
 
00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:06.839 align:start position:0%
to following up on um representative
 
00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:09.959 align:start position:0%
McGuire's uh question do you have any
 
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
sense of what the split is in terms of
 
00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:13.240 align:start position:0%
headcount in terms of how many people
 
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
are working in the um you know
 
00:17:17.789 --> 00:17:17.799 align:start position:0%
supporting the uh the supervised
 
00:17:19.549 --> 00:17:19.559 align:start position:0%
population versus the incarcerated
 
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
population yes there are 77 of my 48
 
00:17:26.029 --> 00:17:26.039 align:start position:0%
existing law enforcement positions 77
 
00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
are supervising people in the community
 
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
it's much smaller number so to give you
 
00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
just a breakout I have seven different
 
00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:35.240 align:start position:0%
unions the teamsters represent the
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
Corrections Officers and corporals that
 
00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
equals to about
 
00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:42.440 align:start position:0%
274 law enforcement officers and then
 
00:17:45.789 --> 00:17:45.799 align:start position:0%
the sca sergeants and above are roughly
 
00:17:45.799 --> 00:17:46.830 align:start position:0%
the sca sergeants and above are roughly
a

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:49.400 align:start position:0%
100ish um and then it there are some
 
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
that do not belong to unions like my
 
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
majors are uh not in a union but gives
 
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
you a proportion and then the 77 I
 
00:17:59.750 --> 00:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
represented 11 of those are chief
 
00:18:01.029 --> 00:18:01.039 align:start position:0%
probation approle officers they have
 
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
their own Union and the de Delta is in
 
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
the probation approle and just one last
 
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
question um go ahead yeah just one last
 
00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
question so that I hear correctly that
 
00:18:14.029 --> 00:18:14.039 align:start position:0%
when you're hiring people you're hiring
 
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
them as enforcement officers and then
 
00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:19.640 align:start position:0%
parole officer is a um kind of a
 
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
career uh step for them you don't hire
 
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
you don't hire new parole officers
 
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
that's correct sir thank you do do uh
 
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
probation officers work less overtime
 
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
than the others or is everybody more
 
00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
less the same so the difference for
 
00:18:34.669 --> 00:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
probation PE officers their choice to
 
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:37.720 align:start position:0%
work overtime is voluntary they do uh
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
provide augmentation um uh and our
 
00:18:43.029 --> 00:18:43.039 align:start position:0%
Corrections Officers and corporals and
 
00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:45.880 align:start position:0%
so on there is both forced and voluntary
 
00:18:49.149 --> 00:18:49.159 align:start position:0%
overtime gotcha yeah because I know this
 
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
$2 a day doesn't sound right to me
 
00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:55.720 align:start position:0%
because um you have 4,000 officers $2 a
 
00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
day would be less than $1,000 a year so
 
00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:01.240 align:start position:0%
we'd be talking $4 million for that out
 
00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
of$ 165 right so you know it's it's got
 
00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
to be way more than that if you just
 
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
think about it in terms of one sixth of
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
the officers are on parole and probation
 
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
then one six of the budget would be more
 
00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
like $25 million or something like that
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
you see what I mean I hear what you're
 
00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:25.039 align:start position:0%
saying um understand how you're getting
 
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
there I I want to be more prepared to
 
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
answer your question all right right
 
00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
I'll let you think about that yeah I was
 
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
trying to get to the which page was my
 
00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:35.720 align:start position:0%
field services
 
00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:41.789 align:start position:0%
field services
budget

00:19:41.789 --> 00:19:41.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:46.600 align:start position:0%
489 yes that's 77 probation and
 
00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:48.799 align:start position:0%
officers there you
 
00:19:54.669 --> 00:19:54.679 align:start position:0%
go okay yeah so 15 million divided by
 
00:20:00.029 --> 00:20:00.039 align:start position:0%
4,000 is is $4,000 each not
 
00:20:02.029 --> 00:20:02.039 align:start position:0%
right so it's more like $5 a day or
 
00:20:06.029 --> 00:20:06.039 align:start position:0%
something anyways okay very good so um
 
00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
it's still of Lo
 
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
number incarceration yeah yeah and bear
 
00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
with me that $2 is from my fy22 annual
 
00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
report and I'm going to be surrendering
 
00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
the FY 23 soon and then the fy2 24 in
 
00:20:20.669 --> 00:20:20.679 align:start position:0%
synchronic so I'm getting all caught up
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
all right let's ask um I any other sort
 
00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
of general questions from
 
00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:31.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
than thank you um I I see in in in in
 
00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:36.200 align:start position:0%
your budget and I don't think it's
 
00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:38.200 align:start position:0%
Unique to your budget but there is about
 
00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
200 $2.4 million in FY 26 of what are
 
00:20:44.909 --> 00:20:44.919 align:start position:0%
called current expenses what are current
 
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
expenses those are our our class 20
 
00:20:51.909 --> 00:20:51.919 align:start position:0%
expenses paper pens those disposable
 
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
items they're under by State uh manual
 
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
procedures and Department of
 
00:21:00.029 --> 00:21:00.039 align:start position:0%
administrative Services Under 240 $9.99
 
00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
or less are considered current expense
 
00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
so that's the new way of call saying
 
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous yes okay anything over
 
00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:11.240 align:start position:0%
249.99 is considered equipment so you
 
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
see that in class 30 they probably have
 
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of paper cuffs and things like
 
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:17.320 align:start position:0%
well to your point there are different
 
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
consumables within the correctional
 
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
institutions we are literally trying to
 
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
reduce physical paper but representative
 
00:21:26.149 --> 00:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
evil thank you Mr chair so you said do I
 
00:21:27.909 --> 00:21:27.919 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any more general
 
00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:29.320 align:start position:0%
questions I don't I know if this meets
 
00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:32.440 align:start position:0%
your definition or not okay but um I
 
00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:34.559 align:start position:0%
read before we get to the page yes right
 
00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
I read an incredibly uh comprehensive
 
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
two-part series of articles on Indigent
 
00:21:43.029 --> 00:21:43.039 align:start position:0%
Council representation in the state of
 
00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:47.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and so I I guess I'm I
 
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate being on division one because
 
00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:53.480 align:start position:0%
I understand what a huge there's so many
 
00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
threads that make up the sweater right
 
00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:00.200 align:start position:0%
yes so one of the comments um in there
 
00:22:03.269 --> 00:22:03.279 align:start position:0%
was that the number of incarcerated
 
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
people really can track back to what is
 
00:22:10.269 --> 00:22:10.279 align:start position:0%
considered a Class A or B misdemeanor
 
00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
and what is considered a felony I mean
 
00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
would you say that was a fair statement
 
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
I think that's uh statutorily makes
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
sense yeah and so one of the things that
 
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
they were saying as far as our system
 
00:22:26.269 --> 00:22:26.279 align:start position:0%
and I'm not arguing one way or the other
 
00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
I'm just making a comment like what was
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
in there for simple possession if you
 
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
moved it from a Class A to a b or a B to
 
00:22:35.789 --> 00:22:35.799 align:start position:0%
an a I don't know which way it is it
 
00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
could really affect the whole system and
 
00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
the processing of the claims and the
 
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
other thing is that simple POS I mean um
 
00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
for felonies for theft right now it's
 
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
$1,000 to become a felony and if you
 
00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
moved to 1500 or if you moved it to
 
00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
2,000 you could also change the
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
incarceration rates so I'm again I I'm
 
00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
not arguing one way or the other but I
 
00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:07.480 align:start position:0%
think as we sit here recognizing this is
 
00:23:10.669 --> 00:23:10.679 align:start position:0%
this huge package and incarceration
 
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
rates costs are so much higher than some
 
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
of these others tweaking things way out
 
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
here can make a huge difference like way
 
00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
out here and I know on possession I
 
00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
assume they're talking about marijuana
 
00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
uh you know and how they but would you
 
00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:31.400 align:start position:0%
say that's a I know you're not arguing
 
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
one way or the other but would you say
 
00:23:35.549 --> 00:23:35.559 align:start position:0%
that was a fair statement representative
 
00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
anytime the state adjusts statutes to U
 
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
I would say adjust a felony to a
 
00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:43.720 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor or uh even down to a
 
00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
violation and a fine those uh clearly
 
00:23:48.909 --> 00:23:48.919 align:start position:0%
affect the use of the New Hampshire
 
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections and that type
 
00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
of incarceration and then in carefulness
 
00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:55.039 align:start position:0%
and again I do not oversee County jails
 
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
when you adjust something to a
 
00:23:57.909 --> 00:23:57.919 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor you would be having that
 
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
person serve incarceration potentially
 
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
in a county jail if they're not on
 
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
probation as a
 
00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:05.720 align:start position:0%
diversion thank you you're welcome I
 
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
that was General yes good no and I I I
 
00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
would tend to agree with you and I I'm
 
00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
willing to bet that that ,000 cut off is
 
00:24:13.279 --> 00:24:14.149 align:start position:0%
willing to bet that that ,000 cut off is
really

00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
old like we're talking about when fines
 
00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:17.710 align:start position:0%
old like we're talking about when fines
are

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:17.720 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
set yeah so I know you do a lot of
 
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
training when you have them in prison I
 
00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
know that you have your own
 
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
saou um so there's probably a major
 
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
portion of the inmates that don't don't
 
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
have a high school diploma and maybe
 
00:24:35.269 --> 00:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
they get it through their I know you
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
have carpentry and and autoshop and all
 
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:40.240 align:start position:0%
that what do you think is the most
 
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
successful program in perhaps stopping
 
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
the recidivism is it getting the high
 
00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:47.240 align:start position:0%
school diploma is it getting the
 
00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
training or can is it hard to tell
 
00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
represent wer I would tell you that
 
00:24:54.669 --> 00:24:54.679 align:start position:0%
nationally when they look at what makes
 
00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
the most profound difference providing
 
00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:57.919 align:start position:0%
somebody with a base education is the
 
00:24:59.870 --> 00:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
first foremost thing you would do and
 
00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:01.880 align:start position:0%
then you'd layer on again vocational
 
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
skills because most individuals are in
 
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
need of those for that success what
 
00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:07.720 align:start position:0%
percentage do you think come in there
 
00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:11.480 align:start position:0%
without a an a diploma I would tell you
 
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
that on the uh men's side I don't have
 
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
the exact percentage but a larger number
 
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
of them have not completed their High
 
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
School level of education on the uh
 
00:25:23.789 --> 00:25:23.799 align:start position:0%
female side a lot of them have uh
 
00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
completed their Base education and for
 
00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:28.360 align:start position:0%
them it's postsecondary and Vocational
 
00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
skills thank you you're
 
00:25:32.669 --> 00:25:32.679 align:start position:0%
welcome repres just to follow up on that
 
00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:35.480 align:start position:0%
and and Mr chair this follows up on a
 
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
conversation we had in here I don't even
 
00:25:39.909 --> 00:25:39.919 align:start position:0%
know what day it was anymore but I
 
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
worked a lot on dyslexia and dyslexic
 
00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
education and early screening and one of
 
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
the things that we found to support
 
00:25:51.149 --> 00:25:51.159 align:start position:0%
trying to do better with dyslexia was
 
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
something like 20% or 25% of the people
 
00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
that were incarcerated had very had
 
00:25:59.230 --> 00:25:59.240 align:start position:0%
learning disabilties
 
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
that sort of threw them off the path
 
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
forward um which was just I mean it's
 
00:26:07.789 --> 00:26:07.799 align:start position:0%
probably higher I just don't want to
 
00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
exaggerate but just emphasizing the
 
00:26:13.029 --> 00:26:13.039 align:start position:0%
importance of uh early intervention and
 
00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
and educational support and to your
 
00:26:18.389 --> 00:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
point I would offer that we not only
 
00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
have to comply with the special
 
00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
education standards but we also offer
 
00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:25.480 align:start position:0%
that um the other uh issues around
 
00:26:27.389 --> 00:26:27.399 align:start position:0%
learning disabilities in education that
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
don't meet the special education
 
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
standards for the students people who
 
00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:34.120 align:start position:0%
inmates who are getting Education
 
00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:37.240 align:start position:0%
Services uh if I could sir I do want to
 
00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
point out the other reduction we
 
00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:41.320 align:start position:0%
consciously made was approximately $1.3
 
00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:43.960 align:start position:0%
million in contracted services for
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
forensic evaluations uh we are not
 
00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
statutorily required to provide those
 
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
Services um and so in order to meet uh
 
00:26:55.029 --> 00:26:55.039 align:start position:0%
the target we did take that out of our
 
00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
medical budgeting line ex what is is a
 
00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
forensic in evaluation what do you mean
 
00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
so those are the criminal competency
 
00:27:06.389 --> 00:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
orders that come out of the Judiciary uh
 
00:27:09.789 --> 00:27:09.799 align:start position:0%
the statute speaks to the ability for a
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
defense Council to question criminal
 
00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:14.200 align:start position:0%
competency in cases when that comes
 
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
forward then it is the charge of the
 
00:27:20.909 --> 00:27:20.919 align:start position:0%
prosecution to uh essentially uh negate
 
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
that claim and the judge then orders a
 
00:27:25.389 --> 00:27:25.399 align:start position:0%
criminal competency evaluation the
 
00:27:25.399 --> 00:27:26.630 align:start position:0%
criminal competency evaluation the
statute

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:27:29.669 --> 00:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
13517 speaks to to the education
 
00:27:31.389 --> 00:27:31.399 align:start position:0%
standards of the person who would do
 
00:27:34.149 --> 00:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
that in our state but does not create an
 
00:27:36.269 --> 00:27:36.279 align:start position:0%
office of forensic examiners it also
 
00:27:38.029 --> 00:27:38.039 align:start position:0%
does not bound it to the Department of
 
00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:41.080 align:start position:0%
Corrections it is simply a contracted
 
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
services that is an archive of moving
 
00:27:44.789 --> 00:27:44.799 align:start position:0%
the secure psych psychiatric unit to the
 
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
department in the 80s um and we're not
 
00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
going to continue to fund that in the
 
00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:51.320 align:start position:0%
next bium budget in this budget proposal
 
00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:53.080 align:start position:0%
but on the other hand I noticed on page
 
00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:55.720 align:start position:0%
496 you're adding five more people to
 
00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
Mental Health
 
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:07.470 align:start position:0%
 
or

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:07.480 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:28:10.509 --> 00:28:10.519 align:start position:0%
six yeah I definitely not adding uh
 
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
competency so I have in that
 
00:28:22.389 --> 00:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
line am I looking at this use you tackle
 
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
that so um it's actually just
 
00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:25.640 align:start position:0%
transferring positions from other
 
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
accounting units so we had an executive
 
00:28:28.549 --> 00:28:28.559 align:start position:0%
secretary that moved from accounting
 
00:28:28.559 --> 00:28:29.710 align:start position:0%
secretary that moved from accounting
unit

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:29.720 align:start position:0%
unit
 
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
3373 a recreation therapist that moved
 
00:28:35.149 --> 00:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
from accounting unit 5833 and then we
 
00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
had an admin a clinical mental health
 
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
clinician and a nurse I can't hear you
 
00:28:40.909 --> 00:28:40.919 align:start position:0%
very well because You' be a little CL
 
00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:41.960 align:start position:0%
and then we had three positions that
 
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
moved from 8234 so if you refer back to
 
00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:46.360 align:start position:0%
those sheets you'll see there's changes
 
00:28:47.789 --> 00:28:47.799 align:start position:0%
in those position
 
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
counts so it's not a it's not an
 
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:52.559 align:start position:0%
addition we've moved people to different
 
00:28:54.389 --> 00:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
organizational units to account for
 
00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
where their service is delivered within
 
00:28:59.909 --> 00:28:59.919 align:start position:0%
the department oh I see yeah but they're
 
00:29:02.909 --> 00:29:02.919 align:start position:0%
within this mental health uh accounting
 
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
unit no the contract money the 1.3 will
 
00:29:12.269 --> 00:29:12.279 align:start position:0%
show up under uh class 101 and not as
 
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
Personnel lines because they're not
 
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
state employees there would the state I
 
00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:19.039 align:start position:0%
think would be challenged to hire a
 
00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
forensic psychologist or forensic
 
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist given the unique uh Niche
 
00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:26.039 align:start position:0%
uh career costs of
 
00:29:30.269 --> 00:29:30.279 align:start position:0%
those right but I so say again why
 
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
this went from 24 to
 
00:29:35.389 --> 00:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
29 we
 
00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
moved one two three four five people
 
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
from different accounting units into
 
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
this accounting
 
00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:45.919 align:start position:0%
unit right so from the secure
 
00:29:48.509 --> 00:29:48.519 align:start position:0%
psychiatric unit you move
 
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
to from the rehabilitative services you
 
00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
moved one Etc right yes yeah and we have
 
00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:58.120 align:start position:0%
in the past if it helps the committee
 
00:30:00.029 --> 00:30:00.039 align:start position:0%
sent you those transfers in a separate
 
00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:02.360 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet happy to do that okay but
 
00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:04.120 align:start position:0%
just you think you need more in this
 
00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
area for some reason yes we just shift
 
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
so sometimes what I find represent
 
00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
McGuire chairman is that they've been
 
00:30:12.269 --> 00:30:12.279 align:start position:0%
sitting in another county unit
 
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
performing the service for this unit and
 
00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
this is clean up
 
00:30:21.029 --> 00:30:21.039 align:start position:0%
time okay all right so let's go back to
 
00:30:21.039 --> 00:30:24.029 align:start position:0%
time okay all right so let's go back to
page

00:30:24.029 --> 00:30:24.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
473 um what is victim
 
00:30:33.669 --> 00:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
Services yes victim Services we have by
 
00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
Statute uh our own Bureau of victim
 
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
services to support individuals affected
 
00:30:42.149 --> 00:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
by felony level crime so on any given
 
00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
day we're supporting more than 2,000
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
people who have been affected by the
 
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
crimes of those incarcerated in the
 
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire a majority of
 
00:30:52.669 --> 00:30:52.679 align:start position:0%
this funding does come from Voca the
 
00:30:56.549 --> 00:30:56.559 align:start position:0%
federally funded um it's been four
 
00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:01.480 align:start position:0%
decades uh Across the Nation
 
00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:05.000 align:start position:0%
and they provide both support for
 
00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
individuals who are coming into our
 
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
Institution for parole hearings against
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
survivors and victims of crime felony
 
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:17.509 --> 00:31:17.519 align:start position:0%
Statute so are you really going to get
 
00:31:21.389 --> 00:31:21.399 align:start position:0%
an extra whatever it is
 
00:31:21.399 --> 00:31:23.789 align:start position:0%
an extra whatever it is
140,000

00:31:23.789 --> 00:31:23.799 align:start position:0%
140,000
 
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
120,000 per year from the federal
 
00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:29.240 align:start position:0%
government for this so um the majority
 
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
of that funding is to fund two positions
 
00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
they're partially funded and there was a
 
00:31:34.909 --> 00:31:34.919 align:start position:0%
vacancy so in speaking with New
 
00:31:36.149 --> 00:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Justice they did
 
00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:38.360 align:start position:0%
estimate that that would be what our our
 
00:31:40.629 --> 00:31:40.639 align:start position:0%
um Revenue would be and that is kind of
 
00:31:42.389 --> 00:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
what we would have expected in fiscal
 
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
year 24 had we had that position filled
 
00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:46.600 align:start position:0%
so the Department of Justice is
 
00:31:49.389 --> 00:31:49.399 align:start position:0%
basically transferring you this money
 
00:31:51.789 --> 00:31:51.799 align:start position:0%
for this thing is that it yes they're
 
00:31:53.789 --> 00:31:53.799 align:start position:0%
The Entity that receives the federal
 
00:31:56.389 --> 00:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
Voca dollars and then they award those
 
00:31:58.990 --> 00:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
okay but you're adding three 150,000 of
 
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
00:32:05.389 --> 00:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
also on page 473 yeah um the general
 
00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
fund for fiscal year 24 spend was 355
 
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
and then it kind of
 
00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:17.389 --> 00:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
job there's a significant amount of
 
00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
General funds too there is there again
 
00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
there are 2,000 plus people we provide
 
00:32:23.629 --> 00:32:23.639 align:start position:0%
support to that come into the
 
00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:27.039 align:start position:0%
institution the position allocation had
 
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
included an administrative support
 
00:32:30.909 --> 00:32:30.919 align:start position:0%
person who literally physically mailed
 
00:32:33.149 --> 00:32:33.159 align:start position:0%
out notification when we went to the
 
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
automated it's called Vine victim
 
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:37.720 align:start position:0%
information notification system we
 
00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:39.320 align:start position:0%
learned that we didn't need that
 
00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
executive role anymore but we would
 
00:32:42.909 --> 00:32:42.919 align:start position:0%
benefit more from another victim witness
 
00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:45.320 align:start position:0%
specialist who literally helps people
 
00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
prepare both what they want to say at a
 
00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
parole hearing to their perpetrator and
 
00:32:52.669 --> 00:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
um helps coordinate bringing them in so
 
00:32:55.669 --> 00:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
they feel safe we are interestingly
 
00:32:58.750 --> 00:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
unique in that our um parole hearings
 
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
the victim has to sit in the same room
 
00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:02.120 align:start position:0%
with someone who may have sexually
 
00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
assaulted them and not and this far away
 
00:33:07.389 --> 00:33:07.399 align:start position:0%
um so having another victim witness
 
00:33:09.549 --> 00:33:09.559 align:start position:0%
specialist to help support that process
 
00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:11.320 align:start position:0%
really is the right thing to do so we
 
00:33:13.629 --> 00:33:13.639 align:start position:0%
only have two victim witness Specialists
 
00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
to do that work now and one is um being
 
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
recruited for as we speak so you think
 
00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
in including the victims in this way has
 
00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:24.269 align:start position:0%
in including the victims in this way has
some

00:33:24.269 --> 00:33:24.279 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:33:27.789 --> 00:33:27.799 align:start position:0%
rehabilitative effect is that uh it is
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
are charged by Statute to provide
 
00:33:31.029 --> 00:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
appropriate support to victims and
 
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
survivors of crime felony level crime uh
 
00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:37.480 align:start position:0%
I think it's a good safety planning for
 
00:33:39.509 --> 00:33:39.519 align:start position:0%
for individuals it also helps educate
 
00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:41.960 align:start position:0%
them on what the actual process is so
 
00:33:44.029 --> 00:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
they come in incredibly well informed
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
most people don't anticipate that
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to understand how
 
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
to navigate the criminal justice system
 
00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
let alone the complications of the
 
00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
correction system um and that's what
 
00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:56.360 align:start position:0%
these two full-time employees uh one
 
00:33:58.669 --> 00:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
right now and two in the future will do
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
I mean presumably they want to be there
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
right I mean some people are nervous but
 
00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:05.320 align:start position:0%
they want to have their voice and they
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
don't know how to do that without
 
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:11.560 align:start position:0%
feeling safe um we have there are a lot
 
00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:13.919 align:start position:0%
of strong confident people who want uh
 
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
and come uh even angry and we have to
 
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
actually coach them on how to present in
 
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
a way that they're going to be heard and
 
00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:22.919 align:start position:0%
not just sound angry and I don't mean to
 
00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
be insensitive but we want people to
 
00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
literally have uh the right voice in the
 
00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
room especially in parole hearings and
 
00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
release hearings interesting
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
representative EV well I was just um
 
00:34:35.950 --> 00:34:35.960 align:start position:0%
remembering our discussion with the
 
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
attorney general yesterday that he had
 
00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:41.480 align:start position:0%
something nine something million dollars
 
00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
to in general funds in his budget that
 
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
the governor had put in because we were
 
00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:49.240 align:start position:0%
losing Federal Appropriations do you
 
00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
remember the Voca so so part of the
 
00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
money then would be coming to you from
 
00:34:59.550 --> 00:34:59.560 align:start position:0%
the right that's my understanding
 
00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
H all
 
00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:05.960 align:start position:0%
right okay um so the next one I wanted
 
00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:08.200 align:start position:0%
to talk about is Correctional Industries
 
00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:20.190 align:start position:0%
to talk about is Correctional Industries
page

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:20.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
479 so this one
 
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
anticipates um like an extra million of
 
00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.150 align:start position:0%
anticipates um like an extra million of
income

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
income
 
00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:30.680 align:start position:0%
over what you actually got in
 
00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:35.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
accurate uh we we essentially just uh
 
00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
flat funded it from the from fiscal year
 
00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
25 is adjusted authorized um and so I
 
00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:45.839 align:start position:0%
think what made the difference up was
 
00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:49.480 align:start position:0%
vacancies at the time and some um fan
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
right in our ear can't hear sorry so
 
00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:55.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's a you want to turn that off
 
00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
maybe I don't care but if she just gets
 
00:36:00.069 --> 00:36:00.079 align:start position:0%
closer to the yeah right sorry um so
 
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
it's essentially flat funded for fiscal
 
00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
year 25's
 
00:36:07.589 --> 00:36:07.599 align:start position:0%
ask right but I'm this is money they're
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
they're selling stuff right or they're
 
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:11.800 align:start position:0%
doing services or something correct
 
00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
right so wouldn't it be more accurate to
 
00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:18.280 align:start position:0%
to have something closer to what the
 
00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:20.200 align:start position:0%
actual in this case
 
00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.309 align:start position:0%
actual in this case
[Music]

00:36:22.309 --> 00:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
yeah I potentially um I mean the are you
 
00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
expecting the the the activity to to
 
00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
increase by 20% is you know I would say
 
00:36:36.589 --> 00:36:36.599 align:start position:0%
it is fair that we forecasted new
 
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
vocations and new opportunities in
 
00:36:41.069 --> 00:36:41.079 align:start position:0%
Industries we are hopeful that we will
 
00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:43.400 align:start position:0%
take in more Revenue we've increased um
 
00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
and invested in um Printing and uh
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
marketing resources we've also invested
 
00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
more in our sublimation work that we're
 
00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:54.200 align:start position:0%
doing so that we can actually sell and
 
00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
produce goods and and re really
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
reinforce both uh budget neutral but
 
00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
again revenues uh for this particular
 
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:03.880 align:start position:0%
area it's Unique obviously to the work
 
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
yeah this furniture yeah and all the
 
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
signs we see yeah they produce most of
 
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:18.280 align:start position:0%
the signs and some of the towns that
 
00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
want a special sign town beach open such
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
and such a lot of them are contracted oh
 
00:37:26.589 --> 00:37:26.599 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I place I have in my house
 
00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
some great things that they've made you
 
00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
know so but my my my main point is if
 
00:37:34.589 --> 00:37:34.599 align:start position:0%
you look at 2024 you'll see that there's
 
00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
243,000 of General funds and that's
 
00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
going away in future years so I'm
 
00:37:44.109 --> 00:37:44.119 align:start position:0%
worried that if these agency income
 
00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't materialize then you're going to
 
00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:49.640 align:start position:0%
come back to fill in with General funds
 
00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
because you want to lay off any of these
 
00:37:56.349 --> 00:37:56.359 align:start position:0%
22 people right so and I hear you and we
 
00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
also requested a footnote because those
 
00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
positions uh are funded by their revenue
 
00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
they're motivated to make this money
 
00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
because that's another uh incentive
 
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
okay um anyways I guess that's more
 
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
for anyways you understand the concern
 
00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:19.030 align:start position:0%
for anyways you understand the concern
all

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:38:24.589 --> 00:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
right um represent month thank you um
 
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
the uh I understand that the inmates are
 
00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:31.319 align:start position:0%
are paid a small stien for their work
 
00:38:34.069 --> 00:38:34.079 align:start position:0%
doing this uh this this work where does
 
00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:36.520 align:start position:0%
that show up in the budget sir uh
 
00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
anywhere you see class 68 remuneration a
 
00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
word I've practiced saying out loud for
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
years that's that's that thank you
 
00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:45.430 align:start position:0%
years that's that's that thank you
you're

00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:48.030 align:start position:0%
you're
welcome

00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:48.040 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
okay all right so most of the rest of
 
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
the stuff is the thing we talked about
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
overtime versus
 
00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
full-time um I guess guess why don't we
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:09.599 --> 00:39:12.030 align:start position:0%
 
486

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:12.040 align:start position:0%
486
 
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
so let's see here
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
486 equipment yeah so you're you're
 
00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:21.430 align:start position:0%
486 equipment yeah so you're you're
planning

00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:23.390 align:start position:0%
 
on

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
um what is this congr contractual
 
00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.150 align:start position:0%
um what is this congr contractual
maintenance

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
00:39:31.109 --> 00:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
buildings and grounds
 
00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
242,000 yes one area of business I
 
00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:36.920 align:start position:0%
learned as a department that we did not
 
00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
have a uh called kitchen grade cleaning
 
00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:43.839 align:start position:0%
contract for our kitchens U this funds
 
00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
those contracts so it is to make sure
 
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
that our Public Health inspected
 
00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
kitchens meet the standard of Sanitation
 
00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:54.680 align:start position:0%
we do have inmates who clean on a daily
 
00:39:56.829 --> 00:39:56.839 align:start position:0%
and regular basis but that's what these
 
00:39:59.109 --> 00:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
uh increas Es are the result of we had
 
00:40:02.589 --> 00:40:02.599 align:start position:0%
not previously had any regular uh
 
00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
commercial private entity who knows how
 
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
to clean those kitchens to meet those
 
00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
standards come in and the inmates can't
 
00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
be trained to do to that level or uh
 
00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:14.200 align:start position:0%
it's also the equipment that they bring
 
00:40:16.589 --> 00:40:16.599 align:start position:0%
in and and the and the venting systems
 
00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
and the grease traps and so again the
 
00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
inmates do clean the kitchens this is to
 
00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:24.440 align:start position:0%
assure that we meet our Public Health um
 
00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
inspection and we've been uh doing it uh
 
00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
this year and we just want to be mindful
 
00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
that we've been basically essentially
 
00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:33.800 align:start position:0%
choosing not to do other things to make
 
00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
sure those kitchens are clean oh so the
 
00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 number is not really zero
 
00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:42.670 align:start position:0%
correct I see okay all right
 
00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:45.150 align:start position:0%
correct I see okay all right
[Music]

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:45.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
um oh let's go to page
 
00:40:52.589 --> 00:40:52.599 align:start position:0%
499 and I saw this in two
 
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
so see on page 499 uh class
 
00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:09.880 align:start position:0%
100 there's a big decrease $3 million in
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
prescription drug costs from actual to
 
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
to budget it so is that
 
00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
realistic uh I think that's a fair
 
00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:21.640 align:start position:0%
question we've been uh implementing the
 
00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:25.720 align:start position:0%
re-entry 1115a waiver with that we've
 
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
received as a state from the center of
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
Medicare Medicaid services we have a
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
pilot occurring where 45 days prior to
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
inmate's release if they're eligible for
 
00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:37.720 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and 90% of people are the this
 
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
um project covers 30 days worth of
 
00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
discharge medications and our goal is
 
00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:45.560 align:start position:0%
obviously to cre increase continuity of
 
00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:47.800 align:start position:0%
transfer treatment so that we reduce
 
00:41:50.309 --> 00:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
that reincarceration rate um that
 
00:41:52.349 --> 00:41:52.359 align:start position:0%
affects our Pharmacy line in addition to
 
00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:55.960 align:start position:0%
that we have a a major discount on the
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals we're using in the
 
00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
treatment of opioid use disorder and so
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
we're trying to be mindful again that we
 
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to budget for more than we
 
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
need but we also are still asking for
 
00:42:09.309 --> 00:42:09.319 align:start position:0%
the footnote that if the pharmaceutical
 
00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
costs increase nationally that we're
 
00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:13.160 align:start position:0%
prepared to come back before physical
 
00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:15.640 align:start position:0%
and genc for additional Appropriations
 
00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
okay because it it um appears in two
 
00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
places I think um I would also add we
 
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
also have our 340b purchasing through
 
00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
partnership with health and human
 
00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
services in our state and we're trying
 
00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:29.800 align:start position:0%
to continue to reduce the cost of the
 
00:42:32.549 --> 00:42:32.559 align:start position:0%
hepatitis C Pharmaceuticals in HIV
 
00:42:35.349 --> 00:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals used in the institutions
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
that's a big cost is that those are
 
00:42:40.549 --> 00:42:40.559 align:start position:0%
those were at one time almost 150,000
 
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:42.839 align:start position:0%
per person receiving those medications
 
00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
and now they're uh I think 15,000 and I
 
00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:47.960 align:start position:0%
I'll verify those numbers I don't want
 
00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
to be wrong there representative Ms um
 
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
i' I'd like to use this as as a like a
 
00:42:56.589 --> 00:42:56.599 align:start position:0%
jumping off point on uh maybe a broader
 
00:42:58.829 --> 00:42:58.839 align:start position:0%
discussion of medical and Pharmacy and I
 
00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:00.680 align:start position:0%
know you've got a page on that in your
 
00:43:04.549 --> 00:43:04.559 align:start position:0%
um in your presentation um I guess my my
 
00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:06.440 align:start position:0%
question is
 
00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
um the where does the funding for that
 
00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
come from I mean I'm looking through the
 
00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
the the materials it it appeared to me
 
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
that most of it's coming from General
 
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
funds yes but um you you've also
 
00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you have this you know
 
00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
waiver through
 
00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um it just started trying to
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
understand that's how much you know
 
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
that's a federal program so how much of
 
00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
the federal government is how much of
 
00:43:36.589 --> 00:43:36.599 align:start position:0%
how much is coming from the federal
 
00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:38.680 align:start position:0%
government versus the state New
 
00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:43.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yeah represent months most
 
00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:45.720 align:start position:0%
99.9% of what we spend on immate
 
00:43:47.549 --> 00:43:47.559 align:start position:0%
healthare comes from the general fund
 
00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
the project I just referenced literally
 
00:43:53.349 --> 00:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
kicked off February 15th of 2025 and so
 
00:43:55.109 --> 00:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
part of our forecasting over the next
 
00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
few years was in this line and hoping
 
00:43:58.750 --> 00:43:58.760 align:start position:0%
that we would reduce it through that
 
00:44:01.109 --> 00:44:01.119 align:start position:0%
work I don't have I won't be able to let
 
00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:03.720 align:start position:0%
you know as we until we navigate um each
 
00:44:06.349 --> 00:44:06.359 align:start position:0%
month thereafter on the federal portion
 
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
I will like to add um that under current
 
00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rules if someone uh ends up in
 
00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
an inpatient stay at a hospital during
 
00:44:19.069 --> 00:44:19.079 align:start position:0%
incarceration uh we can remit for
 
00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
Medicaid to retr cover that impatient
 
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
day so I say that because we've deferred
 
00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
almost $2 million to be paid under
 
00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
Medicaid for impatient stay during
 
00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
incarceration for inmates in the absence
 
00:44:34.589 --> 00:44:34.599 align:start position:0%
of that that $2 million would be paid
 
00:44:37.309 --> 00:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
under the general fund
 
00:44:40.829 --> 00:44:40.839 align:start position:0%
the process we've understood is the way
 
00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
in which your stay at a hospital is
 
00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
ordered is based on the provider who
 
00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:47.240 align:start position:0%
literally writes in the order so for any
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
one of us if we're in the hospital a
 
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
provider orders in writing fundamentally
 
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
that I'm in here for an inpatient day or
 
00:44:57.910 --> 00:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
they can order you in for an observation
 
00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:00.280 align:start position:0%
stay if you in the hospital under an
 
00:45:02.109 --> 00:45:02.119 align:start position:0%
observation stay and you're there for
 
00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:05.240 align:start position:0%
seven days and you're an inmate that
 
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
can't be reimbursed under
 
00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:12.680 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um how much have you how much
 
00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
in Medicaid uh reimbursement under this
 
00:45:18.549 --> 00:45:18.559 align:start position:0%
new waiver program have you assumed in
 
00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:22.280 align:start position:0%
the budget for 26 and 27 I I'll get that
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
to you I don't have that right in front
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
of me today that we're forecasting and
 
00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:27.880 align:start position:0%
and and I guess that you know will lead
 
00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:30.440 align:start position:0%
to my final question which is you know
 
00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
given that um the the budget in
 
00:45:36.309 --> 00:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
Washington the proposed budget in
 
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
Washington has you know approximately
 
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
$800 billion dollar of Medicaid Cuts
 
00:45:43.349 --> 00:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
included in it um you know it would be
 
00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
good to know that to to understand you
 
00:45:48.309 --> 00:45:48.319 align:start position:0%
know what the risk to the uh the state
 
00:45:50.589 --> 00:45:50.599 align:start position:0%
budget's going to be if um some of those
 
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
cuts end up impacting this this program
 
00:45:54.829 --> 00:45:54.839 align:start position:0%
thank you I think that's a very uh
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
thoughtful question we'll get we'll get
 
00:45:58.109 --> 00:45:58.119 align:start position:0%
on that
 
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
all right so the last uh page that I
 
00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to look at was
 
00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:05.670 align:start position:0%
wanted to look at was
504

00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
504
 
00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:09.680 align:start position:0%

00:46:50.349 --> 00:46:50.359 align:start position:0%
those investigators do under that
 
00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
statute a valid law enforcement
 
00:46:54.589 --> 00:46:54.599 align:start position:0%
investigation uh since the Inception of
 
00:46:57.230 --> 00:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
that law in January 1 of 2020 three
 
00:46:59.950 --> 00:46:59.960 align:start position:0%
we've learned uh we needed additional
 
00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
resources so I recently reclassed a
 
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
position to add to that um the in
 
00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:07.720 align:start position:0%
incarcerated population makes a lot of
 
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
allegations um and those allegations
 
00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:11.240 align:start position:0%
have to be investigated according to
 
00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:13.160 align:start position:0%
that law in addition to if those
 
00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
allegations are criminal in nature we
 
00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
have to have a solid partnership with
 
00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's public Integrity
 
00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
unit so that we make the right
 
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
notifications at the right time within
 
00:47:24.349 --> 00:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
the right standards all balanced by
 
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
employees rights under the collective
 
00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement ment it's a very
 
00:47:30.549 --> 00:47:30.559 align:start position:0%
complex but appropriate uh set of
 
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
standards and uh this division is the
 
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
primary resource there I also want to
 
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
then shift gears that inmates uh try to
 
00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
bring in Contraband they engage in
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
assaults and all those other things and
 
00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
this division does all of that
 
00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
investigative work as well as criminal
 
00:47:46.829 --> 00:47:46.839 align:start position:0%
charges referrals if somebody assaults
 
00:47:48.829 --> 00:47:48.839 align:start position:0%
an officer assaults a staff member any
 
00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
of those things this uh division make
 
00:47:53.349 --> 00:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
sure that Justice is actually
 
00:47:56.069 --> 00:47:56.079 align:start position:0%
effectuated in those cases uh we under
 
00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
the switching gears prison rape
 
00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
elimination act audit three sites a year
 
00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
every every year in a three-year cycle
 
00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:06.200 align:start position:0%
and if the department does not meet the
 
00:48:08.309 --> 00:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
uh prison rape elimination act standards
 
00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:11.000 align:start position:0%
we affect uh burn Jag dollars that would
 
00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
come into the state in the form of
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
Federal grant dollars the department has
 
00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
passed our Audits and so the positions
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
dedicated to that are to make sure we
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
continue to do so now are these um
 
00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:24.440 align:start position:0%
mostly group two I mean it's sort of
 
00:48:25.710 --> 00:48:25.720 align:start position:0%
what I would think of as a police
 
00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:27.880 align:start position:0%
detective kind of that's a very fair
 
00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
analogy yes there most of now 15 of them
 
00:48:33.549 --> 00:48:33.559 align:start position:0%
are all certified uh New Hampshire
 
00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections law
 
00:48:38.309 --> 00:48:38.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement great okay very good so I
 
00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:45.160 align:start position:0%
else representative Evo they they
 
00:48:47.829 --> 00:48:47.839 align:start position:0%
prepared a very thorough presentation
 
00:48:50.109 --> 00:48:50.119 align:start position:0%
here and I just wondered in our
 
00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:51.880 align:start position:0%
questioning if there were things that
 
00:48:55.069 --> 00:48:55.079 align:start position:0%
you would like us to know from your
 
00:48:58.069 --> 00:48:58.079 align:start position:0%
presentation I noticed in particular you
 
00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:02.440 align:start position:0%
talked about the um the new prison oh
 
00:49:04.549 --> 00:49:04.559 align:start position:0%
yes we we need to talk about that thank
 
00:49:07.109 --> 00:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
you again we did not want to uh take you
 
00:49:08.829 --> 00:49:08.839 align:start position:0%
through the same presentation we did the
 
00:49:10.349 --> 00:49:10.359 align:start position:0%
last time as it's the same proposed
 
00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:13.160 align:start position:0%
budget I did add additional Pages uh
 
00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
just thinking you may have questions
 
00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
about the proportion Min and so you'll
 
00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
see those on
 
00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
two uh we anticipated the question uh
 
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
which was answered on page three um
 
00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
again page four and five I don't want to
 
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
take you through all of those but again
 
00:49:30.069 --> 00:49:30.079 align:start position:0%
it's to help again follow up on that
 
00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:32.440 align:start position:0%
presentation and give you more detail on
 
00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:35.240 align:start position:0%
page 11 I do want to point out um
 
00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:37.240 align:start position:0%
decisions made by the legislature to
 
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
fund uh additional specialty courts I
 
00:49:42.589 --> 00:49:42.599 align:start position:0%
wanted you to go uh fully informed on
 
00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:44.440 align:start position:0%
what a cost of one probation and prol
 
00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
officer would look like and what those
 
00:49:49.549 --> 00:49:49.559 align:start position:0%
lines um are included if you if you so
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
fund it we would ask that you add or ask
 
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
how many probation prol opers would be
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
necessary and put that complement in our
 
00:49:58.270 --> 00:49:58.280 align:start position:0%
budget if through the legislative
 
00:49:59.950 --> 00:49:59.960 align:start position:0%
budgeting process those specialty courts
 
00:50:02.549 --> 00:50:02.559 align:start position:0%
are funded uh we don't we really want to
 
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
be a good partner but we don't want to
 
00:50:05.309 --> 00:50:05.319 align:start position:0%
be where we were through the
 
00:50:07.789 --> 00:50:07.799 align:start position:0%
implementation of drug courts so that's
 
00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
on page 11 following that page and
 
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
hearing the um questions and I have
 
00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:14.200 align:start position:0%
consulted with the is there a bill
 
00:50:17.829 --> 00:50:17.839 align:start position:0%
number associated with that one my my
 
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
understanding is uh when I was here the
 
00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:21.720 align:start position:0%
last time uh you had shared someone had
 
00:50:23.589 --> 00:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
shared that judge Delker talked about
 
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
the young adult Court happening in
 
00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.079 align:start position:0%
Manchester we do not currently have an
 
00:50:30.430 --> 00:50:30.440 align:start position:0%
additional probation and parol officer
 
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
we have agreed to uh take some portion
 
00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
of an existing officer to support three
 
00:50:37.829 --> 00:50:37.839 align:start position:0%
to five people but that limits the
 
00:50:40.549 --> 00:50:40.559 align:start position:0%
number of people they can have in that
 
00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:42.680 align:start position:0%
um young adult
 
00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:45.160 align:start position:0%
Court I I just don't we don't have the
 
00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
additional resource so is it a bill I
 
00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:51.160 align:start position:0%
don't think it's I haven't it was in the
 
00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
in the judicial Grant presentation yeah
 
00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
presentation there was some discussion
 
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
of it okay
 
00:50:59.589 --> 00:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
just to give you the information you
 
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
need as you navigate any other agencies
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
ask that could affect the department
 
00:51:07.309 --> 00:51:07.319 align:start position:0%
along the lines of if you put pull a
 
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
thread here other things it's just all
 
00:51:12.270 --> 00:51:12.280 align:start position:0%
connected absolutely yeah Melissa can
 
00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
you track that down if it's in somebody
 
00:51:18.030 --> 00:51:18.040 align:start position:0%
else's budget yeah okay yes I can look
 
00:51:19.230 --> 00:51:19.240 align:start position:0%
into that it was brought up by the
 
00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:22.720 align:start position:0%
judicial branch okay very soon okay and
 
00:51:25.789 --> 00:51:25.799 align:start position:0%
then on page 12 and 13 we try to uh give
 
00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
you a nice brief one pager I did uh
 
00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:30.640 align:start position:0%
listen to representative wer um talking
 
00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
about this and he explained it very well
 
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
um but we wanted to make sure you had
 
00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
those resources on page 12 and 11 so the
 
00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
$10 million came out of hb2 as part of
 
00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
the fy2 2425 budget um and we have a the
 
00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:49.400 align:start position:0%
contracted partner who is DLR group is
 
00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh well on time with that project in
 
00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
looking at the physical ground and any
 
00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
geologicals and um also doing what's
 
00:51:59.630 --> 00:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
called programming and trying to
 
00:52:01.870 --> 00:52:01.880 align:start position:0%
understand what we need what we have now
 
00:52:04.309 --> 00:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
um how to think about uh how we put a
 
00:52:06.589 --> 00:52:06.599 align:start position:0%
building on the physical ground in a way
 
00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:08.920 align:start position:0%
to create efficiency we've talked about
 
00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
technology so they've met with every
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
area of the department uh who is part of
 
00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:14.920 align:start position:0%
the operation at the New Hampshire state
 
00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
prison for men and we're going to have
 
00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:19.160 align:start position:0%
some follow-up meetings to see how much
 
00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh square feet they're forecasting right
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
now the $10 million will not get you to
 
00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:26.920 align:start position:0%
bid speec documents it's to do do some
 
00:52:29.309 --> 00:52:29.319 align:start position:0%
base ground work if you turn the page to
 
00:52:33.309 --> 00:52:33.319 align:start position:0%
page uh 13 this $40 million intention
 
00:52:33.319 --> 00:52:34.390 align:start position:0%
page uh 13 this $40 million intention
through

00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:52:36.030 --> 00:52:36.040 align:start position:0%
HB uh
 
00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
2024 uh literally is to do that so that
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
we get the $10 million investment then
 
00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
we get the $40 million investment which
 
00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
is here are the blueprints and here's
 
00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
what it will look like and here's where
 
00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
the Mechanicals and the all of the
 
00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:51.640 align:start position:0%
electricity and everything is I'm
 
00:52:53.349 --> 00:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
working with the Department of Public
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
Works on that process they're putting
 
00:52:57.950 --> 00:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
out what they refer to as an RFI I'm not
 
00:52:59.789 --> 00:52:59.799 align:start position:0%
going to uh pretend to be an expert on
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
what that means for the Department of
 
00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
Public Works I am much more familiar
 
00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:06.280 align:start position:0%
with requests for proposals um but it's
 
00:53:08.910 --> 00:53:08.920 align:start position:0%
to Garner interest from Engineers to let
 
00:53:10.349 --> 00:53:10.359 align:start position:0%
them know that's what the eye is for
 
00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
request for or information yeah uh to
 
00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
Garner interest in this $40 million
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
project let uh um National firms know
 
00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
this is where we're headed and the last
 
00:53:23.109 --> 00:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
conversation I understand things change
 
00:53:25.309 --> 00:53:25.319 align:start position:0%
is that we intended to put out a request
 
00:53:27.710 --> 00:53:27.720 align:start position:0%
for proposal in the month of March I
 
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
have provided um narrative information
 
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
to include in that proposal and continue
 
00:53:34.990 --> 00:53:35.000 align:start position:0%
to work with them on it um so I put the
 
00:53:37.309 --> 00:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
what's included in the $40 million I
 
00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
will tell you the $10 million and the
 
00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
geological shows that we can build back
 
00:53:43.829 --> 00:53:43.839 align:start position:0%
there um and so that's good news there
 
00:53:47.109 --> 00:53:47.119 align:start position:0%
is water just like on any um landscape
 
00:53:48.589 --> 00:53:48.599 align:start position:0%
remember we wasted two years on the
 
00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
women's prison trying to find a location
 
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
that's correct sir and I'm delighted to
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
see bonding authorities so we don't have
 
00:53:56.670 --> 00:53:56.680 align:start position:0%
to put it in the budget it put put in
 
00:53:59.190 --> 00:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
the capital budget so that's we still
 
00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
pay it though no it's it's less yes we
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
have to deal with an hp1 sure right and
 
00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
I I have been uh speaking with the
 
00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
treasurer to let her know where this
 
00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:11.480 align:start position:0%
project is we did just have a
 
00:54:13.870 --> 00:54:13.880 align:start position:0%
conversation this week so uh talked
 
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
about it not needing to be bonded right
 
00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
now because of where we are in the
 
00:54:19.630 --> 00:54:19.640 align:start position:0%
process we won't we won't likely end up
 
00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
with a contract because of the request
 
00:54:24.589 --> 00:54:24.599 align:start position:0%
for proposal process until after June of
 
00:54:27.789 --> 00:54:27.799 align:start position:0%
2024 uh we first further theoretically
 
00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:29.400 align:start position:0%
discussed whether we needed to bond all
 
00:54:32.789 --> 00:54:32.799 align:start position:0%
40 million at once um and we have had
 
00:54:34.750 --> 00:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
some suggestive conversation that they
 
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
could do 20 million in one fiscal year
 
00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
and 20 million in the other and I will
 
00:54:41.589 --> 00:54:41.599 align:start position:0%
defer all that type of expertise to the
 
00:54:45.309 --> 00:54:45.319 align:start position:0%
accounting be 2027 before they even know
 
00:54:47.549 --> 00:54:47.559 align:start position:0%
what's the proposal it's true sir
 
00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
representative evil then representative
 
00:54:52.270 --> 00:54:52.280 align:start position:0%
M um I think I know the answer to this
 
00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
question but I looked at the capital
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
budget proposal from the governor and we
 
00:54:59.349 --> 00:54:59.359 align:start position:0%
didn't there's no additional monies uh
 
00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
for the new prison in the capital budget
 
00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
and I didn't see anything of course in
 
00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
the operate so so at this point um this
 
00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
is all the money that you have this is
 
00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
the money that uh is invested in
 
00:55:15.069 --> 00:55:15.079 align:start position:0%
understanding what it would cost the
 
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire to replace the
 
00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire state prison for men yes
 
00:55:19.829 --> 00:55:19.839 align:start position:0%
we do have some capital budget
 
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
appropriation requests because we still
 
00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
need to keep the infrastructure afloat
 
00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
while we continue this work I I I can't
 
00:55:30.029 --> 00:55:30.039 align:start position:0%
remember it's like12 million or sounds
 
00:55:32.990 --> 00:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
that's quite a bit to just keep things
 
00:55:36.589 --> 00:55:36.599 align:start position:0%
rolling refes Ms thank you Mr chair this
 
00:55:39.630 --> 00:55:39.640 align:start position:0%
is a question for uh my more experienced
 
00:55:43.150 --> 00:55:43.160 align:start position:0%
members of the committee here um if a it
 
00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
where does The Debt Service get charged
 
00:55:48.029 --> 00:55:48.039 align:start position:0%
does that that end up in the treasur bu
 
00:55:50.109 --> 00:55:50.119 align:start position:0%
it's in the treasurer's budget yeah we
 
00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
had her before but she's going to come
 
00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
back at some point okay so it doesn't
 
00:55:58.150 --> 00:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
hit the Department's budget no okay know
 
00:56:01.309 --> 00:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
and yeah we're paying unh's debt in our
 
00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
treasur budget anyways um the key thing
 
00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
with this P new prison is to design it
 
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
like Berlin to be efficient with with uh
 
00:56:17.470 --> 00:56:17.480 align:start position:0%
in the way number of officers needed for
 
00:56:18.829 --> 00:56:18.839 align:start position:0%
per per
 
00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
inmate unlike conquered presence that's
 
00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:25.720 align:start position:0%
correct yeah okay yeah one key factor in
 
00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
every convers ation I have had is we
 
00:56:30.230 --> 00:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
have areas of our department that may be
 
00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:33.720 align:start position:0%
asking for things but if we can't staff
 
00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:35.720 align:start position:0%
a building then the building will never
 
00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
work so we've also continued to share
 
00:56:40.589 --> 00:56:40.599 align:start position:0%
with them what our current Staffing is
 
00:56:43.109 --> 00:56:43.119 align:start position:0%
what our historical staffing has been um
 
00:56:45.069 --> 00:56:45.079 align:start position:0%
and I'll give you a simple example
 
00:56:46.750 --> 00:56:46.760 align:start position:0%
designing a control room in a prison
 
00:56:48.270 --> 00:56:48.280 align:start position:0%
that requires two people and we have
 
00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
never historically been able to put two
 
00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
people and it is an automatic um recipe
 
00:56:57.309 --> 00:56:57.319 align:start position:0%
for failure yeah okay so
 
00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
continue and again so I I anticipated
 
00:57:06.109 --> 00:57:06.119 align:start position:0%
you'd have more uh questions on the
 
00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
formal line by line budget uh didn't
 
00:57:09.829 --> 00:57:09.839 align:start position:0%
want to go through all of these Pages
 
00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:11.960 align:start position:0%
again but wanted to just provide you the
 
00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
same uh similar presentation resources
 
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
so if you have any uh questions from the
 
00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
last time I didn't answer I can
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
certainly uh go through those or any
 
00:57:21.470 --> 00:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
additional questions on the line let's
 
00:57:25.069 --> 00:57:25.079 align:start position:0%
go to the hb2 things yeah I just Melissa
 
00:57:27.789 --> 00:57:27.799 align:start position:0%
could you just get us the information on
 
00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
the bonding if it's in the capital
 
00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
budget just where it is just so we can
 
00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
see the
 
00:57:36.829 --> 00:57:36.839 align:start position:0%
bill just get us the bill that's what I
 
00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
just want to see y I'll email it it's PB
 
00:57:41.470 --> 00:57:41.480 align:start position:0%
2024 yep
 
00:57:44.589 --> 00:57:44.599 align:start position:0%
thanks yes representative
 
00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
Le so going back to the budget on page
 
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
501 dealing with employee development I
 
00:57:54.670 --> 00:57:54.680 align:start position:0%
see that you're reducing that from 15 to
 
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
10 I was just curious
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
of the impact or why it's on page 501
 
00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:02.270 align:start position:0%
of the impact or why it's on page 501
and

00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
502 yeah is that the training
 
00:58:08.510 --> 00:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
line uh thank you representative leean
 
00:58:11.829 --> 00:58:11.839 align:start position:0%
we we reduce that um to meet the target
 
00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:16.559 align:start position:0%
it would mean $155,000 less in
 
00:58:19.789 --> 00:58:19.799 align:start position:0%
um you're talking
 
00:58:22.670 --> 00:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
personnel there you go okay um we just
 
00:58:24.309 --> 00:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
moved them to different accounting units
 
00:58:26.270 --> 00:58:26.280 align:start position:0%
where they made more sense for them to
 
00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
be charged it's not really reducing the
 
00:58:29.789 --> 00:58:29.799 align:start position:0%
support for that
 
00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
division further question yes I'm
 
00:58:35.069 --> 00:58:35.079 align:start position:0%
guessing these were vacant positions
 
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
right or
 
00:58:40.589 --> 00:58:40.599 align:start position:0%
no no not necessarily I mean I'm not
 
00:58:41.710 --> 00:58:41.720 align:start position:0%
sure looking at this but it's not
 
00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily they were vacant they just
 
00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
some of them went to the HR counting
 
00:58:47.910 --> 00:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
unit and some of them went to um 7101
 
00:58:49.829 --> 00:58:49.839 align:start position:0%
all right representative Lehman thanks
 
00:58:52.270 --> 00:58:52.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman so I think we probably all
 
00:58:54.910 --> 00:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
know that you are the greatest Grabber
 
00:58:58.710 --> 00:58:58.720 align:start position:0%
of General funds of of all uh agencies
 
00:59:00.829 --> 00:59:00.839 align:start position:0%
and government at least in state
 
00:59:04.990 --> 00:59:05.000 align:start position:0%
government here and I appreciate uh you
 
00:59:06.670 --> 00:59:06.680 align:start position:0%
holding the line I looked at the of
 
00:59:09.029 --> 00:59:09.039 align:start position:0%
course the last page 507 the same number
 
00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
of employees looks like you're knocking
 
00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:14.200 align:start position:0%
things down again but of course my
 
00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
concern uh that you do have that
 
00:59:18.990 --> 00:59:19.000 align:start position:0%
authority to go to fiscal if you exceed
 
00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
your expenses to ask for additional
 
00:59:23.950 --> 00:59:23.960 align:start position:0%
funding you feel pretty confident that
 
00:59:25.549 --> 00:59:25.559 align:start position:0%
you've got enough money here so you
 
00:59:29.589 --> 00:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
don't have to come to fiscal very often
 
00:59:32.829 --> 00:59:32.839 align:start position:0%
or representative lean I appreciate that
 
00:59:35.470 --> 00:59:35.480 align:start position:0%
and I I think it would especially in the
 
00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:37.720 align:start position:0%
health care side I think that's always a
 
00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
challenge and I'll just give you a for
 
00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:41.640 align:start position:0%
example I have a person uh we have an
 
00:59:44.069 --> 00:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
inmate who just came in who is costing
 
00:59:47.549 --> 00:59:47.559 align:start position:0%
us $20,000 a month uh in Pharmaceuticals
 
00:59:48.750 --> 00:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
and so I'm looking at what their
 
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
sentence structure is I'm looking at
 
00:59:52.270 --> 00:59:52.280 align:start position:0%
what their crimes are and trying to
 
00:59:54.029 --> 00:59:54.039 align:start position:0%
decide if it's appropriate for medical
 
00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
Parole in this instance uh the amount of
 
00:59:58.950 --> 00:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
time they've been incarcerated and their
 
01:00:00.670 --> 01:00:00.680 align:start position:0%
crime type I can't in good conscience
 
01:00:03.109 --> 01:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
sign a medical parole and put the victim
 
01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:05.640 align:start position:0%
of that person's crime through a medical
 
01:00:08.029 --> 01:00:08.039 align:start position:0%
parole so I am making a conscious
 
01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:09.720 align:start position:0%
decision balanced with what I just
 
01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
stated that it's going to cost us
 
01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:13.589 align:start position:0%
stated that it's going to cost us
$20,000

01:00:13.589 --> 01:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
$20,000
 
01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
Mon and again nice nice handout very
 
01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
well put together as usual thanks thanks
 
01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:22.720 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you all right so um
 
01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:24.280 align:start position:0%
should we look at the house bill too
 
01:00:27.069 --> 01:00:27.079 align:start position:0%
briefly here there's looks like two
 
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
items or something I did uh put those on
 
01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
page uh nine and 10 of my presentation
 
01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
if it's easier um and cited the pages
 
01:00:39.390 --> 01:00:39.400 align:start position:0%
from the the bill
 
01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
the first footnote is again about
 
01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
overtime and adds the piece we spoke
 
01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
about last time and this time that if
 
01:00:49.549 --> 01:00:49.559 align:start position:0%
the historical strategy uh didn't meet
 
01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
the measure to fund overtime we would
 
01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
come before fiscal and and then uh so on
 
01:00:56.430 --> 01:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
to governor and councel the second item
 
01:00:58.510 --> 01:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
is a cleanup item because uh through
 
01:01:01.309 --> 01:01:01.319 align:start position:0%
legislative process we've added a
 
01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
unclassified we took a classified Deputy
 
01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:05.839 align:start position:0%
Ward and made it an unclassified Deputy
 
01:01:08.309 --> 01:01:08.319 align:start position:0%
Warden and we have Deputy directors who
 
01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
are unclassified so just fixing that
 
01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
2187 and then are these in the
 
01:01:16.589 --> 01:01:16.599 align:start position:0%
Commissioner's Office the first section
 
01:01:19.150 --> 01:01:19.160 align:start position:0%
of the budget the different positions
 
01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
are throughout different accounting
 
01:01:22.829 --> 01:01:22.839 align:start position:0%
units depending on who they support so
 
01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
for example if there's a deputy director
 
01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
of rehabilit ative Services which there
 
01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
is they're under that accounting unit as
 
01:01:32.510 --> 01:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
a CL unclassified
 
01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
employee and the deputy warden for
 
01:01:36.270 --> 01:01:36.280 align:start position:0%
example will be under the New Hampshire
 
01:01:37.870 --> 01:01:37.880 align:start position:0%
State prison's accounting unit and
 
01:01:39.309 --> 01:01:39.319 align:start position:0%
you'll see a change in number of
 
01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
classified and unclassified it'll go
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
from one to one
 
01:01:49.309 --> 01:01:49.319 align:start position:0%
I the uh other request was around the
 
01:01:51.069 --> 01:01:51.079 align:start position:0%
industry's inventory account talking
 
01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
about those permanent positions and uh
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
fixing uh what we learned is they are
 
01:01:58.670 --> 01:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
being charged to that fund but the
 
01:02:01.390 --> 01:02:01.400 align:start position:0%
statutes not allow aligned to that and
 
01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
we we identified that as an area in
 
01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
which we needed to bring forward for
 
01:02:09.390 --> 01:02:09.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:13.549 --> 01:02:13.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:16.269 --> 01:02:16.279 align:start position:0%
yes I see we don't want the general fund
 
01:02:19.269 --> 01:02:19.279 align:start position:0%
to pay for those positions
 
01:02:23.470 --> 01:02:23.480 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions about
 
01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
this all right represent wer I'm
 
01:02:29.309 --> 01:02:29.319 align:start position:0%
impressed at how well prepared you are
 
01:02:30.910 --> 01:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you sir I
 
01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:32.430 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you sir I
appreciate

01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:32.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
that thank you sir you so we can either
 
01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
we can either talk to the parole board
 
01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
early or we can wait 15 minutes what do
 
01:02:45.269 --> 01:02:45.279 align:start position:0%
you I think I see him here so
 
01:02:49.309 --> 01:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
here so is that going to break our uh
 
01:02:51.670 --> 01:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
procedures no we'll be okay all right I
 
01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
me there there're a sub agency of
 
01:02:56.269 --> 01:02:56.279 align:start position:0%
Department of Correction so I think they
 
01:02:58.109 --> 01:02:58.119 align:start position:0%
there so we're good they're
 
01:03:01.309 --> 01:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
administratively attached okay and that
 
01:03:02.789 --> 01:03:02.799 align:start position:0%
might give us a little more time for
 
01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
military right so all right thank you
 
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
very much
 
01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner all right parl board which
 
01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
is on I think it's just the next page
 
01:03:54.109 --> 01:03:54.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:56.990 --> 01:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
thank you this almost thicker than the
 
01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.630 align:start position:0%
thank you this almost thicker than the
other

01:03:58.630 --> 01:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:04:03.349 --> 01:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:08.589 --> 01:04:08.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:11.230 --> 01:04:11.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
mck good morning chair members of the
 
01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name is Roger Phillips
 
01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
and I'm a chairperson of the Adult
 
01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:19.670 align:start position:0%
and I'm a chairperson of the Adult
Parole

01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
Parole
 
01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
Board excuse
 
01:04:26.789 --> 01:04:26.799 align:start position:0%
me the um um in order to meet the
 
01:04:30.510 --> 01:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
governor's Target budget
 
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:38.680 align:start position:0%
goal uh we had
 
01:04:41.950 --> 01:04:41.960 align:start position:0%
to U in order to accomplish that we had
 
01:04:46.470 --> 01:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
to eliminate a a staff member um um and
 
01:04:48.430 --> 01:04:48.440 align:start position:0%
so we're here today asking for
 
01:04:51.150 --> 01:04:51.160 align:start position:0%
reinstatement of that as you're probably
 
01:04:55.789 --> 01:04:55.799 align:start position:0%
aware where and I I understand the the
 
01:04:58.750 --> 01:04:58.760 align:start position:0%
problems associated with with the
 
01:05:00.789 --> 01:05:00.799 align:start position:0%
revenue side of the budget that the
 
01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire is is facing uh
 
01:05:07.390 --> 01:05:07.400 align:start position:0%
on the other hand it can affect a a
 
01:05:09.870 --> 01:05:09.880 align:start position:0%
small Department like ours more
 
01:05:14.670 --> 01:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
drastically than it will a larger U
 
01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
department so are you saying one of the
 
01:05:19.470 --> 01:05:19.480 align:start position:0%
four is is unfunded is that
 
01:05:27.349 --> 01:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:28.640 align:start position:0%
and although
 
01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
in we had in November asked for that to
 
01:05:36.789 --> 01:05:36.799 align:start position:0%
be included it it didn't make the
 
01:05:40.349 --> 01:05:40.359 align:start position:0%
trailer budget either um is this a
 
01:05:42.789 --> 01:05:42.799 align:start position:0%
vacant position or it is not a vacant
 
01:05:46.069 --> 01:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
position it is is one that is filled now
 
01:05:52.829 --> 01:05:52.839 align:start position:0%
and one obviously that we rely upon um
 
01:06:00.430 --> 01:06:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:03.390 --> 01:06:03.400 align:start position:0%
the challenges of parole and parole
 
01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:05.839 align:start position:0%
revation are no different now than they
 
01:06:10.510 --> 01:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
were a few years ago um the the there
 
01:06:15.069 --> 01:06:15.079 align:start position:0%
are some uh exciting things in in the
 
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
sense that in
 
01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
communities people now have an
 
01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go into a a sober house
 
01:06:24.990 --> 01:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
when they're uh when they're paring from
 
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.870 align:start position:0%
when they're uh when they're paring from
a

01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:06:33.029 --> 01:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
um uh the state's prison and um I do not
 
01:06:35.589 --> 01:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
know what will happen of
 
01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
course on the federal side in the event
 
01:06:45.029 --> 01:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
that the that Medicaid is changed
 
01:06:50.109 --> 01:06:50.119 align:start position:0%
because uh those who those inmates who
 
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
are released and on parole uh more often
 
01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
than not are on Medicare in order to get
 
01:06:58.950 --> 01:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
the treatment that they need both
 
01:07:02.349 --> 01:07:02.359 align:start position:0%
medical and for substance
 
01:07:05.710 --> 01:07:05.720 align:start position:0%
abuse would you like to with me today is
 
01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
Jay Mackey who's director of
 
01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
operations uh who who could address
 
01:07:14.549 --> 01:07:14.559 align:start position:0%
other we tried to put together in our
 
01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
our our packet what
 
01:07:22.990 --> 01:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
um information concerning our our our
 
01:07:25.789 --> 01:07:25.799 align:start position:0%
function and and what we do and how
 
01:07:29.470 --> 01:07:29.480 align:start position:0%
we're hopefully moving uh to the stage
 
01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
of of evidence-based decision making um
 
01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
and the federal government through the
 
01:07:40.150 --> 01:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
the department of of Corrections is and
 
01:07:44.069 --> 01:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
we are now on the list uh as a state as
 
01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
the third state to receive it this this
 
01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
coming year U but as a result board
 
01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
members are going to have to be be
 
01:07:55.950 --> 01:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
trained in that U and the I idea of
 
01:07:59.190 --> 01:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
evidence-based decision making is that
 
01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
all members are looking at the same
 
01:08:06.190 --> 01:08:06.200 align:start position:0%
materials the eight or so domains that
 
01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
are that I needed and that any board
 
01:08:13.029 --> 01:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
member would come to the same decision
 
01:08:16.349 --> 01:08:16.359 align:start position:0%
uh face with with this information so
 
01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully the my bias in whatever
 
01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
fashion I'm I don't think I have doesn't
 
01:08:27.030 --> 01:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
raise its its ugly head as we we do that
 
01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
but it it does require uh us to at least
 
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
I I would hope that we had an audit uh
 
01:08:38.229 --> 01:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
up you know in in
 
01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
2019 uh I I came on the board that year
 
01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh as a
 
01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
member and
 
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
um there have been substantial changes
 
01:08:53.910 --> 01:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
made in the in the parole office and I I
 
01:08:58.590 --> 01:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
think we more efficient we now are at
 
01:09:00.709 --> 01:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
least we're working with laptop
 
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
computers and have digital packets as
 
01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:07.400 align:start position:0%
opposed to the paper that we had years
 
01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:13.159 align:start position:0%
ago um but the the the main reason we
 
01:09:17.149 --> 01:09:17.159 align:start position:0%
want to to do it on the the the next to
 
01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
last page of of of the packet in
 
01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
indicates activity in
 
01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
2004 20 24 I wanted want you to
 
01:09:30.789 --> 01:09:30.799 align:start position:0%
understand that that's only a 9month
 
01:09:33.789 --> 01:09:33.799 align:start position:0%
version the that isn't up to date just
 
01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
for your information the the governor
 
01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
did put in your $10,000 for out of state
 
01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:40.669 align:start position:0%
did put in your $10,000 for out of state
travel

01:09:40.669 --> 01:09:40.679 align:start position:0%
travel
 
01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
oh in in your budget all right so yeah
 
01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
so that's already
 
01:09:52.349 --> 01:09:52.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
okay yes represent thank you m thank you
 
01:10:03.870 --> 01:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for coming in um
 
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
the one position that is um proposed to
 
01:10:08.590 --> 01:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
be eliminated which one is that I'm
 
01:10:10.830 --> 01:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
looking at your your organization chart
 
01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
on page
 
01:10:16.430 --> 01:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
three um I I can answer that so I had
 
01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
submitted two organizational charts okay
 
01:10:21.870 --> 01:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
um one with and one without that
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
position that so the first one is the
 
01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
one with the position position and it is
 
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
the secretary
 
01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
2 okay position that position as we said
 
01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
is currently filled it is mainly
 
01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
responsible for the scheduling of peole
 
01:10:39.189 --> 01:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
hearings as well as um vetting all the
 
01:10:41.550 --> 01:10:41.560 align:start position:0%
plans when when a parole Le is when an
 
01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
inmate is approved for parole we then
 
01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:47.320 align:start position:0%
have to send out their uh housing plan
 
01:10:49.149 --> 01:10:49.159 align:start position:0%
to the doc Field Services to be
 
01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
investigated prior to their
 
01:10:54.189 --> 01:10:54.199 align:start position:0%
release that position that one of her
 
01:10:56.030 --> 01:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
main functions is is vetting all those
 
01:10:57.669 --> 01:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
housing plans sending them out to field
 
01:11:02.709 --> 01:11:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:06.520 align:start position:0%
in we we currently have six staff
 
01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
including myself in the office five
 
01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:10.840 align:start position:0%
full-time one
 
01:11:13.709 --> 01:11:13.719 align:start position:0%
part-time and we originally looked at
 
01:11:16.709 --> 01:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
cutting the part-time position but that
 
01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't bring us down we could get
 
01:11:20.189 --> 01:11:20.199 align:start position:0%
under the target number but we would
 
01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
have no money except for salaries so we
 
01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
had to choose a full-time position
 
01:11:28.149 --> 01:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
to do and that basically Cuts about 17%
 
01:11:28.990 --> 01:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
of our
 
01:11:32.149 --> 01:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
Workforce as you know chair Philip said
 
01:11:34.430 --> 01:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
it it's where much smaller
 
01:11:37.149 --> 01:11:37.159 align:start position:0%
agency now did you get more you got more
 
01:11:42.270 --> 01:11:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:46.149 --> 01:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
there that also board members stiens oh
 
01:11:49.950 --> 01:11:49.960 align:start position:0%
I see yes their annual stiens
 
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
gotcha yeah which we changed I guess
 
01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
last time a little bit yeah okay roughly
 
01:11:58.750 --> 01:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
how much of that is is the
 
01:12:02.590 --> 01:12:02.600 align:start position:0%
board uh 40 70
 
01:12:04.910 --> 01:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
130 oh so it's almost all of the board
 
01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
almost all of it yeah oh
 
01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
okay the chairperson gets
 
01:12:12.430 --> 01:12:12.440 align:start position:0%
40,000 they I mean the vice chairperson
 
01:12:13.790 --> 01:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
gets 40,000 the other three board
 
01:12:17.470 --> 01:12:17.480 align:start position:0%
members get 30,000 annually gotcha okay
 
01:12:19.790 --> 01:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
and how often does the board
 
01:12:23.669 --> 01:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
meet um most every Tuesday is a
 
01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
revocation day and most every Thursday
 
01:12:30.030 --> 01:12:30.040 align:start position:0%
uh are parole days and we also have an
 
01:12:31.870 --> 01:12:31.880 align:start position:0%
administrated meeting on the fourth
 
01:12:33.550 --> 01:12:33.560 align:start position:0%
Friday of every
 
01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
month but it's not the hearing days
 
01:12:37.830 --> 01:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of homework the
 
01:12:40.350 --> 01:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
preparation that's right yeah yeah I
 
01:12:45.910 --> 01:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
before yes 90 to 100 Pages for plle
 
01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
when I started the cardboard cart would
 
01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
be delivered to the front porch of my
 
01:13:04.629 --> 01:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
house of of just paper yeah and would'
 
01:13:06.510 --> 01:13:06.520 align:start position:0%
have to go through that over the the
 
01:13:09.470 --> 01:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
weekend to get ready for the either the
 
01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:15.910 --> 01:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
V you can ask all right representative
 
01:13:19.470 --> 01:13:19.480 align:start position:0%
evil on your chart which is the position
 
01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
that you cut it would be the page before
 
01:13:25.870 --> 01:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
that the uh secretary 2
 
01:13:28.950 --> 01:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:30.510 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:13:30.510 --> 01:13:30.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:13:33.629 --> 01:13:33.639 align:start position:0%
gotcha and then in the very last page of
 
01:13:36.629 --> 01:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
your presentation if that was
 
01:13:39.149 --> 01:13:39.159 align:start position:0%
reinstated that is what she would is
 
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
expected to
 
01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
um her with her salary and benefits over
 
01:13:46.270 --> 01:13:46.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 26 and 27
 
01:13:48.510 --> 01:13:48.520 align:start position:0%
okay in other words that is the amount
 
01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:50.070 align:start position:0%
okay in other words that is the amount
we're

01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
seeking so
 
01:13:55.709 --> 01:13:55.719 align:start position:0%
just if you lose that person
 
01:13:58.950 --> 01:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
does that mean that the number of folks
 
01:14:01.510 --> 01:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
that might be eligible for parole it
 
01:14:04.950 --> 01:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
just slows down the whole process or if
 
01:14:07.189 --> 01:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
you have people that
 
01:14:09.990 --> 01:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
are supposed to come off or you know
 
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
they're being they're they're having a
 
01:14:13.229 --> 01:14:13.239 align:start position:0%
hearing to see if they need to go back
 
01:14:15.470 --> 01:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
to jail I mean does the whole Pro does
 
01:14:17.629 --> 01:14:17.639 align:start position:0%
the whole process really slow down
 
01:14:19.709 --> 01:14:19.719 align:start position:0%
because you don't have the support staff
 
01:14:22.110 --> 01:14:22.120 align:start position:0%
it it will slow down uh recently we
 
01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
we've actually been running without a
 
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
sta one staff member office over the
 
01:14:28.709 --> 01:14:28.719 align:start position:0%
last few months because of multiple
 
01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
issues that actual the secretary 2 went
 
01:14:33.189 --> 01:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
out on medical leave for about a month
 
01:14:34.950 --> 01:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
and right when she came back I went out
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
I'm just returning from back surgery
 
01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:39.280 align:start position:0%
myself um when we have people go on
 
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
vacations and miss some time we're able
 
01:14:43.310 --> 01:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
to to figure it out but if we lose that
 
01:14:46.669 --> 01:14:46.679 align:start position:0%
staff member it you know um it will slow
 
01:14:48.910 --> 01:14:48.920 align:start position:0%
our process down a bit I mean I guess
 
01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
I'm just thinking about it in terms of
 
01:14:54.149 --> 01:14:54.159 align:start position:0%
administrative administration of justice
 
01:14:58.430 --> 01:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
and also if if you look at the cost of
 
01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
incarceration if you're slowing down the
 
01:15:04.270 --> 01:15:04.280 align:start position:0%
number of people that can go on
 
01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
parole it keeps those numbers up if they
 
01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
stay incarcerated longer then they might
 
01:15:13.070 --> 01:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
otherwise have to because they weren't
 
01:15:15.229 --> 01:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
able to you weren't able to get through
 
01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
the parole process as quickly as we do
 
01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
our very best to make certain right I'm
 
01:15:21.709 --> 01:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
sure you do a PE hearing before I'm not
 
01:15:24.510 --> 01:15:24.520 align:start position:0%
slamming you I'm just trying to to to
 
01:15:28.750 --> 01:15:28.760 align:start position:0%
say that without adequate Staffing a lot
 
01:15:33.110 --> 01:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
of that gums up yes well that's right
 
01:15:35.790 --> 01:15:35.800 align:start position:0%
especially in a small office where if
 
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
someone is ill or out and these folks
 
01:15:41.669 --> 01:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
are trying to do more than just one
 
01:15:43.270 --> 01:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
function they they'll step into the
 
01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
shoes of someone else but without that
 
01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
extra person that's going to be very
 
01:15:50.430 --> 01:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
difficult well and conversely if
 
01:15:52.830 --> 01:15:52.840 align:start position:0%
somebody shouldn't be on parole anymore
 
01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
you want to get them off the streets
 
01:15:57.310 --> 01:15:57.320 align:start position:0%
if they should be
 
01:16:01.950 --> 01:16:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
welcome represent
 
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
W so when you went from that box full of
 
01:16:09.870 --> 01:16:09.880 align:start position:0%
paperwork that somebody had to make
 
01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
copies of to computer how much did that
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
save in office time and and preparation
 
01:16:20.590 --> 01:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
not only for what not it didn't save
 
01:16:22.830 --> 01:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
your preparation but the office should
 
01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
have been saved a lot of preparation
 
01:16:27.870 --> 01:16:27.880 align:start position:0%
time from boxing it up copying it all
 
01:16:29.629 --> 01:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
and make sure everybody got
 
01:16:32.149 --> 01:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
delivered that's true but there's also
 
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
one other thing that's happened the the
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
parole office for years has relied on
 
01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
paper Y and all of this has to be
 
01:16:46.070 --> 01:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
scanned in now so we have records if we
 
01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
lose a staff member like that how are we
 
01:16:51.070 --> 01:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
ever going to
 
01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
get up to date and scanning the things
 
01:16:57.270 --> 01:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
that that that should be done um and
 
01:16:59.950 --> 01:16:59.960 align:start position:0%
then it will they'll be scanned and into
 
01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
file hold and that was my hope is that
 
01:17:06.030 --> 01:17:06.040 align:start position:0%
we would be able to start because we
 
01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
still have paper file cabinets these
 
01:17:10.830 --> 01:17:10.840 align:start position:0%
things have to be scanned and and put in
 
01:17:13.709 --> 01:17:13.719 align:start position:0%
and um I'm really concerned about that
 
01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
and I think it's essential that we have
 
01:17:18.189 --> 01:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
that person available so that could be
 
01:17:19.870 --> 01:17:19.880 align:start position:0%
accomplished yeah the scanning is almost
 
01:17:23.470 --> 01:17:23.480 align:start position:0%
as as timely as as the cop paper copying
 
01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
are your records duplicated at the
 
01:17:29.669 --> 01:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections no no well
 
01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
there we have a crossover between the
 
01:17:34.430 --> 01:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
two because Department of Corrections do
 
01:17:37.669 --> 01:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
supervise the PRS of the community but
 
01:17:39.310 --> 01:17:39.320 align:start position:0%
what we have right now which is still an
 
01:17:42.149 --> 01:17:42.159 align:start position:0%
archaic system is we have the green file
 
01:17:43.550 --> 01:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
that we produce when somebody goes up
 
01:17:45.709 --> 01:17:45.719 align:start position:0%
for a parole hearing they then when once
 
01:17:47.669 --> 01:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
they're approved for parole and they go
 
01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
out into parole that green file gets
 
01:17:51.430 --> 01:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
sent to that district office for that
 
01:17:54.030 --> 01:17:54.040 align:start position:0%
parole officer and then if and then any
 
01:17:56.110 --> 01:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
supervision stuff that needs to be done
 
01:17:58.030 --> 01:17:58.040 align:start position:0%
is put in that file and if they come
 
01:17:59.590 --> 01:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
back to the prison for revocation that
 
01:18:02.070 --> 01:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
green file gets sent back to us it's a
 
01:18:03.790 --> 01:18:03.800 align:start position:0%
whole back and forth thing so yes some
 
01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
of the files but
 
01:18:09.070 --> 01:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
we our parole board files are separate
 
01:18:13.229 --> 01:18:13.239 align:start position:0%
from the doc files I see but but all
 
01:18:16.750 --> 01:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
this green file thing is paper still yes
 
01:18:18.870 --> 01:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
I see which is we we've been talking
 
01:18:21.070 --> 01:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
about switching it over kind of trying
 
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
to get into the process of switching it
 
01:18:25.270 --> 01:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
all over all our interstate land people
 
01:18:28.750 --> 01:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
that are now Ono in other states have
 
01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
started to be scanned into the the
 
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
database M okay all right other
 
01:18:39.709 --> 01:18:39.719 align:start position:0%
questions no yes represent a m thank you
 
01:18:42.629 --> 01:18:42.639 align:start position:0%
if I'm I'm I'm looking at your um your
 
01:18:45.709 --> 01:18:45.719 align:start position:0%
your cover letter in your in your packet
 
01:18:49.110 --> 01:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
um and it it it it looks like this
 
01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
additional staff person was a direct
 
01:18:54.790 --> 01:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
result of the LBA audit yes and the
 
01:18:57.910 --> 01:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
recommendations included in there um so
 
01:19:00.070 --> 01:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that and I think you say
 
01:19:02.790 --> 01:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
this in your in your letter but if that
 
01:19:04.030 --> 01:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
position is
 
01:19:07.470 --> 01:19:07.480 align:start position:0%
eliminated you would run the risk of uh
 
01:19:10.110 --> 01:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
kind of running a running a foul of uh
 
01:19:13.350 --> 01:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
the audit the audit results of of of the
 
01:19:15.790 --> 01:19:15.800 align:start position:0%
recommendations that's right we're
 
01:19:17.430 --> 01:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
finally getting to that point where we
 
01:19:19.830 --> 01:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
can be more efficient and do things well
 
01:19:22.709 --> 01:19:22.719 align:start position:0%
and that y okay I think it would have an
 
01:19:25.350 --> 01:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
adverse impact okay thank you
 
01:19:28.229 --> 01:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
so for me just looking at your or chart
 
01:19:30.750 --> 01:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
if I were eliminating one position it
 
01:19:31.790 --> 01:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
would be the
 
01:19:34.030 --> 01:19:34.040 align:start position:0%
supervisor right because you have two
 
01:19:37.229 --> 01:19:37.239 align:start position:0%
chiefs for four Indians here right and
 
01:19:40.350 --> 01:19:40.360 align:start position:0%
so couldn't the director supervise
 
01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:41.750 align:start position:0%
so couldn't the director supervise
everybody

01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
01:19:44.590 --> 01:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
else that that was the position that was
 
01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
created by the audit um the supervisor
 
01:19:52.189 --> 01:19:52.199 align:start position:0%
position the that person is currently in
 
01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
charge of running all the revocation
 
01:19:56.990 --> 01:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
hearings M if we were to lose that that
 
01:20:00.910 --> 01:20:00.920 align:start position:0%
position with all of the so we chose to
 
01:20:02.950 --> 01:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
eliminate the position that had the the
 
01:20:04.709 --> 01:20:04.719 align:start position:0%
lowest labor grade with the least amount
 
01:20:07.149 --> 01:20:07.159 align:start position:0%
of responsibilities so the office could
 
01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
still function if we are unable to get
 
01:20:12.669 --> 01:20:12.679 align:start position:0%
it back it would it would be taking on a
 
01:20:14.990 --> 01:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
lot less if we remove the
 
01:20:17.470 --> 01:20:17.480 align:start position:0%
supervisor and now we have to take those
 
01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
high level duties to dispers amongst
 
01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
myself or other people at a lower level
 
01:20:25.830 --> 01:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
it it it'll so saying that person is
 
01:20:28.709 --> 01:20:28.719 align:start position:0%
really more in parallel with you right
 
01:20:30.149 --> 01:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
you're doing the parole hearings and
 
01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
they're doing the rication hearings
 
01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
she's doing the rication hearings the
 
01:20:34.669 --> 01:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
parole hearings are done by the case
 
01:20:38.830 --> 01:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
manager y I'm overseeing everything okay
 
01:20:41.550 --> 01:20:41.560 align:start position:0%
but I'm also responsible for you know
 
01:20:43.350 --> 01:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
getting all the inmates back that are in
 
01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:44.719 align:start position:0%
uh revocations tracking them when
 
01:20:47.070 --> 01:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
they're out of state and coming back as
 
01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
well as obviously so that person is not
 
01:20:51.189 --> 01:20:51.199 align:start position:0%
really supervising all other she does
 
01:20:52.629 --> 01:20:52.639 align:start position:0%
she does she does some of the the
 
01:20:56.669 --> 01:20:56.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:58.229 --> 01:20:58.239 align:start position:0%
all right well maybe we have to talk
 
01:21:01.270 --> 01:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
about that okay thank you other
 
01:21:04.110 --> 01:21:04.120 align:start position:0%
questions no don't see any thank you
 
01:21:09.070 --> 01:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
very much thank you all right so is
 
01:21:12.030 --> 01:21:12.040 align:start position:0%
the since we're going what take a
 
01:21:14.629 --> 01:21:14.639 align:start position:0%
break five minutes
 
01:21:18.430 --> 01:21:18.440 align:start position:0%
okay we we have almost 10 minutes nine
 
01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:23.550 align:start position:0%
okay we we have almost 10 minutes nine

Hampshire when you want to take a look
 
01:33:40.390 --> 01:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
at our agency budget over 80% of our
 
01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
state operating but over 80% of our
 
01:33:47.590 --> 01:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
operating budget is federal funds 177%
 
01:33:49.550 --> 01:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
of our federal of our state operating
 
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
budget is General funds um we were able
 
01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
to meet the governor's targeted budget
 
01:33:58.870 --> 01:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
request that came at a a slight cost to
 
01:34:00.510 --> 01:34:00.520 align:start position:0%
our military Affairs our National Guard
 
01:34:02.189 --> 01:34:02.199 align:start position:0%
portfolio which affected sort of our
 
01:34:04.390 --> 01:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
Armory portfolio which we have over 20
 
01:34:06.149 --> 01:34:06.159 align:start position:0%

state active duty
 
01:34:09.950 --> 01:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
account we also took limited hits to our
 
01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
veteran service portfolio which affected
 
01:34:13.830 --> 01:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
our Division of Community Based military
 
01:34:17.109 --> 01:34:17.119 align:start position:0%

build language there was no impact to
 
01:34:22.470 --> 01:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
the Department of military Affairs and
 
01:34:24.790 --> 01:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
veteran services
 
01:34:27.669 --> 01:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
current vacancies we currently have 19
 
01:34:29.270 --> 01:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
vacancies within the department of
 
01:34:31.270 --> 01:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
military Affairs and veteran
 
01:34:34.709 --> 01:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
services 18 of those positions are
 
01:34:37.149 --> 01:34:37.159 align:start position:0%
either 100% federally reimbursed or
 
01:34:40.149 --> 01:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
generally have a 75 Federal 25% general
 
01:34:41.470 --> 01:34:41.480 align:start position:0%
fund cost
 
01:34:44.669 --> 01:34:44.679 align:start position:0%
share we only have one
 
01:34:47.109 --> 01:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
part-time vacant position that is
 
01:34:49.390 --> 01:34:49.400 align:start position:0%
generally funded and it was an
 
01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:51.709 align:start position:0%
generally funded and it was an
administrative

01:34:51.709 --> 01:34:51.719 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
01:34:53.830 --> 01:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
position when you look at the challenges
 
01:34:55.590 --> 01:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
face in this budget we can live within
 
01:34:57.629 --> 01:34:57.639 align:start position:0%
our means in the T Governor's targeted
 
01:35:00.149 --> 01:35:00.159 align:start position:0%
request um we are not requesting any
 
01:35:02.550 --> 01:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
additional funds but I would offer to
 
01:35:03.990 --> 01:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
you that the challenge in this fiscal
 
01:35:06.669 --> 01:35:06.679 align:start position:0%
environment also is at the federal level
 
01:35:08.390 --> 01:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
for example through executive voters
 
01:35:10.430 --> 01:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with an 8% reduction in
 
01:35:12.950 --> 01:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
the federal civilian Workforce that
 
01:35:14.430 --> 01:35:14.440 align:start position:0%
affects our federal civilians which
 
01:35:15.390 --> 01:35:15.400 align:start position:0%
support the men and women in the
 
01:35:18.030 --> 01:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire National Guard uh today or
 
01:35:20.070 --> 01:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
next Monday we will start the deferral
 
01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh the layoff of uh people have signed
 
01:35:25.070 --> 01:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
up for deferred um res ation and we're
 
01:35:26.950 --> 01:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
currently awaiting additional guidance
 
01:35:28.510 --> 01:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
on what to do with our federal civilian
 
01:35:29.910 --> 01:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
probationary employees who have been
 
01:35:32.109 --> 01:35:32.119 align:start position:0%
employed for less than a year so within
 
01:35:33.669 --> 01:35:33.679 align:start position:0%
our Workforce there's a lot of turmoil
 
01:35:36.109 --> 01:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
on con a lot of turmoil on friction and
 
01:35:39.550 --> 01:35:39.560 align:start position:0%
so of those 19 vacancies of which 18 or
 
01:35:42.350 --> 01:35:42.360 align:start position:0%
100% generally funded or 75 25 uh
 
01:35:44.430 --> 01:35:44.440 align:start position:0%
federal state cost year we really need
 
01:35:46.390 --> 01:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
those positions they all fund and
 
01:35:47.550 --> 01:35:47.560 align:start position:0%
support the men and women in the
 
01:35:49.590 --> 01:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire National Guard none of them
 
01:35:50.990 --> 01:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
are currently in line with our veteran
 
01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:52.270 align:start position:0%
are currently in line with our veteran
service

01:35:52.270 --> 01:35:52.280 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:35:54.430 --> 01:35:54.440 align:start position:0%
portfolio subject your questions that's
 
01:35:56.910 --> 01:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
all I have all
 
01:36:00.270 --> 01:36:00.280 align:start position:0%
right um let's uh let's look at this
 
01:36:05.149 --> 01:36:05.159 align:start position:0%
page 206 um so it looks like you're
 
01:36:05.159 --> 01:36:07.470 align:start position:0%
page 206 um so it looks like you're
spending

01:36:07.470 --> 01:36:07.480 align:start position:0%
spending
 
01:36:11.990 --> 01:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
um you actually spent in turn in
 
01:36:15.430 --> 01:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
2024 one and a. half million of General
 
01:36:19.990 --> 01:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
funds but um you you want that to go up
 
01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:20.950 align:start position:0%
funds but um you you want that to go up
by

01:36:20.950 --> 01:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:36:24.310 --> 01:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
about uh looks like 800,000
 
01:36:27.270 --> 01:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:31.629 --> 01:36:31.639 align:start position:0%
that so were there so is that the 19 the
 
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
general fund part of those 19 positions
 
01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
or is it something
 
01:36:39.070 --> 01:36:39.080 align:start position:0%
else can
 
01:36:42.390 --> 01:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh vacant position it uh sir was mostly
 
01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:43.310 align:start position:0%
uh vacant position it uh sir was mostly
vacant

01:36:43.310 --> 01:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
vacant
 
01:36:47.669 --> 01:36:47.679 align:start position:0%
positions okay so are they still vacant
 
01:36:47.679 --> 01:36:49.109 align:start position:0%
positions okay so are they still vacant
or

01:36:49.109 --> 01:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:36:53.629 --> 01:36:53.639 align:start position:0%
not yes okay but you want to hire them
 
01:36:56.709 --> 01:36:56.719 align:start position:0%
is that the idea there's airing yes the
 
01:36:58.270 --> 01:36:58.280 align:start position:0%
uh there's a state hiring freeze we've
 
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
put in for a few positions to get
 
01:37:02.030 --> 01:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
waivers for that are 100% federally
 
01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
reimburse right now and in the process
 
01:37:07.070 --> 01:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
if there's a 75 25 Federal uh federal
 
01:37:09.709 --> 01:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
government 25% General funded State cost
 
01:37:11.189 --> 01:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
year we are looking to hire those
 
01:37:12.790 --> 01:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
positions as well I'm sorry yeah I'm I
 
01:37:15.669 --> 01:37:15.679 align:start position:0%
was looking at this um veteran services
 
01:37:18.030 --> 01:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
now the whole thing I'm sorry I had the
 
01:37:20.870 --> 01:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
the number so it's $2 million more of
 
01:37:24.590 --> 01:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
General funds right
 
01:37:28.270 --> 01:37:28.280 align:start position:0%
yeah page page 206 yeah at the bottom
 
01:37:31.229 --> 01:37:31.239 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah yeah sorry oh the 40 million
 
01:37:33.189 --> 01:37:33.199 align:start position:0%
to 42 to
 
01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
42 right so in 2004 you spent 5 A5
 
01:37:39.589 --> 01:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
million of General funds I got it right
 
01:37:42.589 --> 01:37:42.599 align:start position:0%
and now we're going to 7 point something
 
01:37:44.030 --> 01:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
right so it's it's more or less 2
 
01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:45.229 align:start position:0%
right so it's it's more or less 2
million

01:37:45.229 --> 01:37:45.239 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:37:47.709 --> 01:37:47.719 align:start position:0%
more um that was our inability to
 
01:37:50.229 --> 01:37:50.239 align:start position:0%
execute construction contracts um or
 
01:37:51.790 --> 01:37:51.800 align:start position:0%
service agreements that had a federal
 
01:37:53.830 --> 01:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
state cost share
 
01:37:55.950 --> 01:37:55.960 align:start position:0%
so we sort of dropped General funds
 
01:37:57.189 --> 01:37:57.199 align:start position:0%
because we couldn't execute the federal
 
01:38:01.270 --> 01:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
dollars associated with it okay so is
 
01:38:03.589 --> 01:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
and and the and the federal funds is
 
01:38:07.669 --> 01:38:07.679 align:start position:0%
going up hugely right I mean it's it's
 
01:38:10.709 --> 01:38:10.719 align:start position:0%
um but you saying this is up in the air
 
01:38:13.629 --> 01:38:13.639 align:start position:0%
right the 16 million kind of
 
01:38:16.430 --> 01:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
number no uh sir generally speaking we
 
01:38:18.189 --> 01:38:18.199 align:start position:0%
significantly underere executed because
 
01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
our inability to procure our contract
 
01:38:23.149 --> 01:38:23.159 align:start position:0%
services that had a federal match oh I
 
01:38:23.159 --> 01:38:24.229 align:start position:0%
services that had a federal match oh I
see

01:38:24.229 --> 01:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
okay but you think that's going to
 
01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:29.109 align:start position:0%
okay but you think that's going to
change

01:38:29.109 --> 01:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:38:33.070 --> 01:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
yes okay well maybe we can get to sort
 
01:38:34.950 --> 01:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
of exactly where in the budget those
 
01:38:38.669 --> 01:38:38.679 align:start position:0%
things are yep so essentially sir you
 
01:38:40.270 --> 01:38:40.280 align:start position:0%
want additional clarification on that
 
01:38:43.270 --> 01:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
sort of that line on page 206 well yeah
 
01:38:45.750 --> 01:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
I mean this is the the bottom line right
 
01:38:48.830 --> 01:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
so so yeah where
 
01:38:53.790 --> 01:38:53.800 align:start position:0%
is where is the extra $2 million of
 
01:38:56.589 --> 01:38:56.599 align:start position:0%
General funds being
 
01:39:01.070 --> 01:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
spent so there was a
 
01:39:03.669 --> 01:39:03.679 align:start position:0%
uh of the $2 million I think it goes
 
01:39:04.669 --> 01:39:04.679 align:start position:0%
there's like three or four different
 
01:39:06.510 --> 01:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
places I think one was the state
 
01:39:08.790 --> 01:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
vacancies the state position vacancies
 
01:39:11.310 --> 01:39:11.320 align:start position:0%
that had a state cost share that's part
 
01:39:13.510 --> 01:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
of it number two is our inability to
 
01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
execute State contracts with the federal
 
01:39:20.229 --> 01:39:20.239 align:start position:0%
match and number three was um sometimes
 
01:39:21.750 --> 01:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
during continuing resolutions when we
 
01:39:24.030 --> 01:39:24.040 align:start position:0%
receive the federal funds too late
 
01:39:25.990 --> 01:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
it exasperates our problem with
 
01:39:27.910 --> 01:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
executing those like for example an
 
01:39:30.910 --> 01:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
Armory a read the center the 18 to 20
 
01:39:32.470 --> 01:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
that we have throughout the state is a
 
01:39:34.750 --> 01:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
50/50 federal state cost share so when
 
01:39:36.510 --> 01:39:36.520 align:start position:0%
under continuing resolution sometimes we
 
01:39:38.589 --> 01:39:38.599 align:start position:0%
get the federal dollars late and it
 
01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
exasperates our compounds our problem of
 
01:39:43.550 --> 01:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
how we can execute those funds so we had
 
01:39:46.149 --> 01:39:46.159 align:start position:0%
uh one or two substandard years of which
 
01:39:49.030 --> 01:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
we uh had to transfer the federal
 
01:39:51.109 --> 01:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
dollars into other accounts uh for it to
 
01:39:52.950 --> 01:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
be spent and therefore we underere
 
01:39:55.669 --> 01:39:55.679 align:start position:0%
executed are General funds gotcha so why
 
01:39:57.830 --> 01:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
don't we go through the pages and we'll
 
01:40:00.910 --> 01:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
we'll kind of highlight places where
 
01:40:03.310 --> 01:40:03.320 align:start position:0%
General funds are used because that's
 
01:40:07.510 --> 01:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
our our main concern here all
 
01:40:12.490 --> 01:40:12.500 align:start position:0%
right so let's see start with one page
 
01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:15.589 align:start position:0%
right so let's see start with one page
[Music]

01:40:15.589 --> 01:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:40:15.599 --> 01:40:18.310 align:start position:0%
[Music]
179

01:40:18.310 --> 01:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
179
 
01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:20.030 align:start position:0%
179
okay

01:40:20.030 --> 01:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:40:24.750 --> 01:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
um Administration and armories
 
01:40:28.790 --> 01:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
okay so here's an example right
 
01:40:33.870 --> 01:40:33.880 align:start position:0%
so um general fund going up uh by a
 
01:40:37.990 --> 01:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
third right from 1.5 to
 
01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:43.629 align:start position:0%
third right from 1.5 to
two

01:40:43.629 --> 01:40:43.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:46.270 --> 01:40:46.280 align:start position:0%
million well 20 so are you going to
 
01:40:50.910 --> 01:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
spend in 2025 2.1 in this
 
01:40:55.629 --> 01:40:55.639 align:start position:0%
area page 179 right yeah well 179 goes
 
01:41:04.270 --> 01:41:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:06.229 --> 01:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
are so it looks like there were
 
01:41:06.239 --> 01:41:07.709 align:start position:0%
are so it looks like there were
vacancies

01:41:07.709 --> 01:41:07.719 align:start position:0%
vacancies
 
01:41:07.719 --> 01:41:10.589 align:start position:0%
vacancies
probably

01:41:10.589 --> 01:41:10.599 align:start position:0%
probably
 
01:41:13.310 --> 01:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
yep V
 
01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:16.270 align:start position:0%
yep V
contracts

01:41:16.270 --> 01:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
01:41:20.350 --> 01:41:20.360 align:start position:0%
and and uh so was vacant positions are
 
01:41:22.070 --> 01:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
inability to execute contracts and it
 
01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
was the Challenger the difference in
 
01:41:26.790 --> 01:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
utility bills yes utility bills rents
 
01:41:30.189 --> 01:41:30.199 align:start position:0%
are going up and and heat electricity
 
01:41:34.550 --> 01:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
Etc right so we uh we have over 66
 
01:41:36.149 --> 01:41:36.159 align:start position:0%
buildings in in the Army National Guard
 
01:41:37.830 --> 01:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
and 44 buildings in the International
 
01:41:39.310 --> 01:41:39.320 align:start position:0%
Guard so we have over 100 buildings so
 
01:41:42.790 --> 01:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
we pay a fair amount of uh we have a lot
 
01:41:44.310 --> 01:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
of real
 
01:41:48.990 --> 01:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
estate but but you only was was 2024 a
 
01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
very light year for electricity cuz you
 
01:41:56.070 --> 01:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
only spent the 1.544 for well the
 
01:41:59.990 --> 01:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
71,000 I'm I'm looking on page
 
01:42:02.189 --> 01:42:02.199 align:start position:0%
179 line
 
01:42:02.199 --> 01:42:04.790 align:start position:0%
179 line
23

01:42:04.790 --> 01:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
23
 
01:42:08.589 --> 01:42:08.599 align:start position:0%
right so that 71,000 is going up to 120
 
01:42:08.599 --> 01:42:11.229 align:start position:0%
right so that 71,000 is going up to 120
a

01:42:11.229 --> 01:42:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:15.310 --> 01:42:15.320 align:start position:0%
year and your rents are going from 277
 
01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:17.589 align:start position:0%
year and your rents are going from 277
to

01:42:17.589 --> 01:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:20.189 --> 01:42:20.199 align:start position:0%
400 so I'm going to defer to Judy Chang
 
01:42:21.870 --> 01:42:21.880 align:start position:0%
our Chief Financial Officer um that's a
 
01:42:24.390 --> 01:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
good idea
 
01:42:26.310 --> 01:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
yeah use that microphone right on the
 
01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:35.350 align:start position:0%
yeah use that microphone right on the
corner

01:42:35.350 --> 01:42:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:38.669 --> 01:42:38.679 align:start position:0%
there W okay so basically for the
 
01:42:42.750 --> 01:42:42.760 align:start position:0%
utility things is um we're trying to use
 
01:42:46.390 --> 01:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
the federal resource to to you know to
 
01:42:49.709 --> 01:42:49.719 align:start position:0%
save the the general funds and and the
 
01:42:53.189 --> 01:42:53.199 align:start position:0%
plus we have a the very warm year in the
 
01:42:56.750 --> 01:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
24 so that's why the utility funds is
 
01:42:59.669 --> 01:42:59.679 align:start position:0%
it's much lower than we anticipate so we
 
01:43:03.189 --> 01:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
did a budget around the 220,000 but we
 
01:43:05.870 --> 01:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
only spend 71,000 I see what you're
 
01:43:09.229 --> 01:43:09.239 align:start position:0%
saying yeah okay and
 
01:43:12.510 --> 01:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
rents uh the rent is ready for the city
 
01:43:15.229 --> 01:43:15.239 align:start position:0%
of conquer for the land we have the the
 
01:43:18.109 --> 01:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
airport land and so basically the
 
01:43:21.589 --> 01:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
increase depend on the the index every
 
01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
year so the index keep changing so for
 
01:43:26.950 --> 01:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
the last three years the index still the
 
01:43:29.550 --> 01:43:29.560 align:start position:0%
same roughly but when we do the budget
 
01:43:32.390 --> 01:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
we anticipate the index with increase
 
01:43:36.109 --> 01:43:36.119 align:start position:0%
that's the reason and current
 
01:43:40.030 --> 01:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
expense um current expense that think
 
01:43:44.030 --> 01:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
the current expense is normally we move
 
01:43:46.790 --> 01:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
that money into because when the DS
 
01:43:50.750 --> 01:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
changed for the snow point and for the
 
01:43:53.310 --> 01:43:53.320 align:start position:0%
trash they want the coding to 103
 
01:43:55.669 --> 01:43:55.679 align:start position:0%
instead the in know traditional Rec
 
01:43:58.350 --> 01:43:58.360 align:start position:0%
coding in the class 20 that's why we
 
01:44:01.390 --> 01:44:01.400 align:start position:0%
move the money M
 
01:44:04.629 --> 01:44:04.639 align:start position:0%
okay all right and also your it costs
 
01:44:07.270 --> 01:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
are going up it looks like yeah the it
 
01:44:09.550 --> 01:44:09.560 align:start position:0%
cost is ready for the
 
01:44:12.270 --> 01:44:12.280 align:start position:0%
doit uh are you talking about the class
 
01:44:16.270 --> 01:44:16.280 align:start position:0%
27 right yes so it's really doit U
 
01:44:18.669 --> 01:44:18.679 align:start position:0%
wherever they budget yes they charge us
 
01:44:21.790 --> 01:44:21.800 align:start position:0%
for the cost allocation then we just do
 
01:44:23.589 --> 01:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
as they charge us
 
01:44:27.910 --> 01:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
okay all right so that was one
 
01:44:34.390 --> 01:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
page um let's see page
 
01:44:39.790 --> 01:44:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:42.790 --> 01:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
181 yes representative sorry Mr chair on
 
01:44:47.510 --> 01:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
before we leave um uh 180 uh page 180
 
01:44:50.629 --> 01:44:50.639 align:start position:0%
the contracts for operational services
 
01:44:52.669 --> 01:44:52.679 align:start position:0%
that line went up quite a bit what what
 
01:44:54.149 --> 01:44:54.159 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:44:56.709 --> 01:44:56.719 align:start position:0%
so we have the one incident when the
 
01:44:58.350 --> 01:44:58.360 align:start position:0%
people hit our
 
01:45:02.229 --> 01:45:02.239 align:start position:0%
gate and uh um do you want to talk about
 
01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
that the gate on the pamur gate yeah so
 
01:45:09.910 --> 01:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
we had an incident where uh I can't
 
01:45:12.189 --> 01:45:12.199 align:start position:0%
remember who it was um had a medical
 
01:45:15.070 --> 01:45:15.080 align:start position:0%
emergency and hit our security gate at
 
01:45:17.390 --> 01:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
one of our entrances to our reservation
 
01:45:20.470 --> 01:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
and we had to Contract Services to fix
 
01:45:23.950 --> 01:45:23.960 align:start position:0%
the retaining wall the the metal fencing
 
01:45:25.550 --> 01:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
and the gate itself that opens and
 
01:45:27.270 --> 01:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
closes automatically with an access card
 
01:45:29.550 --> 01:45:29.560 align:start position:0%
reader so I think that was a significant
 
01:45:32.030 --> 01:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
onetime hit and we had to pay for just
 
01:45:34.510 --> 01:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
generally that that line and operational
 
01:45:36.629 --> 01:45:36.639 align:start position:0%
Services that's it's that kind of thing
 
01:45:38.270 --> 01:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
where you need to hire somebody to come
 
01:45:40.950 --> 01:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
in and do some work okay thank you but
 
01:45:43.390 --> 01:45:43.400 align:start position:0%
you won't necessarily ongoing need quite
 
01:45:47.189 --> 01:45:47.199 align:start position:0%
so much right um we also has the roof
 
01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
issues our building is very old you want
 
01:45:52.229 --> 01:45:52.239 align:start position:0%
to talk about the so we can use this one
 
01:45:53.430 --> 01:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
to fix
 
01:45:55.830 --> 01:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
coding as 100% General from coding
 
01:45:59.430 --> 01:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
buildings okay to fix yeah most of our
 
01:46:02.950 --> 01:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
building is either 100% federal or 5050
 
01:46:06.109 --> 01:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
75 25 but we still have a few of the
 
01:46:09.550 --> 01:46:09.560 align:start position:0%
building coding as 100% General funds
 
01:46:11.830 --> 01:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
and we want to fix the roof with the
 
01:46:14.390 --> 01:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
edge pack and the boil all those things
 
01:46:15.870 --> 01:46:15.880 align:start position:0%
that's the purpose is that what so
 
01:46:17.470 --> 01:46:17.480 align:start position:0%
you're saying some of the buildings are
 
01:46:19.470 --> 01:46:19.480 align:start position:0%
General funds and some of them very few
 
01:46:21.589 --> 01:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
we only have a one or two buildings
 
01:46:24.030 --> 01:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
gotcha I see
 
01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
okay all right um then on page
 
01:46:32.669 --> 01:46:32.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:37.510 --> 01:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:42.310 --> 01:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
that yes so 182 is 75% Federal sheare
 
01:46:45.310 --> 01:46:45.320 align:start position:0%
and 25% State sheare for the Army
 
01:46:48.189 --> 01:46:48.199 align:start position:0%
National Guard supporting but where's
 
01:46:51.270 --> 01:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
some of these 18 positions vacant yes so
 
01:46:54.510 --> 01:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
some of that is the V positions um
 
01:46:58.430 --> 01:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
because that's a 7525 year uh at that
 
01:47:01.709 --> 01:47:01.719 align:start position:0%
time in 2024 we have a vacant positions
 
01:47:04.910 --> 01:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
but we slowly uh fill all those position
 
01:47:07.830 --> 01:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
already so for the sheet with uh the
 
01:47:10.430 --> 01:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
general talking about the 19 weing
 
01:47:13.310 --> 01:47:13.320 align:start position:0%
positions we don't have in the account
 
01:47:16.189 --> 01:47:16.199 align:start position:0%
yet so pretty much we fill all those
 
01:47:18.750 --> 01:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
positions now in this case the
 
01:47:23.109 --> 01:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
electricity bill is not going up so much
 
01:47:27.229 --> 01:47:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:32.669 --> 01:47:32.679 align:start position:0%
one so for this utility bill we hope so
 
01:47:34.070 --> 01:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
one thing that we're trying to meet the
 
01:47:36.990 --> 01:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
governor's Target so we trying to manage
 
01:47:40.550 --> 01:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
the whole Department's budgets and uh
 
01:47:42.629 --> 01:47:42.639 align:start position:0%
that's the one reason so we're trying to
 
01:47:45.470 --> 01:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
do more efficiencies with our new
 
01:47:48.189 --> 01:47:48.199 align:start position:0%
buildings especially when we looking for
 
01:47:50.589 --> 01:47:50.599 align:start position:0%
the capital budget to do the all the
 
01:47:53.790 --> 01:47:53.800 align:start position:0%
renovation stuff so hopefully and the
 
01:47:57.430 --> 01:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency will helping us uh
 
01:48:00.550 --> 01:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
second things is uh we want that budget
 
01:48:04.430 --> 01:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
as close as we participate because Das
 
01:48:07.990 --> 01:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
changed the rule so in case if we have
 
01:48:10.750 --> 01:48:10.760 align:start position:0%
the warm weather and we didn't spend the
 
01:48:14.830 --> 01:48:14.840 align:start position:0%
utility money uh it can be Moval for any
 
01:48:14.840 --> 01:48:16.270 align:start position:0%
utility money uh it can be Moval for any
other

01:48:16.270 --> 01:48:16.280 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:48:19.270 --> 01:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
use gotcha all right we're going to move
 
01:48:29.990 --> 01:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:32.750 --> 01:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
4 Mr chair usually we're just a pass
 
01:48:34.830 --> 01:48:34.840 align:start position:0%
through so what happens is the committee
 
01:48:36.229 --> 01:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
gives us the money we pass it through to
 
01:48:38.790 --> 01:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
Civil Air Patrol and if there's a cut
 
01:48:40.350 --> 01:48:40.360 align:start position:0%
based upon the governor's efficiency
 
01:48:43.589 --> 01:48:43.599 align:start position:0%
budget we just sort of cut what's passed
 
01:48:45.070 --> 01:48:45.080 align:start position:0%
through we don't we don't we don't take
 
01:48:47.550 --> 01:48:47.560 align:start position:0%
any of it it's just it's what the state
 
01:48:49.950 --> 01:48:49.960 align:start position:0%
gives to them when we're just the what
 
01:48:52.390 --> 01:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
is civil air patrol it's there's a
 
01:48:54.870 --> 01:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
corner building near our state Military
 
01:48:56.350 --> 01:48:56.360 align:start position:0%
Reservation I think it's regional Drive
 
01:48:59.109 --> 01:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
and Airport Road and it's the youth
 
01:49:01.229 --> 01:49:01.239 align:start position:0%
based crew uh program like high school
 
01:49:04.189 --> 01:49:04.199 align:start position:0%
kids who show up for like a day or twice
 
01:49:07.270 --> 01:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
a month and they wear like an Air Force
 
01:49:08.910 --> 01:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
uniform they learn about avionics and
 
01:49:10.750 --> 01:49:10.760 align:start position:0%
airplanes and they fly so there's like
 
01:49:12.750 --> 01:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
retired military who are their
 
01:49:14.750 --> 01:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
instructors and it's just it's to get
 
01:49:16.350 --> 01:49:16.360 align:start position:0%
them into like aviation industry it's
 
01:49:18.589 --> 01:49:18.599 align:start position:0%
almost like a junior RC program navc
 
01:49:20.950 --> 01:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
Cadets very similar it just happens to
 
01:49:23.629 --> 01:49:23.639 align:start position:0%
be house on the corner next to our
 
01:49:23.639 --> 01:49:25.790 align:start position:0%
be house on the corner next to our
reservation

01:49:25.790 --> 01:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
reservation
 
01:49:29.910 --> 01:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
gotcha yeah you like it yeah so the
 
01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
governor trimmed it a bit it looks like
 
01:49:34.990 --> 01:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
yeah well usually what we'll do is we'll
 
01:49:37.830 --> 01:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
incorporate those budget
 
01:49:40.870 --> 01:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
reductions into their account and we'll
 
01:49:42.790 --> 01:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
notify them that Hey listen based upon
 
01:49:44.390 --> 01:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
like you know the current fiscal
 
01:49:46.790 --> 01:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
climate because all we do is we're just
 
01:49:51.270 --> 01:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
a pass through gotcha okay
 
01:49:54.430 --> 01:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
um uh so this one is one I remember from
 
01:49:59.270 --> 01:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
last time page 199 enlistment
 
01:50:02.270 --> 01:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
incentive so we really increased that I
 
01:50:07.510 --> 01:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:10.189 --> 01:50:10.199 align:start position:0%
time well it was General funds right
 
01:50:14.350 --> 01:50:14.360 align:start position:0%
yeah so so uh sir I would offer to you
 
01:50:16.510 --> 01:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
that the biggest um the biggest
 
01:50:17.870 --> 01:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
challenge for the United States military
 
01:50:19.550 --> 01:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
is not China or Russia it's our ability
 
01:50:21.030 --> 01:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
to fill our formations of an all
 
01:50:23.870 --> 01:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
volunteer force and we struggle at our
 
01:50:26.430 --> 01:50:26.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire International Guard um
 
01:50:28.950 --> 01:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
location location and new KC 46 refueler
 
01:50:31.470 --> 01:50:31.480 align:start position:0%
we are 100% fully man I'm in the Army
 
01:50:35.149 --> 01:50:35.159 align:start position:0%
National Guard with about 1760 positions
 
01:50:36.870 --> 01:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
we're running actually like a 10%
 
01:50:39.750 --> 01:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate um that's actually
 
01:50:41.990 --> 01:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
fairly significant for our ability to
 
01:50:43.510 --> 01:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
dur our number one Mission which is the
 
01:50:45.790 --> 01:50:45.800 align:start position:0%
fight America's Wars and so anything
 
01:50:48.149 --> 01:50:48.159 align:start position:0%
that we can do to help the accessions of
 
01:50:50.470 --> 01:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
bringing in new recruits or the
 
01:50:52.669 --> 01:50:52.679 align:start position:0%
retention of those service members into
 
01:50:54.629 --> 01:50:54.639 align:start position:0%
so you know there's a couple of best
 
01:50:55.990 --> 01:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
practices that we've seen from other
 
01:50:58.189 --> 01:50:58.199 align:start position:0%
states so we now offer like say dot a
 
01:51:01.310 --> 01:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
$1,000 referral program so if you're
 
01:51:03.189 --> 01:51:03.199 align:start position:0%
you're an listed member of retiree in
 
01:51:04.830 --> 01:51:04.840 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire National Guard you
 
01:51:06.709 --> 01:51:06.719 align:start position:0%
refer someone to join us you get
 
01:51:10.149 --> 01:51:10.159 align:start position:0%
$1,000 this year we expanded it to um do
 
01:51:15.430 --> 01:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
a uh a state retention bonus so in the
 
01:51:18.790 --> 01:51:18.800 align:start position:0%
event the feds do not offer you a say
 
01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:19.990 align:start position:0%
event the feds do not offer you a say
six-year

01:51:19.990 --> 01:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
six-year
 
01:51:23.790 --> 01:51:23.800 align:start position:0%
$20,000 reenlistment bonus um we've
 
01:51:25.750 --> 01:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
developed through the legislature a
 
01:51:28.109 --> 01:51:28.119 align:start position:0%
state retention bonus of really it's
 
01:51:29.390 --> 01:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
nominal it's like
 
01:51:33.350 --> 01:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
$4,000 and so we're trying to apply some
 
01:51:36.270 --> 01:51:36.280 align:start position:0%
resources to ensure that we can recruit
 
01:51:38.030 --> 01:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
and then retain a quality volunteer
 
01:51:41.950 --> 01:51:41.960 align:start position:0%
Force that's the why how many new um
 
01:51:44.030 --> 01:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
people are recruited every
 
01:51:47.229 --> 01:51:47.239 align:start position:0%
year it's a revolving door yeah so
 
01:51:48.550 --> 01:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
generally speaking I'll just talk about
 
01:51:50.189 --> 01:51:50.199 align:start position:0%
the Army
 
01:51:54.310 --> 01:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
guard uh 15% turnover rate so every year
 
01:51:56.430 --> 01:51:56.440 align:start position:0%
we need to get 200 soldiers
 
01:52:00.390 --> 01:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
in every year we ATT Tri 2 to 210 so the
 
01:52:02.109 --> 01:52:02.119 align:start position:0%
challenge is because an enlistment
 
01:52:05.310 --> 01:52:05.320 align:start position:0%
contract can vary between 3 to six years
 
01:52:06.870 --> 01:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
so that we're planting this current
 
01:52:09.310 --> 01:52:09.320 align:start position:0%
generation yes they want to serve but a
 
01:52:11.069 --> 01:52:11.079 align:start position:0%
lman contract is typically what we call
 
01:52:13.790 --> 01:52:13.800 align:start position:0%
a 3x5 three years of active service in
 
01:52:15.709 --> 01:52:15.719 align:start position:0%
the National Guard week and a month and
 
01:52:18.589 --> 01:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
five years independent ready Reserve
 
01:52:20.109 --> 01:52:20.119 align:start position:0%
because surface members will come in I
 
01:52:22.750 --> 01:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
served got my tuition waiver did my call
 
01:52:25.270 --> 01:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
serve my country I'm good and so the
 
01:52:28.069 --> 01:52:28.079 align:start position:0%
challenge is um trying to keep service
 
01:52:30.950 --> 01:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
members in after that first enlistment
 
01:52:32.390 --> 01:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
because there's no more 20-year
 
01:52:34.270 --> 01:52:34.280 align:start position:0%
retirement uh the federal government get
 
01:52:35.830 --> 01:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
rid of it so now we're at
 
01:52:38.470 --> 01:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
401K so you join now as a junior and
 
01:52:41.030 --> 01:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
listed um you don't wait for that 20e
 
01:52:42.149 --> 01:52:42.159 align:start position:0%
retirement that you're going to get at
 
01:52:43.830 --> 01:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
age either 42 or 60 depending if you're
 
01:52:47.109 --> 01:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
a full-time part-time um it's a 401k so
 
01:52:48.750 --> 01:52:48.760 align:start position:0%
there's really no Financial incentive
 
01:52:51.709 --> 01:52:51.719 align:start position:0%
for service members when they to stay a
 
01:52:53.709 --> 01:52:53.719 align:start position:0%
particularly length of time because life
 
01:52:55.910 --> 01:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
takes over they get a promotion to the
 
01:52:57.550 --> 01:52:57.560 align:start position:0%
civilian job they get their education
 
01:52:58.950 --> 01:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
they have a house a kid and next thing
 
01:53:02.149 --> 01:53:02.159 align:start position:0%
you know um life gets busy and and so
 
01:53:05.589 --> 01:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
we're having it recruiting is isn't as
 
01:53:07.229 --> 01:53:07.239 align:start position:0%
big of an issue as it currently is right
 
01:53:08.270 --> 01:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
now with
 
01:53:10.470 --> 01:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
retention and so we're trying to figure
 
01:53:12.709 --> 01:53:12.719 align:start position:0%
out different ways of retention and so
 
01:53:15.589 --> 01:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
um and so an example we partnered with
 
01:53:17.109 --> 01:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
the university system of New Hampshire
 
01:53:18.390 --> 01:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
and the community college system of New
 
01:53:21.189 --> 01:53:21.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so if you reinlist um after
 
01:53:22.950 --> 01:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
your first six years
 
01:53:24.470 --> 01:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
that free tuition waiver to the
 
01:53:26.629 --> 01:53:26.639 align:start position:0%
university is transferable to your
 
01:53:28.550 --> 01:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
spouse because we're trying to retain
 
01:53:30.910 --> 01:53:30.920 align:start position:0%
that family member as well those are the
 
01:53:32.270 --> 01:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
creative things we've been trying to do
 
01:53:34.350 --> 01:53:34.360 align:start position:0%
now you just said you're recruiting 200
 
01:53:37.350 --> 01:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
a year but you also said there are 3,000
 
01:53:40.750 --> 01:53:40.760 align:start position:0%
National Guard and 15% turnover so that'
 
01:53:43.870 --> 01:53:43.880 align:start position:0%
be more like 450 a year right that's
 
01:53:45.589 --> 01:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
just Army on the International Guard we
 
01:53:47.990 --> 01:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
about 1100 and so it's the same it's
 
01:53:50.629 --> 01:53:50.639 align:start position:0%
almost by 10% their National Guard has
 
01:53:53.709 --> 01:53:53.719 align:start position:0%
less turnover um they're about 1100
 
01:53:56.030 --> 01:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
strong we typically have to assess about
 
01:53:56.040 --> 01:53:58.550 align:start position:0%
strong we typically have to assess about
100

01:53:58.550 --> 01:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:02.550 --> 01:54:02.560 align:start position:0%
120 on the Army it's technically 250 but
 
01:54:04.350 --> 01:54:04.360 align:start position:0%
I say 200 because that's what we call
 
01:54:06.870 --> 01:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
non- prior Services sessions then you
 
01:54:08.589 --> 01:54:08.599 align:start position:0%
have officer commissioning then you have
 
01:54:11.030 --> 01:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
Interstate transfers so generally
 
01:54:13.990 --> 01:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
speaking we'll bring in about 250 new
 
01:54:16.629 --> 01:54:16.639 align:start position:0%
soldiers or service members in the Army
 
01:54:20.109 --> 01:54:20.119 align:start position:0%
guard of a force about 1757
 
01:54:22.990 --> 01:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
1760 oh okay
 
01:54:25.510 --> 01:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
so what you're saying is they're in two
 
01:54:28.510 --> 01:54:28.520 align:start position:0%
groups ye yes regular National Guard and
 
01:54:30.709 --> 01:54:30.719 align:start position:0%
Air National Guard that the Army the
 
01:54:34.189 --> 01:54:34.199 align:start position:0%
Army Army's Army about 250 air about 110
 
01:54:36.470 --> 01:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
Army okay I
 
01:54:36.480 --> 01:54:41.149 align:start position:0%
Army okay I
see

01:54:41.149 --> 01:54:41.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:45.310 --> 01:54:45.320 align:start position:0%
gotcha s about five years ago um they
 
01:54:47.470 --> 01:54:47.480 align:start position:0%
thought they were going to save money
 
01:54:49.830 --> 01:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
the federal government and uh it went to
 
01:54:52.669 --> 01:54:52.679 align:start position:0%
uh 401K we called a blended return
 
01:54:55.510 --> 01:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:58.669 --> 01:54:58.679 align:start position:0%
BRS you get you get well that's the
 
01:55:00.990 --> 01:55:01.000 align:start position:0%
whole point was you now get something
 
01:55:03.350 --> 01:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
for any term Of
 
01:55:07.030 --> 01:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
Enlistment versus the 20% who would do
 
01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
20 years so now everyone gets something
 
01:55:12.990 --> 01:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
but people don't have the incentive for
 
01:55:15.550 --> 01:55:15.560 align:start position:0%
the 20
 
01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:17.290 align:start position:0%
the 20
right

01:55:17.290 --> 01:55:17.300 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:55:17.300 --> 01:55:19.510 align:start position:0%
right
[Music]

01:55:19.510 --> 01:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:55:22.709 --> 01:55:22.719 align:start position:0%
right okay but but this this this small
 
01:55:24.790 --> 01:55:24.800 align:start position:0%
amount of money here this
 
01:55:27.229 --> 01:55:27.239 align:start position:0%
$100,000 you
 
01:55:30.390 --> 01:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
can't you can't divide it very much I
 
01:55:32.470 --> 01:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
mean not everybody is getting this or oh
 
01:55:35.950 --> 01:55:35.960 align:start position:0%
no so you know generally speaking I
 
01:55:39.229 --> 01:55:39.239 align:start position:0%
believe we do about 40 referrals a
 
01:55:42.069 --> 01:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
year um and then we just started the
 
01:55:44.229 --> 01:55:44.239 align:start position:0%
state retention program it passed the
 
01:55:47.430 --> 01:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
legislature last uh year so this is our
 
01:55:50.109 --> 01:55:50.119 align:start position:0%
first year the policy just went out so
 
01:55:51.589 --> 01:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
we're in the sort of initial stages of
 
01:55:53.510 --> 01:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
sort of testing demand signal like hey
 
01:55:54.830 --> 01:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
what's out
 
01:55:59.470 --> 01:55:59.480 align:start position:0%
there okay all right thank you so page
 
01:56:02.550 --> 01:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
uh let's see
 
01:56:10.830 --> 01:56:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:14.589 --> 01:56:14.599 align:start position:0%
cemetery okay 202
 
01:56:17.669 --> 01:56:17.679 align:start position:0%
202 yeah so there's a large increase in
 
01:56:19.189 --> 01:56:19.199 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
01:56:24.069 --> 01:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
here right so it it in 2024 was only six
 
01:56:29.870 --> 01:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
$116,000 that's going up to 250 260 per
 
01:56:35.870 --> 01:56:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:41.030 --> 01:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
come so that one is because we have the
 
01:56:45.709 --> 01:56:45.719 align:start position:0%
so thatc is 100% general fund but
 
01:56:48.830 --> 01:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
however we received the if the veteran
 
01:56:51.430 --> 01:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
barrier in our Veteran Cemetery we
 
01:56:54.669 --> 01:56:54.679 align:start position:0%
receive from the the VA with the vrine
 
01:56:59.470 --> 01:56:59.480 align:start position:0%
um the revenue and also uh if you see
 
01:57:03.589 --> 01:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
the uh the agency income is when we bury
 
01:57:06.830 --> 01:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
you the sports and the dependence that's
 
01:57:09.830 --> 01:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
we collect the money from the family so
 
01:57:13.550 --> 01:57:13.560 align:start position:0%
normally is so in this case uh on the
 
01:57:17.149 --> 01:57:17.159 align:start position:0%
federal funding last year they Chang the
 
01:57:21.950 --> 01:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
Perfection rates so right now is so
 
01:57:24.030 --> 01:57:24.040 align:start position:0%
every October 1st they change they
 
01:57:26.990 --> 01:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
increased the rat so last year the rates
 
01:57:30.069 --> 01:57:30.079 align:start position:0%
increased tremendous I think it's a
 
01:57:32.990 --> 01:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
700 80 I'm not really sure I can go
 
01:57:35.550 --> 01:57:35.560 align:start position:0%
double check but around that thing so
 
01:57:37.830 --> 01:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
when we have that and we're trying to
 
01:57:40.990 --> 01:57:41.000 align:start position:0%
decrease general funds to to basically
 
01:57:43.990 --> 01:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
use our you know the revenue to cover
 
01:57:46.669 --> 01:57:46.679 align:start position:0%
the general fund so I think of it like
 
01:57:48.629 --> 01:57:48.639 align:start position:0%
this uh the federal government gives us
 
01:57:50.310 --> 01:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
a plot allowance for every veteran we
 
01:57:52.510 --> 01:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
bury at the cemetery
 
01:57:54.310 --> 01:57:54.320 align:start position:0%
about two three years ago a federal law
 
01:57:57.109 --> 01:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
change where now a national a reservice
 
01:58:00.390 --> 01:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
or National Guards person um who hasn't
 
01:58:02.510 --> 01:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
been activated on what we call Title 10
 
01:58:04.350 --> 01:58:04.360 align:start position:0%
like a deployment overseas or Southern
 
01:58:07.149 --> 01:58:07.159 align:start position:0%
border um is now eligible for burial in
 
01:58:09.950 --> 01:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
the Veteran Cemetery so that's a cost we
 
01:58:12.870 --> 01:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
eat um to giving them a dignified final
 
01:58:15.030 --> 01:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
resting ground based upon a change in a
 
01:58:17.270 --> 01:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
I believe a federal
 
01:58:19.990 --> 01:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
policy so I mean what we have we're
 
01:58:22.350 --> 01:58:22.360 align:start position:0%
trying to cover the the that other cost
 
01:58:23.990 --> 01:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
that was going to increase over time I
 
01:58:27.430 --> 01:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
think we've had over 200 uh about 50
 
01:58:29.310 --> 01:58:29.320 align:start position:0%
burials of those Guardsmen and reservist
 
01:58:31.109 --> 01:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
and we have another 150 or 200 on the
 
01:58:33.629 --> 01:58:33.639 align:start position:0%
books for like sort of a that's where
 
01:58:34.790 --> 01:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
they're going to get
 
01:58:38.390 --> 01:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
buried that and when we budget the
 
01:58:41.589 --> 01:58:41.599 align:start position:0%
federal uh funds and the ageny income
 
01:58:43.990 --> 01:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
again when we do the budget we have to
 
01:58:46.390 --> 01:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
figure out how many barrier we were
 
01:58:48.910 --> 01:58:48.920 align:start position:0%
going to have and that's a hot
 
01:58:53.350 --> 01:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
projection for the barrier rate so that
 
01:58:54.830 --> 01:58:54.840 align:start position:0%
probably you see the little bit
 
01:58:57.790 --> 01:58:57.800 align:start position:0%
different between 24 and 25 what's the
 
01:58:57.800 --> 01:58:58.870 align:start position:0%
different between 24 and 25 what's the
family

01:58:58.870 --> 01:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
family
 
01:59:00.990 --> 01:59:01.000 align:start position:0%
cost is it
 
01:59:05.550 --> 01:59:05.560 align:start position:0%
150 per person 150 150 per person versus
 
01:59:08.589 --> 01:59:08.599 align:start position:0%
probably couple 3,000 for right I see
 
01:59:12.030 --> 01:59:12.040 align:start position:0%
every the paper lists them all is 60 70
 
01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
every month y yeah is that right so so I
 
01:59:20.270 --> 01:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
just I guess the main thing here is the
 
01:59:22.589 --> 01:59:22.599 align:start position:0%
expenses went up
 
01:59:26.750 --> 01:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
right so um you must have had a vacancy
 
01:59:31.830 --> 01:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
in 2024 maybe of the nine people not
 
01:59:43.750 --> 01:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:47.950 --> 01:59:47.960 align:start position:0%
it so yeah okay so this kind a little
 
01:59:50.629 --> 01:59:50.639 align:start position:0%
bit difference so if our business
 
01:59:52.830 --> 01:59:52.840 align:start position:0%
supervisor will know as well so when we
 
01:59:55.390 --> 01:59:55.400 align:start position:0%
do the budgets you know you have the
 
01:59:58.910 --> 01:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
like a clean up fiscal years 24 then
 
02:00:01.870 --> 02:00:01.880 align:start position:0%
clean up the fiscal year 25 so in this
 
02:00:01.880 --> 02:00:02.950 align:start position:0%
clean up the fiscal year 25 so in this
account

02:00:02.950 --> 02:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
account
 
02:00:06.870 --> 02:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
because that revenue is brought forward
 
02:00:10.790 --> 02:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
so it's hard to you know to match the
 
02:00:14.470 --> 02:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
systems as we can provide the actual
 
02:00:17.270 --> 02:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
figure so instead so they the system
 
02:00:20.270 --> 02:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
only give us the total but we want to
 
02:00:22.669 --> 02:00:22.679 align:start position:0%
show the how much we receive funds how
 
02:00:25.750 --> 02:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
much we receive the agency income that's
 
02:00:27.950 --> 02:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
why the general fund you look like a g
 
02:00:30.870 --> 02:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
fund is very little but actually is not
 
02:00:33.589 --> 02:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
it just the system in the buy it just
 
02:00:37.189 --> 02:00:37.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't reflect exactly so so the
 
02:00:39.910 --> 02:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
general the general fund is what's left
 
02:00:42.109 --> 02:00:42.119 align:start position:0%
when you subtract the other two from the
 
02:00:47.550 --> 02:00:47.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:49.709 --> 02:00:49.719 align:start position:0%
okay so I can get back to you on that
 
02:00:53.189 --> 02:00:53.199 align:start position:0%
one the barrier for the family
 
02:00:56.830 --> 02:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
150 you do you know when that was set um
 
02:00:58.830 --> 02:00:58.840 align:start position:0%
that was set right in the beginning of
 
02:01:01.669 --> 02:01:01.679 align:start position:0%
the cemetery open and uh it never
 
02:01:09.709 --> 02:01:09.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:12.109 --> 02:01:12.119 align:start position:0%
know um
 
02:01:15.790 --> 02:01:15.800 align:start position:0%
normally the VAC CER the vaction CER
 
02:01:17.990 --> 02:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
would do the annalysis across the
 
02:01:20.910 --> 02:01:20.920 align:start position:0%
countries and if he decide change I
 
02:01:22.790 --> 02:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
think we have to go to Governors and
 
02:01:25.030 --> 02:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
physical to get approval and they had to
 
02:01:26.790 --> 02:01:26.800 align:start position:0%
get the rule
 
02:01:29.550 --> 02:01:29.560 align:start position:0%
change toen
 
02:01:32.550 --> 02:01:32.560 align:start position:0%
all so we're looking into it valid valid
 
02:01:34.669 --> 02:01:34.679 align:start position:0%
point we get we got to do some research
 
02:01:37.189 --> 02:01:37.199 align:start position:0%
on that and ask our secetary
 
02:01:40.550 --> 02:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
director yep okay because essentially
 
02:01:42.350 --> 02:01:42.360 align:start position:0%
your question is um what is the current
 
02:01:43.790 --> 02:01:43.800 align:start position:0%
rate for a family member of the Veteran
 
02:01:46.589 --> 02:01:46.599 align:start position:0%
Cemetery when did it come into effect
 
02:01:48.229 --> 02:01:48.239 align:start position:0%
and is it time to take a relook and see
 
02:01:49.990 --> 02:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
what the the proposed cost should be if
 
02:01:54.270 --> 02:01:54.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:56.270 --> 02:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yeah I think it's 25 to be
 
02:01:57.109 --> 02:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
honest with you I think we just
 
02:01:59.069 --> 02:01:59.079 align:start position:0%
celebrated last year s 25 yeah we're
 
02:02:01.430 --> 02:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
we're taking a serious look at fees
 
02:02:03.830 --> 02:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
because there's some that were set 50
 
02:02:05.870 --> 02:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
years ago and haven't changed you know
 
02:02:09.350 --> 02:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
so like some of these
 
02:02:16.109 --> 02:02:16.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:18.310 --> 02:02:18.320 align:start position:0%
employes Bingo sir and so you know we're
 
02:02:20.550 --> 02:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
trying to take a look at a sort of the
 
02:02:22.790 --> 02:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
our veteran service portfol is 100%
 
02:02:25.149 --> 02:02:25.159 align:start position:0%
generally funded so we have about 25
 
02:02:26.390 --> 02:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
positions when you look at the the
 
02:02:28.669 --> 02:02:28.679 align:start position:0%
cemetery the veteran service officers
 
02:02:30.030 --> 02:02:30.040 align:start position:0%
and the division Community Based
 
02:02:31.750 --> 02:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
military programs so we're taking a look
 
02:02:34.310 --> 02:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
internally is as a veteran population
 
02:02:36.830 --> 02:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
ages do we need as many veteran service
 
02:02:38.870 --> 02:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
officers and as we double triple
 
02:02:40.510 --> 02:02:40.520 align:start position:0%
quadruple because we're doing another
 
02:02:42.109 --> 02:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
Federal expansion of the cemetery this
 
02:02:44.750 --> 02:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
year do we need to put those resources
 
02:02:46.950 --> 02:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
over to the cemetery because you right
 
02:02:48.069 --> 02:02:48.079 align:start position:0%
now we've been getting by with
 
02:02:49.990 --> 02:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
volunteers we have a lot of volunteer
 
02:02:51.470 --> 02:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
associations who do the gardening up
 
02:02:54.149 --> 02:02:54.159 align:start position:0%
there and a lot of the sort of uh
 
02:02:57.229 --> 02:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
Aesthetics um yeah we're it's they're
 
02:03:03.350 --> 02:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:06.750 --> 02:03:06.760 align:start position:0%
there I believe it's the exact price
 
02:03:09.750 --> 02:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
regardless of uh was it
 
02:03:12.950 --> 02:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
cremation uh or barrial or burial or
 
02:03:16.310 --> 02:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
like the box in the the not ears the
 
02:03:19.830 --> 02:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
columbarium versus in the ground so I I
 
02:03:22.629 --> 02:03:22.639 align:start position:0%
believe it's the same price and back to
 
02:03:24.470 --> 02:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
just all right you'll find that out so
 
02:03:25.870 --> 02:03:25.880 align:start position:0%
we're running out of time but I wanted
 
02:03:29.390 --> 02:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
to ask about on page 20
 
02:03:33.629 --> 02:03:33.639 align:start position:0%
204 um there's a big increase in general
 
02:03:37.510 --> 02:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
funds in this area of veteran services
 
02:03:40.069 --> 02:03:40.079 align:start position:0%
Mental Health social
 
02:03:44.549 --> 02:03:44.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:46.990 --> 02:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
that um you're talking about the
 
02:03:52.109 --> 02:03:52.119 align:start position:0%
increase from fiscal 24 465,000 to
 
02:03:55.669 --> 02:03:55.679 align:start position:0%
500 no the the next group the next thing
 
02:03:58.950 --> 02:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
on the page oh this one contract for
 
02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:00.629 align:start position:0%
on the page oh this one contract for
program

02:04:00.629 --> 02:04:00.639 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:04:05.950 --> 02:04:05.960 align:start position:0%
Services right in 2024 was only
 
02:04:10.830 --> 02:04:10.840 align:start position:0%
204 and now you're spending 650 is do
 
02:04:13.030 --> 02:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
I'm going to try I think I know what it
 
02:04:17.470 --> 02:04:17.480 align:start position:0%
is so I I believe the legislature one by
 
02:04:20.470 --> 02:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
Animo specifically provided us a million
 
02:04:22.189 --> 02:04:22.199 align:start position:0%
dollar to division Comm commity based
 
02:04:25.030 --> 02:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
military programs to execute specific
 
02:04:27.549 --> 02:04:27.559 align:start position:0%
programs like an ask the question
 
02:04:30.430 --> 02:04:30.440 align:start position:0%
campaign in the contracts have finally
 
02:04:31.950 --> 02:04:31.960 align:start position:0%
like they've come to fruition like we
 
02:04:34.350 --> 02:04:34.360 align:start position:0%
got the money last bium and we're now
 
02:04:36.589 --> 02:04:36.599 align:start position:0%
executing the contracts so that's why I
 
02:04:38.709 --> 02:04:38.719 align:start position:0%
think you see the increase from you know
 
02:04:39.870 --> 02:04:39.880 align:start position:0%
because the legislature gave us the
 
02:04:41.189 --> 02:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
money to execute these contracts on
 
02:04:43.549 --> 02:04:43.559 align:start position:0%
behalf of our veteran population am I
 
02:04:46.549 --> 02:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
right right so in the addition
 
02:04:50.310 --> 02:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
125,000 if you look at the fiscal is 25
 
02:04:54.310 --> 02:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
that's is the Sy system the DHHS created
 
02:04:57.669 --> 02:04:57.679 align:start position:0%
and we were going to pay as our share by
 
02:05:00.589 --> 02:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
using the systems it's called the roof
 
02:05:03.430 --> 02:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
referral um but because the contract
 
02:05:07.069 --> 02:05:07.079 align:start position:0%
didn't get approved in time um for the
 
02:05:10.270 --> 02:05:10.280 align:start position:0%
DHHS contract that's why we didn't
 
02:05:14.830 --> 02:05:14.840 align:start position:0%
process we kind L that 125,000 24 but
 
02:05:19.470 --> 02:05:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:22.990 --> 02:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
for so you so there's like three or four
 
02:05:24.669 --> 02:05:24.679 align:start position:0%
things that the legislature had us
 
02:05:26.510 --> 02:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
chartered us to do is go get after
 
02:05:28.830 --> 02:05:28.840 align:start position:0%
veteran homelessness um and there's
 
02:05:30.589 --> 02:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
another program called ask the
 
02:05:32.390 --> 02:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
question generally speaking there's
 
02:05:33.790 --> 02:05:33.800 align:start position:0%
990,000 veterans in the state of New
 
02:05:35.990 --> 02:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire only a third of them receive
 
02:05:37.830 --> 02:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
Care at the the Manchester VA or the
 
02:05:40.790 --> 02:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
White River Junction VA so 60,000
 
02:05:42.350 --> 02:05:42.360 align:start position:0%
veterans go to their primary care
 
02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
provider so the program was initiated
 
02:05:47.709 --> 02:05:47.719 align:start position:0%
about a a decade ago and we we're
 
02:05:49.470 --> 02:05:49.480 align:start position:0%
putting teeth into it and continuing it
 
02:05:51.310 --> 02:05:51.320 align:start position:0%
so it's you're a veteran you go to
 
02:05:54.069 --> 02:05:54.079 align:start position:0%
primary care provider and that provider
 
02:05:55.790 --> 02:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
should say have you
 
02:05:57.870 --> 02:05:57.880 align:start position:0%
served and then they can get after
 
02:05:59.830 --> 02:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
there's any mental health or substance
 
02:06:02.870 --> 02:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
misuse issues to identify that veteran
 
02:06:05.950 --> 02:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
with the appropriate resources so one of
 
02:06:07.950 --> 02:06:07.960 align:start position:0%
our signature programs is called asked
 
02:06:10.510 --> 02:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
the question campaign that's and then we
 
02:06:12.270 --> 02:06:12.280 align:start position:0%
do a few other things like a veteran
 
02:06:15.310 --> 02:06:15.320 align:start position:0%
friendly Business program to get hiring
 
02:06:17.109 --> 02:06:17.119 align:start position:0%
a veterans with Employment Security in
 
02:06:18.629 --> 02:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire for employees
 
02:06:20.310 --> 02:06:20.320 align:start position:0%
because we have such a state low uh
 
02:06:22.950 --> 02:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
State unemployment rate so it's just
 
02:06:25.030 --> 02:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
different contracted programs that we
 
02:06:27.589 --> 02:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
try to get after for serving
 
02:06:30.790 --> 02:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
veterans okay but some of these are
 
02:06:32.950 --> 02:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
brand new right I
 
02:06:37.270 --> 02:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
mean yes CU sir I believe the last
 
02:06:39.629 --> 02:06:39.639 align:start position:0%
legislature mandated us with those three
 
02:06:42.510 --> 02:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
positions right um that gave us three
 
02:06:44.390 --> 02:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
positions and I think a million dollars
 
02:06:46.430 --> 02:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
to get after like veteran
 
02:06:49.790 --> 02:06:49.800 align:start position:0%
homelessness uh mental health and those
 
02:06:52.229 --> 02:06:52.239 align:start position:0%
are another one
 
02:06:54.310 --> 02:06:54.320 align:start position:0%
I don't see any position anyways last
 
02:06:56.149 --> 02:06:56.159 align:start position:0%
last time I went to the VA they wanted
 
02:06:58.549 --> 02:06:58.559 align:start position:0%
to make a big deal we exposed to agent
 
02:07:00.589 --> 02:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
orange I was in an airplane where it was
 
02:07:03.069 --> 02:07:03.079 align:start position:0%
being sprayed and and you know it was
 
02:07:05.510 --> 02:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
supposed to be a line like this where
 
02:07:07.430 --> 02:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
all the sprays going back but then we
 
02:07:09.629 --> 02:07:09.639 align:start position:0%
come to a hill this plane next to us
 
02:07:11.109 --> 02:07:11.119 align:start position:0%
goes up over the hill and we're down
 
02:07:12.549 --> 02:07:12.559 align:start position:0%
here and we're get sprayed and the
 
02:07:14.589 --> 02:07:14.599 align:start position:0%
windows are open in the airplane why do
 
02:07:16.470 --> 02:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
you open the windows so they won't break
 
02:07:18.470 --> 02:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
when the bullets hit them
 
02:07:23.109 --> 02:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
yeah to it
 
02:07:24.430 --> 02:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
so the other thing I'd say real quick
 
02:07:26.830 --> 02:07:26.840 align:start position:0%
too is um this division of community-
 
02:07:30.189 --> 02:07:30.199 align:start position:0%
based military programs has grown so in
 
02:07:31.709 --> 02:07:31.719 align:start position:0%
2019 when the governor signed the
 
02:07:33.229 --> 02:07:33.239 align:start position:0%
executive order and the legislature
 
02:07:34.790 --> 02:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
codified into law that changes from
 
02:07:36.830 --> 02:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
agent General's Department to military
 
02:07:39.109 --> 02:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
Affairs and veteran services it was two
 
02:07:40.549 --> 02:07:40.559 align:start position:0%
positions that came over from Health and
 
02:07:40.559 --> 02:07:41.589 align:start position:0%
positions that came over from Health and
Human

02:07:41.589 --> 02:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
Human
 
02:07:43.910 --> 02:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
Services I believe it was the last
 
02:07:46.189 --> 02:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
legislature you all gave us a mandate to
 
02:07:48.310 --> 02:07:48.320 align:start position:0%
hire three more State positions we went
 
02:07:51.149 --> 02:07:51.159 align:start position:0%
from two to five and now this year we're
 
02:07:53.510 --> 02:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
in the process of transferring a a one
 
02:07:56.830 --> 02:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
more State position from education to us
 
02:07:58.069 --> 02:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
which is called a state approval
 
02:07:59.510 --> 02:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
Authority it's a person that just
 
02:08:01.669 --> 02:08:01.679 align:start position:0%
certifies higher education is like meets
 
02:08:03.990 --> 02:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
like GI B criteria so we keep
 
02:08:06.709 --> 02:08:06.719 align:start position:0%
consolidating growing this I shouldn't
 
02:08:09.109 --> 02:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
say growing but like we've been mandated
 
02:08:11.629 --> 02:08:11.639 align:start position:0%
to like consolidate all these resources
 
02:08:13.229 --> 02:08:13.239 align:start position:0%
in this one
 
02:08:15.149 --> 02:08:15.159 align:start position:0%
division our division of veteran
 
02:08:16.669 --> 02:08:16.679 align:start position:0%
services and cemeteries generally
 
02:08:19.109 --> 02:08:19.119 align:start position:0%
haven't changed at all it's like 9 10
 
02:08:20.270 --> 02:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
employees for each of one of these
 
02:08:22.549 --> 02:08:22.559 align:start position:0%
portfolios this this one we've
 
02:08:24.990 --> 02:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
Consolidated other resources and that's
 
02:08:27.270 --> 02:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
why sometimes I think you see broader
 
02:08:28.990 --> 02:08:29.000 align:start position:0%
fluctuations in budget right I'll let
 
02:08:30.790 --> 02:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
represent months have the last question
 
02:08:32.790 --> 02:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
but we thank you and I just wanted to
 
02:08:35.430 --> 02:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
follow up on your questions about U the
 
02:08:37.149 --> 02:08:37.159 align:start position:0%
contracts for program Services because
 
02:08:39.229 --> 02:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I noticed is that
 
02:08:42.149 --> 02:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
there was an overall increase in in
 
02:08:44.069 --> 02:08:44.079 align:start position:0%
contracts for program Services of about
 
02:08:44.079 --> 02:08:45.549 align:start position:0%
contracts for program Services of about
$2.2

02:08:45.549 --> 02:08:45.559 align:start position:0%
$2.2
 
02:08:49.950 --> 02:08:49.960 align:start position:0%
million um I think from FY 24 to
 
02:08:53.189 --> 02:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
25 um and it sounds like a million of
 
02:08:55.790 --> 02:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
that may be what you what you just
 
02:08:58.709 --> 02:08:58.719 align:start position:0%
explained the the the state government
 
02:09:00.310 --> 02:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
giving you the authorization to move
 
02:09:02.990 --> 02:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
forward with those programs do you have
 
02:09:04.549 --> 02:09:04.559 align:start position:0%
any idea what the rest of the number
 
02:09:07.149 --> 02:09:07.159 align:start position:0%
money is for what what what what's
 
02:09:10.549 --> 02:09:10.559 align:start position:0%
driving that so I just want to uh make
 
02:09:12.790 --> 02:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
sure I understand the question yet so
 
02:09:14.470 --> 02:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
are you talking about the general fund
 
02:09:17.109 --> 02:09:17.119 align:start position:0%
the difference from fiscal years 24 the
 
02:09:19.790 --> 02:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
$2 million difference no I'm talk I'm
 
02:09:22.910 --> 02:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
talking about overall spending not to
 
02:09:25.310 --> 02:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
it's the expenses I'm not worried about
 
02:09:30.910 --> 02:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
the funding um when I when I looked at
 
02:09:32.910 --> 02:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
contracts for program services for the
 
02:09:32.920 --> 02:09:33.870 align:start position:0%
contracts for program services for the
entire

02:09:33.870 --> 02:09:33.880 align:start position:0%
entire
 
02:09:35.990 --> 02:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
department it looked like there was a
 
02:09:40.669 --> 02:09:40.679 align:start position:0%
$2.2 million increase from 24 to 25 and
 
02:09:43.629 --> 02:09:43.639 align:start position:0%
then that carried forward to 26 right so
 
02:09:45.189 --> 02:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
I'm trying trying to understand you know
 
02:09:49.750 --> 02:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
what the what that money was for so do
 
02:09:54.189 --> 02:09:54.199 align:start position:0%
that's for the 100% fed Z positions and
 
02:09:57.950 --> 02:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
the security guard
 
02:10:00.270 --> 02:10:00.280 align:start position:0%
oh good point so
 
02:10:02.990 --> 02:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
um is what did it increase or change
 
02:10:04.750 --> 02:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
increase we increase the security ta
 
02:10:07.510 --> 02:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
security so so I believe what you're
 
02:10:11.830 --> 02:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
referring to is um the we the security
 
02:10:13.950 --> 02:10:13.960 align:start position:0%
contract at both our like New Hampshire
 
02:10:16.229 --> 02:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
National Guard base at PE is a private
 
02:10:18.470 --> 02:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
contract Security Forces like our
 
02:10:20.910 --> 02:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
military personnel do not secure the
 
02:10:22.950 --> 02:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
international Nation Guard base and that
 
02:10:28.109 --> 02:10:28.119 align:start position:0%
contract is about 1.1 to $1.3 million a
 
02:10:31.830 --> 02:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
year yeah so basically we have the um B
 
02:10:34.549 --> 02:10:34.559 align:start position:0%
of Secura they do one is in the Army
 
02:10:36.669 --> 02:10:36.679 align:start position:0%
National Guard one's at the P Air
 
02:10:39.830 --> 02:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
National Guard so those is 100% Federal
 
02:10:44.270 --> 02:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
funding and uh when several things years
 
02:10:47.669 --> 02:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
the last years because we have a
 
02:10:49.709 --> 02:10:49.719 align:start position:0%
difficulty with the receive the full
 
02:10:52.229 --> 02:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
Federal funding so we change amend the
 
02:10:55.149 --> 02:10:55.159 align:start position:0%
contracts to decrease now so now we
 
02:10:57.830 --> 02:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
anticipate that the 100% federal funds
 
02:11:00.109 --> 02:11:00.119 align:start position:0%
will ful refund to us so that's why we
 
02:11:04.270 --> 02:11:04.280 align:start position:0%
increase uh the budget just make sure we
 
02:11:08.549 --> 02:11:08.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:12.990 --> 02:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:16.030 --> 02:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
right sorry uh you had you had mentioned
 
02:11:18.950 --> 02:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
up front and um that one of the the
 
02:11:23.549 --> 02:11:23.559 align:start position:0%
biggest challenges that um we face is uh
 
02:11:26.430 --> 02:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
the the the potential of federal of cuts
 
02:11:30.430 --> 02:11:30.440 align:start position:0%
at the federal level um and I see that
 
02:11:32.189 --> 02:11:32.199 align:start position:0%
you know in the news that there's talk
 
02:11:34.109 --> 02:11:34.119 align:start position:0%
of a of the the defense department
 
02:11:36.830 --> 02:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
cutting its budget by $50 billion every
 
02:11:40.109 --> 02:11:40.119 align:start position:0%
year going forward um do you have any
 
02:11:44.030 --> 02:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
sense yet as to what that would do to to
 
02:11:47.549 --> 02:11:47.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:50.950 --> 02:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
funding sir not yet what we do know is
 
02:11:50.960 --> 02:11:52.669 align:start position:0%
funding sir not yet what we do know is
um

02:11:52.669 --> 02:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:56.310 --> 02:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
we're losing people so we have U like I
 
02:11:58.470 --> 02:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
I jokingly tell people we have five HR
 
02:12:00.830 --> 02:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
departments full-time Army Air uh
 
02:12:02.350 --> 02:12:02.360 align:start position:0%
National Guard full-time Air National
 
02:12:04.149 --> 02:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
Guard then we we call this program
 
02:12:06.270 --> 02:12:06.280 align:start position:0%
called the title 32 dual status
 
02:12:08.430 --> 02:12:08.440 align:start position:0%
technician Army and air so you can be a
 
02:12:11.310 --> 02:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
gs12 and a federal employee and you're
 
02:12:14.030 --> 02:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
in the garden a week and a month but so
 
02:12:16.109 --> 02:12:16.119 align:start position:0%
it's like it's a so we have and then we
 
02:12:18.189 --> 02:12:18.199 align:start position:0%
have just Federal
 
02:12:21.189 --> 02:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
civilians the initial proposal for an 8%
 
02:12:24.069 --> 02:12:24.079 align:start position:0%
budget reduction in Personnel is the one
 
02:12:26.069 --> 02:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
we're worried about the most and we
 
02:12:27.950 --> 02:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
haven't seen other cuts to potential
 
02:12:29.510 --> 02:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
programs in the future so right now for
 
02:12:32.549 --> 02:12:32.559 align:start position:0%
us this sort of close Target is what is
 
02:12:34.430 --> 02:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
going to be the reduction on our federal
 
02:12:37.470 --> 02:12:37.480 align:start position:0%
Workforce and we know uh supposed to be
 
02:12:38.669 --> 02:12:38.679 align:start position:0%
today but I have to do Monday because
 
02:12:41.310 --> 02:12:41.320 align:start position:0%
some people on like vacation is uh
 
02:12:44.310 --> 02:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
people who uh does an email that went
 
02:12:46.870 --> 02:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
Elon Musk the fork in the road email
 
02:12:50.069 --> 02:12:50.079 align:start position:0%
people took that and so we get no
 
02:12:51.950 --> 02:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
backfill for those positions
 
02:12:53.990 --> 02:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
and then what's going to happen with
 
02:12:56.229 --> 02:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
probationary employees so generally with
 
02:12:58.030 --> 02:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
this federal government your first year
 
02:13:00.149 --> 02:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
is probationary they want to cut all
 
02:13:03.549 --> 02:13:03.559 align:start position:0%
those positions so
 
02:13:06.270 --> 02:13:06.280 align:start position:0%
so the initial concern for us that we
 
02:13:07.950 --> 02:13:07.960 align:start position:0%
actually know about is what will be the
 
02:13:10.310 --> 02:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
reduction in our federal Workforce we
 
02:13:11.669 --> 02:13:11.679 align:start position:0%
don't know what other programs in the
 
02:13:14.310 --> 02:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
future will be cut so wouldn't wouldn't
 
02:13:17.310 --> 02:13:17.320 align:start position:0%
it simply be instead of 3,000 soldiers
 
02:13:20.510 --> 02:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
you'll have 2700 or you know some
 
02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:22.030 align:start position:0%
you'll have 2700 or you know some
smaller

02:13:22.030 --> 02:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
smaller
 
02:13:25.270 --> 02:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
that's coming um right now it's the
 
02:13:26.950 --> 02:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
several hundred Federal civilians that
 
02:13:29.549 --> 02:13:29.559 align:start position:0%
we have I see who stays to support the
 
02:13:32.430 --> 02:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
men and women in uniform right so when
 
02:13:33.950 --> 02:13:33.960 align:start position:0%
you balance a state employees and
 
02:13:33.960 --> 02:13:34.870 align:start position:0%
you balance a state employees and
federal

02:13:34.870 --> 02:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
federal
 
02:13:37.470 --> 02:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
civilians uh and you don't see the cost
 
02:13:39.990 --> 02:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
of those federal payroll that's a SE
 
02:13:42.030 --> 02:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
distinct thing so we get like $200
 
02:13:43.870 --> 02:13:43.880 align:start position:0%
million a year to fund the military
 
02:13:45.950 --> 02:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
personnel and our federal civilians um
 
02:13:48.350 --> 02:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
that's just another sort of ancillary uh
 
02:13:51.189 --> 02:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
but when you when you talk about um you
 
02:13:53.790 --> 02:13:53.800 align:start position:0%
know reductions in in in staff I mean
 
02:13:56.950 --> 02:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
are you talking about the 129 or so
 
02:13:59.830 --> 02:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
people that you have these are other yes
 
02:14:02.030 --> 02:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
okay so it's a 3,000 other people we
 
02:14:04.950 --> 02:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
have so we have like 2,800 uniform
 
02:14:07.350 --> 02:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
Personnel yeah and another 200 or so
 
02:14:10.470 --> 02:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
Federal civilians then 129 State
 
02:14:12.310 --> 02:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
civilians that's why we like five HR
 
02:14:13.709 --> 02:14:13.719 align:start position:0%
departments oh because these These are
 
02:14:14.990 --> 02:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
people that are on the state payroll
 
02:14:17.109 --> 02:14:17.119 align:start position:0%
these are just state employees I got you
 
02:14:19.109 --> 02:14:19.119 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you very much
 
02:14:21.270 --> 02:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
general for coming thanks sir and we'll
 
02:14:23.870 --> 02:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
be back at 1:15 with the division of
 
02:14:28.870 --> 02:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:33.669 --> 02:14:33.679 align:start position:0%
resources the deputy the Warr Warren War
 
02:14:35.910 --> 02:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
he just retired turned 6 had his first
 
02:14:38.069 --> 02:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
grand kids and
 
02:14:43.549 --> 02:14:43.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:45.910 --> 02:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
Perry they didn't like to Army people so
 
02:14:47.990 --> 02:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
it's Army and Air
 
02:15:19.950 --> 02:15:19.960 align:start position:0%

03:16:22.830 --> 03:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
um if you'd be so kind um because the
 
03:16:25.510 --> 03:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
last time we met we were still reviewing
 
03:16:29.269 --> 03:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
a previous budget uh draft and um and
 
03:16:31.110 --> 03:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
now we have some more information for
 
03:16:35.630 --> 03:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
you so just for the people here we're on
 
03:16:35.640 --> 03:16:36.990 align:start position:0%
you so just for the people here we're on
page

03:16:36.990 --> 03:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
page
 
03:16:39.750 --> 03:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
602 to look at the the bottom line but
 
03:16:43.510 --> 03:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:47.710 --> 03:16:47.720 align:start position:0%
603 yeah thank you so DNC I
 
03:16:47.720 --> 03:16:49.229 align:start position:0%
603 yeah thank you so DNC I
am

03:16:49.229 --> 03:16:49.239 align:start position:0%
am
 
03:16:53.910 --> 03:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
um yeah well so um so this Governor's
 
03:16:57.189 --> 03:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
budget um re Governor aat budget reduces
 
03:17:00.830 --> 03:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
the general fund overall um by
 
03:17:03.349 --> 03:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
3.79% and within that you will see our
 
03:17:05.870 --> 03:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
agency made an 11% reduction to our
 
03:17:09.229 --> 03:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
general funds we we have gone from a
 
03:17:12.189 --> 03:17:12.199 align:start position:0%
general fund total of
 
03:17:15.389 --> 03:17:15.399 align:start position:0%
11,27 th000 plus change in fiscal year
 
03:17:19.910 --> 03:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:25.070 --> 03:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
9,955 th000 in fiscal year 2026 and
 
03:17:29.309 --> 03:17:29.319 align:start position:0%
9,951 in fiscal year
 
03:17:32.510 --> 03:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
27 thank you that's well I I'll point
 
03:17:35.429 --> 03:17:35.439 align:start position:0%
out that this number is what you spent
 
03:17:35.439 --> 03:17:36.830 align:start position:0%
out that this number is what you spent
in

03:17:36.830 --> 03:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:17:39.830 --> 03:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
2024 right so it's it's not what was
 
03:17:43.110 --> 03:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
budgeted but it's what was spent so it's
 
03:17:45.349 --> 03:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
I'll have more or less the same level I
 
03:17:47.030 --> 03:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
have Chris Marino with me whenever we
 
03:17:50.150 --> 03:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
talk numbers and he will look at that um
 
03:17:53.830 --> 03:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
so the entire budget for dncr for fiscal
 
03:17:57.110 --> 03:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
year 26 and 27 is about 65 million with
 
03:17:58.750 --> 03:17:58.760 align:start position:0%
a vast majority of our funding coming
 
03:18:00.910 --> 03:18:00.920 align:start position:0%
through Revenue the remaining General
 
03:18:03.790 --> 03:18:03.800 align:start position:0%
funds after our 11% reduction is
 
03:18:05.590 --> 03:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
critical to maintain the federal match
 
03:18:07.469 --> 03:18:07.479 align:start position:0%
money available to provide important
 
03:18:10.429 --> 03:18:10.439 align:start position:0%
services to our constituents for
 
03:18:12.189 --> 03:18:12.199 align:start position:0%
instance we are preserving the general
 
03:18:14.269 --> 03:18:14.279 align:start position:0%
fund allocation to the division of
 
03:18:16.349 --> 03:18:16.359 align:start position:0%
historical resources to maintain the
 
03:18:19.030 --> 03:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
review and compliance program in section
 
03:18:22.110 --> 03:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
106 the loss of this program would stop
 
03:18:24.870 --> 03:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
all state and federal project permitting
 
03:18:27.189 --> 03:18:27.199 align:start position:0%
that would not be good we are reducing
 
03:18:29.349 --> 03:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
the general fund allocation to the Arts
 
03:18:32.590 --> 03:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
by an additional 110,000 in Grants from
 
03:18:35.110 --> 03:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
the initial 300,000 we submitted during
 
03:18:39.030 --> 03:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
the agency phase for 26 and 500,000 for
 
03:18:41.950 --> 03:18:41.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 27 making the total amount
 
03:18:46.030 --> 03:18:46.040 align:start position:0%
cut to equal 410,000 in fiscal year 26
 
03:18:47.229 --> 03:18:47.239 align:start position:0%
and 600
 
03:18:50.910 --> 03:18:50.920 align:start position:0%
0,000 for fiscal year 27 additionally we
 
03:18:53.229 --> 03:18:53.239 align:start position:0%
are unfund a vacant General funded
 
03:18:55.030 --> 03:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
position cutting another
 
03:18:59.550 --> 03:18:59.560 align:start position:0%
80,000 plus in fiscal year 26 and 85,000
 
03:19:02.309 --> 03:19:02.319 align:start position:0%
Plus in 27 and with a staff of only
 
03:19:04.030 --> 03:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
seven in this division losing one
 
03:19:06.229 --> 03:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
full-time employee creates a workload
 
03:19:07.950 --> 03:19:07.960 align:start position:0%
impact on the entire
 
03:19:10.229 --> 03:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
team with the reality that the State
 
03:19:12.150 --> 03:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
Library must show a specif with the
 
03:19:13.910 --> 03:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
reality that the State Library must show
 
03:19:15.870 --> 03:19:15.880 align:start position:0%
a specific amount allocated by the
 
03:19:18.030 --> 03:19:18.040 align:start position:0%
general fund to to reach the threshold
 
03:19:20.070 --> 03:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
of Eligibility to receive federal
 
03:19:22.269 --> 03:19:22.279 align:start position:0%
funding as required by the federal
 
03:19:24.990 --> 03:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
program here we have focused on the
 
03:19:28.229 --> 03:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
unfund of two vacant General funded
 
03:19:30.910 --> 03:19:30.920 align:start position:0%
positions uh totaling
 
03:19:36.070 --> 03:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
$168,000 126 and 174 in 27 combined with
 
03:19:38.590 --> 03:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
a general fund cut of
 
03:19:41.550 --> 03:19:41.560 align:start position:0%
15533 in 26 and
 
03:19:45.309 --> 03:19:45.319 align:start position:0%
3510 in fiscal year 27 uh that's the
 
03:19:48.830 --> 03:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
publication budget this combination of
 
03:19:50.830 --> 03:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
cuts will prevent us from losing our
 
03:19:52.670 --> 03:19:52.680 align:start position:0%
required Federal funding match and will
 
03:19:54.309 --> 03:19:54.319 align:start position:0%
avoid the need for cutting critical
 
03:19:56.269 --> 03:19:56.279 align:start position:0%
services like our inter Library Loan
 
03:19:59.349 --> 03:19:59.359 align:start position:0%
program or our talking books program if
 
03:20:01.110 --> 03:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
we have to make any further Cuts we will
 
03:20:03.349 --> 03:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
need to close public access to the main
 
03:20:05.389 --> 03:20:05.399 align:start position:0%
library building for at minimum one day
 
03:20:07.750 --> 03:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
a week as additional positions would be
 
03:20:11.670 --> 03:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
cut necessita necessitating this drastic
 
03:20:14.229 --> 03:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
action the division of forest and lands
 
03:20:15.990 --> 03:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
is home to our forest rangers who are
 
03:20:17.389 --> 03:20:17.399 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
03:20:19.229 --> 03:20:19.239 align:start position:0%
in September we submitted a budget that
 
03:20:22.830 --> 03:20:22.840 align:start position:0%
unfund one vacant forest ranger position
 
03:20:24.710 --> 03:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
rather than cut the Rangers further as
 
03:20:27.710 --> 03:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
we only have 10 in order to meet further
 
03:20:30.429 --> 03:20:30.439 align:start position:0%
General funded cut targets we decided to
 
03:20:32.349 --> 03:20:32.359 align:start position:0%
shift the funding of three generally
 
03:20:33.830 --> 03:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
funded staff
 
03:20:36.030 --> 03:20:36.040 align:start position:0%
positions in the forest management
 
03:20:38.309 --> 03:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
Bureau to our revolving fund which is
 
03:20:39.750 --> 03:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
called the forest management and
 
03:20:42.910 --> 03:20:42.920 align:start position:0%
protection fund this fund is reliant on
 
03:20:45.110 --> 03:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
our division's own revenues from Timber
 
03:20:47.269 --> 03:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
harvests on state land under the
 
03:20:50.030 --> 03:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
management of this agency the timber is
 
03:20:52.389 --> 03:20:52.399 align:start position:0%
sold to private logging companies and
 
03:20:53.790 --> 03:20:53.800 align:start position:0%
Sawmills throughout through a
 
03:20:56.590 --> 03:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
competitive bidding process the revenue
 
03:20:58.790 --> 03:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
covers not only most of our forest
 
03:21:00.590 --> 03:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
management Bureau staff but also
 
03:21:02.870 --> 03:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
critical expenses such as vehicles and
 
03:21:05.510 --> 03:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
computer equipment for most of the
 
03:21:07.550 --> 03:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
division besides being the primary
 
03:21:09.309 --> 03:21:09.319 align:start position:0%
funding source of the forest management
 
03:21:11.630 --> 03:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
Bureau the timber sale program also has
 
03:21:13.990 --> 03:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
a significant economic impact on the
 
03:21:17.349 --> 03:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
public sector on average it generate
 
03:21:21.429 --> 03:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
$160,000 of Timber tax an oh this is I
 
03:21:24.030 --> 03:21:24.040 align:start position:0%
screwed this one up Timber tax annually
 
03:21:25.550 --> 03:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
distributed to the towns where the
 
03:21:27.150 --> 03:21:27.160 align:start position:0%
timber is harvested if you're following
 
03:21:28.750 --> 03:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
along that was a
 
03:21:31.389 --> 03:21:31.399 align:start position:0%
glitch additionally dozens of logging
 
03:21:33.750 --> 03:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
and trucking companies benefit as do the
 
03:21:36.309 --> 03:21:36.319 align:start position:0%
local sawmills that rely on state lands
 
03:21:38.830 --> 03:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
to procure their wood supply Studies
 
03:21:40.630 --> 03:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
have shown an economic multiplier
 
03:21:43.429 --> 03:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
upwards of $30 for every $1 of revenue
 
03:21:46.790 --> 03:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
generated from the sale of Timber
 
03:21:48.710 --> 03:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
moving generally funded Forest
 
03:21:50.750 --> 03:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
management Bureau positions to funding
 
03:21:52.710 --> 03:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
from Timber sale Revenue in the forest
 
03:21:54.550 --> 03:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
management and protection fund will
 
03:21:57.189 --> 03:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
reduce general fund costs by nearly
 
03:22:00.389 --> 03:22:00.399 align:start position:0%
$520,000 in fiscal year 26 and
 
03:22:02.950 --> 03:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
27 there is a strong concern however
 
03:22:04.630 --> 03:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
that we are now over obligating the
 
03:22:06.630 --> 03:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
forest management and protection fund to
 
03:22:09.189 --> 03:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
take on more operational expenses than
 
03:22:12.269 --> 03:22:12.279 align:start position:0%
it can sustain over the long
 
03:22:14.830 --> 03:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
term we have also considered shifting
 
03:22:17.469 --> 03:22:17.479 align:start position:0%
Wildfire Patrol position costs to
 
03:22:19.309 --> 03:22:19.319 align:start position:0%
federal funds to cover these
 
03:22:21.229 --> 03:22:21.239 align:start position:0%
expenditures with Federal grant funds
 
03:22:22.990 --> 03:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
the fire tower positions would go
 
03:22:25.670 --> 03:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
unfunded and thereby eliminate 10
 
03:22:27.830 --> 03:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
part-time seasonal forestry Aid
 
03:22:30.429 --> 03:22:30.439 align:start position:0%
positions who staff the fire towers for
 
03:22:33.070 --> 03:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
fire detection this would be in addition
 
03:22:35.110 --> 03:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
to not funding a full-time forest ranger
 
03:22:37.429 --> 03:22:37.439 align:start position:0%
position and reducing the Wildfire fight
 
03:22:39.349 --> 03:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
detection budget by
 
03:22:41.870 --> 03:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
62% the current and proposed budget
 
03:22:43.630 --> 03:22:43.640 align:start position:0%
reductions will have an impact on the
 
03:22:45.830 --> 03:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
Department's ability to provide Wildfire
 
03:22:48.110 --> 03:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
detection suppression prevention and
 
03:22:50.790 --> 03:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
Forest Law Enforcement throughout the
 
03:22:52.830 --> 03:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
state while the division of Parks and
 
03:22:55.110 --> 03:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
Recreation is operationally self-funded
 
03:22:56.830 --> 03:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
they have stepped up to support the
 
03:22:58.990 --> 03:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
traditionally General funded Bureau of
 
03:23:01.349 --> 03:23:01.359 align:start position:0%
historic sites they will support this
 
03:23:02.990 --> 03:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
Bureau with $
 
03:23:06.830 --> 03:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
56,600 and
 
03:23:10.750 --> 03:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
5988 respectfully for the years 26 and
 
03:23:14.630 --> 03:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
27 the impact simply put removes money
 
03:23:18.070 --> 03:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
from the park system uh which is used to
 
03:23:19.229 --> 03:23:19.239 align:start position:0%
uh keep up with maintenance
 
03:23:20.670 --> 03:23:20.680 align:start position:0%
infrastructure improvements and their
 
03:23:22.229 --> 03:23:22.239 align:start position:0%
rainy day
 
03:23:24.790 --> 03:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
fund finally from the commissioner's
 
03:23:27.389 --> 03:23:27.399 align:start position:0%
office we are profer up a critical
 
03:23:29.830 --> 03:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
position unfund our funded vacant
 
03:23:32.790 --> 03:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
in-house Legal Professional position the
 
03:23:35.550 --> 03:23:35.560 align:start position:0%
dncr is engaged in hundreds of contracts
 
03:23:37.630 --> 03:23:37.640 align:start position:0%
leases and other complex scenarios with
 
03:23:40.510 --> 03:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
outside organizations regularly and we
 
03:23:42.110 --> 03:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
depend heavily on the Office of the
 
03:23:44.349 --> 03:23:44.359 align:start position:0%
Attorney General their legal counsil
 
03:23:47.030 --> 03:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
team to support us in these endeavors
 
03:23:48.229 --> 03:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
in determining that it would be
 
03:23:49.630 --> 03:23:49.640 align:start position:0%
essential for us to have a full-time
 
03:23:52.349 --> 03:23:52.359 align:start position:0%
dedicated legal representation resource
 
03:23:54.550 --> 03:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
to keep up in a timely fashion with our
 
03:23:56.750 --> 03:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
legal needs to that end we worked with
 
03:23:59.110 --> 03:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
doj to craft a position to support us
 
03:24:01.469 --> 03:24:01.479 align:start position:0%
internally and provide a more efficient
 
03:24:03.830 --> 03:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
tether to their Department without this
 
03:24:05.990 --> 03:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
position we rely solely on the precious
 
03:24:08.950 --> 03:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
time assigned to us by doj filling this
 
03:24:10.550 --> 03:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
position would be a win-win for both
 
03:24:12.630 --> 03:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
agencies but we will have to wait until
 
03:24:15.229 --> 03:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
we can afford this opportunity and I
 
03:24:16.990 --> 03:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
want to end by saying very proud of the
 
03:24:19.389 --> 03:24:19.399 align:start position:0%
hard work my team has taken on to bring
 
03:24:21.670 --> 03:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
forward a budget that while is a little
 
03:24:24.189 --> 03:24:24.199 align:start position:0%
painful it is in line with the goals of
 
03:24:25.790 --> 03:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
the state to ensure a fiscally
 
03:24:28.189 --> 03:24:28.199 align:start position:0%
responsible budget for the next
 
03:24:30.830 --> 03:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
Byam thank you very much you're welcome
 
03:24:33.389 --> 03:24:33.399 align:start position:0%
and we're here to answer questions okay
 
03:24:35.309 --> 03:24:35.319 align:start position:0%
so let's go to page
 
03:24:35.319 --> 03:24:37.110 align:start position:0%
so let's go to page
602

03:24:37.110 --> 03:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
602
 
03:24:40.590 --> 03:24:40.600 align:start position:0%
um so as I said General funds looks like
 
03:24:43.429 --> 03:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
it's um in line with what you spent last
 
03:24:47.870 --> 03:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
year which is good um the uh I want to
 
03:24:50.269 --> 03:24:50.279 align:start position:0%
ask federal funds seem to be declining
 
03:24:53.389 --> 03:24:53.399 align:start position:0%
right so uh last year it was 7.2 this
 
03:24:56.189 --> 03:24:56.199 align:start position:0%
year it's budgeted at 8.9 probably I'm
 
03:24:58.630 --> 03:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
guessing it doesn't come in that level
 
03:25:02.550 --> 03:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
but it's going to only six million so um
 
03:25:04.469 --> 03:25:04.479 align:start position:0%
are we losing some kind of federal
 
03:25:07.309 --> 03:25:07.319 align:start position:0%
grants or something is in thanks for the
 
03:25:08.990 --> 03:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
question so we're not actually losing
 
03:25:11.469 --> 03:25:11.479 align:start position:0%
grants in this case what we did was we
 
03:25:13.870 --> 03:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
sort of dialed some of the
 
03:25:16.349 --> 03:25:16.359 align:start position:0%
Appropriations that we typically
 
03:25:18.710 --> 03:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
estimate going forward uh and and tried
 
03:25:20.070 --> 03:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
to bring them back down to a more
 
03:25:21.870 --> 03:25:21.880 align:start position:0%
realistic number relative to what's
 
03:25:23.950 --> 03:25:23.960 align:start position:0%
actually spent on a yearly basis there
 
03:25:26.870 --> 03:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
were years where we were hoping to
 
03:25:28.870 --> 03:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
receive significant amounts of federal
 
03:25:31.189 --> 03:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
funds which we will do but we also have
 
03:25:33.630 --> 03:25:33.640 align:start position:0%
many years to spend them but we were
 
03:25:36.110 --> 03:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
budgeting the whole amount on a yearly
 
03:25:38.349 --> 03:25:38.359 align:start position:0%
basis so what I tried to do this time
 
03:25:40.950 --> 03:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
around was bring that number back to be
 
03:25:42.910 --> 03:25:42.920 align:start position:0%
more realistic to what we actually spend
 
03:25:44.469 --> 03:25:44.479 align:start position:0%
on a yearly basis so that's all that
 
03:25:47.229 --> 03:25:47.239 align:start position:0%
really is we haven't lost necessar neily
 
03:25:49.189 --> 03:25:49.199 align:start position:0%
Federal funding that has been available
 
03:25:52.550 --> 03:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
to us for for many years we've just
 
03:25:54.269 --> 03:25:54.279 align:start position:0%
tried to budget and appropriate in a
 
03:25:57.189 --> 03:25:57.199 align:start position:0%
little more of a conservative fashion to
 
03:25:58.870 --> 03:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
stay in step with what actually go out
 
03:25:59.990 --> 03:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
the door I see so what you're saying is
 
03:26:02.710 --> 03:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
I see six million of spending but the
 
03:26:04.750 --> 03:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
amount coming in could be seven it could
 
03:26:06.469 --> 03:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
be five it could be some other number it
 
03:26:08.870 --> 03:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
can fluctuate cor absolutely so again
 
03:26:11.150 --> 03:26:11.160 align:start position:0%
trying to stay in step with what we know
 
03:26:12.950 --> 03:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
at a at a point in time but those
 
03:26:15.389 --> 03:26:15.399 align:start position:0%
numbers do change I get it yes now in
 
03:26:17.630 --> 03:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
other funds which I assume is the park
 
03:26:22.590 --> 03:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
fees mostly um maybe other kinds of fees
 
03:26:25.510 --> 03:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh you're expecting to go up 5 million a
 
03:26:28.309 --> 03:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
year is roughly a little more than 10%
 
03:26:31.229 --> 03:26:31.239 align:start position:0%
looks like 12% or so um from what you
 
03:26:34.550 --> 03:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
got last year so is that realistic are
 
03:26:37.870 --> 03:26:37.880 align:start position:0%
you raising fees well there's two parts
 
03:26:40.750 --> 03:26:40.760 align:start position:0%
to two answers to that one yes fees were
 
03:26:43.590 --> 03:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
raised fees have changed um through a
 
03:26:45.670 --> 03:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
series of fee package submissions that
 
03:26:46.950 --> 03:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
have occurred
 
03:26:48.870 --> 03:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
um but this number the the difference
 
03:26:50.870 --> 03:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
that you see is
 
03:26:54.950 --> 03:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
essentially budgeting 24 is actuals 25
 
03:26:56.630 --> 03:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
is an adjusted authorized there is an
 
03:27:00.030 --> 03:27:00.040 align:start position:0%
element of of estimating in that figure
 
03:27:01.910 --> 03:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
um we're hopeful to to meet those
 
03:27:05.469 --> 03:27:05.479 align:start position:0%
targets but we may not with the increase
 
03:27:07.030 --> 03:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
in the fees we hope to come close to
 
03:27:09.790 --> 03:27:09.800 align:start position:0%
that number and then going into 26 and
 
03:27:12.710 --> 03:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
27 we tried to keep that flat keep that
 
03:27:14.349 --> 03:27:14.359 align:start position:0%
consistent and that's why those numbers
 
03:27:16.189 --> 03:27:16.199 align:start position:0%
look the way they do what what kind of
 
03:27:18.710 --> 03:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
changes have there been in fees so one
 
03:27:21.630 --> 03:27:21.640 align:start position:0%
example is a $1 an hour increase at our
 
03:27:24.590 --> 03:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
Hampton Beach toll uh parking meters so
 
03:27:27.389 --> 03:27:27.399 align:start position:0%
that went up from $2 to $3 and we
 
03:27:29.750 --> 03:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
automated the system um so that people
 
03:27:31.750 --> 03:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
could be on the beach reading their book
 
03:27:33.229 --> 03:27:33.239 align:start position:0%
and just put more money in with their
 
03:27:35.990 --> 03:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
phone uh which is which is um something
 
03:27:40.269 --> 03:27:40.279 align:start position:0%
that they that is uh very uh appreciated
 
03:27:42.590 --> 03:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
um so that was an incremental change um
 
03:27:45.269 --> 03:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
we just went to fiscal with a couple of
 
03:27:48.790 --> 03:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
tweaks to the C Mountain um ski package
 
03:27:52.030 --> 03:27:52.040 align:start position:0%
for next season again really incremental
 
03:27:54.910 --> 03:27:54.920 align:start position:0%
but we're you know over the last year or
 
03:27:57.710 --> 03:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
two we've been scrutinizing our fee
 
03:28:01.070 --> 03:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
package so that we don't create harm in
 
03:28:04.750 --> 03:28:04.760 align:start position:0%
uh and and overwhelm people but we tweak
 
03:28:07.110 --> 03:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
a couple things here and there that that
 
03:28:09.189 --> 03:28:09.199 align:start position:0%
really benefit us when when the um the
 
03:28:11.189 --> 03:28:11.199 align:start position:0%
wage increase for state employees
 
03:28:12.750 --> 03:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
happened it was really important that we
 
03:28:15.269 --> 03:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
were able to dial up the Hampton meters
 
03:28:17.349 --> 03:28:17.359 align:start position:0%
because the general fund you know didn't
 
03:28:19.510 --> 03:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
pay for that wage increase and we were
 
03:28:22.070 --> 03:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
able to compensate for it with that in
 
03:28:25.830 --> 03:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
increment okay so one thing we we look
 
03:28:29.389 --> 03:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
at to see um if people are on track sort
 
03:28:32.910 --> 03:28:32.920 align:start position:0%
of is we look at um what they spent in
 
03:28:35.510 --> 03:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
2019 compared to what they're spending
 
03:28:41.229 --> 03:28:41.239 align:start position:0%
today and um so fiscal year 25 to 2019
 
03:28:44.389 --> 03:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
is six years and in that period your
 
03:28:46.710 --> 03:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
general funds went up 4
 
03:28:51.189 --> 03:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
36% now that compares to like 30% if you
 
03:28:54.429 --> 03:28:54.439 align:start position:0%
look at uh inflation and and growth of
 
03:28:58.269 --> 03:28:58.279 align:start position:0%
the state so you're considerably over in
 
03:29:01.870 --> 03:29:01.880 align:start position:0%
the use of General funds lately sort of
 
03:29:03.950 --> 03:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
uh I'll speak to one point and then I'll
 
03:29:08.429 --> 03:29:08.439 align:start position:0%
let Chris correct me um so uh over the
 
03:29:10.830 --> 03:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
last couple years our general fund
 
03:29:14.389 --> 03:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
allocation for the Arts has increased um
 
03:29:17.189 --> 03:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
it doubled um so that's one area where
 
03:29:18.710 --> 03:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
we were able to get support from
 
03:29:22.070 --> 03:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
governor cunu and legislation to to dial
 
03:29:24.189 --> 03:29:24.199 align:start position:0%
that up um which had not seen an
 
03:29:25.870 --> 03:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
increase in a very long time so that's
 
03:29:28.870 --> 03:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
one example okay yeah and that would be
 
03:29:30.469 --> 03:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
thank you that would be the most
 
03:29:33.269 --> 03:29:33.279 align:start position:0%
significant example uh that went from a
 
03:29:34.710 --> 03:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
half a million dollars a year to a
 
03:29:36.349 --> 03:29:36.359 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year so that added a
 
03:29:39.269 --> 03:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
million dollars per bium to the general
 
03:29:41.389 --> 03:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
fund alone between that period and and
 
03:29:44.309 --> 03:29:44.319 align:start position:0%
this period um we of course know that
 
03:29:46.070 --> 03:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
with the with the pay increases of of
 
03:29:47.670 --> 03:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
course that probably accounts for with
 
03:29:50.030 --> 03:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
the 30% average that you just mentioned
 
03:29:52.150 --> 03:29:52.160 align:start position:0%
yeah we're a little bit higher than that
 
03:29:55.030 --> 03:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh not only because of the increase in
 
03:29:56.950 --> 03:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
the Arts which was a substantial
 
03:29:59.349 --> 03:29:59.359 align:start position:0%
component of that but other small uh
 
03:30:01.469 --> 03:30:01.479 align:start position:0%
changes such as for example the forest
 
03:30:03.349 --> 03:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
Protection Bureau which received a
 
03:30:06.269 --> 03:30:06.279 align:start position:0%
significant increase uh in Pay due to an
 
03:30:09.030 --> 03:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
allocation adjustment for pay for that
 
03:30:11.910 --> 03:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
particular group um as a group two uh
 
03:30:13.990 --> 03:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
staff so that was a substantial amount
 
03:30:16.429 --> 03:30:16.439 align:start position:0%
as well those are some of the the pieces
 
03:30:19.550 --> 03:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
that would contribute to that amount
 
03:30:20.990 --> 03:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
higher than the average but I can get
 
03:30:23.150 --> 03:30:23.160 align:start position:0%
you the details if you would like just
 
03:30:25.229 --> 03:30:25.239 align:start position:0%
to to do that further analysis to to
 
03:30:26.990 --> 03:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
clarify that for you okay do you have a
 
03:30:28.469 --> 03:30:28.479 align:start position:0%
lot of group two
 
03:30:31.229 --> 03:30:31.239 align:start position:0%
employees relatively speaking no I think
 
03:30:35.110 --> 03:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
the total is I think 11 or 12 um Forest
 
03:30:38.189 --> 03:30:38.199 align:start position:0%
ranges out of 200 out of 200 yes yeah
 
03:30:41.590 --> 03:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
okay all right shall we go to page
 
03:30:43.309 --> 03:30:43.319 align:start position:0%
something else repres
 
03:30:46.030 --> 03:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
wer you show as a number of employees
 
03:30:48.630 --> 03:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
about 200 but when I get the information
 
03:30:51.830 --> 03:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
from the treasurer of how many paychecks
 
03:30:54.590 --> 03:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
went to your department it's like 500
 
03:30:57.830 --> 03:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
going in seasonally up to 800 almost 900
 
03:30:59.630 --> 03:30:59.640 align:start position:0%
and then yes back to 5 we like to give
 
03:31:02.309 --> 03:31:02.319 align:start position:0%
our employees multiple just kidding
 
03:31:05.710 --> 03:31:05.720 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of temps sure no we
 
03:31:08.429 --> 03:31:08.439 align:start position:0%
probably not the Right
 
03:31:11.429 --> 03:31:11.439 align:start position:0%
audience how does she how you give out
 
03:31:14.269 --> 03:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
500 so we have so many seasonal
 
03:31:17.030 --> 03:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
employees um that goes up to 800
 
03:31:19.710 --> 03:31:19.720 align:start position:0%
something in in this summertime yes but
 
03:31:22.030 --> 03:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
it's you still only showed 200 here but
 
03:31:23.790 --> 03:31:23.800 align:start position:0%
this shows most of the months of the
 
03:31:26.550 --> 03:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
year it's 500 so we I mean we have we
 
03:31:28.910 --> 03:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
have winter seasonals as well at Canon
 
03:31:34.229 --> 03:31:34.239 align:start position:0%
for example um and um yeah so I'm happy
 
03:31:37.510 --> 03:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
to clarify so yeah the 200 uh plus 200
 
03:31:40.070 --> 03:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
well be 202 I think it was 210 this past
 
03:31:42.469 --> 03:31:42.479 align:start position:0%
by anym uh is is a combination of
 
03:31:44.429 --> 03:31:44.439 align:start position:0%
permanent classified and unclassified
 
03:31:48.229 --> 03:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
positions only we we also have about 30
 
03:31:50.150 --> 03:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
full-time temps that are budgeted on a
 
03:31:52.670 --> 03:31:52.680 align:start position:0%
banal basis and then of course beyond
 
03:31:56.670 --> 03:31:56.680 align:start position:0%
that is many mo many many temp positions
 
03:31:59.110 --> 03:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh used for firefighting which H which
 
03:32:01.189 --> 03:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
occurs at different periods of the year
 
03:32:03.070 --> 03:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
but most significantly keeping those
 
03:32:06.150 --> 03:32:06.160 align:start position:0%
numbers up is the 300 plus that are
 
03:32:07.870 --> 03:32:07.880 align:start position:0%
employed during the winter for Canon as
 
03:32:10.110 --> 03:32:10.120 align:start position:0%
seasonals and then the over 800 that
 
03:32:12.110 --> 03:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
occur during the summertime uh for the
 
03:32:14.910 --> 03:32:14.920 align:start position:0%
park system so that it big recruiting
 
03:32:18.110 --> 03:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
job thank you yes how many of the 210
 
03:32:20.510 --> 03:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
are vacant
 
03:32:24.070 --> 03:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
currently we have I have that list right
 
03:32:27.429 --> 03:32:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:30.469 --> 03:32:30.479 align:start position:0%
me of the
 
03:32:34.670 --> 03:32:34.680 align:start position:0%
210 and that would be just the
 
03:32:36.910 --> 03:32:36.920 align:start position:0%
full-time I'm sorry excuse me just one
 
03:32:41.189 --> 03:32:41.199 align:start position:0%
second here my paper is yeah that's all
 
03:32:43.550 --> 03:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
right it's actually in the package uh
 
03:32:44.550 --> 03:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
that I
 
03:32:49.309 --> 03:32:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:52.630 --> 03:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
here we go this would be uh page
 
03:32:55.189 --> 03:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
six uh in the package there are
 
03:33:00.030 --> 03:33:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:04.269 --> 03:33:04.279 align:start position:0%
full-time three four five six seven 8 N9
 
03:33:09.389 --> 03:33:09.399 align:start position:0%
10 11 A Lot 12 there are 12 permanent
 
03:33:11.510 --> 03:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
classified and one unclassified combined
 
03:33:13.710 --> 03:33:13.720 align:start position:0%
total uh currently
 
03:33:16.469 --> 03:33:16.479 align:start position:0%
vacant oh I see
 
03:33:17.670 --> 03:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
most of which are in the Parks and
 
03:33:19.590 --> 03:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
Recreation division which is an other
 
03:33:21.550 --> 03:33:21.560 align:start position:0%
funded uh
 
03:33:24.469 --> 03:33:24.479 align:start position:0%
position or other funded positions so
 
03:33:27.670 --> 03:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
what is this long list then uh this list
 
03:33:30.910 --> 03:33:30.920 align:start position:0%
was provided uh to identify
 
03:33:33.910 --> 03:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
all vacant funded
 
03:33:38.309 --> 03:33:38.319 align:start position:0%
positions uh currently uh in
 
03:33:40.990 --> 03:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
fy2 uh both full-time and
 
03:33:44.349 --> 03:33:44.359 align:start position:0%
part-time permanent classified and
 
03:33:46.630 --> 03:33:46.640 align:start position:0%
temporary oh I see so all these
 
03:33:49.030 --> 03:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
firefighters are temporary correct in
 
03:33:50.750 --> 03:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
case you have a fire
 
03:33:55.150 --> 03:33:55.160 align:start position:0%
right okay makes sense I see thank you
 
03:33:58.990 --> 03:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
all right let's go to page let's see
 
03:34:02.070 --> 03:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
here um
 
03:34:02.080 --> 03:34:08.229 align:start position:0%
here um
537

03:34:08.229 --> 03:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:16.269 --> 03:34:16.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:16.279 --> 03:34:20.830 align:start position:0%
 
all

03:34:20.830 --> 03:34:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:24.030 --> 03:34:24.040 align:start position:0%
right so administ were there were there
 
03:34:26.990 --> 03:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
vacancies in 2024 in the administration
 
03:34:29.870 --> 03:34:29.880 align:start position:0%
or maybe there are some still now uh
 
03:34:31.790 --> 03:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
there is currently one vacant uh
 
03:34:33.830 --> 03:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
position in administration it is the
 
03:34:36.429 --> 03:34:36.439 align:start position:0%
attorney position which we are actually
 
03:34:38.910 --> 03:34:38.920 align:start position:0%
26 27 yes that's the only vacant
 
03:34:41.150 --> 03:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
position right now in our but we're not
 
03:34:42.309 --> 03:34:42.319 align:start position:0%
getting rid of
 
03:34:45.750 --> 03:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
it yes we're not we are we unfunded it
 
03:34:47.830 --> 03:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
UNF funding it for 26 and right but we
 
03:34:50.550 --> 03:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
didn't um remove the position we haven't
 
03:34:52.269 --> 03:34:52.279 align:start position:0%
removed the position because the 19 is
 
03:34:55.269 --> 03:34:55.279 align:start position:0%
still 19 we were we simply uh retained
 
03:34:58.269 --> 03:34:58.279 align:start position:0%
it as an unfunded FTE okay so Jack maybe
 
03:35:00.030 --> 03:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
make a note of that
 
03:35:03.790 --> 03:35:03.800 align:start position:0%
one okay
 
03:35:06.830 --> 03:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
um representative evil yeah just on on
 
03:35:08.750 --> 03:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
UNF funding just because something is
 
03:35:10.950 --> 03:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
unfunded it doesn't mean that it's not
 
03:35:13.790 --> 03:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps vital to your
 
03:35:16.510 --> 03:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
operations C I'm sorry for for this one
 
03:35:18.670 --> 03:35:18.680 align:start position:0%
specifically we worked really hard to
 
03:35:21.510 --> 03:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
achieve this position and fund it um as
 
03:35:24.389 --> 03:35:24.399 align:start position:0%
I mentioned we worked closely with doj
 
03:35:26.990 --> 03:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
um we have a really close working
 
03:35:30.150 --> 03:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
relationship with the team over there um
 
03:35:34.550 --> 03:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
but our workload is immense um and I
 
03:35:36.229 --> 03:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
think we could we could open our own Law
 
03:35:37.309 --> 03:35:37.319 align:start position:0%
Firm at the
 
03:35:40.710 --> 03:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
dncr um so I'd like someday to get back
 
03:35:42.510 --> 03:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
to a place where we can have that
 
03:35:44.150 --> 03:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
position I think it would streamline a
 
03:35:46.429 --> 03:35:46.439 align:start position:0%
lot of our legal documents it would be
 
03:35:49.030 --> 03:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
nice to have somebody with a a legal
 
03:35:51.670 --> 03:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
interpretation at some of our meetings
 
03:35:54.630 --> 03:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
um and when we uh when we develop
 
03:35:56.510 --> 03:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
relationships you know let's do it right
 
03:35:59.550 --> 03:35:59.560 align:start position:0%
the first time um so to speak so I think
 
03:36:02.229 --> 03:36:02.239 align:start position:0%
that it's an important worthy position
 
03:36:04.910 --> 03:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh and we'll just take a knee at for now
 
03:36:07.550 --> 03:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
and hope that we can we can fulfill that
 
03:36:10.670 --> 03:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
in the future what what sort of legal
 
03:36:13.990 --> 03:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
conundrum are there that you just to
 
03:36:16.670 --> 03:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
name a couple um
 
03:36:20.429 --> 03:36:20.439 align:start position:0%
well we do a lot of of leasing of space
 
03:36:22.269 --> 03:36:22.279 align:start position:0%
so the SE Coast Science Center is at
 
03:36:26.229 --> 03:36:26.239 align:start position:0%
Odon uh Point State Park um we have the
 
03:36:28.750 --> 03:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
observatory up at Mount Washington State
 
03:36:33.630 --> 03:36:33.640 align:start position:0%
Park um we we work uh with um with well
 
03:36:35.750 --> 03:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
we have special use permits that you
 
03:36:38.870 --> 03:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
know could be a family reunion or uh you
 
03:36:42.550 --> 03:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
know a a huge um swimathon that raises
 
03:36:45.630 --> 03:36:45.640 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars um and so we have a
 
03:36:47.870 --> 03:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
staff that's working operationally in
 
03:36:49.590 --> 03:36:49.600 align:start position:0%
state parks but it would be really good
 
03:36:52.389 --> 03:36:52.399 align:start position:0%
to shore up some of these types of
 
03:36:54.790 --> 03:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
agreements and arrangements so that
 
03:36:58.150 --> 03:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
we're handing something to doj to review
 
03:37:00.710 --> 03:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
that's already in good shape and not
 
03:37:03.110 --> 03:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
expending a lot of their mental capacity
 
03:37:04.830 --> 03:37:04.840 align:start position:0%
to sort of walk us through every time we
 
03:37:06.030 --> 03:37:06.040 align:start position:0%
get a new
 
03:37:08.950 --> 03:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
situation okay so you'd prefer retain
 
03:37:08.960 --> 03:37:10.670 align:start position:0%
situation okay so you'd prefer retain
this

03:37:10.670 --> 03:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:37:12.790 --> 03:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
position thank you Mr chair thank you
 
03:37:15.630 --> 03:37:15.640 align:start position:0%
for uh coming in uh just a follow up on
 
03:37:18.830 --> 03:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
on representative Evil's Point um you
 
03:37:21.229 --> 03:37:21.239 align:start position:0%
did make a point in your statement that
 
03:37:25.550 --> 03:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
the um the general funded position in
 
03:37:29.830 --> 03:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
the uh arts division is um would would
 
03:37:33.269 --> 03:37:33.279 align:start position:0%
create a um an impact
 
03:37:38.389 --> 03:37:38.399 align:start position:0%
um um is that you know it sounds like
 
03:37:39.950 --> 03:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
with the attorney you've have a
 
03:37:43.150 --> 03:37:43.160 align:start position:0%
workaround figured out is this one uh in
 
03:37:44.870 --> 03:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
a little different class that it's it's
 
03:37:46.150 --> 03:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
really going to
 
03:37:47.990 --> 03:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
get down into the
 
03:37:50.710 --> 03:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
bone well you
 
03:37:53.070 --> 03:37:53.080 align:start position:0%
know I would I would love to fill that
 
03:37:54.710 --> 03:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
position because there's enough work to
 
03:37:57.070 --> 03:37:57.080 align:start position:0%
do and with a small staff as I mentioned
 
03:37:58.950 --> 03:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
you know a small staff you take one out
 
03:38:01.630 --> 03:38:01.640 align:start position:0%
then then it's noticeable if it was a
 
03:38:03.870 --> 03:38:03.880 align:start position:0%
staff of 150 and we took one out the the
 
03:38:05.950 --> 03:38:05.960 align:start position:0%
workload could be shared a little little
 
03:38:10.269 --> 03:38:10.279 align:start position:0%
bit um easier so uh you know for this we
 
03:38:13.229 --> 03:38:13.239 align:start position:0%
we took our task uh to heart and we
 
03:38:16.229 --> 03:38:16.239 align:start position:0%
looked at what we could manage and this
 
03:38:19.189 --> 03:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
is a scenario where thankfully we have a
 
03:38:22.670 --> 03:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
really Dynamic close-knit um Arts staff
 
03:38:25.070 --> 03:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
that you know doesn't mind picking up
 
03:38:28.630 --> 03:38:28.640 align:start position:0%
the load and um and moving forward you
 
03:38:30.229 --> 03:38:30.239 align:start position:0%
know so that our constituents don't
 
03:38:31.870 --> 03:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
notice the difference that's really the
 
03:38:35.349 --> 03:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
key right what can we what can we cut um
 
03:38:38.070 --> 03:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
or get rid of but without sacrificing
 
03:38:40.670 --> 03:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
the customer service aspect so in the
 
03:38:43.670 --> 03:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
Arts uh division they work a lot with
 
03:38:46.510 --> 03:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
you know Grant giving and and sort of
 
03:38:49.150 --> 03:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
assisting uh organizations and artists
 
03:38:52.229 --> 03:38:52.239 align:start position:0%
around the state um by losing this
 
03:38:54.590 --> 03:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
position it it's going to be felt with
 
03:38:56.630 --> 03:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
the staff but we're going to maintain
 
03:38:59.830 --> 03:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
our our customer service um
 
03:39:02.269 --> 03:39:02.279 align:start position:0%
representative cell thank you Mr chair
 
03:39:05.630 --> 03:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
just curious on uh page
 
03:39:10.150 --> 03:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
539 uh uh line 60 the benefits how we
 
03:39:11.510 --> 03:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
how are you able to get the benefits
 
03:39:15.750 --> 03:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
down like prob over close to 100,000 so
 
03:39:18.349 --> 03:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
sure so you'll notice the salary line is
 
03:39:21.389 --> 03:39:21.399 align:start position:0%
also significantly decreased we actually
 
03:39:25.469 --> 03:39:25.479 align:start position:0%
uh for 26 27 we moved I believe six or
 
03:39:27.429 --> 03:39:27.439 align:start position:0%
seven positions out of this accounting
 
03:39:30.309 --> 03:39:30.319 align:start position:0%
unit into a different accounting unit so
 
03:39:31.950 --> 03:39:31.960 align:start position:0%
you're seeing a significant reduction in
 
03:39:33.630 --> 03:39:33.640 align:start position:0%
the salary and benefits lines in this
 
03:39:35.469 --> 03:39:35.479 align:start position:0%
particular this particular grp okay
 
03:39:37.830 --> 03:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah look at positions at the
 
03:39:39.469 --> 03:39:39.479 align:start position:0%
bottom of the page
 
03:39:47.510 --> 03:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:51.269 --> 03:39:51.279 align:start position:0%
uh page 20
 
03:39:51.279 --> 03:39:53.429 align:start position:0%
uh page 20
541

03:39:53.429 --> 03:39:53.439 align:start position:0%
541
 
03:39:57.790 --> 03:39:57.800 align:start position:0%
um so down at the bottom here we have um
 
03:40:00.030 --> 03:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
conservation plate
 
03:40:03.349 --> 03:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
funds um are we
 
03:40:07.229 --> 03:40:07.239 align:start position:0%
expecting we got only
 
03:40:13.229 --> 03:40:13.239 align:start position:0%
um uh 560,000 in 24 but we're expecting
 
03:40:15.870 --> 03:40:15.880 align:start position:0%
900,000 ongoing is the cost of a
 
03:40:20.469 --> 03:40:20.479 align:start position:0%
conservation plate gone up or no no
 
03:40:24.030 --> 03:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
somebody so yeah so what you're seeing
 
03:40:27.389 --> 03:40:27.399 align:start position:0%
there is you're seeing a figure uh
 
03:40:30.590 --> 03:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
related to a combination of of agency
 
03:40:33.269 --> 03:40:33.279 align:start position:0%
income the next page actually uh adds an
 
03:40:35.389 --> 03:40:35.399 align:start position:0%
additionally 9,000 to tie out that total
 
03:40:35.399 --> 03:40:36.070 align:start position:0%
additionally 9,000 to tie out that total
of

03:40:36.070 --> 03:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:40:38.590 --> 03:40:38.600 align:start position:0%
647 relative to what was spent in that
 
03:40:40.429 --> 03:40:40.439 align:start position:0%
fiscal year we actually receive a
 
03:40:42.309 --> 03:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
significant amount more in that
 
03:40:45.670 --> 03:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
accounting unit um but this the actuals
 
03:40:47.309 --> 03:40:47.319 align:start position:0%
that are depicted here only show the
 
03:40:49.110 --> 03:40:49.120 align:start position:0%
revenue relative to what was actually
 
03:40:50.870 --> 03:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
spent so you're not seeing the full
 
03:40:54.110 --> 03:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
picture this is a this is a a dedicated
 
03:40:56.110 --> 03:40:56.120 align:start position:0%
fund there's a fund balance in this
 
03:40:58.790 --> 03:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
accounting unit uh in the last couple of
 
03:41:00.389 --> 03:41:00.399 align:start position:0%
years we've received actually over a
 
03:41:03.630 --> 03:41:03.640 align:start position:0%
million dollars uh for our portion to oh
 
03:41:05.389 --> 03:41:05.399 align:start position:0%
and this you sort of transfer out to
 
03:41:07.790 --> 03:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
other things is the well no we keep we
 
03:41:10.670 --> 03:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
keep the funding in the accounting unit
 
03:41:12.710 --> 03:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
um but we put an estimate an
 
03:41:15.269 --> 03:41:15.279 align:start position:0%
appropriation estimate uh in this case
 
03:41:18.670 --> 03:41:18.680 align:start position:0%
$900,000 but we've been posting stronger
 
03:41:22.269 --> 03:41:22.279 align:start position:0%
Revenue I see and the big well so the
 
03:41:25.830 --> 03:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
big increase here has been this uh
 
03:41:28.030 --> 03:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
building contractual maintenance
 
03:41:32.149 --> 03:41:32.159 align:start position:0%
buildings and grounds you you added to
 
03:41:36.149 --> 03:41:36.159 align:start position:0%
that went from zero to 2,
 
03:41:39.030 --> 03:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
200,000 I'm sorry is which which class
 
03:41:41.110 --> 03:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
class 48 class
 
03:41:46.670 --> 03:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
48 um 0 to 200,000 Zer in 2024 yes
 
03:41:48.910 --> 03:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
understood okay right so again that
 
03:41:51.830 --> 03:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
that's 24 is actuals so what that means
 
03:41:54.950 --> 03:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
is although we keep money in the fund
 
03:41:56.830 --> 03:41:56.840 align:start position:0%
balance for the purpose of Maintenance
 
03:41:58.750 --> 03:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
particularly uh related to the Bureau of
 
03:42:01.590 --> 03:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
historic sites uh there was no actual
 
03:42:03.870 --> 03:42:03.880 align:start position:0%
spending that occurred in fy2 24 I think
 
03:42:05.910 --> 03:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
most of it was encumbered through
 
03:42:08.070 --> 03:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
Contracting but because of the time it
 
03:42:10.349 --> 03:42:10.359 align:start position:0%
takes to contract to get through the
 
03:42:12.590 --> 03:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
process to get everything encumbered
 
03:42:14.389 --> 03:42:14.399 align:start position:0%
there essentially was no spending that
 
03:42:16.550 --> 03:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
occurred so it's projects more than
 
03:42:18.950 --> 03:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
correct clean maintenance projects yes
 
03:42:23.790 --> 03:42:23.800 align:start position:0%
okay all right good so let's go to
 
03:42:23.800 --> 03:42:26.389 align:start position:0%
okay all right good so let's go to
page

03:42:26.389 --> 03:42:26.399 align:start position:0%
page
 
03:42:36.510 --> 03:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:40.790 --> 03:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:42.790 --> 03:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
forestry page
 
03:42:46.389 --> 03:42:46.399 align:start position:0%
546 Community Forestry um um we have our
 
03:42:49.710 --> 03:42:49.720 align:start position:0%
state Forester with us Patrick would you
 
03:43:00.110 --> 03:43:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:09.950 --> 03:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:12.229 --> 03:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
perfect uh my name is Patrick Hackley
 
03:43:14.030 --> 03:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
I'm the state Forester for the division
 
03:43:15.910 --> 03:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
of forest and lands
 
03:43:18.630 --> 03:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
um a community Forester so we have uh we
 
03:43:22.110 --> 03:43:22.120 align:start position:0%
have seven bureaus within our division
 
03:43:24.070 --> 03:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
and one of them is the Urban and
 
03:43:27.429 --> 03:43:27.439 align:start position:0%
Community forestry Bureau and so we have
 
03:43:30.510 --> 03:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
a full-time individual a Forester who
 
03:43:34.429 --> 03:43:34.439 align:start position:0%
provides education and Outreach uh we do
 
03:43:35.910 --> 03:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of school tree
 
03:43:37.870 --> 03:43:37.880 align:start position:0%
plantings uh we work with project
 
03:43:41.910 --> 03:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
Learning Tree um uh mostly with uh like
 
03:43:44.910 --> 03:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
I said with private land owners schools
 
03:43:47.030 --> 03:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
um we partner with UNH Cooperative
 
03:43:49.990 --> 03:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
Extension um this is a u federally
 
03:43:51.990 --> 03:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
funded position so we we couldn't do
 
03:43:54.590 --> 03:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
that work without the um Federal pass
 
03:43:56.349 --> 03:43:56.359 align:start position:0%
through funding from the US Forest
 
03:43:58.750 --> 03:43:58.760 align:start position:0%
Service oh even though it says inter
 
03:43:58.760 --> 03:44:00.990 align:start position:0%
Service oh even though it says inter
agency

03:44:00.990 --> 03:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
agency
 
03:44:03.189 --> 03:44:03.199 align:start position:0%
transfer it's still
 
03:44:06.469 --> 03:44:06.479 align:start position:0%
Federal yeah let me clarify so it is
 
03:44:08.229 --> 03:44:08.239 align:start position:0%
it's federally funded but the funding
 
03:44:09.990 --> 03:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
itself resides in a different accounting
 
03:44:12.670 --> 03:44:12.680 align:start position:0%
unit so in order to get the funding over
 
03:44:15.110 --> 03:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
to where the position is we use this
 
03:44:17.269 --> 03:44:17.279 align:start position:0%
inter agency transfer mechanism to yeah
 
03:44:19.510 --> 03:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
most of this forestry stuff does look
 
03:44:19.520 --> 03:44:23.110 align:start position:0%
most of this forestry stuff does look
Federal

03:44:23.110 --> 03:44:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:26.990 --> 03:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah except well let's go to Forest
 
03:44:29.389 --> 03:44:29.399 align:start position:0%
leg as long as you're here page 548
 
03:44:29.399 --> 03:44:30.870 align:start position:0%
leg as long as you're here page 548
Forest

03:44:30.870 --> 03:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
Forest
 
03:44:33.950 --> 03:44:33.960 align:start position:0%
Legacy so Forest Legacy is a federal
 
03:44:36.469 --> 03:44:36.479 align:start position:0%
program as well and that provides
 
03:44:38.870 --> 03:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
funding to uh purchase conservation
 
03:44:42.110 --> 03:44:42.120 align:start position:0%
easements from willing land owners who
 
03:44:43.590 --> 03:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
wish to sell the development rights to
 
03:44:45.189 --> 03:44:45.199 align:start position:0%
their property and keep it in working
 
03:44:48.030 --> 03:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
Forest but did we lose a giant Grant cuz
 
03:44:51.110 --> 03:44:51.120 align:start position:0%
that we're spending a big number in 2024
 
03:44:53.189 --> 03:44:53.199 align:start position:0%
it's uh it it it U fluctuates
 
03:44:55.309 --> 03:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
significantly and these deals can be in
 
03:44:57.110 --> 03:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
the millions of dollars so some some
 
03:44:59.349 --> 03:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
years we have like 1.5 or 2 million in
 
03:45:01.189 --> 03:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
the account and other years we don't
 
03:45:03.070 --> 03:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
because they're very they're targeted
 
03:45:05.790 --> 03:45:05.800 align:start position:0%
based on an application process and then
 
03:45:07.309 --> 03:45:07.319 align:start position:0%
the US Forest Service decides whether
 
03:45:08.510 --> 03:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to fund it or not it's
 
03:45:11.590 --> 03:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
competitive nationally uh competitive
 
03:45:13.670 --> 03:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
and then that funding is awarded if they
 
03:45:16.590 --> 03:45:16.600 align:start position:0%
find it to be worthy and then we proceed
 
03:45:18.710 --> 03:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
it takes about three years from start to
 
03:45:20.670 --> 03:45:20.680 align:start position:0%
finish you find a place to buy and then
 
03:45:22.870 --> 03:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
you ask the feds could I have money for
 
03:45:25.309 --> 03:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
this very simply
 
03:45:28.510 --> 03:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so what's the purchase that you had
 
03:45:28.520 --> 03:45:29.389 align:start position:0%
yeah so what's the purchase that you had
in

03:45:29.389 --> 03:45:29.399 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:45:33.590 --> 03:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
2024 2024 it's probably 2.3 million I
 
03:45:36.149 --> 03:45:36.159 align:start position:0%
see that was probably yeah that's right
 
03:45:38.790 --> 03:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
Chris it was the Dundee Forest up in the
 
03:45:41.670 --> 03:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
um Jackson intervail area it was
 
03:45:44.389 --> 03:45:44.399 align:start position:0%
actually three Parcels we worked with um
 
03:45:47.189 --> 03:45:47.199 align:start position:0%
many times we have to work with a uh a
 
03:45:48.790 --> 03:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
partner because of the complexity of the
 
03:45:50.590 --> 03:45:50.600 align:start position:0%
application so for that one we worked
 
03:45:52.950 --> 03:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
with the Trust for Public Lands and we
 
03:45:54.750 --> 03:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
have one in the in the queue now called
 
03:45:56.990 --> 03:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
Andre scogan Valley I don't know if that
 
03:45:59.070 --> 03:45:59.080 align:start position:0%
appears in the budget but that's um I
 
03:46:02.349 --> 03:46:02.359 align:start position:0%
think 1.6 million and that's in the gorm
 
03:46:05.710 --> 03:46:05.720 align:start position:0%
area no and then just to to clarify so
 
03:46:06.950 --> 03:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
this is a good example of what I
 
03:46:08.790 --> 03:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned at the beginning about how
 
03:46:11.269 --> 03:46:11.279 align:start position:0%
we're managing the federal
 
03:46:13.429 --> 03:46:13.439 align:start position:0%
Appropriations because of the
 
03:46:15.469 --> 03:46:15.479 align:start position:0%
fluctuating of this type of a purchase
 
03:46:17.229 --> 03:46:17.239 align:start position:0%
what we don't want to do is build a $2.3
 
03:46:20.149 --> 03:46:20.159 align:start position:0%
million appropriation in the budget we
 
03:46:21.750 --> 03:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
don't even know how much is going to be
 
03:46:22.870 --> 03:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
and we don't even know if we're going to
 
03:46:24.870 --> 03:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
get it so typically what happens is we
 
03:46:26.630 --> 03:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
wait until the award occurs through a
 
03:46:28.510 --> 03:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
series of of actions and then we bring
 
03:46:30.429 --> 03:46:30.439 align:start position:0%
it as a as an accept and expend to the
 
03:46:32.389 --> 03:46:32.399 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee that's the normal
 
03:46:34.070 --> 03:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
practice for these types of things thank
 
03:46:39.030 --> 03:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
you on page 552 there's Forest um
 
03:46:43.030 --> 03:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
protection uh 13 employees what's that
 
03:46:44.950 --> 03:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
Forest protection is the forest rangers
 
03:46:46.710 --> 03:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about so that's where
 
03:46:49.070 --> 03:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
our oh there's one vacant or something
 
03:46:51.110 --> 03:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
that's the unfunded position oh one
 
03:46:55.950 --> 03:46:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:55.960 --> 03:46:57.550 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:46:57.550 --> 03:46:57.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:46:57.560 --> 03:47:02.349 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

03:47:02.349 --> 03:47:02.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:08.070 --> 03:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:08.080 --> 03:47:09.830 align:start position:0%
 
554

03:47:09.830 --> 03:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
554
 
03:47:12.870 --> 03:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
um northern region
 
03:47:15.020 --> 03:47:15.030 align:start position:0%
headquarters you're you're double
 
03:47:15.030 --> 03:47:16.189 align:start position:0%
headquarters you're you're double
[Music]

03:47:16.189 --> 03:47:16.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:47:22.189 --> 03:47:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:26.710 --> 03:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
heat yeah um so the northern region is
 
03:47:30.750 --> 03:47:30.760 align:start position:0%
our Lancaster office and we um we have
 
03:47:33.510 --> 03:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh our forest ranger staff located there
 
03:47:35.510 --> 03:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
we have about four Rangers out of that
 
03:47:38.670 --> 03:47:38.680 align:start position:0%
office uh we also have uh one Parks
 
03:47:41.710 --> 03:47:41.720 align:start position:0%
division staff uh we also are the
 
03:47:43.950 --> 03:47:43.960 align:start position:0%
landlords to fishing game and UNH
 
03:47:46.070 --> 03:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
Cooperative Extension there and I
 
03:47:47.790 --> 03:47:47.800 align:start position:0%
believe we are in the market for a new
 
03:47:49.990 --> 03:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
boiler uh so I don't know if that
 
03:47:51.389 --> 03:47:51.399 align:start position:0%
anything to do with the increased cost
 
03:47:53.750 --> 03:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
of heat but we we do need to replace the
 
03:47:56.429 --> 03:47:56.439 align:start position:0%
boiler there that could be a burn some
 
03:47:59.229 --> 03:47:59.239 align:start position:0%
wood we do burn wood there actually we
 
03:48:01.710 --> 03:48:01.720 align:start position:0%
do in the garage yeah if the State Fire
 
03:48:04.309 --> 03:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
Marshall will let us
 
03:48:04.319 --> 03:48:05.990 align:start position:0%
Marshall will let us
continue

03:48:05.990 --> 03:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
continue
 
03:48:06.000 --> 03:48:07.720 align:start position:0%
continue
um

03:48:07.720 --> 03:48:07.730 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:07.730 --> 03:48:09.870 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

03:48:09.870 --> 03:48:09.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:48:09.880 --> 03:48:12.910 align:start position:0%
[Music]
okay

03:48:12.910 --> 03:48:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:15.590 --> 03:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
so yes and this Northeastern
 
03:48:15.600 --> 03:48:17.550 align:start position:0%
so yes and this Northeastern
coordination

03:48:17.550 --> 03:48:17.560 align:start position:0%
coordination
 
03:48:21.309 --> 03:48:21.319 align:start position:0%
Center yeah so that is I believe that's
 
03:48:24.710 --> 03:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
also federally funded and that is um
 
03:48:27.309 --> 03:48:27.319 align:start position:0%
what we call Our Kind of our
 
03:48:30.269 --> 03:48:30.279 align:start position:0%
mobilization uh partnership with the US
 
03:48:32.189 --> 03:48:32.199 align:start position:0%
Forest Service so that individual works
 
03:48:35.710 --> 03:48:35.720 align:start position:0%
for us but is um housed at the US Forest
 
03:48:37.990 --> 03:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
Service Office in Campton at the White
 
03:48:40.389 --> 03:48:40.399 align:start position:0%
Mountain National Forest headquarters so
 
03:48:42.070 --> 03:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
when we have requests from neighboring
 
03:48:44.110 --> 03:48:44.120 align:start position:0%
states and the maritime Canadian
 
03:48:44.120 --> 03:48:45.590 align:start position:0%
states and the maritime Canadian
maritimes

03:48:45.590 --> 03:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
maritimes
 
03:48:48.510 --> 03:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
that individual mobilizes uh works with
 
03:48:51.750 --> 03:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
um our our conquered office and other
 
03:48:54.389 --> 03:48:54.399 align:start position:0%
states to put together fire Crews and
 
03:48:56.189 --> 03:48:56.199 align:start position:0%
get them shipped off to the various
 
03:48:59.070 --> 03:48:59.080 align:start position:0%
States including out west so it's really
 
03:49:01.950 --> 03:49:01.960 align:start position:0%
kind of like a dispatch position and
 
03:49:04.790 --> 03:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
it's temp it's a temp so it's you're
 
03:49:07.030 --> 03:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
just sort of estimating what it could be
 
03:49:08.910 --> 03:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
is that kind of what it is yeah
 
03:49:11.670 --> 03:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
basically because it's way down it's way
 
03:49:15.349 --> 03:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
up from what you actually spend in 2020
 
03:49:18.870 --> 03:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
24 budgeting right but
 
03:49:22.189 --> 03:49:22.199 align:start position:0%
okay but it's just a guess I guess okay
 
03:49:23.630 --> 03:49:23.640 align:start position:0%
Mr chair can I ask a question I had to
 
03:49:27.070 --> 03:49:27.080 align:start position:0%
represent M uh thanks um in that area
 
03:49:30.149 --> 03:49:30.159 align:start position:0%
why is the uh benefit expense so
 
03:49:33.229 --> 03:49:33.239 align:start position:0%
high relative I mean there's no
 
03:49:33.239 --> 03:49:34.309 align:start position:0%
high relative I mean there's no
Personnel

03:49:34.309 --> 03:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
Personnel
 
03:49:37.670 --> 03:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
costs uh well so to to clarify that is a
 
03:49:40.550 --> 03:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
a temp it's a called a full-time temp um
 
03:49:42.429 --> 03:49:42.439 align:start position:0%
which means it it is budgeted as
 
03:49:44.389 --> 03:49:44.399 align:start position:0%
essentially a full-time employee which
 
03:49:46.910 --> 03:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
means it's eligible for full benefits so
 
03:49:48.550 --> 03:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
when we budget it we do have to budget
 
03:49:48.560 --> 03:49:49.429 align:start position:0%
when we budget it we do have to budget
full

03:49:49.429 --> 03:49:49.439 align:start position:0%
full
 
03:49:52.670 --> 03:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
benefits along with that position um the
 
03:49:54.349 --> 03:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
disparity you're seeing between 24 and
 
03:49:56.990 --> 03:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
25 is essentially what Patrick has kind
 
03:49:58.870 --> 03:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
of alluded to is it's really based on
 
03:50:00.670 --> 03:50:00.680 align:start position:0%
its its need the demand for that
 
03:50:03.189 --> 03:50:03.199 align:start position:0%
position to function um but we have to
 
03:50:05.630 --> 03:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
start with the position and then you
 
03:50:07.990 --> 03:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
know as time allows depending on on how
 
03:50:09.910 --> 03:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
things go there may not be a demand for
 
03:50:12.550 --> 03:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
that many hours uh to keep that position
 
03:50:13.950 --> 03:50:13.960 align:start position:0%
fully employed throughout the course of
 
03:50:16.550 --> 03:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
a of a full year okay this budget
 
03:50:19.349 --> 03:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
depicts essentially a 12-month full-time
 
03:50:19.359 --> 03:50:20.910 align:start position:0%
depicts essentially a 12-month full-time
employee

03:50:20.910 --> 03:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
employee
 
03:50:22.990 --> 03:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
okay all
 
03:50:28.910 --> 03:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:36.510 --> 03:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:40.429 --> 03:50:40.439 align:start position:0%
management so we're adding agency
 
03:50:42.830 --> 03:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
income where there used to be General
 
03:50:42.840 --> 03:50:45.670 align:start position:0%
income where there used to be General
funds

03:50:45.670 --> 03:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
funds
 
03:50:48.189 --> 03:50:48.199 align:start position:0%
yes yeah so that's what the commissioner
 
03:50:49.950 --> 03:50:49.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned in her opening
 
03:50:53.670 --> 03:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
remarks um uh accounting unit 3505 is
 
03:50:55.670 --> 03:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
our forest management protection fund
 
03:50:57.269 --> 03:50:57.279 align:start position:0%
it's a revolving
 
03:51:01.710 --> 03:51:01.720 align:start position:0%
fund um it consists of largely Timber
 
03:51:04.990 --> 03:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
Revenue income but also revenue from the
 
03:51:07.269 --> 03:51:07.279 align:start position:0%
sale of seedlings from our State Forest
 
03:51:11.510 --> 03:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
Nursery uh also um uh Communications
 
03:51:13.349 --> 03:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
that's more of a kind of goes in and
 
03:51:15.349 --> 03:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
goes out to our communication sites but
 
03:51:17.990 --> 03:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
we have um uh communication leases all
 
03:51:20.670 --> 03:51:20.680 align:start position:0%
over the state on our mountain tops U
 
03:51:23.670 --> 03:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
Camp leases seasonal camps we have about
 
03:51:24.630 --> 03:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
going say
 
03:51:28.510 --> 03:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
110 seasonal camps uh 91 of them are up
 
03:51:31.030 --> 03:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
in Nash stream and then um there's half
 
03:51:33.429 --> 03:51:33.439 align:start position:0%
a dozen or so over in onog so it's
 
03:51:37.309 --> 03:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
probably under 100 um they're they run
 
03:51:40.550 --> 03:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 1,000 to $2,000 a year so
 
03:51:45.030 --> 03:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
those all go into that fund as well
 
03:51:49.910 --> 03:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:49.920 --> 03:51:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
good

03:51:50.940 --> 03:51:50.950 align:start position:0%
good
 
03:51:50.950 --> 03:51:52.710 align:start position:0%
good
[Music]

03:51:52.710 --> 03:51:52.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:51:55.870 --> 03:51:55.880 align:start position:0%
um let's go to I'm going to skip ahead
 
03:51:55.880 --> 03:51:58.830 align:start position:0%
um let's go to I'm going to skip ahead
to

03:51:58.830 --> 03:51:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:03.309 --> 03:52:03.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:07.309 --> 03:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
um so um is this somebody who like came
 
03:52:10.110 --> 03:52:10.120 align:start position:0%
in partway through the year or something
 
03:52:12.349 --> 03:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
like that CU it's it looks like one
 
03:52:17.110 --> 03:52:17.120 align:start position:0%
person but the spending for for salary
 
03:52:19.790 --> 03:52:19.800 align:start position:0%
is taking a big
 
03:52:22.110 --> 03:52:22.120 align:start position:0%
jump this is for conservation asement
 
03:52:22.120 --> 03:52:25.590 align:start position:0%
jump this is for conservation asement
stewardship

03:52:25.590 --> 03:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:25.600 --> 03:52:27.110 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:52:27.110 --> 03:52:27.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:52:31.030 --> 03:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
570 570 so just to clarify again uh
 
03:52:32.389 --> 03:52:32.399 align:start position:0%
actuals in
 
03:52:35.389 --> 03:52:35.399 align:start position:0%
24 uh represent a period of time that an
 
03:52:36.950 --> 03:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
employee worked obviously the position
 
03:52:39.590 --> 03:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
was open for some period of time FY 24
 
03:52:41.309 --> 03:52:41.319 align:start position:0%
so it did not incur a full Year's worth
 
03:52:45.229 --> 03:52:45.239 align:start position:0%
of salary and benefits uh fy2
 
03:52:47.670 --> 03:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
again is an estimate based on that
 
03:52:51.550 --> 03:52:51.560 align:start position:0%
position uh salary and benefits at that
 
03:52:56.950 --> 03:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh labor grade and step uh going into uh
 
03:53:00.349 --> 03:53:00.359 align:start position:0%
26 and 27 it looks like the position has
 
03:53:03.030 --> 03:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
been estimated at a higher St higher
 
03:53:05.149 --> 03:53:05.159 align:start position:0%
salary probably due to some an
 
03:53:08.990 --> 03:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
adjustment in the um uh lab not the so
 
03:53:10.830 --> 03:53:10.840 align:start position:0%
the person you hired was more senior
 
03:53:12.670 --> 03:53:12.680 align:start position:0%
than you thought you were going to get
 
03:53:15.030 --> 03:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
or something like that that can happen
 
03:53:16.469 --> 03:53:16.479 align:start position:0%
that Canen where you end up bring
 
03:53:18.990 --> 03:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
somebody in at a higher step only
 
03:53:21.189 --> 03:53:21.199 align:start position:0%
because of their expertise which
 
03:53:22.710 --> 03:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
typically the budget when the position
 
03:53:26.389 --> 03:53:26.399 align:start position:0%
is vacant it's a step one right but a
 
03:53:27.990 --> 03:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
lot of times when someone comes in if
 
03:53:29.070 --> 03:53:29.080 align:start position:0%
they have experience they're going to
 
03:53:31.070 --> 03:53:31.080 align:start position:0%
come in at a higher amount okay but here
 
03:53:33.950 --> 03:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
you had to add general
 
03:53:37.149 --> 03:53:37.159 align:start position:0%
fund yes this particular one uh does
 
03:53:39.830 --> 03:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
have a small component of General funds
 
03:53:42.990 --> 03:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
built into it although uh we we reduced
 
03:53:46.269 --> 03:53:46.279 align:start position:0%
it it was 5050 in this bium and we've
 
03:53:48.469 --> 03:53:48.479 align:start position:0%
reduced it to be a much smaller portion
 
03:53:50.309 --> 03:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
General funding in this in this
 
03:53:55.790 --> 03:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:55.800 --> 03:53:57.750 align:start position:0%
 
right

03:53:57.750 --> 03:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:54:01.950 --> 03:54:01.960 align:start position:0%
um so on page 572 and
 
03:54:05.590 --> 03:54:05.600 align:start position:0%
573 you you sort of
 
03:54:09.269 --> 03:54:09.279 align:start position:0%
ended you moved General
 
03:54:11.950 --> 03:54:11.960 align:start position:0%
funds or you move the pro natural
 
03:54:11.960 --> 03:54:13.070 align:start position:0%
funds or you move the pro natural
heritage

03:54:13.070 --> 03:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
heritage
 
03:54:17.349 --> 03:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
Bureau right you um a natural heritage
 
03:54:17.359 --> 03:54:18.590 align:start position:0%
Bureau right you um a natural heritage
Agency

03:54:18.590 --> 03:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
Agency
 
03:54:21.389 --> 03:54:21.399 align:start position:0%
Inc yeah you kind of move things around
 
03:54:25.229 --> 03:54:25.239 align:start position:0%
here yes yes so you notice that so what
 
03:54:28.670 --> 03:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
we did was within 2103 accounting which
 
03:54:30.030 --> 03:54:30.040 align:start position:0%
is at the towards the bottom of the page
 
03:54:31.750 --> 03:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
that was that's the primary natural
 
03:54:34.790 --> 03:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
heritage Bureau accounting unit um we
 
03:54:36.389 --> 03:54:36.399 align:start position:0%
have Personnel in that accounting unit
 
03:54:37.710 --> 03:54:37.720 align:start position:0%
but there were different mixes of
 
03:54:39.950 --> 03:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
funding so what we did in this case was
 
03:54:42.630 --> 03:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
we said let's identify the the general
 
03:54:45.510 --> 03:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
funded uh folks and move them into their
 
03:54:48.269 --> 03:54:48.279 align:start position:0%
own accounting unit so we we separated
 
03:54:49.149 --> 03:54:49.159 align:start position:0%
to to
 
03:54:51.469 --> 03:54:51.479 align:start position:0%
346 and that's what that's for although
 
03:54:53.110 --> 03:54:53.120 align:start position:0%
there is a component of their salary
 
03:54:55.189 --> 03:54:55.199 align:start position:0%
benefits that's also being funded by
 
03:54:56.750 --> 03:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
some other agency income that's being
 
03:54:58.950 --> 03:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
transferred into that accounting unit
 
03:55:02.550 --> 03:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
but in doing so we were able to to set
 
03:55:05.110 --> 03:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
it up so that
 
03:55:07.830 --> 03:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
2103 no longer has any general funding
 
03:55:10.990 --> 03:55:11.000 align:start position:0%
in it it is only a fund mix of agency
 
03:55:13.030 --> 03:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
income inter agency transfers and
 
03:55:15.750 --> 03:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
transfers of funding from other agencies
 
03:55:17.550 --> 03:55:17.560 align:start position:0%
so it was a way to just isolate the
 
03:55:21.389 --> 03:55:21.399 align:start position:0%
general funded component of this account
 
03:55:23.269 --> 03:55:23.279 align:start position:0%
uh to so that it would have uh better
 
03:55:25.429 --> 03:55:25.439 align:start position:0%
visibility and tracking without mixing
 
03:55:26.870 --> 03:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
too many sources of funding in the
 
03:55:29.229 --> 03:55:29.239 align:start position:0%
natural heritage Bureau representa evil
 
03:55:31.309 --> 03:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
yeah um to what ex I know we're not
 
03:55:34.469 --> 03:55:34.479 align:start position:0%
talking about hb2 today but to what
 
03:55:38.510 --> 03:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
extent are the changes in hb2 reflected
 
03:55:38.520 --> 03:55:40.149 align:start position:0%
extent are the changes in hb2 reflected
in

03:55:40.149 --> 03:55:40.159 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:55:43.870 --> 03:55:43.880 align:start position:0%
hb1 uh at this time everything that was
 
03:55:45.830 --> 03:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh going going to be done relative to
 
03:55:49.269 --> 03:55:49.279 align:start position:0%
hb2 is reflected in hb1 in the case of
 
03:55:51.790 --> 03:55:51.800 align:start position:0%
the with an exception in the case of the
 
03:55:54.469 --> 03:55:54.479 align:start position:0%
natural heritage Bureau one of the
 
03:55:56.550 --> 03:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
actions that was going to be taken was
 
03:55:58.710 --> 03:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
to move two of the positions that
 
03:56:00.309 --> 03:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
currently are employed from the natural
 
03:56:02.469 --> 03:56:02.479 align:start position:0%
heritage Bureau to be employed at
 
03:56:04.429 --> 03:56:04.439 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services however both of
 
03:56:07.149 --> 03:56:07.159 align:start position:0%
those positions were full-time temporary
 
03:56:08.710 --> 03:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
positions that were approved through a
 
03:56:10.630 --> 03:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal action so they were never
 
03:56:13.469 --> 03:56:13.479 align:start position:0%
reflected in the hb1 even before this
 
03:56:14.790 --> 03:56:14.800 align:start position:0%
change was made so you we won't see any
 
03:56:17.510 --> 03:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
changes in HB one relative to the
 
03:56:20.229 --> 03:56:20.239 align:start position:0%
natural heritage bu Bureau based on the
 
03:56:22.429 --> 03:56:22.439 align:start position:0%
actions that have already occurred
 
03:56:24.710 --> 03:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
however there is going to be a need to
 
03:56:28.030 --> 03:56:28.040 align:start position:0%
make a change uh further and I have that
 
03:56:29.950 --> 03:56:29.960 align:start position:0%
that's part of the submission uh that I
 
03:56:31.710 --> 03:56:31.720 align:start position:0%
have attached and we can go over that
 
03:56:32.910 --> 03:56:32.920 align:start position:0%
these are some additional budget
 
03:56:35.309 --> 03:56:35.319 align:start position:0%
requests that we have one of the actions
 
03:56:39.030 --> 03:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
will be to move one of the positions uh
 
03:56:40.349 --> 03:56:40.359 align:start position:0%
from the natural heritage Bureau
 
03:56:42.870 --> 03:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
actually in accounting unit
 
03:56:46.710 --> 03:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
347 uh will will be moved out of if that
 
03:56:50.429 --> 03:56:50.439 align:start position:0%
is done then hb1 you will see 3407 be
 
03:56:53.429 --> 03:56:53.439 align:start position:0%
eliminated as well yeah all right so
 
03:56:56.990 --> 03:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
this is um this letter you have on page
 
03:57:02.229 --> 03:57:02.239 align:start position:0%
eight uh let's take a look starting on
 
03:57:05.710 --> 03:57:05.720 align:start position:0%
page eight correct all right this is the
 
03:57:07.950 --> 03:57:07.960 align:start position:0%
these are the requests that we have have
 
03:57:11.030 --> 03:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
submitted uh budgetary changes all right
 
03:57:12.750 --> 03:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
well let's uh maybe we should talk about
 
03:57:15.389 --> 03:57:15.399 align:start position:0%
this just so we don't run out of
 
03:57:18.590 --> 03:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
time sure right now I mean
 
03:57:22.149 --> 03:57:22.159 align:start position:0%
okay so going through the first uh
 
03:57:24.550 --> 03:57:24.560 align:start position:0%
number one is basically establishing
 
03:57:26.309 --> 03:57:26.319 align:start position:0%
budgets for Connecticut Lake
 
03:57:29.309 --> 03:57:29.319 align:start position:0%
headquarters um we have endowments that
 
03:57:31.630 --> 03:57:31.640 align:start position:0%
are used to fund uh the cost of
 
03:57:33.750 --> 03:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
Maintenance stewardship and and other
 
03:57:35.670 --> 03:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
components of Connecticut League
 
03:57:38.349 --> 03:57:38.359 align:start position:0%
headquarters or functions um we did not
 
03:57:40.269 --> 03:57:40.279 align:start position:0%
initially submit these requests as
 
03:57:41.790 --> 03:57:41.800 align:start position:0%
budgetary requests during the agency
 
03:57:43.670 --> 03:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
phase or even the governor's phase
 
03:57:45.309 --> 03:57:45.319 align:start position:0%
because we were still working with
 
03:57:48.349 --> 03:57:48.359 align:start position:0%
treasury to ensure that we understood
 
03:57:50.510 --> 03:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
exactly how much was in these endowments
 
03:57:51.910 --> 03:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
that they were sufficient and that we
 
03:57:53.670 --> 03:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
could move forward we're also
 
03:57:55.510 --> 03:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
communicating with uh the fish and game
 
03:57:57.429 --> 03:57:57.439 align:start position:0%
Bureau who also has a stake in these
 
03:57:59.950 --> 03:57:59.960 align:start position:0%
endowments everybody's in agreement at
 
03:58:01.349 --> 03:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
this point of how much is available
 
03:58:02.710 --> 03:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
there's a significant amount of money
 
03:58:04.670 --> 03:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
available in these endowments so what
 
03:58:06.229 --> 03:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
we'd like to do is go ahead and request
 
03:58:09.389 --> 03:58:09.399 align:start position:0%
to to to proceed with putting budgets in
 
03:58:11.110 --> 03:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
place for the Connecticut Lake
 
03:58:12.990 --> 03:58:13.000 align:start position:0%
headquarters accounting units and that's
 
03:58:14.149 --> 03:58:14.159 align:start position:0%
that's what you're seeing here in the
 
03:58:19.189 --> 03:58:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:23.429 --> 03:58:23.439 align:start position:0%
request um the second component number
 
03:58:26.830 --> 03:58:26.840 align:start position:0%
two is related to positions that were
 
03:58:29.710 --> 03:58:29.720 align:start position:0%
initially moved as part of the hb2 that
 
03:58:31.910 --> 03:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
you've just mentioned uh the
 
03:58:34.469 --> 03:58:34.479 align:start position:0%
consolidation of the permitting process
 
03:58:36.229 --> 03:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
in the course of preparing for that
 
03:58:38.550 --> 03:58:38.560 align:start position:0%
through the governor's phase it was
 
03:58:40.269 --> 03:58:40.279 align:start position:0%
believed that two of the positions in
 
03:58:42.030 --> 03:58:42.040 align:start position:0%
the division of historical resources
 
03:58:44.429 --> 03:58:44.439 align:start position:0%
would also need to be moved to support
 
03:58:47.349 --> 03:58:47.359 align:start position:0%
that function upon further discussions
 
03:58:49.229 --> 03:58:49.239 align:start position:0%
it was determined no these positions are
 
03:58:51.429 --> 03:58:51.439 align:start position:0%
not appropriate to be moved uh however
 
03:58:53.750 --> 03:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
it was too late uh in the governor's
 
03:58:56.189 --> 03:58:56.199 align:start position:0%
phase to get the moved back so they ask
 
03:58:58.590 --> 03:58:58.600 align:start position:0%
us when you go just request to have them
 
03:59:02.110 --> 03:59:02.120 align:start position:0%
put back so that that this second
 
03:59:04.070 --> 03:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
section is essentially requesting to
 
03:59:06.630 --> 03:59:06.640 align:start position:0%
move those two positions from the
 
03:59:08.110 --> 03:59:08.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
03:59:10.309 --> 03:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
back into our division of historical
 
03:59:12.429 --> 03:59:12.439 align:start position:0%
resources um and I've identified the
 
03:59:14.309 --> 03:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
accounts and the positions can you can
 
03:59:19.349 --> 03:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
you put show me the page for this page
 
03:59:22.309 --> 03:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
10 no no no I'm sorry yeah I I jumped a
 
03:59:24.030 --> 03:59:24.040 align:start position:0%
little bit ahead on the connectic
 
03:59:24.040 --> 03:59:26.149 align:start position:0%
little bit ahead on the connectic
headwaters

03:59:26.149 --> 03:59:26.159 align:start position:0%
headwaters
 
03:59:29.590 --> 03:59:29.600 align:start position:0%
um okay page 10 of the submission if
 
03:59:32.910 --> 03:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
halfway down the page uh section two
 
03:59:34.950 --> 03:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
yeah it identifies the request to move
 
03:59:36.389 --> 03:59:36.399 align:start position:0%
the two positions it explains
 
03:59:38.550 --> 03:59:38.560 align:start position:0%
essentially what happened and and what
 
03:59:40.550 --> 03:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
we'd like to to do
 
03:59:45.149 --> 03:59:45.159 align:start position:0%
no okay but where is it in house build
 
03:59:48.790 --> 03:59:48.800 align:start position:0%
one do we know yes in house it is in
 
03:59:51.550 --> 03:59:51.560 align:start position:0%
house bill one if you were to go to the
 
03:59:53.030 --> 03:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
section of the budget where the division
 
03:59:55.670 --> 03:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
of historical resources are and I can
 
03:59:57.389 --> 03:59:57.399 align:start position:0%
give you the page number so you can see
 
04:00:02.269 --> 04:00:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:06.910 --> 04:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:11.030 --> 04:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:14.469 --> 04:00:14.479 align:start position:0%
federal see them
 
04:00:22.149 --> 04:00:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:26.070 --> 04:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
sorry okay so you'll notice on page 600
 
04:00:30.349 --> 04:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:33.550 --> 04:00:33.560 align:start position:0%
one on page 600 under accounting unit
 
04:00:36.469 --> 04:00:36.479 align:start position:0%
1444 you'll notice that the head count
 
04:00:37.790 --> 04:00:37.800 align:start position:0%
of the number of permanent classified
 
04:00:41.070 --> 04:00:41.080 align:start position:0%
positions from 25 to 26 goes from 4 to
 
04:00:45.710 --> 04:00:45.720 align:start position:0%
three yes and you'll notice in on page
 
04:00:48.030 --> 04:00:48.040 align:start position:0%
601 under
 
04:00:50.349 --> 04:00:50.359 align:start position:0%
1445 the permanent classified position
 
04:00:53.030 --> 04:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
count goes from 7 to six so those are
 
04:00:54.590 --> 04:00:54.600 align:start position:0%
the those were the two positions that
 
04:00:55.950 --> 04:00:55.960 align:start position:0%
were reduced there was one in each one
 
04:00:57.630 --> 04:00:57.640 align:start position:0%
of these accounting units so we're
 
04:00:59.269 --> 04:00:59.279 align:start position:0%
asking for those to be restored back
 
04:01:01.389 --> 04:01:01.399 align:start position:0%
into this accounting init and and that
 
04:01:06.070 --> 04:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:10.750 --> 04:01:10.760 align:start position:0%
yes well yeah right but one of them cost
 
04:01:13.189 --> 04:01:13.199 align:start position:0%
me general fund yes one of them is
 
04:01:14.830 --> 04:01:14.840 align:start position:0%
General funds and actually it is an
 
04:01:18.590 --> 04:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
unfunded position oh in 26 27 so it'll
 
04:01:20.990 --> 04:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
be moved back the count will will change
 
04:01:22.389 --> 04:01:22.399 align:start position:0%
but the dollars in that accounting un it
 
04:01:24.189 --> 04:01:24.199 align:start position:0%
will not I
 
04:01:29.189 --> 04:01:29.199 align:start position:0%
see okay um currently vacant I see this
 
04:01:30.110 --> 04:01:30.120 align:start position:0%
the second
 
04:01:33.790 --> 04:01:33.800 align:start position:0%
one yes okay I see it's vacant and
 
04:01:33.800 --> 04:01:37.030 align:start position:0%
one yes okay I see it's vacant and
unfunded

04:01:37.030 --> 04:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:40.790 --> 04:01:40.800 align:start position:0%
yes okay all right next one and then
 
04:01:43.349 --> 04:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
finally the the third request that we
 
04:01:46.030 --> 04:01:46.040 align:start position:0%
have is what I just mentioned about the
 
04:01:48.870 --> 04:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
natural heritage Bureau uh through the
 
04:01:50.550 --> 04:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
the changes that are occurring in hb2
 
04:01:52.990 --> 04:01:53.000 align:start position:0%
relative to the pering process
 
04:01:54.830 --> 04:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
consolidation they're also going to be
 
04:01:58.309 --> 04:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
moving the the fund The Authority for
 
04:02:01.229 --> 04:02:01.239 align:start position:0%
the natural heritage Bureau fund uh
 
04:02:03.830 --> 04:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
under their Authority as well currently
 
04:02:06.630 --> 04:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
because we have a position residing
 
04:02:09.429 --> 04:02:09.439 align:start position:0%
under that fund uh if the fund goes over
 
04:02:11.149 --> 04:02:11.159 align:start position:0%
to environmental services so does the
 
04:02:13.349 --> 04:02:13.359 align:start position:0%
position so that position needs to
 
04:02:14.830 --> 04:02:14.840 align:start position:0%
actually move move over to the
 
04:02:16.950 --> 04:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services so
 
04:02:18.630 --> 04:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
we've specifi we've identified the
 
04:02:21.870 --> 04:02:21.880 align:start position:0%
position number and the purpose so are
 
04:02:24.030 --> 04:02:24.040 align:start position:0%
you transferring some of these funds to
 
04:02:26.269 --> 04:02:26.279 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services all of all of the
 
04:02:28.309 --> 04:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
funding will go over to Environmental
 
04:02:30.590 --> 04:02:30.600 align:start position:0%
Services with the position from their
 
04:02:33.309 --> 04:02:33.319 align:start position:0%
sources to their to their it'll it'll go
 
04:02:34.790 --> 04:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
I don't know if the fund is going from
 
04:02:37.110 --> 04:02:37.120 align:start position:0%
what I understand the fund itself is not
 
04:02:40.269 --> 04:02:40.279 align:start position:0%
going to be liquidated but the authority
 
04:02:42.269 --> 04:02:42.279 align:start position:0%
over that use of that fund will transfer
 
04:02:45.910 --> 04:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
to environmental services and I see okay
 
04:02:48.469 --> 04:02:48.479 align:start position:0%
so um Jack you'll remind me of these
 
04:02:51.070 --> 04:02:51.080 align:start position:0%
things when we come to vote on this okay
 
04:02:56.110 --> 04:02:56.120 align:start position:0%
good all right um let's go back to the
 
04:03:00.670 --> 04:03:00.680 align:start position:0%
questions um page
 
04:03:05.469 --> 04:03:05.479 align:start position:0%
581 um you're predicting that that your
 
04:03:08.830 --> 04:03:08.840 align:start position:0%
utilities expense at Canon is going to
 
04:03:11.830 --> 04:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
go down by a
 
04:03:14.269 --> 04:03:14.279 align:start position:0%
third that seems Cor seems pretty
 
04:03:16.469 --> 04:03:16.479 align:start position:0%
aggressive very excited really good news
 
04:03:18.469 --> 04:03:18.479 align:start position:0%
oh okay we
 
04:03:21.349 --> 04:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
renegotiated ah with the electric
 
04:03:24.950 --> 04:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
company through D Das yes it's a
 
04:03:27.229 --> 04:03:27.239 align:start position:0%
significant savings can you do that for
 
04:03:30.830 --> 04:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
me too we'll talk upine
 
04:03:33.389 --> 04:03:33.399 align:start position:0%
okay all right so so you think this is
 
04:03:38.149 --> 04:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
is accurate yes yes yeah okay good very
 
04:03:40.229 --> 04:03:40.239 align:start position:0%
good all right
 
04:03:44.670 --> 04:03:44.680 align:start position:0%
589 yes representative evil so just um
 
04:03:48.870 --> 04:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
on in hb2 you have the change relative
 
04:03:50.590 --> 04:03:50.600 align:start position:0%
to the Canon Mountain
 
04:03:54.950 --> 04:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
Tramway correct yes that's 18 million so
 
04:03:58.590 --> 04:03:58.600 align:start position:0%
you just are needing more time I just
 
04:04:00.269 --> 04:04:00.279 align:start position:0%
saw the date well I can I can clarify
 
04:04:01.790 --> 04:04:01.800 align:start position:0%
the language the purpose of the language
 
04:04:04.349 --> 04:04:04.359 align:start position:0%
in hb2 and then the commissioner wants
 
04:04:06.950 --> 04:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
to talk that's fine so all all the
 
04:04:09.030 --> 04:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
language in hb2 is doing is saying that
 
04:04:12.229 --> 04:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
at the end of the bium whatever
 
04:04:14.830 --> 04:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
Appropriations are remaining aing from
 
04:04:16.830 --> 04:04:16.840 align:start position:0%
this warrant that have not been expended
 
04:04:18.950 --> 04:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
will lapse back to the general fund
 
04:04:22.510 --> 04:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
that's the only purpose of that language
 
04:04:26.149 --> 04:04:26.159 align:start position:0%
um so we achieved an allocation of$ 18
 
04:04:28.950 --> 04:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
million for the
 
04:04:33.830 --> 04:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
tram and this says that that 18 million
 
04:04:36.389 --> 04:04:36.399 align:start position:0%
will revert back to the general fund and
 
04:04:40.110 --> 04:04:40.120 align:start position:0%
then in hb2 I believe they've put um a
 
04:04:44.670 --> 04:04:44.680 align:start position:0%
suggestion of 20 million hb25 hb25 sorry
 
04:04:46.149 --> 04:04:46.159 align:start position:0%
so we'll have a
 
04:04:49.710 --> 04:04:49.720 align:start position:0%
conversation um at that point to try to
 
04:04:54.790 --> 04:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
secure that $20 million for the tram um
 
04:04:57.630 --> 04:04:57.640 align:start position:0%
just for situational awareness uh you
 
04:05:01.189 --> 04:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
know the the tram is sort of like uh
 
04:05:03.590 --> 04:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
very complicated scenario where we can't
 
04:05:06.110 --> 04:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
just you know buy parts for a little bit
 
04:05:07.990 --> 04:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
of money now and then just buy parts we
 
04:05:10.469 --> 04:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
have to buy we have to redo the tram um
 
04:05:12.309 --> 04:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
and that's one big ticket item um so
 
04:05:15.030 --> 04:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
we've been working with um um we did an
 
04:05:18.229 --> 04:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
RF RFP we got a bid back with some
 
04:05:20.990 --> 04:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
really um helpful notes uh from the two
 
04:05:23.229 --> 04:05:23.239 align:start position:0%
companies one company bid one didn't the
 
04:05:25.670 --> 04:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
bid came back at 33 million which is way
 
04:05:28.229 --> 04:05:28.239 align:start position:0%
more than 18 million um and so we've
 
04:05:30.389 --> 04:05:30.399 align:start position:0%
learned from that and one of the Lessons
 
04:05:34.269 --> 04:05:34.279 align:start position:0%
Learned is if we can verify the safety
 
04:05:36.389 --> 04:05:36.399 align:start position:0%
of some
 
04:05:40.429 --> 04:05:40.439 align:start position:0%
concrete posts foundations um that and
 
04:05:43.349 --> 04:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
verify it to the at an engineering level
 
04:05:47.389 --> 04:05:47.399 align:start position:0%
that that allows uh a vendor to make a
 
04:05:50.510 --> 04:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
much lower bid on the tram so we're
 
04:05:53.149 --> 04:05:53.159 align:start position:0%
trying to achieve that validation before
 
04:05:56.389 --> 04:05:56.399 align:start position:0%
we go back out to bid I see so it'll
 
04:05:59.030 --> 04:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
take another year or something but yeah
 
04:06:02.830 --> 04:06:02.840 align:start position:0%
okay I get it representative Ms um thank
 
04:06:05.550 --> 04:06:05.560 align:start position:0%
you can I just follow up on that and and
 
04:06:07.710 --> 04:06:07.720 align:start position:0%
my apologies if I'm not if I'm a little
 
04:06:10.710 --> 04:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
slow on the uptake here so there's $18
 
04:06:12.630 --> 04:06:12.640 align:start position:0%
million that was approved for the
 
04:06:12.640 --> 04:06:14.229 align:start position:0%
million that was approved for the
Tramway

04:06:14.229 --> 04:06:14.239 align:start position:0%
Tramway
 
04:06:18.870 --> 04:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
for the current bium yes that money is
 
04:06:21.110 --> 04:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
not being spent so that's coming back to
 
04:06:24.110 --> 04:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
the general fund in the in the current
 
04:06:29.630 --> 04:06:29.640 align:start position:0%
bium the FY 2425 bani yes okay
 
04:06:34.110 --> 04:06:34.120 align:start position:0%
um and then there's $20 million
 
04:06:37.710 --> 04:06:37.720 align:start position:0%
allocated in the capital budget for
 
04:06:39.950 --> 04:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
2627 in the
 
04:06:42.429 --> 04:06:42.439 align:start position:0%
governor's capital budget so we will go
 
04:06:45.710 --> 04:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
before the capital budget committee and
 
04:06:48.149 --> 04:06:48.159 align:start position:0%
try to secure their support for that
 
04:06:50.389 --> 04:06:50.399 align:start position:0%
okay and and there and so then there's
 
04:06:54.309 --> 04:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
nothing in this budget that we're
 
04:06:57.910 --> 04:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
reviewing um there's no money for for
 
04:06:59.710 --> 04:06:59.720 align:start position:0%
the Canon Mountain Tramway corre this
 
04:07:01.910 --> 04:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
budget correct okay thank you so Jack
 
04:07:03.469 --> 04:07:03.479 align:start position:0%
this makes me wonder if house Ways and
 
04:07:05.550 --> 04:07:05.560 align:start position:0%
Means knew about this 18
 
04:07:09.590 --> 04:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
million in their estimates yeah
 
04:07:12.309 --> 04:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
represent where here Does it show the
 
04:07:14.429 --> 04:07:14.439 align:start position:0%
monies that are transferred from Mount
 
04:07:16.750 --> 04:07:16.760 align:start position:0%
sop to
 
04:07:19.790 --> 04:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
can and how much might that be that
 
04:07:23.189 --> 04:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
would be accounting unit uh
 
04:07:26.510 --> 04:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
3705 on page let me see if I can find it
 
04:07:26.520 --> 04:07:37.269 align:start position:0%
3705 on page let me see if I can find it
for

04:07:37.269 --> 04:07:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:41.189 --> 04:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
you oh I'm sorry so I just remember so
 
04:07:42.710 --> 04:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
that's not an operating budget item you
 
04:07:44.309 --> 04:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
won't see
 
04:07:46.910 --> 04:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
the uh the budget for the Canam mountain
 
04:07:48.149 --> 04:07:48.159 align:start position:0%
and capital impr it's essentially the
 
04:07:50.389 --> 04:07:50.399 align:start position:0%
Canam Mountain Capital Improvement fund
 
04:07:52.990 --> 04:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
so what that is is it's a fund that is
 
04:07:56.189 --> 04:07:56.199 align:start position:0%
used to uh Provide support for
 
04:07:57.870 --> 04:07:57.880 align:start position:0%
maintenance costs at up at Canon
 
04:07:59.750 --> 04:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
Mountain authorized up to six million
 
04:08:03.070 --> 04:08:03.080 align:start position:0%
dollar in bonding the revenue from the
 
04:08:06.269 --> 04:08:06.279 align:start position:0%
sonap lease is used to pay the debt
 
04:08:10.189 --> 04:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
service on that bonding um but that is
 
04:08:12.590 --> 04:08:12.600 align:start position:0%
not built into the operating budget per
 
04:08:14.070 --> 04:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
se it is a
 
04:08:17.149 --> 04:08:17.159 align:start position:0%
separate request that occurs uh at the
 
04:08:19.830 --> 04:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
beginning of every fiscal year where I I
 
04:08:21.990 --> 04:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
make a request to appropriate what I
 
04:08:24.109 --> 04:08:24.119 align:start position:0%
think is the amount of Debt Service in
 
04:08:25.510 --> 04:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
concert with the treasury to get that
 
04:08:28.670 --> 04:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
number and then I budget the the same
 
04:08:31.910 --> 04:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
amount for Revenue um you know and the
 
04:08:34.070 --> 04:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
belief of course and it has been strong
 
04:08:35.950 --> 04:08:35.960 align:start position:0%
is we've been receiving revenue from
 
04:08:37.750 --> 04:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
that lease in excess of our debt service
 
04:08:39.910 --> 04:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
so we' built up a pretty good balance
 
04:08:42.030 --> 04:08:42.040 align:start position:0%
which is about how much right now we
 
04:08:45.710 --> 04:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
this year I think we we just posted um
 
04:08:49.510 --> 04:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh8 over $800,000 in
 
04:08:52.510 --> 04:08:52.520 align:start position:0%
Revenue okay uh representative
 
04:08:55.189 --> 04:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
Griffin yeah thank you Mr chair and
 
04:08:58.149 --> 04:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question obviously
 
04:09:00.710 --> 04:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
of all the divisions we look at weather
 
04:09:04.469 --> 04:09:04.479 align:start position:0%
is a huge factor with you people and um
 
04:09:07.670 --> 04:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering whether it's also a factor
 
04:09:10.670 --> 04:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
and expenses it obviously can affect
 
04:09:13.870 --> 04:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
your Revenue a poor winter and a poor
 
04:09:17.149 --> 04:09:17.159 align:start position:0%
summer really affects your revenue does
 
04:09:21.309 --> 04:09:21.319 align:start position:0%
it also affect your expenses
 
04:09:24.510 --> 04:09:24.520 align:start position:0%
proportionately thank you great question
 
04:09:27.189 --> 04:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
um we've had a great winter so far by
 
04:09:29.590 --> 04:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
the way and revenue at Canon is is is up
 
04:09:31.750 --> 04:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
which is awesome um one of the reasons
 
04:09:33.910 --> 04:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
we try to keep a healthy Park fund is
 
04:09:35.670 --> 04:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
for that reason right if it's a rainy
 
04:09:38.830 --> 04:09:38.840 align:start position:0%
summer um the parks license plates also
 
04:09:41.870 --> 04:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
help us um predict you know our budget
 
04:09:44.870 --> 04:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
better because uh the of the support
 
04:09:47.630 --> 04:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
from uh folks who buy that license plate
 
04:09:50.830 --> 04:09:50.840 align:start position:0%
but yes weather of of course um creates
 
04:09:53.229 --> 04:09:53.239 align:start position:0%
costs at Hampton Beach you know this the
 
04:09:55.550 --> 04:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
winter storms at Hampton Beach put a
 
04:09:58.030 --> 04:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
number on our parking lots as
 
04:10:00.790 --> 04:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
representative Ms must notice um we have
 
04:10:03.830 --> 04:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
to do a lot of prep preparation to get
 
04:10:06.670 --> 04:10:06.680 align:start position:0%
uh the beach safe for the summer um I'd
 
04:10:09.070 --> 04:10:09.080 align:start position:0%
also say that I've learned a ton about
 
04:10:14.070 --> 04:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
CTS in this position and um uh you know
 
04:10:18.630 --> 04:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
weather um puts a strain on our CTS um
 
04:10:21.510 --> 04:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh both for our roads that we manage in
 
04:10:23.189 --> 04:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
and out of parks but for our trail
 
04:10:26.469 --> 04:10:26.479 align:start position:0%
system um too so Bridges and culverts um
 
04:10:29.830 --> 04:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
get expensive in a hurry um we you know
 
04:10:33.189 --> 04:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
we try our best to um catch up with all
 
04:10:36.149 --> 04:10:36.159 align:start position:0%
of this stuff in in in time for a season
 
04:10:37.870 --> 04:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
which holds us accountable really
 
04:10:40.109 --> 04:10:40.119 align:start position:0%
because you know if things aren't fixed
 
04:10:42.910 --> 04:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
in time for ATV season our phones are
 
04:10:42.920 --> 04:10:43.910 align:start position:0%
in time for ATV season our phones are
ringing

04:10:43.910 --> 04:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
ringing
 
04:10:46.510 --> 04:10:46.520 align:start position:0%
um so we really do try to get ahead of
 
04:10:49.510 --> 04:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
the problem as as seasonally as possible
 
04:10:51.429 --> 04:10:51.439 align:start position:0%
um but yeah it it the we weather for
 
04:10:54.349 --> 04:10:54.359 align:start position:0%
sure is a is a cost
 
04:10:54.359 --> 04:10:55.910 align:start position:0%
sure is a is a cost
Factor

04:10:55.910 --> 04:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
Factor
 
04:11:00.429 --> 04:11:00.439 align:start position:0%
yeah yes Mr Le representative Le thanks
 
04:11:03.389 --> 04:11:03.399 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman so one of your earlier
 
04:11:05.269 --> 04:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
statements you mentioned the cutback and
 
04:11:08.790 --> 04:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
like fire support I think like
 
04:11:12.070 --> 04:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
62% the Staffing of like what 12 fire
 
04:11:14.790 --> 04:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
Towers uh knowing that you had like a
 
04:11:17.389 --> 04:11:17.399 align:start position:0%
record number of fires last year yeah
 
04:11:18.870 --> 04:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
and that could happen again how would
 
04:11:21.750 --> 04:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
you handle the funding of that if you
 
04:11:24.349 --> 04:11:24.359 align:start position:0%
had to staff up fire Towers or found
 
04:11:26.750 --> 04:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
ourselves in a drought as we have in the
 
04:11:29.950 --> 04:11:29.960 align:start position:0%
past internally about this in particular
 
04:11:31.229 --> 04:11:31.239 align:start position:0%
um New
 
04:11:34.269 --> 04:11:34.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this season was very busy um
 
04:11:35.750 --> 04:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
not only in New Hampshire but in helping
 
04:11:37.389 --> 04:11:37.399 align:start position:0%
our neighbors to the South and to the
 
04:11:39.630 --> 04:11:39.640 align:start position:0%
north you know fires in Canada fires in
 
04:11:42.189 --> 04:11:42.199 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um we really are Regional
 
04:11:43.750 --> 04:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
Support Network
 
04:11:49.670 --> 04:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
um and uh one one blessing to um to
 
04:11:52.750 --> 04:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
fires is that we get to send our staff
 
04:11:54.950 --> 04:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
out west to really get some excellent
 
04:11:57.070 --> 04:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
training and bring back their knowledge
 
04:11:59.630 --> 04:11:59.640 align:start position:0%
here to the New England region uh so we
 
04:12:01.950 --> 04:12:01.960 align:start position:0%
take advantage of those opportunities if
 
04:12:03.750 --> 04:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
you will um so we have a very
 
04:12:06.070 --> 04:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
sophisticated and and and well-trained
 
04:12:09.269 --> 04:12:09.279 align:start position:0%
team that we share our knowledge base um
 
04:12:11.910 --> 04:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
beyond our our division walls with the
 
04:12:14.950 --> 04:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
local fired departments and our um in
 
04:12:18.349 --> 04:12:18.359 align:start position:0%
our regional uh uh Partners but Patrick
 
04:12:19.510 --> 04:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
I'll let you speak a little bit more
 
04:12:22.510 --> 04:12:22.520 align:start position:0%
about that can I just comment we may be
 
04:12:26.870 --> 04:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
on page 558 State Fire assistance is
 
04:12:29.710 --> 04:12:29.720 align:start position:0%
that right and that's going up this is
 
04:12:31.790 --> 04:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
federal funds but it's it looks like the
 
04:12:33.670 --> 04:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
FED federal government is putting a lot
 
04:12:37.550 --> 04:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
more money into this right um our forest
 
04:12:39.349 --> 04:12:39.359 align:start position:0%
Protection Bureau where our Rangers
 
04:12:42.149 --> 04:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
reside or where they work that's their
 
04:12:45.030 --> 04:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
um division
 
04:12:48.109 --> 04:12:48.119 align:start position:0%
uh we while it's one of our largest
 
04:12:50.590 --> 04:12:50.600 align:start position:0%
generally funded uh sections of our
 
04:12:52.950 --> 04:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
division it also is well funded by
 
04:12:55.670 --> 04:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
federal funds that we pass through to
 
04:12:58.630 --> 04:12:58.640 align:start position:0%
the towns for equipment purchases we
 
04:13:03.070 --> 04:13:03.080 align:start position:0%
also have a federal um uh equipment
 
04:13:07.630 --> 04:13:07.640 align:start position:0%
program that we administer so when uh
 
04:13:09.750 --> 04:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
fire trucks engines Jeeps become
 
04:13:12.189 --> 04:13:12.199 align:start position:0%
available on the federal they have a
 
04:13:15.710 --> 04:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
kind of a online inventory our people
 
04:13:18.590 --> 04:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
find out what the towns need secure the
 
04:13:20.389 --> 04:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
the equipment and deliver them to the
 
04:13:22.670 --> 04:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
towns all with the the support of
 
04:13:22.680 --> 04:13:23.550 align:start position:0%
towns all with the the support of
federal

04:13:23.550 --> 04:13:23.560 align:start position:0%
federal
 
04:13:27.030 --> 04:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
funding um so yeah it's it's a great
 
04:13:29.950 --> 04:13:29.960 align:start position:0%
program and and the towns depend on our
 
04:13:32.550 --> 04:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
Bureau and our Rangers for training we
 
04:13:35.550 --> 04:13:35.560 align:start position:0%
provide equipment with water pumps and
 
04:13:37.149 --> 04:13:37.159 align:start position:0%
techniques for
 
04:13:39.429 --> 04:13:39.439 align:start position:0%
suppression um so when they're not
 
04:13:41.830 --> 04:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
enforcing Timber harvesting laws or
 
04:13:43.870 --> 04:13:43.880 align:start position:0%
engaged in um
 
04:13:45.429 --> 04:13:45.439 align:start position:0%
uh fire suppression and detection
 
04:13:46.990 --> 04:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
they're training they're doing workshops
 
04:13:49.630 --> 04:13:49.640 align:start position:0%
with the towns I did want to get back to
 
04:13:51.349 --> 04:13:51.359 align:start position:0%
representative leishman's question
 
04:13:54.750 --> 04:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
though um it is a concern so just to be
 
04:13:58.349 --> 04:13:58.359 align:start position:0%
very brief it is a concern with these um
 
04:14:00.510 --> 04:14:00.520 align:start position:0%
increasingly dry Summers and this was a
 
04:14:02.229 --> 04:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
record-breaking fall as the commissioner
 
04:14:06.109 --> 04:14:06.119 align:start position:0%
alluded to fortunately we we were about
 
04:14:08.550 --> 04:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
average in New Hampshire but our
 
04:14:10.910 --> 04:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
neighbors to the South uh Massachusetts
 
04:14:14.229 --> 04:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
and Connecticut had record years
 
04:14:17.349 --> 04:14:17.359 align:start position:0%
so so one of our sergeants who uh we we
 
04:14:19.590 --> 04:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
miss that's the unfunded position our
 
04:14:21.429 --> 04:14:21.439 align:start position:0%
Sergeant he took a position with
 
04:14:23.389 --> 04:14:23.399 align:start position:0%
Connecticut as their Force fire
 
04:14:25.710 --> 04:14:25.720 align:start position:0%
supervisor within two weeks when he got
 
04:14:28.389 --> 04:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
there there are fires all across
 
04:14:30.870 --> 04:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and uh he had to call in a
 
04:14:32.950 --> 04:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
helicopter from Maine part of that
 
04:14:34.710 --> 04:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
network of support we have with the
 
04:14:37.590 --> 04:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
other states and uh they they mobilized
 
04:14:40.630 --> 04:14:40.640 align:start position:0%
their National Guard um and I think the
 
04:14:41.870 --> 04:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
the governor declared a state of
 
04:14:43.670 --> 04:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
emergency on at least a couple of what
 
04:14:46.070 --> 04:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
we call Red Flag days when the humidity
 
04:14:48.790 --> 04:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
relative humidity is low and the
 
04:14:50.790 --> 04:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
temperatures are high and there's a wind
 
04:14:53.189 --> 04:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
a steady wind I think I don't know that
 
04:14:54.830 --> 04:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
the limit but has to be a certain amount
 
04:14:56.510 --> 04:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
of those three factors called the Red
 
04:14:59.070 --> 04:14:59.080 align:start position:0%
Flag Day so there are there record
 
04:15:02.389 --> 04:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
number of dry fall days that um in in
 
04:15:04.149 --> 04:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts there they had two fires
 
04:15:06.030 --> 04:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
are over a thousand acres in size which
 
04:15:08.269 --> 04:15:08.279 align:start position:0%
is unusual for a new small New England
 
04:15:10.510 --> 04:15:10.520 align:start position:0%
State I guess to my question where would
 
04:15:12.389 --> 04:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
the money come from if you needed to
 
04:15:15.349 --> 04:15:15.359 align:start position:0%
staff the fire tower get people out in
 
04:15:17.229 --> 04:15:17.239 align:start position:0%
the field right so we have two buckets
 
04:15:18.510 --> 04:15:18.520 align:start position:0%
of money we have General funds and we
 
04:15:20.990 --> 04:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
have federal funds so we're we're
 
04:15:22.870 --> 04:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
toggling between those two buckets to
 
04:15:24.710 --> 04:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
fund either the Wildfire
 
04:15:28.149 --> 04:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
patrols or the the fire tower Staffing
 
04:15:31.070 --> 04:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
but we can't do both so we had to make a
 
04:15:34.830 --> 04:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
choice so that's the situation we're in
 
04:15:37.269 --> 04:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
with with the budget cuts I you know I
 
04:15:40.269 --> 04:15:40.279 align:start position:0%
we could seek perhaps additional grant
 
04:15:42.389 --> 04:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
funding from the federal side but I'm
 
04:15:44.429 --> 04:15:44.439 align:start position:0%
sure all of you know the the Federal
 
04:15:46.670 --> 04:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
grant funding is is under duress these
 
04:15:49.510 --> 04:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
days as well so that bucket is less
 
04:15:52.030 --> 04:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
certain than General funding in New
 
04:15:54.950 --> 04:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I did have another question Mr
 
04:15:56.990 --> 04:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
chairman I know we're getting close to
 
04:16:00.750 --> 04:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
the have 30 seconds perhaps uh I heard
 
04:16:02.070 --> 04:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
from a friend of mine with the timber
 
04:16:04.710 --> 04:16:04.720 align:start position:0%
land Owners Association and you talked
 
04:16:07.429 --> 04:16:07.439 align:start position:0%
about selling your Timber off to the saw
 
04:16:09.950 --> 04:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
mills and he informed me that the mills
 
04:16:12.389 --> 04:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
in Canada aren't taking product now
 
04:16:14.590 --> 04:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
because of the tariff issue they don't
 
04:16:16.670 --> 04:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
want to take New Hampshire logs or us
 
04:16:19.269 --> 04:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
logs and not be able to sell them on the
 
04:16:21.550 --> 04:16:21.560 align:start position:0%
return trip have you heard anything
 
04:16:23.309 --> 04:16:23.319 align:start position:0%
about that or is that a significant
 
04:16:25.950 --> 04:16:25.960 align:start position:0%
concern that we can't move our lumber to
 
04:16:28.990 --> 04:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
Canada because the Mills AR accepting it
 
04:16:30.790 --> 04:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
I hadn't heard it until now but it's not
 
04:16:33.269 --> 04:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
surprising that happened four years ago
 
04:16:34.429 --> 04:16:34.439 align:start position:0%
in the in the previous Trump
 
04:16:35.950 --> 04:16:35.960 align:start position:0%
Administration there was some issues
 
04:16:39.990 --> 04:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
with moving logs to Canada
 
04:16:42.590 --> 04:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
um yeah so they'll find other markets
 
04:16:44.790 --> 04:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
proba for their for their Timber but the
 
04:16:47.109 --> 04:16:47.119 align:start position:0%
Canadians pay pretty well so that that's
 
04:16:48.510 --> 04:16:48.520 align:start position:0%
a frustration for the land owners
 
04:16:50.870 --> 04:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
selling the timber as well as the the
 
04:16:53.750 --> 04:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
loggers and Foresters involved yeah
 
04:16:56.189 --> 04:16:56.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks okay um
 
04:16:58.389 --> 04:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
yeah we're almost out of time so let me
 
04:17:02.710 --> 04:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:07.750 --> 04:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
589 um and 590 I guess um what are these
 
04:17:11.630 --> 04:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
grants um National recreational Trails
 
04:17:13.349 --> 04:17:13.359 align:start position:0%
fund um
 
04:17:17.189 --> 04:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
we're doing grants that are more than
 
04:17:21.030 --> 04:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
doubling um and also contracts for
 
04:17:28.550 --> 04:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:30.710 --> 04:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
doubling yeah so thanks for the question
 
04:17:33.830 --> 04:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
so th this one here um these are these
 
04:17:36.349 --> 04:17:36.359 align:start position:0%
are grants that we receive actually the
 
04:17:38.910 --> 04:17:38.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation the federal
 
04:17:41.550 --> 04:17:41.560 align:start position:0%
do gives a gives a huge block grant to
 
04:17:43.710 --> 04:17:43.720 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire do and then New
 
04:17:45.469 --> 04:17:45.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire dot allocat so we actually
 
04:17:48.309 --> 04:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
receive an amount from that uh straight
 
04:17:50.510 --> 04:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire do the numbers that
 
04:17:52.790 --> 04:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
are budgeted are based on the figures
 
04:17:55.389 --> 04:17:55.399 align:start position:0%
that they give us to say that this is
 
04:17:58.309 --> 04:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
how much we have to give you for 26 27
 
04:18:00.510 --> 04:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
so that's where these numbers come from
 
04:18:02.389 --> 04:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
we don't make these numbers up they we
 
04:18:05.149 --> 04:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
actually uh receive them from New
 
04:18:07.990 --> 04:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire do uh then it's up to us to
 
04:18:10.910 --> 04:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
basically turn around and budget and you
 
04:18:12.830 --> 04:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
can you'll notice that a substantial
 
04:18:16.269 --> 04:18:16.279 align:start position:0%
portion of it is is actually grants to
 
04:18:18.630 --> 04:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities communities and the and
 
04:18:21.269 --> 04:18:21.279 align:start position:0%
the like so that's potentially doing
 
04:18:25.670 --> 04:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
what for for uh maintenance of of trails
 
04:18:28.109 --> 04:18:28.119 align:start position:0%
the trails Bureau yeah essentially okay
 
04:18:29.910 --> 04:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
yeah these are for Trails for clubs uh
 
04:18:35.590 --> 04:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
snowmobile ATV Etc I see so it's just um
 
04:18:38.990 --> 04:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
do gets a big General sort of Federal
 
04:18:41.910 --> 04:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
Grant and they decide how much to give
 
04:18:44.590 --> 04:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
you is that yeah there's a formula for
 
04:18:46.710 --> 04:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
for it but yes we receive a portion of
 
04:18:50.229 --> 04:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
that but is it that the feds gave them
 
04:18:52.309 --> 04:18:52.319 align:start position:0%
twice as much or it's
 
04:18:55.229 --> 04:18:55.239 align:start position:0%
just I assume so I don't talk to do to
 
04:18:59.510 --> 04:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
ask okay so I I can ask division to yeah
 
04:19:02.149 --> 04:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
we're can I know we're out of time but
 
04:19:04.229 --> 04:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
could you just give us just sort of a
 
04:19:06.269 --> 04:19:06.279 align:start position:0%
snapshot of your thoughts on the
 
04:19:08.349 --> 04:19:08.359 align:start position:0%
condition of our state parks I know they
 
04:19:11.269 --> 04:19:11.279 align:start position:0%
get an awful lot of use and I know with
 
04:19:13.670 --> 04:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
budget cuts maintenances challenging and
 
04:19:18.590 --> 04:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
I'm just you know curious thank you so
 
04:19:20.590 --> 04:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
we do things the New Hampshire way in
 
04:19:22.550 --> 04:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and we are one of two
 
04:19:24.469 --> 04:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
states I believe that are operationally
 
04:19:26.910 --> 04:19:26.920 align:start position:0%
self-funded for our Park system which
 
04:19:29.630 --> 04:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
has worked really well for us especially
 
04:19:31.510 --> 04:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
when we have to tighten things up with a
 
04:19:35.630 --> 04:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
general fund um we uh have you know an
 
04:19:37.910 --> 04:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
endless list of Maintenance uh we we
 
04:19:40.950 --> 04:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
always will um but we we are
 
04:19:43.910 --> 04:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
strategizing every year and and we go to
 
04:19:46.229 --> 04:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
Capital uh with you know our top
 
04:19:48.670 --> 04:19:48.680 align:start position:0%
priorities the capital budget committee
 
04:19:50.510 --> 04:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
and they've over the the years have been
 
04:19:53.910 --> 04:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
very gracious um you know profer up uh
 
04:19:56.349 --> 04:19:56.359 align:start position:0%
Investments of a couple million dollars
 
04:19:59.269 --> 04:19:59.279 align:start position:0%
uh which helps um it helps um make sure
 
04:20:01.790 --> 04:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
that you know we prioritize our safety
 
04:20:06.349 --> 04:20:06.359 align:start position:0%
situations first um we benefited from a
 
04:20:09.469 --> 04:20:09.479 align:start position:0%
very generous arpa allocation which
 
04:20:13.030 --> 04:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
allowed us to uh to grow some of our
 
04:20:15.149 --> 04:20:15.159 align:start position:0%
campgrounds which then provides more
 
04:20:17.550 --> 04:20:17.560 align:start position:0%
Revenue um so we made one-time
 
04:20:19.750 --> 04:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
Investments with arpa where we would get
 
04:20:22.109 --> 04:20:22.119 align:start position:0%
a return on that investment so that's
 
04:20:24.590 --> 04:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
that makes us feel a little optimistic
 
04:20:26.309 --> 04:20:26.319 align:start position:0%
about how we're moving forward our
 
04:20:29.710 --> 04:20:29.720 align:start position:0%
campgrounds are booked you know um 90%
 
04:20:32.389 --> 04:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
of the time uh which is a good thing um
 
04:20:34.830 --> 04:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
but we we need to uh be strategic about
 
04:20:37.189 --> 04:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
how we're expanding and updating our
 
04:20:40.229 --> 04:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
bathrooms bathrooms are very expensive
 
04:20:43.630 --> 04:20:43.640 align:start position:0%
um and they're in remote areas um my
 
04:20:45.349 --> 04:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
least favorite bathroom is on top of
 
04:20:48.429 --> 04:20:48.439 align:start position:0%
Mount Washington cuz that's like not
 
04:20:52.670 --> 04:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
supposed to be there um but yeah we I
 
04:20:54.309 --> 04:20:54.319 align:start position:0%
think because we're oper operationally
 
04:20:56.590 --> 04:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
self-funded and we've maintained a
 
04:20:59.670 --> 04:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
healthy um State Park fund a rainy day
 
04:21:04.950 --> 04:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
fund um we're able to be strategic
 
04:21:08.469 --> 04:21:08.479 align:start position:0%
um we had to close Greenfield state park
 
04:21:10.830 --> 04:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
for some Renovations um we just decided
 
04:21:12.229 --> 04:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
we'll just instead of doing peace meal
 
04:21:14.229 --> 04:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
we'll just close it for a season that
 
04:21:16.590 --> 04:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
will impact our Revenue a little bit but
 
04:21:19.630 --> 04:21:19.640 align:start position:0%
we we you know we planned for that um
 
04:21:22.550 --> 04:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
and uh revenues right now we get a
 
04:21:26.389 --> 04:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
weekly revenue report and uh it's it's
 
04:21:29.309 --> 04:21:29.319 align:start position:0%
very optimistic um people love our state
 
04:21:32.790 --> 04:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
parks um we have as we noted you know
 
04:21:34.990 --> 04:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
several hundred seasonals well those
 
04:21:36.590 --> 04:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
aren't brand new every year a lot of
 
04:21:39.030 --> 04:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
them have worked with us for 20 30 40
 
04:21:42.870 --> 04:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
years um so there's um there's a a a a
 
04:21:46.750 --> 04:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
love for protecting these places um and
 
04:21:49.429 --> 04:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
uh and as you know through pocket
 
04:21:51.030 --> 04:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
pockets of communities around the state
 
04:21:52.990 --> 04:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
are very passionate about their local
 
04:21:55.550 --> 04:21:55.560 align:start position:0%
outdoor spaces and they hold us
 
04:21:59.030 --> 04:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
accountable um so you know people adopt
 
04:22:01.109 --> 04:22:01.119 align:start position:0%
their state parks as their own and I
 
04:22:02.750 --> 04:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have it any other way because
 
04:22:06.830 --> 04:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
it keeps us um on track and uh I'm sure
 
04:22:08.910 --> 04:22:08.920 align:start position:0%
you hear about it if somebody's upset
 
04:22:12.309 --> 04:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
with a parking lot or a bathroom or um
 
04:22:13.790 --> 04:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
any any other experience that they have
 
04:22:15.229 --> 04:22:15.239 align:start position:0%
that's not acceptable we've worked
 
04:22:18.389 --> 04:22:18.399 align:start position:0%
really hard on training um on on sort of
 
04:22:23.109 --> 04:22:23.119 align:start position:0%
the the the um customer service part of
 
04:22:25.630 --> 04:22:25.640 align:start position:0%
state parks uh to professionalize our
 
04:22:28.590 --> 04:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
operations and when we go to I go to a
 
04:22:32.550 --> 04:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
manager meeting twice a year and um they
 
04:22:34.389 --> 04:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
it's a professional operation it's it's
 
04:22:36.950 --> 04:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
really impressive it's not just um show
 
04:22:39.269 --> 04:22:39.279 align:start position:0%
up and and mow the lawn it's a lot more
 
04:22:41.670 --> 04:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
more than that and it's it's doing very
 
04:22:44.670 --> 04:22:44.680 align:start position:0%
well do you do any kind of joint
 
04:22:47.030 --> 04:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
marketing programs with the division of
 
04:22:50.189 --> 04:22:50.199 align:start position:0%
travel and tourism so if you recall
 
04:22:53.590 --> 04:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
dread really tied travel and tourism
 
04:22:55.670 --> 04:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
with state parks it was all under one
 
04:22:58.149 --> 04:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
agency um and so there was a bit of a a
 
04:23:00.550 --> 04:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
learning curve when that was untangled
 
04:23:02.790 --> 04:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
but we now um have our own marketing
 
04:23:05.469 --> 04:23:05.479 align:start position:0%
contract for state parks um the short
 
04:23:07.910 --> 04:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
answer is yes we like to be very similar
 
04:23:10.189 --> 04:23:10.199 align:start position:0%
with what travel and tourism is doing so
 
04:23:12.990 --> 04:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
that we can all benefit from um you know
 
04:23:16.349 --> 04:23:16.359 align:start position:0%
a similar approach um with our marketing
 
04:23:21.309 --> 04:23:21.319 align:start position:0%
um but uh yeah we we we I think per RSA
 
04:23:25.269 --> 04:23:25.279 align:start position:0%
we're still um connected in in terms of
 
04:23:27.750 --> 04:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
messaging and marketing uh to make sure
 
04:23:28.990 --> 04:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
that we're not saying two different
 
04:23:32.630 --> 04:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
things um to the public yeah I'm just
 
04:23:34.950 --> 04:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
trying to get feedback as to how
 
04:23:37.309 --> 04:23:37.319 align:start position:0%
effective those things are I mean you
 
04:23:40.109 --> 04:23:40.119 align:start position:0%
said we're doing well yeah getting
 
04:23:42.670 --> 04:23:42.680 align:start position:0%
people in but is it that your marketing
 
04:23:44.630 --> 04:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
their marketing or some combination you
 
04:23:47.189 --> 04:23:47.199 align:start position:0%
don't know probably I don't I don't know
 
04:23:49.309 --> 04:23:49.319 align:start position:0%
um I think that I think that's a or just
 
04:23:51.550 --> 04:23:51.560 align:start position:0%
natural a fact a fascinating question
 
04:23:53.389 --> 04:23:53.399 align:start position:0%
and and I think it's worthy of of
 
04:23:56.149 --> 04:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
research we're so busy every day that we
 
04:23:57.870 --> 04:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
haven't had the time to step back and do
 
04:23:59.830 --> 04:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
some of that research but uh we're
 
04:24:01.990 --> 04:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
aggressive with our with our marketing
 
04:24:03.429 --> 04:24:03.439 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you commissioner
 
04:24:05.750 --> 04:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
Stewart um I don't know if we'll have to
 
04:24:08.510 --> 04:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
ask you back but we may so because you I
 
04:24:11.389 --> 04:24:11.399 align:start position:0%
mean you have 65 Pages here so it's like
 
04:24:12.990 --> 04:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
a lot in HB
 
04:24:15.590 --> 04:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
yes yeah so certainly for hb2 we'll have
 
04:24:17.349 --> 04:24:17.359 align:start position:0%
I won't go on any more vacations okay
 
04:24:19.429 --> 04:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for the month of March at
 
04:24:22.910 --> 04:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
least okay thank you all right um so is
 
04:24:27.910 --> 04:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
is um commissioner Jasper here maybe
 
04:24:29.910 --> 04:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
we're GNA be going to
 
04:24:36.670 --> 04:24:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:38.990 --> 04:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
242 hey
 
04:24:50.510 --> 04:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:52.710 --> 04:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
so nothing goes through the cracks here
 
04:24:56.269 --> 04:24:56.279 align:start position:0%
how about executive office um that's us
 
04:24:58.870 --> 04:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
but we probably won't see them like the
 
04:25:00.910 --> 04:25:00.920 align:start position:0%
governor that's the governor yeah we saw
 
04:25:03.710 --> 04:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
them at the uh bigger meeting at the
 
04:25:06.469 --> 04:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
full Finance kind of kind
 
04:25:08.790 --> 04:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
of if you looked at them there probably
 
04:25:12.030 --> 04:25:12.040 align:start position:0%
be a small number here yeah oh fees here
 
04:25:14.389 --> 04:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:18.550 --> 04:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
oh is Community College under r no
 
04:25:23.950 --> 04:25:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:26.429 --> 04:25:26.439 align:start position:0%
two all right I'm sorry we're late
 
04:25:26.439 --> 04:26:02.950 align:start position:0%
two all right I'm sorry we're late
commissioner

04:26:02.950 --> 04:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:04.790 --> 04:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
um so I'm thank you for coming
 
04:26:06.469 --> 04:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
commissioner so I'm I'm just just
 
04:26:09.510 --> 04:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
reading your letter here um we currently
 
04:26:10.710 --> 04:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
spend over
 
04:26:13.950 --> 04:26:13.960 align:start position:0%
$350,000 on pet vending what does that
 
04:26:15.469 --> 04:26:15.479 align:start position:0%
mean what do you what are you spend what
 
04:26:19.469 --> 04:26:19.479 align:start position:0%
are you doing that oh what are we doing
 
04:26:23.710 --> 04:26:23.720 align:start position:0%
well we uh spend a lot of time doing
 
04:26:27.070 --> 04:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
inspections and followup there are you
 
04:26:29.590 --> 04:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
know thousands and thousands I think you
 
04:26:31.389 --> 04:26:31.399 align:start position:0%
know there are numbers in here about
 
04:26:33.670 --> 04:26:33.680 align:start position:0%
55,000 animals that are transferred
 
04:26:36.349 --> 04:26:36.359 align:start position:0%
around the state and we regulate the
 
04:26:39.870 --> 04:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
people who uh are engaged in that and
 
04:26:43.510 --> 04:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
those can be rescues or uh
 
04:26:45.870 --> 04:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
for-profits um but they have standards
 
04:26:48.710 --> 04:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
that the legislature has uh assigned
 
04:26:51.149 --> 04:26:51.159 align:start position:0%
that they must meet and so we try to get
 
04:26:53.590 --> 04:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
in twice a year but in reality if
 
04:26:55.710 --> 04:26:55.720 align:start position:0%
somebody has a clean bill of health
 
04:26:58.389 --> 04:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
we're probably only in these location
 
04:27:01.990 --> 04:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
once a year but um there is a lot of
 
04:27:05.950 --> 04:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
work that that goes with the trade and
 
04:27:08.349 --> 04:27:08.359 align:start position:0%
um spend a lot of time on those who are
 
04:27:11.309 --> 04:27:11.319 align:start position:0%
not complying with the laws and and have
 
04:27:14.389 --> 04:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
problems so we spend you know probably
 
04:27:15.550 --> 04:27:15.560 align:start position:0%
two and a
 
04:27:19.950 --> 04:27:19.960 align:start position:0%
half um people within the
 
04:27:24.590 --> 04:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
four uh of our four um yeah what am I
 
04:27:26.389 --> 04:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
trying to say four veterinarian
 
04:27:28.990 --> 04:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
technicians and excuse me I have had two
 
04:27:32.750 --> 04:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
very poor nights of sleep we were in DC
 
04:27:35.950 --> 04:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
got held over without our luggage uh and
 
04:27:38.790 --> 04:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
on top of that I had a severe case of
 
04:27:41.309 --> 04:27:41.319 align:start position:0%
gout and I could barely walk I thought
 
04:27:42.590 --> 04:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
he was going to be pushing me through
 
04:27:45.229 --> 04:27:45.239 align:start position:0%
the airport in a wheelchair I managed
 
04:27:48.750 --> 04:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
and so I am not very sharp today so
 
04:27:52.229 --> 04:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
forgive me but um yeah it's uh it is the
 
04:27:53.950 --> 04:27:53.960 align:start position:0%
bane of our existence if we could find
 
04:27:55.670 --> 04:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
somebody else to do pet vending and if
 
04:27:57.070 --> 04:27:57.080 align:start position:0%
you find anybody who says they need
 
04:27:58.510 --> 04:27:58.520 align:start position:0%
something else to do we're glad to give
 
04:28:01.030 --> 04:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
them pet vending although we just did
 
04:28:04.510 --> 04:28:04.520 align:start position:0%
develop our uh animal database where now
 
04:28:07.830 --> 04:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
we're having um you know probably on
 
04:28:09.030 --> 04:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
average about
 
04:28:11.790 --> 04:28:11.800 align:start position:0%
120 certificates come through that on in
 
04:28:13.229 --> 04:28:13.239 align:start position:0%
a day
 
04:28:15.070 --> 04:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
is it something where most of the
 
04:28:17.229 --> 04:28:17.239 align:start position:0%
problems you find are due to complaints
 
04:28:19.510 --> 04:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
rather than due to inspections um there
 
04:28:23.149 --> 04:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
are a lot of complaints but most of the
 
04:28:25.269 --> 04:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
the problems I think we find are people
 
04:28:27.910 --> 04:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
not meeting the the standards and a lot
 
04:28:29.389 --> 04:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
of that has to do with when you're
 
04:28:31.790 --> 04:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
having animals if you have untreated
 
04:28:33.590 --> 04:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
surfaces and animals are scratching at
 
04:28:35.830 --> 04:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
them it's a breeding ground for
 
04:28:38.389 --> 04:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
bacterior disease and they're supposed
 
04:28:43.830 --> 04:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
to be um painted or M um impervious to
 
04:28:46.550 --> 04:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
to water to things like that and
 
04:28:49.269 --> 04:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
improper paperwork a lot of times with
 
04:28:51.950 --> 04:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
you know we've seen some where it says
 
04:28:53.710 --> 04:28:53.720 align:start position:0%
it was a dog and then someplace else on
 
04:28:55.189 --> 04:28:55.199 align:start position:0%
the same paperwork I might say it was a
 
04:28:57.109 --> 04:28:57.119 align:start position:0%
cat so trying to figure out what are we
 
04:28:59.590 --> 04:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
actually dealing with so paperwork is a
 
04:29:03.510 --> 04:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
big issue and so yes represented M thank
 
04:29:05.630 --> 04:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for coming in
 
04:29:09.510 --> 04:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
again um are the are the
 
04:29:11.510 --> 04:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
requirements in this area that the
 
04:29:13.870 --> 04:29:13.880 align:start position:0%
legisl has charged you with are they
 
04:29:15.510 --> 04:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
still reasonable I mean are they
 
04:29:17.429 --> 04:29:17.439 align:start position:0%
consistent with best practice in the
 
04:29:19.710 --> 04:29:19.720 align:start position:0%
rest of the country I believe that that
 
04:29:21.389 --> 04:29:21.399 align:start position:0%
they are there and there's nothing in
 
04:29:23.429 --> 04:29:23.439 align:start position:0%
there the vast majority of our pet
 
04:29:25.590 --> 04:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
vendors are able to meet the
 
04:29:29.349 --> 04:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
requirements uh very easily one of the
 
04:29:31.189 --> 04:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
the common things that we get from
 
04:29:33.950 --> 04:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
people who aren't is well yeah but I'm
 
04:29:37.349 --> 04:29:37.359 align:start position:0%
I'm doing good I'm doing good work well
 
04:29:39.349 --> 04:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
there's not an exemption in the law for
 
04:29:41.030 --> 04:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
doing good work you don't get to violate
 
04:29:42.670 --> 04:29:42.680 align:start position:0%
the law just cuz you're trying to do
 
04:29:45.910 --> 04:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
good so it's there's a lot of drama
 
04:29:47.830 --> 04:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
literally there is a lot of drama
 
04:29:50.189 --> 04:29:50.199 align:start position:0%
involved in
 
04:29:53.389 --> 04:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
this are these vendors licensed they are
 
04:29:55.750 --> 04:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
licensed if they so that's this $30,000
 
04:29:58.710 --> 04:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
licensing that is correct I see so
 
04:30:00.910 --> 04:30:00.920 align:start position:0%
you're proposing not to raise that but
 
04:30:03.830 --> 04:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
more to have a per a per animal right
 
04:30:05.469 --> 04:30:05.479 align:start position:0%
because that would make it proportional
 
04:30:08.269 --> 04:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
based on the usage particularly of of
 
04:30:10.990 --> 04:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
this multi-million dollar database that
 
04:30:12.710 --> 04:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
we have and the
 
04:30:14.590 --> 04:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
and the requirements to maintain it I'm
 
04:30:17.070 --> 04:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
sure you all know how much uh the annual
 
04:30:19.590 --> 04:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
licensing fees are so I understand all
 
04:30:23.950 --> 04:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
right the next one pesticide product
 
04:30:26.830 --> 04:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
registration um yes have not increased
 
04:30:29.710 --> 04:30:29.720 align:start position:0%
the fees since 18 1980s okay so we're
 
04:30:32.910 --> 04:30:32.920 align:start position:0%
talking about 40 years
 
04:30:39.710 --> 04:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:42.630 --> 04:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
um and the biggest one of the fees there
 
04:30:47.830 --> 04:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
we can actually do within um in no yeah
 
04:30:50.670 --> 04:30:50.680 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah that's the one that is in Rule
 
04:30:53.109 --> 04:30:53.119 align:start position:0%
and uh we can produce a lot more Revenue
 
04:30:56.469 --> 04:30:56.479 align:start position:0%
there uh and I I do propose that we go
 
04:30:58.670 --> 04:30:58.680 align:start position:0%
forward with that as we're looking at
 
04:31:01.790 --> 04:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
all of these so you don't need a don't
 
04:31:04.189 --> 04:31:04.199 align:start position:0%
need change for that don't need on that
 
04:31:06.870 --> 04:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
but the the other increases we do and we
 
04:31:09.070 --> 04:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
can certainly okay provide and and again
 
04:31:12.109 --> 04:31:12.119 align:start position:0%
I apologize I had expected to be in in

pond right
 
04:31:22.389 --> 04:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
now 540,000
 
04:31:25.550 --> 04:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
it's missing I thought you might be oh
 
04:31:26.750 --> 04:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
04:31:30.070 --> 04:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
yeah 54,000 oh yeah so representative
 
04:31:33.590 --> 04:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
camell points out here it's 540,000 or
 
04:31:38.830 --> 04:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
is it 500 54,000 no it's 540 right yeah
 
04:31:42.389 --> 04:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
okay oh apologize that was a late minute
 
04:31:45.309 --> 04:31:45.319 align:start position:0%
because originally I thought that this
 
04:31:48.469 --> 04:31:48.479 align:start position:0%
was in law and then I got a last minute
 
04:31:52.630 --> 04:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
note and so got and typing I left off a
 
04:31:56.950 --> 04:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:00.670 --> 04:32:00.680 align:start position:0%
I don't think that'll work too well okay
 
04:32:02.670 --> 04:32:02.680 align:start position:0%
um regulatory
 
04:32:08.309 --> 04:32:08.319 align:start position:0%
Services um what's that so that uh deals
 
04:32:08.319 --> 04:32:10.429 align:start position:0%
Services um what's that so that uh deals
with

04:32:10.429 --> 04:32:10.439 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:32:12.429 --> 04:32:12.439 align:start position:0%

177,000
 
04:32:25.269 --> 04:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
products something like that I've got it
 
04:32:25.279 --> 04:32:26.870 align:start position:0%
products something like that I've got it
here

04:32:26.870 --> 04:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:32:30.550 --> 04:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:35.550 --> 04:32:35.560 align:start position:0%
detail any animal feed product or um any
 
04:32:37.109 --> 04:32:37.119 align:start position:0%
fertilizer that's registered in the
 
04:32:38.630 --> 04:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire has to come
 
04:32:40.670 --> 04:32:40.680 align:start position:0%
through our our department our division
 
04:32:45.750 --> 04:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:47.269 --> 04:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm I'm
 
04:32:51.550 --> 04:32:51.560 align:start position:0%
but fertilizers as I say lming agents
 
04:32:54.750 --> 04:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
pet food um
 
04:32:57.630 --> 04:32:57.640 align:start position:0%
seed there's a whole lot of variety of
 
04:32:57.640 --> 04:32:58.830 align:start position:0%
seed there's a whole lot of variety of
things

04:32:58.830 --> 04:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:32:58.840 --> 04:33:00.790 align:start position:0%
things
there

04:33:00.790 --> 04:33:00.800 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:33:04.230 --> 04:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
um weights and measures fees were set 25
 
04:33:06.429 --> 04:33:06.439 align:start position:0%
years ago yeah what it's interesting
 
04:33:08.230 --> 04:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
there and I'll give you the back story
 
04:33:12.990 --> 04:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
is they used to be in statute they were
 
04:33:19.269 --> 04:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
raised in fee by 30 33% in
 
04:33:21.551 --> 04:33:21.561 align:start position:0%
20110 and the legislature didn't like
 
04:33:24.510 --> 04:33:24.520 align:start position:0%
that and put them back to the the old
 
04:33:26.349 --> 04:33:26.359 align:start position:0%
fees so that's how it's ended up
 
04:33:29.269 --> 04:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
actually their the same as they were in
 
04:33:32.070 --> 04:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
2000 so for a while they were higher
 
04:33:35.230 --> 04:33:35.240 align:start position:0%
yeah for about a year okay and you
 
04:33:38.189 --> 04:33:38.199 align:start position:0%
wanted so are you proposed to go up by a
 
04:33:40.590 --> 04:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
third or what well they're actually
 
04:33:42.910 --> 04:33:42.920 align:start position:0%
they're they're relatively small fees
 
04:33:46.510 --> 04:33:46.520 align:start position:0%
the I think the rate of inflation at
 
04:33:49.629 --> 04:33:49.639 align:start position:0%
2.75% it comes up to uh somewhere in the
 
04:33:52.789 --> 04:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
vicinity of of 80% now these are
 
04:33:58.230 --> 04:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
relatively small fees and so
 
04:34:01.349 --> 04:34:01.359 align:start position:0%
um yeah they would go up significantly
 
04:34:03.150 --> 04:34:03.160 align:start position:0%
but they would not be out of line with
 
04:34:05.230 --> 04:34:05.240 align:start position:0%
what the states around us are charging
 
04:34:07.470 --> 04:34:07.480 align:start position:0%
that was one of the things that I said I
 
04:34:09.949 --> 04:34:09.959 align:start position:0%
I direct I directed my directors to look
 
04:34:12.230 --> 04:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
at the rate of inflation and then to
 
04:34:14.869 --> 04:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
look at what were other states charging
 
04:34:17.029 --> 04:34:17.039 align:start position:0%
particularly around us and these would
 
04:34:19.830 --> 04:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
be uh right in line with what our
 
04:34:23.910 --> 04:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
surrounding states are charging gotcha
 
04:34:27.310 --> 04:34:27.320 align:start position:0%
okay excellent okay
 
04:34:30.230 --> 04:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
good um anybody want to ask a question
 
04:34:36.189 --> 04:34:36.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:36.199 --> 04:34:38.349 align:start position:0%
 
242

04:34:38.349 --> 04:34:38.359 align:start position:0%
242
 
04:34:42.189 --> 04:34:42.199 align:start position:0%
um so speaking of the general fund
 
04:34:45.230 --> 04:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
um page 242 is the bottom line of your
 
04:34:48.830 --> 04:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
budget and your use of General funds is
 
04:34:51.830 --> 04:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
going up significantly not from what we
 
04:34:54.830 --> 04:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
budgeted for fiscal year 25 but from
 
04:34:59.830 --> 04:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:59.840 --> 04:35:02.269 align:start position:0%
 
24

04:35:02.269 --> 04:35:02.279 align:start position:0%
24
 
04:35:02.279 --> 04:35:04.789 align:start position:0%
24
so

04:35:04.789 --> 04:35:04.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:35:08.789 --> 04:35:08.799 align:start position:0%
um can we budget for Less is the
 
04:35:11.109 --> 04:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
question since it's since your spending
 
04:35:14.670 --> 04:35:14.680 align:start position:0%
levels seems to be quite a bit less yeah
 
04:35:18.429 --> 04:35:18.439 align:start position:0%
um so uh for accounting for a lot of
 
04:35:20.189 --> 04:35:20.199 align:start position:0%
that would be the animal records
 
04:35:23.629 --> 04:35:23.639 align:start position:0%
database uh which from uh fiscal year 24
 
04:35:25.551 --> 04:35:25.561 align:start position:0%
was about in in the hundreds of
 
04:35:27.750 --> 04:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
thousands 120,000 I believe and it's up
 
04:35:30.750 --> 04:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
to 250,000 now and then we expanded that
 
04:35:32.510 --> 04:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
through other divisions to update all of
 
04:35:35.910 --> 04:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
our records databases and so modernizing
 
04:35:37.830 --> 04:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
that process making more efficiencies
 
04:35:40.310 --> 04:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
within the department uh just those two
 
04:35:42.590 --> 04:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
things alone are close to about 400,000
 
04:35:45.029 --> 04:35:45.039 align:start position:0%
of that increase and then when we have
 
04:35:48.150 --> 04:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh added added salaries uh and benefits
 
04:35:50.070 --> 04:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
going into that I think that makes up
 
04:35:53.429 --> 04:35:53.439 align:start position:0%
the majority of of that increase um we
 
04:35:55.830 --> 04:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
might be able to look a little further
 
04:35:57.910 --> 04:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
but I don't think that the it's going to
 
04:36:00.310 --> 04:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
be a massive savings without reducing
 
04:36:02.470 --> 04:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
the services that we can provide so so
 
04:36:05.990 --> 04:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
the amount you're paying doit is much
 
04:36:07.709 --> 04:36:07.719 align:start position:0%
higher that's they're they're in those
 
04:36:12.510 --> 04:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
are in our uh in our agent budget those
 
04:36:14.990 --> 04:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
two pieces those software things correct
 
04:36:17.670 --> 04:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
I see okay but it but it's
 
04:36:20.590 --> 04:36:20.600 align:start position:0%
software um fee I don't know what it's
 
04:36:22.949 --> 04:36:22.959 align:start position:0%
called subscription types things licing
 
04:36:26.109 --> 04:36:26.119 align:start position:0%
impementation first round got main okay
 
04:36:29.189 --> 04:36:29.199 align:start position:0%
and we have had increase in in Personnel
 
04:36:32.750 --> 04:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
in there um and obviously the just the
 
04:36:37.709 --> 04:36:37.719 align:start position:0%
10% increase um moving forward well so
 
04:36:39.629 --> 04:36:39.639 align:start position:0%
we went yes and no right because that
 
04:36:43.429 --> 04:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
was in 2024 so I think 2025 was only
 
04:36:46.029 --> 04:36:46.039 align:start position:0%
another 2% right you're correct excuse
 
04:36:48.869 --> 04:36:48.879 align:start position:0%
me but um but then there Step you know
 
04:36:51.230 --> 04:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
there's some step step we did go through
 
04:36:54.670 --> 04:36:54.680 align:start position:0%
this budget with a with a fine to comb
 
04:36:56.750 --> 04:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
um you know realizing what we're were
 
04:36:59.990 --> 04:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
facing and you know short of laying off
 
04:37:02.070 --> 04:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
people that the legislature has
 
04:37:04.709 --> 04:37:04.719 align:start position:0%
authorized which ultimately will just
 
04:37:06.830 --> 04:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
create other other problems in a very
 
04:37:10.150 --> 04:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
small agency um yeah I think we've done
 
04:37:12.029 --> 04:37:12.039 align:start position:0%
a very responsible
 
04:37:15.390 --> 04:37:15.400 align:start position:0%
uh budget uh obviously we're not pleased
 
04:37:20.150 --> 04:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
with the um funds that we had that were
 
04:37:22.830 --> 04:37:22.840 align:start position:0%
providing assistance for agricultural
 
04:37:26.990 --> 04:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
land preservation for Farmer stress U
 
04:37:30.230 --> 04:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
those were large Cuts but there's you
 
04:37:32.029 --> 04:37:32.039 align:start position:0%
know there's no increase in Personnel
 
04:37:34.070 --> 04:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
here and there's nothing that okay I
 
04:37:36.670 --> 04:37:36.680 align:start position:0%
feel we could cut further on I
 
04:37:39.349 --> 04:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
understand so on other funds you're
 
04:37:42.189 --> 04:37:42.199 align:start position:0%
you're projecting an increase
 
04:37:47.830 --> 04:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
of um $700 or more thousand what what's
 
04:37:51.230 --> 04:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:53.830 --> 04:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
that so I know with some of our federal
 
04:37:55.830 --> 04:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
funds there are years that are and I'm
 
04:37:58.750 --> 04:37:58.760 align:start position:0%
not sure if this is what not federal so
 
04:38:00.910 --> 04:38:00.920 align:start position:0%
Federal looks like okay EXC Federal
 
04:38:03.590 --> 04:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
looks like it's up a little but not much
 
04:38:05.629 --> 04:38:05.639 align:start position:0%
right but I'm I'm asking about other F
 
04:38:05.639 --> 04:38:07.709 align:start position:0%
right but I'm I'm asking about other F
oh

04:38:07.709 --> 04:38:07.719 align:start position:0%
oh
 
04:38:11.789 --> 04:38:11.799 align:start position:0%
yeah Shel do you
 
04:38:13.349 --> 04:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
no but those are all new none of those
 
04:38:18.310 --> 04:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:22.629 --> 04:38:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:33.551 --> 04:38:33.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:36.551 --> 04:38:36.561 align:start position:0%
ahead oh was was part of that the change
 
04:38:39.310 --> 04:38:39.320 align:start position:0%
on the um what used to be the
 
04:38:42.349 --> 04:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
product think so yeah so there was a
 
04:38:45.990 --> 04:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
change um in a bill last year which
 
04:38:48.709 --> 04:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
changed the percentage that that um of
 
04:38:48.719 --> 04:38:49.709 align:start position:0%
changed the percentage that that um of
other

04:38:49.709 --> 04:38:49.719 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:38:52.189 --> 04:38:52.199 align:start position:0%
funds so that more money was going to
 
04:38:55.349 --> 04:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
the general fund from one category and
 
04:38:57.189 --> 04:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
then that was moved into there and as a
 
04:39:01.470 --> 04:39:01.480 align:start position:0%
result we cut cut general fund um
 
04:39:03.269 --> 04:39:03.279 align:start position:0%
request for personnel so that we're
 
04:39:05.390 --> 04:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
trying to within the
 
04:39:07.709 --> 04:39:07.719 align:start position:0%
regulatory fund whatever that's called
 
04:39:10.830 --> 04:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
and uh in pesticides more Personnel are
 
04:39:12.510 --> 04:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
being funded from there but that has
 
04:39:16.390 --> 04:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
brought in more to others simply because
 
04:39:21.590 --> 04:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
of the fact that um more staying
 
04:39:25.470 --> 04:39:25.480 align:start position:0%
there essentially we we shifted some uh
 
04:39:28.189 --> 04:39:28.199 align:start position:0%
funding to from those uh dedicated funds
 
04:39:30.709 --> 04:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
so it looks like there's more spending
 
04:39:33.590 --> 04:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
coming out of the dedicated funds uh
 
04:39:35.029 --> 04:39:35.039 align:start position:0%
rather than have it come out of General
 
04:39:36.949 --> 04:39:36.959 align:start position:0%
funds so are you saying the balances and
 
04:39:39.470 --> 04:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
the dedicated funds were growing faster
 
04:39:43.550 --> 04:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
than were growing so Revenue was more
 
04:39:45.550 --> 04:39:45.560 align:start position:0%
than you were expending and so therefore
 
04:39:48.550 --> 04:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
you adjusted spending up correct okay I
 
04:39:51.550 --> 04:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
understand okay good so let's go back to
 
04:39:56.750 --> 04:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:00.310 --> 04:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
guess let's see what are we looking for
 
04:40:03.390 --> 04:40:03.400 align:start position:0%
time what we 207 yeah we don't have much
 
04:40:06.110 --> 04:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
time so
 
04:40:06.120 --> 04:40:08.708 align:start position:0%
time so
um

04:40:08.708 --> 04:40:08.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:12.708 --> 04:40:12.718 align:start position:0%
maybe yeah let's go to page um
 
04:40:14.788 --> 04:40:14.798 align:start position:0%
I'm looking for place where there's big
 
04:40:21.868 --> 04:40:21.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:25.230 --> 04:40:25.240 align:start position:0%
210 oh this is your database right so
 
04:40:27.628 --> 04:40:27.638 align:start position:0%
this is your
 
04:40:31.590 --> 04:40:31.600 align:start position:0%
software okay so you bought a new a new
 
04:40:34.190 --> 04:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
computer the big one
 
04:40:49.830 --> 04:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:54.190 --> 04:40:54.200 align:start position:0%
yeah so um more temps or so animal
 
04:40:54.200 --> 04:40:55.670 align:start position:0%
yeah so um more temps or so animal
population

04:40:55.670 --> 04:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
population
 
04:40:58.550 --> 04:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
control is
 
04:41:00.910 --> 04:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
that well I don't know it's Personnel
 
04:41:04.510 --> 04:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
Services non-benefit what is
 
04:41:08.030 --> 04:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
that are those temp part- timers or
 
04:41:14.510 --> 04:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:18.628 --> 04:41:18.638 align:start position:0%
so that was a part that was a parttime
 
04:41:18.638 --> 04:41:21.030 align:start position:0%
so that was a part that was a parttime
position

04:41:21.030 --> 04:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
position
 
04:41:25.510 --> 04:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
um no I'm asking about class 45 oh
 
04:41:27.948 --> 04:41:27.958 align:start position:0%
45 person
 
04:41:31.070 --> 04:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
services but that doesn't make any sense
 
04:41:34.190 --> 04:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
why we double we haven't doubled
 
04:41:37.270 --> 04:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
this I think that's one of our dedicated
 
04:41:40.310 --> 04:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
funds they're trying to out uh what she
 
04:41:42.230 --> 04:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
said was it it's one of the dedicated
 
04:41:43.910 --> 04:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
funds that again we're trying to spend
 
04:41:45.270 --> 04:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
down but that wouldn't have come out of
 
04:41:54.910 --> 04:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:57.190 --> 04:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
yeah Personnel
 
04:42:01.430 --> 04:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
Services oh yes correct there there's um
 
04:42:02.670 --> 04:42:02.680 align:start position:0%
that is
 
04:42:07.990 --> 04:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:10.868 --> 04:42:10.878 align:start position:0%
fund but what is where's it going to
 
04:42:12.550 --> 04:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
that's the question oh I think that was
 
04:42:14.430 --> 04:42:14.440 align:start position:0%
a case again where we were
 
04:42:14.440 --> 04:42:16.030 align:start position:0%
a case again where we were
shifting

04:42:16.030 --> 04:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
shifting
 
04:42:19.670 --> 04:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
um where the employees salaries will
 
04:42:24.350 --> 04:42:24.360 align:start position:0%
come in from and this this position um
 
04:42:27.230 --> 04:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
essentially Works to a point and when
 
04:42:29.590 --> 04:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
the budget for that salary Personnel
 
04:42:32.030 --> 04:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
runs out the services stop for the Year
 
04:42:34.470 --> 04:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
this person uh supports uh helping
 
04:42:36.590 --> 04:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
low-income folks uh with the getting
 
04:42:38.868 --> 04:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
spay and neuters of their animals to
 
04:42:41.590 --> 04:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
reduce animal population and uh this
 
04:42:44.070 --> 04:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
would allow us to continue out for the
 
04:42:47.788 --> 04:42:47.798 align:start position:0%
full year it's sort of um giving some
 
04:42:50.788 --> 04:42:50.798 align:start position:0%
leeway so that the position can provide
 
04:42:52.990 --> 04:42:53.000 align:start position:0%
the services for longer during the year
 
04:42:55.230 --> 04:42:55.240 align:start position:0%
this is where we actually increased to
 
04:42:57.830 --> 04:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
100% so what was happening
 
04:43:01.230 --> 04:43:01.240 align:start position:0%
excuse so we were paying veterinarians
 
04:43:01.240 --> 04:43:02.030 align:start position:0%
excuse so we were paying veterinarians
about

04:43:02.030 --> 04:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:43:05.310 --> 04:43:05.320 align:start position:0%
80% of what it actually cost them to do
 
04:43:07.628 --> 04:43:07.638 align:start position:0%
the spay and neuter we were
 
04:43:11.948 --> 04:43:11.958 align:start position:0%
seeing um that number drop off dramatic
 
04:43:15.030 --> 04:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
atically and so we were afraid we were
 
04:43:17.550 --> 04:43:17.560 align:start position:0%
going to have a program with no
 
04:43:19.470 --> 04:43:19.480 align:start position:0%
veterinarians to provide it so we upped
 
04:43:22.670 --> 04:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
it to 100% um that was growing and I
 
04:43:25.390 --> 04:43:25.400 align:start position:0%
think this is uh largely an estimate but
 
04:43:27.230 --> 04:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
it's coming from a dedicated fund so it
 
04:43:29.150 --> 04:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any any difference I think
 
04:43:32.390 --> 04:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
it's the large increases due to the hope
 
04:43:33.990 --> 04:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
and that we will have the money there to
 
04:43:36.788 --> 04:43:36.798 align:start position:0%
be able to actually provide the services
 
04:43:39.430 --> 04:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
I see so you you don't think the 500,000
 
04:43:41.868 --> 04:43:41.878 align:start position:0%
is likely to be spent right no and
 
04:43:43.910 --> 04:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
because it's a dedicated fund it doesn't
 
04:43:47.550 --> 04:43:47.560 align:start position:0%
really matter you're saying yeah yeah
 
04:43:50.230 --> 04:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
okay all
 
04:43:50.240 --> 04:43:51.830 align:start position:0%
okay all
right

04:43:51.830 --> 04:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:43:55.310 --> 04:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
well so it does in the sense that if you
 
04:43:57.150 --> 04:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
could use this dedicated fund for
 
04:43:59.190 --> 04:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
something else in the budget that is now
 
04:44:01.190 --> 04:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
generally funded then I could have some
 
04:44:03.990 --> 04:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
more General funds for you know that is
 
04:44:06.470 --> 04:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
where this is funded through the dog
 
04:44:08.270 --> 04:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
licensing right right and there's a
 
04:44:11.510 --> 04:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
dedicated um amount that goes there so
 
04:44:14.470 --> 04:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
if you want to steal money from the dog
 
04:44:16.830 --> 04:44:16.840 align:start position:0%
dog owners who are already not happy
 
04:44:18.750 --> 04:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
about the fact that we are putting some
 
04:44:24.110 --> 04:44:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:27.150 --> 04:44:27.160 align:start position:0%
right I guess so yeah that's that is
 
04:44:28.868 --> 04:44:28.878 align:start position:0%
always the well but I mean if there's
 
04:44:30.590 --> 04:44:30.600 align:start position:0%
anything else you were doing with dog
 
04:44:33.788 --> 04:44:33.798 align:start position:0%
licensing that was not that was
 
04:44:35.910 --> 04:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
generally funded but you know yeah no we
 
04:44:40.190 --> 04:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
are not okay well or you know some part
 
04:44:42.550 --> 04:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
of your time goes to J goes to dog
 
04:44:45.910 --> 04:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
licensing right so I have nothing to do
 
04:44:49.750 --> 04:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
with that at all well totally a cat me
 
04:44:53.190 --> 04:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
yeah no but I meant you know yeah no
 
04:44:55.510 --> 04:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
because that's really really is there
 
04:44:58.070 --> 04:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
the one person with an authorization for
 
04:45:00.310 --> 04:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
10 hours a week when she's on
 
04:45:04.110 --> 04:45:04.120 align:start position:0%
vacation um that stays totally internal
 
04:45:07.910 --> 04:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
and got she deals with it all and uh Dr
 
04:45:11.190 --> 04:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
Crawford does sign off on whether was
 
04:45:13.510 --> 04:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable or not but that's about it
 
04:45:14.628 --> 04:45:14.638 align:start position:0%
which is much easier now that we're
 
04:45:17.628 --> 04:45:17.638 align:start position:0%
paying 100% not having to do the
 
04:45:21.150 --> 04:45:21.160 align:start position:0%
math okay all
 
04:45:25.970 --> 04:45:25.980 align:start position:0%
right well I think let me ask about
 
04:45:25.980 --> 04:45:35.310 align:start position:0%
right well I think let me ask about
[Music]

04:45:35.310 --> 04:45:35.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:45.670 --> 04:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:48.510 --> 04:45:48.520 align:start position:0%
oh so uh invasive species you're you're
 
04:45:52.430 --> 04:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:56.628 --> 04:45:56.638 align:start position:0%
here new this year new this bium or they
 
04:45:58.510 --> 04:45:58.520 align:start position:0%
moved from somewhere else yeah we well I
 
04:46:01.750 --> 04:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
think we had was it 100 or
 
04:46:04.270 --> 04:46:04.280 align:start position:0%
150,000 as part of that grant program
 
04:46:07.150 --> 04:46:07.160 align:start position:0%
for towns to apply for the invasive
 
04:46:11.190 --> 04:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
species we re we reimburse towns
 
04:46:16.430 --> 04:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:22.868 --> 04:46:22.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:25.750 --> 04:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah that's like Japanese not weed
 
04:46:28.708 --> 04:46:28.718 align:start position:0%
and japanes which
 
04:46:28.718 --> 04:46:30.830 align:start position:0%
and japanes which
is

04:46:30.830 --> 04:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:46:30.840 --> 04:46:32.470 align:start position:0%
is
horrifying

04:46:32.470 --> 04:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
horrifying
 
04:46:35.708 --> 04:46:35.718 align:start position:0%
yeah I can never remember that Buri I
 
04:46:36.788 --> 04:46:36.798 align:start position:0%
don't but it's something that wasn't
 
04:46:40.030 --> 04:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
being done before that is correct better
 
04:46:42.270 --> 04:46:42.280 align:start position:0%
sweep I don't know I can I can never
 
04:46:42.280 --> 04:46:43.590 align:start position:0%
sweep I don't know I can I can never
remember

04:46:43.590 --> 04:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
remember
 
04:46:46.390 --> 04:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
Bittersweet yeah tree tree of Heaven is
 
04:46:46.400 --> 04:46:47.670 align:start position:0%
Bittersweet yeah tree tree of Heaven is
another

04:46:47.670 --> 04:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
another
 
04:46:50.750 --> 04:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
one such a problem I just have this
 
04:46:52.548 --> 04:46:52.558 align:start position:0%
block I think we talked about that the
 
04:46:55.390 --> 04:46:55.400 align:start position:0%
last time so this is this is there that
 
04:46:58.350 --> 04:46:58.360 align:start position:0%
was a newly funded position uh a while
 
04:47:00.510 --> 04:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
ago so we do have one more person in
 
04:47:03.070 --> 04:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
that division than we than we had the
 
04:47:03.080 --> 04:47:04.310 align:start position:0%
that division than we than we had the
previous

04:47:04.310 --> 04:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
previous
 
04:47:07.390 --> 04:47:07.400 align:start position:0%
banian um we seen much bird
 
04:47:11.788 --> 04:47:11.798 align:start position:0%
flu we have not seen much bird flu um
 
04:47:14.190 --> 04:47:14.200 align:start position:0%
we have only seen it really in people
 
04:47:16.470 --> 04:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
that are like sanctuaries or rescues and
 
04:47:20.350 --> 04:47:20.360 align:start position:0%
they might have a pond and then a wild
 
04:47:23.150 --> 04:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
goose flies in and then it it's and it
 
04:47:26.708 --> 04:47:26.718 align:start position:0%
it is serious in that um because of the
 
04:47:28.990 --> 04:47:29.000 align:start position:0%
quarantine zones uh hubard Farms which
 
04:47:32.070 --> 04:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
is a international breeder of poultry
 
04:47:33.430 --> 04:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
they can get up to
 
04:47:36.990 --> 04:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
$150 per chick now for their specialty
 
04:47:40.830 --> 04:47:40.840 align:start position:0%
Birds uh yeah it actually cost them sign
 
04:47:42.470 --> 04:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
significant and I'm talking a couple
 
04:47:44.310 --> 04:47:44.320 align:start position:0%
million dollars of sales because this
 
04:47:46.510 --> 04:47:46.520 align:start position:0%
one little Sanctuary was in their
 
04:47:49.110 --> 04:47:49.120 align:start position:0%
quarantine Zone and Japan would not take
 
04:47:51.750 --> 04:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
the uh anything in from from New
 
04:47:51.760 --> 04:47:53.270 align:start position:0%
the uh anything in from from New
Hampshire

04:47:53.270 --> 04:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:47:59.590 --> 04:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:59.600 --> 04:48:02.548 align:start position:0%
 
but

04:48:02.548 --> 04:48:02.558 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:48:07.548 --> 04:48:07.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:09.788 --> 04:48:09.798 align:start position:0%
neighbors what's the division of
 
04:48:12.190 --> 04:48:12.200 align:start position:0%
regulatory Serv
 
04:48:14.910 --> 04:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
services that is the uh division that
 
04:48:17.948 --> 04:48:17.958 align:start position:0%
deals with
 
04:48:22.548 --> 04:48:22.558 align:start position:0%
um the U generally what is it Gap um
 
04:48:24.270 --> 04:48:24.280 align:start position:0%
they deal with the seed registration
 
04:48:27.510 --> 04:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
which was a a big problem last year once
 
04:48:30.910 --> 04:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
we divested ourselves of doing um
 
04:48:33.590 --> 04:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
organic inspections we found out that
 
04:48:34.990 --> 04:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire had become a Dumping
 
04:48:37.310 --> 04:48:37.320 align:start position:0%
Ground for expired seeds such as grass
 
04:48:39.190 --> 04:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
seeds so you bought your grass seed and
 
04:48:40.430 --> 04:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
it didn't Sprout you thought it was
 
04:48:42.270 --> 04:48:42.280 align:start position:0%
because you didn't water it enough or
 
04:48:44.750 --> 04:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
you watered it too much or whatever it's
 
04:48:46.590 --> 04:48:46.600 align:start position:0%
probably because it had
 
04:48:51.270 --> 04:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
expired um we collected over uh $100,000
 
04:48:54.030 --> 04:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
in fines in that area we had issued
 
04:48:55.788 --> 04:48:55.798 align:start position:0%
about a quarter million dollars in fin
 
04:48:58.230 --> 04:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
just trying to get some attention but it
 
04:48:59.830 --> 04:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
was still significant that we actually
 
04:49:02.230 --> 04:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
did collect because they were just
 
04:49:04.510 --> 04:49:04.520 align:start position:0%
moving the stuff all over the place can
 
04:49:06.830 --> 04:49:06.840 align:start position:0%
I send my water bill to you to get
 
04:49:06.840 --> 04:49:09.270 align:start position:0%
I send my water bill to you to get
reimbursed

04:49:09.270 --> 04:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
reimbursed
 
04:49:11.670 --> 04:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
no but it's something where you hadn't
 
04:49:14.230 --> 04:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
been spending much at all right and it's
 
04:49:16.510 --> 04:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
it's really growing page
 
04:49:20.230 --> 04:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
217 two that should have that should be
 
04:49:21.670 --> 04:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
less from the general fund because we'
 
04:49:24.470 --> 04:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
shifted so much no not well some more
 
04:49:26.910 --> 04:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
from the general fund but also from
 
04:49:33.470 --> 04:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:35.990 --> 04:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
217 but in in
 
04:49:39.390 --> 04:49:39.400 align:start position:0%
2024 it was only a $166,000 thing and
 
04:49:53.070 --> 04:49:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:54.948 --> 04:49:54.958 align:start position:0%
something looking
 
04:49:54.958 --> 04:49:56.548 align:start position:0%
something looking
at

04:49:56.548 --> 04:49:56.558 align:start position:0%
at
 
04:49:56.558 --> 04:50:04.788 align:start position:0%
at
regulatory

04:50:04.788 --> 04:50:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:07.510 --> 04:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
04:50:10.868 --> 04:50:10.878 align:start position:0%
yeah so is those matching that's because
 
04:50:13.470 --> 04:50:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:17.830 --> 04:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:22.510 --> 04:50:22.520 align:start position:0%
the oh is this oh this is fsma isn't it
 
04:50:25.390 --> 04:50:25.400 align:start position:0%
no that's not fsma no
 
04:50:28.190 --> 04:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
okay we have been drawing down
 
04:50:29.750 --> 04:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
accounting unit
 
04:50:32.948 --> 04:50:32.958 align:start position:0%
2605 which is one of our dedicated fund
 
04:50:36.708 --> 04:50:36.718 align:start position:0%
accounts and by the end of this
 
04:50:41.110 --> 04:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
bium that account is not going to be
 
04:50:43.548 --> 04:50:43.558 align:start position:0%
sustainable the way we're drawing
 
04:50:46.470 --> 04:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
funds down
 
04:50:52.190 --> 04:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
so a lot of that cost was in previous bu
 
04:50:55.150 --> 04:50:55.160 align:start position:0%
and then we absorbed it into 2605 which
 
04:50:57.350 --> 04:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
is the product was called the product
 
04:51:00.110 --> 04:51:00.120 align:start position:0%
scale testing fund now it's
 
04:51:03.110 --> 04:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
Agricultural Product regulatory
 
04:51:07.030 --> 04:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
fund so we're trying to shift that some
 
04:51:09.390 --> 04:51:09.400 align:start position:0%
of that fund there there are no new
 
04:51:12.590 --> 04:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
positions in the well obviously yeah and
 
04:51:15.070 --> 04:51:15.080 align:start position:0%
which those positions used to be in that
 
04:51:17.788 --> 04:51:17.798 align:start position:0%
accounting unit but now are in
 
04:51:21.070 --> 04:51:21.080 align:start position:0%
that all right all right so we will
 
04:51:24.590 --> 04:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
consider your um your fee fee
 
04:51:26.708 --> 04:51:26.718 align:start position:0%
suggestions we like those I think all
 
04:51:29.390 --> 04:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
right would would you like me to uh who
 
04:51:30.788 --> 04:51:30.798 align:start position:0%
would you like me to send chapter and
 
04:51:33.708 --> 04:51:33.718 align:start position:0%
verse to yeah uh you can do that to Jack
 
04:51:38.590 --> 04:51:38.600 align:start position:0%
and he'll get it to us yeah and um I
 
04:51:40.590 --> 04:51:40.600 align:start position:0%
don't know if you have any house built
 
04:51:48.110 --> 04:51:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:51.590 --> 04:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
you nothing oh okay well this this would
 
04:51:54.548 --> 04:51:54.558 align:start position:0%
be all this fee stuff will will become
 
04:51:57.190 --> 04:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
too right okay so we may or may not ask
 
04:52:00.150 --> 04:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
you back but thank you very
 
04:52:03.548 --> 04:52:03.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:06.868 --> 04:52:06.878 align:start position:0%
right yes
 
04:52:16.310 --> 04:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:18.670 --> 04:52:18.680 align:start position:0%
okay all right so we've saved the best
 
04:52:18.680 --> 04:52:22.670 align:start position:0%
okay all right so we've saved the best
for

04:52:22.670 --> 04:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:22.680 --> 04:52:24.548 align:start position:0%
 
last

04:52:24.548 --> 04:52:24.558 align:start position:0%
last
 
04:52:29.310 --> 04:52:29.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:31.708 --> 04:52:31.718 align:start position:0%
fortunately I
 
04:52:34.868 --> 04:52:34.878 align:start position:0%
know they
 
04:52:39.948 --> 04:52:39.958 align:start position:0%
hiding yeah because these guys have in
 
04:52:41.270 --> 04:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
house build
 
04:52:45.310 --> 04:52:45.320 align:start position:0%
one 131
 
04:52:45.320 --> 04:52:48.750 align:start position:0%
one 131
[Laughter]

04:52:48.750 --> 04:52:48.760 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:52:48.760 --> 04:52:50.590 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
Pages

04:52:50.590 --> 04:52:50.600 align:start position:0%
Pages
 
04:52:53.590 --> 04:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so we are not going to go Page by
 
04:52:55.750 --> 04:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
page I don't think maybe that's why they
 
04:52:59.628 --> 04:52:59.638 align:start position:0%
have so many page but um let's go to
 
04:53:12.510 --> 04:53:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:14.628 --> 04:53:14.638 align:start position:0%
oh and welcome
 
04:53:16.548 --> 04:53:16.558 align:start position:0%
commissioner thank you we have a hand
 
04:53:18.390 --> 04:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
out too
 
04:53:21.830 --> 04:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
good please is a committee yes
 
04:53:24.470 --> 04:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
please all right so let's look at this
 
04:53:24.480 --> 04:53:31.310 align:start position:0%
please all right so let's look at this
page

04:53:31.310 --> 04:53:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:31.320 --> 04:53:35.708 align:start position:0%
 
here

04:53:35.708 --> 04:53:35.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:38.270 --> 04:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
okay so I'll just tell you one of the
 
04:53:44.230 --> 04:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
things we're we do is as we look at um
 
04:53:44.240 --> 04:53:45.750 align:start position:0%
things we're we do is as we look at um
spending

04:53:45.750 --> 04:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
spending
 
04:53:51.150 --> 04:53:51.160 align:start position:0%
on uh 20 2019 versus
 
04:53:55.270 --> 04:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
2025 right to see what's the progress in
 
04:53:58.750 --> 04:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
spending and you have one of the more
 
04:53:58.760 --> 04:54:00.230 align:start position:0%
spending and you have one of the more
unusual

04:54:00.230 --> 04:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
unusual
 
04:54:04.628 --> 04:54:04.638 align:start position:0%
lines in that over those six years your
 
04:54:08.590 --> 04:54:08.600 align:start position:0%
general fund spending went down
 
04:54:11.230 --> 04:54:11.240 align:start position:0%
3% but your total
 
04:54:15.548 --> 04:54:15.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:18.510 --> 04:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
68% so I don't know what you're if you
 
04:54:19.830 --> 04:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
if I don't know if that's doing
 
04:54:21.910 --> 04:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
something right or wrong I I don't know
 
04:54:25.548 --> 04:54:25.558 align:start position:0%
but it's it's very unusual me you like
 
04:54:28.270 --> 04:54:28.280 align:start position:0%
it so if it pleases the chair I can I
 
04:54:30.150 --> 04:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
can uh I can address that up up front a
 
04:54:31.868 --> 04:54:31.878 align:start position:0%
little at least some of that so
 
04:54:34.190 --> 04:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
obviously from 2019 to now A lot's
 
04:54:34.200 --> 04:54:35.628 align:start position:0%
obviously from 2019 to now A lot's
happened

04:54:35.628 --> 04:54:35.638 align:start position:0%
happened
 
04:54:38.590 --> 04:54:38.600 align:start position:0%
and uh we received significant amounts
 
04:54:41.190 --> 04:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
of arpa money for water and waste water
 
04:54:43.750 --> 04:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure uh the infrastructure
 
04:54:46.868 --> 04:54:46.878 align:start position:0%
Bill uh was over a 5year period which is
 
04:54:49.510 --> 04:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
still continuing added uh almost a half
 
04:54:51.270 --> 04:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
a billion dollars in water and
 
04:54:54.390 --> 04:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
wastewater struct uh infrastructure so I
 
04:54:57.470 --> 04:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
I'll let in a moment once I'm done given
 
04:54:59.430 --> 04:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
the the broad brush uh Susan Carlson I'm
 
04:55:02.510 --> 04:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
sure can elaborate but uh that's a big
 
04:55:04.830 --> 04:55:04.840 align:start position:0%
chunk of that increase right so and
 
04:55:07.868 --> 04:55:07.878 align:start position:0%
that's a sign of post postco a lot of
 
04:55:09.948 --> 04:55:09.958 align:start position:0%
money was injected into infrastructure
 
04:55:11.510 --> 04:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
04:55:13.948 --> 04:55:13.958 align:start position:0%
obviously we have roughly 200 programs
 
04:55:15.470 --> 04:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
or so so there's a lot of moving Parts
 
04:55:16.788 --> 04:55:16.798 align:start position:0%
within there but those are the big
 
04:55:18.990 --> 04:55:19.000 align:start position:0%
ticket items that are probably driving
 
04:55:23.510 --> 04:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
that if that makes sense so so okay um
 
04:55:24.830 --> 04:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
okay yeah go ahead with the why don't
 
04:55:27.150 --> 04:55:27.160 align:start position:0%
you do the presentation yeah so if I may
 
04:55:29.430 --> 04:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
before briefly I'm GNA yeah I'll be
 
04:55:30.990 --> 04:55:31.000 align:start position:0%
really brief and then I'll I'll hand
 
04:55:33.070 --> 04:55:33.080 align:start position:0%
over for the presentation for uh our
 
04:55:35.788 --> 04:55:35.798 align:start position:0%
chief operating officer Susan Carlson
 
04:55:39.030 --> 04:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
again I'm Bob Scott uh happy to be back
 
04:55:41.150 --> 04:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
again um
 
04:55:43.430 --> 04:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
some items I want to note so obviously
 
04:55:44.548 --> 04:55:44.558 align:start position:0%
now we're talking about the the
 
04:55:46.110 --> 04:55:46.120 align:start position:0%
governor's budget last time we were here
 
04:55:48.910 --> 04:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
we weren't able to talk freely about
 
04:55:53.948 --> 04:55:53.958 align:start position:0%
that uh I will I will say context before
 
04:55:55.868 --> 04:55:55.878 align:start position:0%
two items in the governor's budget one
 
04:55:58.190 --> 04:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
which was the governor Governor's uh
 
04:56:00.510 --> 04:56:00.520 align:start position:0%
initiative to on permit consolidation
 
04:56:02.350 --> 04:56:02.360 align:start position:0%
which is in house bill one and two and I
 
04:56:04.510 --> 04:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
know we'll be back next Friday to
 
04:56:07.030 --> 04:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
discuss that I assume in more detail yes
 
04:56:10.628 --> 04:56:10.638 align:start position:0%
and the addition of some uh funds in Dam
 
04:56:13.310 --> 04:56:13.320 align:start position:0%
safety program in Le of a larger fee
 
04:56:16.708 --> 04:56:16.718 align:start position:0%
increase uh before that we had roughly
 
04:56:20.510 --> 04:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
uh an 11% reduction uh in general funds
 
04:56:23.150 --> 04:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
after those two items were were entered
 
04:56:26.030 --> 04:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
in we're we're now at roughly a 7%
 
04:56:28.990 --> 04:56:29.000 align:start position:0%
reduction um I also want to note and I
 
04:56:30.430 --> 04:56:30.440 align:start position:0%
think we did this in our last
 
04:56:33.510 --> 04:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
presentation of the roughly uh B
 
04:56:38.070 --> 04:56:38.080 align:start position:0%
basically half almost of the 7% we have
 
04:56:40.750 --> 04:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
remaining in general funds is the state
 
04:56:43.788 --> 04:56:43.798 align:start position:0%
aid grant program uh there's a slide on
 
04:56:46.470 --> 04:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
that that that Sue Carlson and and uh we
 
04:56:49.190 --> 04:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
we can go through and again that's I do
 
04:56:52.310 --> 04:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
want to note that uh that
 
04:56:55.510 --> 04:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
program with the existing Wastewater
 
04:56:57.470 --> 04:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
projects that have already been entered
 
04:56:59.390 --> 04:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
into that program and again this is a
 
04:57:02.948 --> 04:57:02.958 align:start position:0%
Debt Service payment over 20 or so years
 
04:57:06.150 --> 04:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh without adding any additional waste R
 
04:57:08.990 --> 04:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
treatment plants and if we were to pay
 
04:57:11.390 --> 04:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
all that debt services to that's $140
 
04:57:13.470 --> 04:57:13.480 align:start position:0%
million so I just want to people to have
 
04:57:16.708 --> 04:57:16.718 align:start position:0%
some context of that program and where
 
04:57:18.430 --> 04:57:18.440 align:start position:0%
where that goes and that's assuming
 
04:57:20.590 --> 04:57:20.600 align:start position:0%
funds availability of course so explain
 
04:57:23.150 --> 04:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
that I'm not sure I understand so this
 
04:57:24.910 --> 04:57:24.920 align:start position:0%
again there's a slide on this so you
 
04:57:27.350 --> 04:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
know which page we want to go right
 
04:57:29.190 --> 04:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
there okay
 
04:57:33.910 --> 04:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
yeah should be page is it 10 um it's
 
04:57:41.150 --> 04:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:46.390 --> 04:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
sure whatever the chair desires yeah um
 
04:57:47.750 --> 04:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
just so you understand what the
 
04:57:50.230 --> 04:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner just said um state aid
 
04:57:53.830 --> 04:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
grant programs for Wastewater um when we
 
04:57:57.830 --> 04:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
make an award we then pay our 20% on
 
04:57:59.990 --> 04:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
their Debt Service most communities have
 
04:58:03.030 --> 04:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
a 20-year Debt Service schedule right
 
04:58:06.110 --> 04:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
now on our existing grants that we have
 
04:58:08.510 --> 04:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
made we have Debt Service payments going
 
04:58:11.070 --> 04:58:11.080 align:start position:0%
out to 2052
 
04:58:14.430 --> 04:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
and those going out to 2052 total up to
 
04:58:17.868 --> 04:58:17.878 align:start position:0%
slightly less than $140 million it's not
 
04:58:20.110 --> 04:58:20.120 align:start position:0%
that we're making $140 million in
 
04:58:23.310 --> 04:58:23.320 align:start position:0%
payments this year it's just over over
 
04:58:27.510 --> 04:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
the next 30 year uh 20 plus 30 20 plus
 
04:58:30.110 --> 04:58:30.120 align:start position:0%
years we we've already calculated
 
04:58:32.590 --> 04:58:32.600 align:start position:0%
there's that liability sitting there
 
04:58:35.548 --> 04:58:35.558 align:start position:0%
okay but but the annual is one of these
 
04:58:37.190 --> 04:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
num one of these six million type
 
04:58:39.708 --> 04:58:39.718 align:start position:0%
numbers or yeah uh let me let me go
 
04:58:42.990 --> 04:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
through okay sure um the state aid grant
 
04:58:47.670 --> 04:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
program is a general fund program um and
 
04:58:51.390 --> 04:58:51.400 align:start position:0%
the waste water is the largest active um
 
04:58:53.510 --> 04:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
program of state aid grants we have a
 
04:58:56.070 --> 04:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
small landfill closure state aid grant
 
04:58:57.910 --> 04:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
program we have a small public water
 
04:59:00.110 --> 04:59:00.120 align:start position:0%
interconnection program both of those
 
04:59:02.470 --> 04:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
programs we consider to be closed we're
 
04:59:05.230 --> 04:59:05.240 align:start position:0%
not making any new Awards um like
 
04:59:06.990 --> 04:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
landfills there's less than 10 years
 
04:59:09.430 --> 04:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
left in payments and on the public water
 
04:59:11.750 --> 04:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
systems there's maybe 15 years left of
 
04:59:14.110 --> 04:59:14.120 align:start position:0%
payments and they're small dollars
 
04:59:17.230 --> 04:59:17.240 align:start position:0%
Wastewater is an active grant
 
04:59:20.948 --> 04:59:20.958 align:start position:0%
program um and as you know under arpa
 
04:59:24.030 --> 04:59:24.040 align:start position:0%
and now under Bill communities are
 
04:59:26.190 --> 04:59:26.200 align:start position:0%
receiving millions of dollars in federal
 
04:59:29.150 --> 04:59:29.160 align:start position:0%
aid to do major Wastewater
 
04:59:32.110 --> 04:59:32.120 align:start position:0%
projects now those Grant monies are not
 
04:59:32.120 --> 04:59:33.270 align:start position:0%
projects now those Grant monies are not
funding

04:59:33.270 --> 04:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
funding
 
04:59:36.390 --> 04:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
100% of that project they're funding a
 
04:59:39.430 --> 04:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
proportional so towns are taking on debt
 
04:59:41.150 --> 04:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
to make those those
 
04:59:45.750 --> 04:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
improvements and as those projects
 
04:59:50.030 --> 04:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
finish um we participate under statute
 
04:59:52.150 --> 04:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
on 20% of The Debt Service that they
 
04:59:54.548 --> 04:59:54.558 align:start position:0%
have once the project is
 
04:59:57.030 --> 04:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
complete so if the city of Manchester
 
04:59:59.830 --> 04:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
has a $12 million project they get $6
 
05:00:02.390 --> 05:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
million in funding from federal grants
 
05:00:04.708 --> 05:00:04.718 align:start position:0%
or other sources then they have a bond
 
05:00:08.110 --> 05:00:08.120 align:start position:0%
of $6 million we contribute 20% on that
 
05:00:11.110 --> 05:00:11.120 align:start position:0%
remaining $6 million of bond
 
05:00:13.948 --> 05:00:13.958 align:start position:0%
up until recently the state aid grant
 
05:00:16.910 --> 05:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
program in the budget has been in a
 
05:00:18.548 --> 05:00:18.558 align:start position:0%
county unit
 
05:00:22.628 --> 05:00:22.638 align:start position:0%
a,3 and it is had received an
 
05:00:25.470 --> 05:00:25.480 align:start position:0%
appropriation in the operating budget
 
05:00:30.030 --> 05:00:30.040 align:start position:0%
over the last few years or last few
 
05:00:33.670 --> 05:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
bium funding has in the budget has been
 
05:00:37.628 --> 05:00:37.638 align:start position:0%
erratic a lot of the funding is now in
 
05:00:41.030 --> 05:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
hb2 or in some cases is coming in a
 
05:00:41.040 --> 05:00:42.430 align:start position:0%
hb2 or in some cases is coming in a
separate

05:00:42.430 --> 05:00:42.440 align:start position:0%
separate
 
05:00:45.310 --> 05:00:45.320 align:start position:0%
bill currently I think we have such a
 
05:00:48.230 --> 05:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
bill yes yes you
 
05:00:53.190 --> 05:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
do um currently um we have funding in
 
05:00:55.670 --> 05:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
that accounting unit coming from two
 
05:00:59.270 --> 05:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
sources one is House Bill
 
05:01:02.948 --> 05:01:02.958 align:start position:0%
395 which was passed in the 22 session
 
05:01:06.030 --> 05:01:06.040 align:start position:0%
which provided us funding in FY 23 and
 
05:01:06.040 --> 05:01:07.750 align:start position:0%
which provided us funding in FY 23 and
FY

05:01:07.750 --> 05:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
FY
 
05:01:13.310 --> 05:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
24 then in HB 2 from the 23 session we
 
05:01:17.430 --> 05:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
received a lump sum of $27.9 million but
 
05:01:21.948 --> 05:01:21.958 align:start position:0%
it was appropriated to us as a 23
 
05:01:25.990 --> 05:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
appropriation not as a 24 appropriation
 
05:01:30.628 --> 05:01:30.638 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't show up in our 24 budget
 
05:01:34.070 --> 05:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
or our 25 budget as an appropriation it
 
05:01:37.628 --> 05:01:37.638 align:start position:0%
just a huge balance for
 
05:01:40.750 --> 05:01:40.760 align:start position:0%
it what we have been doing a dedicated
 
05:01:43.230 --> 05:01:43.240 align:start position:0%
fund or no it's not a dedicated fund it
 
05:01:45.150 --> 05:01:45.160 align:start position:0%
is just a general fund appropriation
 
05:01:46.788 --> 05:01:46.798 align:start position:0%
it's just on the books it's on the books
 
05:01:49.788 --> 05:01:49.798 align:start position:0%
it's a nonap and it's non- lapsing right
 
05:01:53.350 --> 05:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
okay so what we've been doing because we
 
05:01:56.750 --> 05:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
have these two pots of money and just to
 
05:01:59.628 --> 05:01:59.638 align:start position:0%
give you an idea we are currently paying
 
05:01:59.638 --> 05:02:00.510 align:start position:0%
give you an idea we are currently paying
on

05:02:00.510 --> 05:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:02:00.520 --> 05:02:02.390 align:start position:0%
on
174

05:02:02.390 --> 05:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
174
 
05:02:05.670 --> 05:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
projects so that is the population that
 
05:02:07.510 --> 05:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
we're currently paying
 
05:02:10.390 --> 05:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
on what we have been doing
 
05:02:15.390 --> 05:02:15.400 align:start position:0%
with the HB 398 money is as communities
 
05:02:17.470 --> 05:02:17.480 align:start position:0%
submit their applications for state aid
 
05:02:19.990 --> 05:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
grants we've been making the initial
 
05:02:23.110 --> 05:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
award using that
 
05:02:25.830 --> 05:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
appropriation then once we get past that
 
05:02:28.548 --> 05:02:28.558 align:start position:0%
first year then that we call that at
 
05:02:30.510 --> 05:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
that point we then call it okay that's
 
05:02:32.628 --> 05:02:32.638 align:start position:0%
maintenance and then we start paying the
 
05:02:36.150 --> 05:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
second year onward out of the hb2
 
05:02:38.990 --> 05:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
money that's what this table is showing
 
05:02:41.470 --> 05:02:41.480 align:start position:0%
you so right
 
05:02:44.270 --> 05:02:44.280 align:start position:0%
now under these two pots of money that
 
05:02:47.910 --> 05:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
sit in one accounting unit we started
 
05:02:47.920 --> 05:02:49.110 align:start position:0%
sit in one accounting unit we started
the

05:02:49.110 --> 05:02:49.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:02:55.628 --> 05:02:55.638 align:start position:0%
2425 bium was $7.8 million of HB 398
 
05:02:58.190 --> 05:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
money and we started
 
05:03:01.990 --> 05:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
2425 with 27.9 million of what I call
 
05:03:03.390 --> 05:03:03.400 align:start position:0%
the hb2
 
05:03:06.670 --> 05:03:06.680 align:start position:0%
money during 24 and
 
05:03:10.270 --> 05:03:10.280 align:start position:0%
25 we have dispersed out
 
05:03:15.190 --> 05:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
and made new Awards and we have pending
 
05:03:18.190 --> 05:03:18.200 align:start position:0%
um in our program right now an
 
05:03:21.190 --> 05:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
additional I think six to nine
 
05:03:23.548 --> 05:03:23.558 align:start position:0%
applications that we could be making new
 
05:03:25.590 --> 05:03:25.600 align:start position:0%
Awards on right
 
05:03:29.628 --> 05:03:29.638 align:start position:0%
now in addition to that um we have been
 
05:03:31.270 --> 05:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
making what we call our maintenance
 
05:03:35.430 --> 05:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
payments we made um $ 10.8 Million last
 
05:03:37.548 --> 05:03:37.558 align:start position:0%
year and we're going to be making $10.3
 
05:03:40.230 --> 05:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
million this year in payment inside the
 
05:03:44.548 --> 05:03:44.558 align:start position:0%
hb2 money which will leave us $6.1
 
05:03:48.070 --> 05:03:48.080 align:start position:0%
million left of the HB 398 money and
 
05:03:52.470 --> 05:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
$6.6 million in change of the hb2
 
05:03:57.150 --> 05:03:57.160 align:start position:0%
money forecasting out for 26 and 27
 
05:03:58.910 --> 05:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
under HB
 
05:04:02.910 --> 05:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
398 we have potentially 12 new 12 to 15
 
05:04:05.430 --> 05:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
new Awards we're intend we think we
 
05:04:06.990 --> 05:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
might be making in
 
05:04:10.270 --> 05:04:10.280 align:start position:0%
26 and then another
 
05:04:13.110 --> 05:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
15 new Awards we might be making in
 
05:04:16.310 --> 05:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
27 with those estimated payments that
 
05:04:18.670 --> 05:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
would be spend another approximately $3
 
05:04:24.548 --> 05:04:24.558 align:start position:0%
million we would end the 27 26 27 bym
 
05:04:29.070 --> 05:04:29.080 align:start position:0%
with 3.1 million of that HB 398 money
 
05:04:31.708 --> 05:04:31.718 align:start position:0%
left on the hb2
 
05:04:35.990 --> 05:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
money what I've done is in 26 we have
 
05:04:38.470 --> 05:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
defined maintenance payments of of
 
05:04:42.270 --> 05:04:42.280 align:start position:0%
10.2 um um new payments estimated new
 
05:04:44.390 --> 05:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
payments from any new Awards we make
 
05:04:47.910 --> 05:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
this year of 700,000 so we our payments
 
05:04:49.150 --> 05:04:49.160 align:start position:0%
would be $1
 
05:04:53.030 --> 05:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
million our current budget for 26 is
 
05:04:56.670 --> 05:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:59.310 --> 05:04:59.320 align:start position:0%
million um which leaves a difference of
 
05:05:03.230 --> 05:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
2.1 in 27 our maintenance payments would
 
05:05:03.240 --> 05:05:04.510 align:start position:0%
2.1 in 27 our maintenance payments would
be

05:05:04.510 --> 05:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:05:08.670 --> 05:05:08.680 align:start position:0%
9.7 plus another 700,000 from the 25
 
05:05:11.750 --> 05:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
Awards Plus plus 1.2 million of
 
05:05:14.190 --> 05:05:14.200 align:start position:0%
additional funds and payments that came
 
05:05:17.430 --> 05:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
from 26 Awards so we'd be at
 
05:05:20.470 --> 05:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
11.6 the budget is currently sitting at
 
05:05:24.470 --> 05:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
8.6 a difference of 3 million we started
 
05:05:27.470 --> 05:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
the 20 if we'd start the 2627 by Anum
 
05:05:31.868 --> 05:05:31.878 align:start position:0%
with a $6.6 million excess you subtract
 
05:05:35.948 --> 05:05:35.958 align:start position:0%
out the two differences for 26 and 27 we
 
05:05:39.830 --> 05:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
will end the 27 vium with a balance of
 
05:05:42.788 --> 05:05:42.798 align:start position:0%
that original hb2 Money of 1 Point
 
05:05:45.110 --> 05:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
slightly under 1.5
 
05:05:48.230 --> 05:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
million so that is where we stand on on
 
05:05:51.230 --> 05:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
state aid grants at a very high level so
 
05:05:53.070 --> 05:05:53.080 align:start position:0%
if I looked in house bill one I would
 
05:05:53.080 --> 05:05:55.030 align:start position:0%
if I looked in house bill one I would
find

05:05:55.030 --> 05:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
find
 
05:05:58.910 --> 05:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
8.98 for 26 and
 
05:06:04.150 --> 05:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
8605 for 27 right and if I wanted to I
 
05:06:07.110 --> 05:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
could take the extra
 
05:06:09.628 --> 05:06:09.638 align:start position:0%
4.6 that I see at the bottom of the page
 
05:06:13.190 --> 05:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
age and lower those two amounts you
 
05:06:13.200 --> 05:06:15.470 align:start position:0%
age and lower those two amounts you
could

05:06:15.470 --> 05:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
could
 
05:06:19.350 --> 05:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
okay I will tell you um just so you
 
05:06:21.310 --> 05:06:21.320 align:start position:0%
understand what we're
 
05:06:24.830 --> 05:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
forecasting is we are looking at like I
 
05:06:28.270 --> 05:06:28.280 align:start position:0%
said 15 new Awards in
 
05:06:33.910 --> 05:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
26 15 new Awards or actually upwards of
 
05:06:37.628 --> 05:06:37.638 align:start position:0%
15 to 30 new Awards in 27 and additional
 
05:06:40.190 --> 05:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
30 new Awards in 28
 
05:06:43.628 --> 05:06:43.638 align:start position:0%
what we are forecasting out is as this
 
05:06:47.070 --> 05:06:47.080 align:start position:0%
Opa money has been spent and as all
 
05:06:50.350 --> 05:06:50.360 align:start position:0%
these waste water projects are now being
 
05:06:53.110 --> 05:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
completed communities have this volume
 
05:06:55.110 --> 05:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
of projects that they will be coming
 
05:06:58.910 --> 05:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
into us for State a grant funding so the
 
05:07:01.830 --> 05:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
demand will be going
 
05:07:05.030 --> 05:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
up okay now you said it's all Wastewater
 
05:07:06.910 --> 05:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
I thought some of these are freshwater
 
05:07:10.868 --> 05:07:10.878 align:start position:0%
no Wastewater is sewer sewer right yeah
 
05:07:12.788 --> 05:07:12.798 align:start position:0%
there's no drinking water in this
 
05:07:15.350 --> 05:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
program oh but there is somewhere else
 
05:07:18.548 --> 05:07:18.558 align:start position:0%
we have a small public water
 
05:07:21.230 --> 05:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
interconnection state aid grant program
 
05:07:23.788 --> 05:07:23.798 align:start position:0%
but that's a closed program there's no
 
05:07:27.190 --> 05:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
new no new general fund Awards in that
 
05:07:30.430 --> 05:07:30.440 align:start position:0%
if you read the statute for that it was
 
05:07:34.390 --> 05:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
based on an EPA change and regulations
 
05:07:36.270 --> 05:07:36.280 align:start position:0%
from the
 
05:07:39.990 --> 05:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
90s that's all done okay
 
05:07:42.948 --> 05:07:42.958 align:start position:0%
but then there's other federal grants oh
 
05:07:44.310 --> 05:07:44.320 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of other federal grants
 
05:07:46.030 --> 05:07:46.040 align:start position:0%
for public water system I and then
 
05:07:47.470 --> 05:07:47.480 align:start position:0%
there's a drinking water groundwater
 
05:07:50.110 --> 05:07:50.120 align:start position:0%
trust fund several several there's a lot
 
05:07:51.788 --> 05:07:51.798 align:start position:0%
of there's all kinds of other money
 
05:07:54.750 --> 05:07:54.760 align:start position:0%
right yes is there
 
05:07:58.548 --> 05:07:58.558 align:start position:0%
other such things for Wastewater or not
 
05:08:04.510 --> 05:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
no well there is the srf Loan program
 
05:08:09.190 --> 05:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
okay that and um some of the and with
 
05:08:11.350 --> 05:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
the bill money that comes as
 
05:08:12.788 --> 05:08:12.798 align:start position:0%
supplemental bill money there is
 
05:08:15.390 --> 05:08:15.400 align:start position:0%
additional money there but generally
 
05:08:18.270 --> 05:08:18.280 align:start position:0%
there are not grants for wastewater
 
05:08:18.280 --> 05:08:19.948 align:start position:0%
there are not grants for wastewater
treatment

05:08:19.948 --> 05:08:19.958 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
05:08:22.390 --> 05:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
systems so again the difference here is
 
05:08:24.230 --> 05:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
the state aid grant program is that
 
05:08:26.030 --> 05:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
after the fact you've already built your
 
05:08:29.070 --> 05:08:29.080 align:start position:0%
plant you commissioned it and now the
 
05:08:30.990 --> 05:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
state is helping to pay debt service up
 
05:08:33.990 --> 05:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
to 20% uh the state revolving Loan Fund
 
05:08:35.910 --> 05:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
and the other funds we're talking about
 
05:08:39.430 --> 05:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
are upfront and during construction to
 
05:08:41.150 --> 05:08:41.160 align:start position:0%
to get it to get it going so it's on the
 
05:08:43.230 --> 05:08:43.240 align:start position:0%
other side if you will but we tell them
 
05:08:45.390 --> 05:08:45.400 align:start position:0%
before they build it that this money is
 
05:08:48.708 --> 05:08:48.718 align:start position:0%
available or not uh that would be I'm
 
05:08:51.310 --> 05:08:51.320 align:start position:0%
sure represent Buco would have a lot of
 
05:08:54.708 --> 05:08:54.718 align:start position:0%
opinions on this but I would argue at
 
05:08:57.628 --> 05:08:57.638 align:start position:0%
least from our staff given that starting
 
05:08:59.670 --> 05:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
under Governor Lynch this program has
 
05:09:01.310 --> 05:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
stopped and started stopped and started
 
05:09:04.150 --> 05:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
multiple times we try to assure them
 
05:09:06.190 --> 05:09:06.200 align:start position:0%
that this is not a guarantee I see and
 
05:09:08.830 --> 05:09:08.840 align:start position:0%
it's subject to availability of funds
 
05:09:12.110 --> 05:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
others say different but so if I turn to
 
05:09:12.120 --> 05:09:14.430 align:start position:0%
others say different but so if I turn to
page

05:09:14.430 --> 05:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
page
 
05:09:18.708 --> 05:09:18.718 align:start position:0%
733 um and I see that you're you're
 
05:09:22.470 --> 05:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
budgeting 27 million of General funds
 
05:09:22.480 --> 05:09:23.590 align:start position:0%
budgeting 27 million of General funds
per

05:09:23.590 --> 05:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
per
 
05:09:26.430 --> 05:09:26.440 align:start position:0%
year we've just seen eight of that eight
 
05:09:30.310 --> 05:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
and a half or something each year is
 
05:09:33.070 --> 05:09:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:35.788 --> 05:09:35.798 align:start position:0%
saying can you say that question so on
 
05:09:35.798 --> 05:09:37.310 align:start position:0%
saying can you say that question so on
page

05:09:37.310 --> 05:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
page
 
05:09:41.190 --> 05:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
733 uh I look at General funds yeah
 
05:09:45.788 --> 05:09:45.798 align:start position:0%
27. 385 358 and 27.8
 
05:09:49.708 --> 05:09:49.718 align:start position:0%
35 right um you already what you just
 
05:09:54.628 --> 05:09:54.638 align:start position:0%
told me is roughly 8 to n million of
 
05:09:58.110 --> 05:09:58.120 align:start position:0%
that yes right so we haven't yet heard
 
05:10:02.150 --> 05:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
about 18 million or so of that right or
 
05:10:06.190 --> 05:10:06.200 align:start position:0%
yes yeah in each year yes yes okay good
 
05:10:08.948 --> 05:10:08.958 align:start position:0%
all right representative Griffin so that
 
05:10:12.270 --> 05:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
brings me to the question of that $18
 
05:10:16.590 --> 05:10:16.600 align:start position:0%
million is any of that matching
 
05:10:16.600 --> 05:10:18.150 align:start position:0%
million is any of that matching
funds

05:10:18.150 --> 05:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
funds
 
05:10:21.270 --> 05:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
yes it it
 
05:10:23.990 --> 05:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
um I can't give you an exact number of
 
05:10:25.310 --> 05:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
how much of our general funds is
 
05:10:29.430 --> 05:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
matching but um I would I would have to
 
05:10:31.190 --> 05:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
get back to you with an exact number I
 
05:10:33.470 --> 05:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to guess can you guess
 
05:10:37.628 --> 05:10:37.638 align:start position:0%
about uh she doesn't want it she doesn't
 
05:10:39.510 --> 05:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
we're trying to we're trying to get the
 
05:10:42.270 --> 05:10:42.280 align:start position:0%
grasp of the picture it doesn't have to
 
05:10:44.350 --> 05:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
be perfect it doesn't have to be to the
 
05:10:48.470 --> 05:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
penny um I would say I would be guessing
 
05:10:51.750 --> 05:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
at 20 to 25% but I would want to i'
 
05:10:54.510 --> 05:10:54.520 align:start position:0%
really want to confirm that well let me
 
05:10:57.310 --> 05:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
let me ask a question like if you were
 
05:11:01.310 --> 05:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
to lose 15 million of General funds what
 
05:11:03.708 --> 05:11:03.718 align:start position:0%
impact would it have on you and how much
 
05:11:07.190 --> 05:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
of that would you manage to to use
 
05:11:13.788 --> 05:11:13.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:13.798 --> 05:11:15.548 align:start position:0%
 
I

05:11:15.548 --> 05:11:15.558 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:11:19.070 --> 05:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
um we would probably
 
05:11:19.080 --> 05:11:20.708 align:start position:0%
um we would probably
lose

05:11:20.708 --> 05:11:20.718 align:start position:0%
lose
 
05:11:25.548 --> 05:11:25.558 align:start position:0%
75% of our general fund programs and um
 
05:11:28.830 --> 05:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
I would doubt we could
 
05:11:31.948 --> 05:11:31.958 align:start position:0%
replace any of that with federal
 
05:11:36.470 --> 05:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
funds um our primary Federal Agency for
 
05:11:40.190 --> 05:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
our funding is EPA
 
05:11:43.628 --> 05:11:43.638 align:start position:0%
um and we have no idea what is happening
 
05:11:46.830 --> 05:11:46.840 align:start position:0%
to epa's budget going
 
05:11:49.548 --> 05:11:49.558 align:start position:0%
forward well let let me rephrase the
 
05:11:52.070 --> 05:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
question other than those
 
05:11:54.670 --> 05:11:54.680 align:start position:0%
funds other than those funds that are
 
05:11:57.628 --> 05:11:57.638 align:start position:0%
required for matching funds and are
 
05:11:59.670 --> 05:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
already committed to the Wastewater
 
05:12:01.670 --> 05:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
thing whatever is
 
05:12:04.708 --> 05:12:04.718 align:start position:0%
left what what what would the impact of
 
05:12:12.310 --> 05:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:16.150 --> 05:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
um well
 
05:12:19.788 --> 05:12:19.798 align:start position:0%
um we would probably
 
05:12:19.798 --> 05:12:21.990 align:start position:0%
um we would probably
lose

05:12:21.990 --> 05:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
lose
 
05:12:25.628 --> 05:12:25.638 align:start position:0%
um we would lose our circular
 
05:12:28.110 --> 05:12:28.120 align:start position:0%
maintenance program which is the program
 
05:12:31.310 --> 05:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
that manages the former Federal super
 
05:12:31.320 --> 05:12:32.110 align:start position:0%
that manages the former Federal super
fund

05:12:32.110 --> 05:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
fund
 
05:12:36.788 --> 05:12:36.798 align:start position:0%
sites um we would lose our Solid Waste
 
05:12:42.548 --> 05:12:42.558 align:start position:0%
Management program we would lose um um
 
05:12:44.470 --> 05:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
lakes and rivers management we would
 
05:12:47.590 --> 05:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
lose shellfish we would lose Dam
 
05:12:51.830 --> 05:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
operations um we would lose um
 
05:12:56.350 --> 05:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner's office um maybe not
 
05:12:59.670 --> 05:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
a um we probably would lose the majority
 
05:13:02.270 --> 05:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
of our administrative staff we would
 
05:13:04.590 --> 05:13:04.600 align:start position:0%
probably lose
 
05:13:09.670 --> 05:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
geology um we would lose a yeah most
 
05:13:11.670 --> 05:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
most of our programs yeah we'd have to
 
05:13:13.548 --> 05:13:13.558 align:start position:0%
cut programs I don't see federal funds
 
05:13:16.150 --> 05:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
able to so here is the is the position
 
05:13:19.350 --> 05:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
that the finance finds itself
 
05:13:22.708 --> 05:13:22.718 align:start position:0%
in uh we have to make cuts and the cuts
 
05:13:23.990 --> 05:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
are going to be
 
05:13:26.310 --> 05:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
significant and
 
05:13:29.070 --> 05:13:29.080 align:start position:0%
uh we we want to know what damage we're
 
05:13:29.910 --> 05:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
going to
 
05:13:29.920 --> 05:13:31.830 align:start position:0%
going to
do

05:13:31.830 --> 05:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:13:35.190 --> 05:13:35.200 align:start position:0%
so because there is I'm sure there'll be
 
05:13:37.910 --> 05:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
some damage because the revenue
 
05:13:42.070 --> 05:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
shortfall is large enough that there're
 
05:13:44.628 --> 05:13:44.638 align:start position:0%
going to be Cuts Here There and
 
05:13:48.110 --> 05:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
Everywhere pretty much uh the the uh
 
05:13:51.628 --> 05:13:51.638 align:start position:0%
Governor's 4% isn't isn't going to be
 
05:13:54.230 --> 05:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
sufficient so I'm trying to get a grasp
 
05:13:57.430 --> 05:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
on on what the impact of those cuts is
 
05:14:00.910 --> 05:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
going to be to in each
 
05:14:04.110 --> 05:14:04.120 align:start position:0%
agency so any light you can shed on that
 
05:14:05.708 --> 05:14:05.718 align:start position:0%
yeah when you talk about like your
 
05:14:06.948 --> 05:14:06.958 align:start position:0%
office for
 
05:14:09.990 --> 05:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
example would don't Federal Grant allow
 
05:14:12.548 --> 05:14:12.558 align:start position:0%
some some fraction of them to be used
 
05:14:15.110 --> 05:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
for administration and things like that
 
05:14:16.708 --> 05:14:16.718 align:start position:0%
yeah usually it's the other way around
 
05:14:18.990 --> 05:14:19.000 align:start position:0%
we're matching with some with our staff
 
05:14:22.230 --> 05:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
time usually but good um I
 
05:14:25.390 --> 05:14:25.400 align:start position:0%
see the administration and support
 
05:14:26.830 --> 05:14:26.840 align:start position:0%
account which is the first account in
 
05:14:29.750 --> 05:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
our budget um as you can see um we
 
05:14:34.548 --> 05:14:34.558 align:start position:0%
collect um 47% of that uh county unit um
 
05:14:37.590 --> 05:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
through the indirect cost proposals and
 
05:14:39.628 --> 05:14:39.638 align:start position:0%
that's how we recapture
 
05:14:42.750 --> 05:14:42.760 align:start position:0%
a good portion of the admin support the
 
05:14:47.310 --> 05:14:47.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner's office um is not um is in
 
05:14:51.510 --> 05:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
the Statewide indirect cost pool which
 
05:14:54.868 --> 05:14:54.878 align:start position:0%
um gets collected part of the what they
 
05:14:57.948 --> 05:14:57.958 align:start position:0%
call the swap dollars and it goes right
 
05:15:00.510 --> 05:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
to administrative Services the
 
05:15:03.548 --> 05:15:03.558 align:start position:0%
Department of administra Services so um
 
05:15:06.190 --> 05:15:06.200 align:start position:0%
but we don't we don't capture it on our
 
05:15:08.708 --> 05:15:08.718 align:start position:0%
budget the commissioner's office is 100%
 
05:15:11.270 --> 05:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
General fund gotcha all right
 
05:15:12.750 --> 05:15:12.760 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin again and then
 
05:15:15.270 --> 05:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
representative Wy thank you Mr chair
 
05:15:18.030 --> 05:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
just a follow-up question obviously when
 
05:15:21.830 --> 05:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
you inspect dams you get you get U
 
05:15:24.510 --> 05:15:24.520 align:start position:0%
Revenue when you do septic systems you
 
05:15:27.788 --> 05:15:27.798 align:start position:0%
get Revenue you you you receive revenue
 
05:15:29.910 --> 05:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
for most of what you
 
05:15:33.270 --> 05:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
do uh is that Revenue now all going to
 
05:15:36.150 --> 05:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
the general fund or is it going into an
 
05:15:39.070 --> 05:15:39.080 align:start position:0%
inter agency fund is it in other funds
 
05:15:40.430 --> 05:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
uh for the ones you mentioned those are
 
05:15:44.150 --> 05:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
going to for those programs I will say
 
05:15:46.310 --> 05:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
um and you know our view is Fe fee for
 
05:15:51.430 --> 05:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
service makes a lot of sense uh is uh
 
05:15:54.110 --> 05:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so we have some projected increases
 
05:15:56.628 --> 05:15:56.638 align:start position:0%
in those fees as well and house bill to
 
05:15:58.628 --> 05:15:58.638 align:start position:0%
uh moving forward but are are you
 
05:16:01.430 --> 05:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
retaining those fees to cover your cost
 
05:16:05.110 --> 05:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
yes yes so you you you not necessarily
 
05:16:07.990 --> 05:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't lose everything that you well
 
05:16:10.548 --> 05:16:10.558 align:start position:0%
those programs are already um on the
 
05:16:12.708 --> 05:16:12.718 align:start position:0%
budget as other funds they are not on
 
05:16:15.070 --> 05:16:15.080 align:start position:0%
the budget as general funds yeah so
 
05:16:17.030 --> 05:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
they've already they're they're not in
 
05:16:19.788 --> 05:16:19.798 align:start position:0%
our $27 million well like inspection of
 
05:16:22.750 --> 05:16:22.760 align:start position:0%
dams that you mentioned that you lose
 
05:16:25.750 --> 05:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
aren't there significant fees when when
 
05:16:28.270 --> 05:16:28.280 align:start position:0%
when somebody owns a dam and has it
 
05:16:30.750 --> 05:16:30.760 align:start position:0%
inspected uh I would arue know they're
 
05:16:32.310 --> 05:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
not significant fees but we're we're
 
05:16:34.230 --> 05:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
trying to increase them but but but to
 
05:16:35.548 --> 05:16:35.558 align:start position:0%
answer your earlier question I mean the
 
05:16:38.310 --> 05:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
only program that comes to mind in in uh
 
05:16:40.910 --> 05:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
director set behind me but the solid
 
05:16:43.150 --> 05:16:43.160 align:start position:0%
waste program to the extent they have
 
05:16:45.190 --> 05:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
fees that goes into the general fund and
 
05:16:48.830 --> 05:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
then back to staff again so it's so
 
05:16:51.868 --> 05:16:51.878 align:start position:0%
that's anyways so so they do have fees
 
05:16:54.070 --> 05:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
but it's not enough to cover but it goes
 
05:16:55.510 --> 05:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
to the general funds if that answers
 
05:16:57.708 --> 05:16:57.718 align:start position:0%
your question so representative eel
 
05:17:01.750 --> 05:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
wants to add some fees to that I think
 
05:17:03.830 --> 05:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
any she does yes she does okay
 
05:17:06.430 --> 05:17:06.440 align:start position:0%
representative wer what we found is that
 
05:17:08.948 --> 05:17:08.958 align:start position:0%
a lot of the fees we charge
 
05:17:11.910 --> 05:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
been changed for 20 years sometimes
 
05:17:13.548 --> 05:17:13.558 align:start position:0%
longer and and you know everything else
 
05:17:16.270 --> 05:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
has gone up in 20 years AG s them by the
 
05:17:19.868 --> 05:17:19.878 align:start position:0%
price of eggs we could triple
 
05:17:23.868 --> 05:17:23.878 align:start position:0%
them anyway it's it's a way to keep from
 
05:17:26.430 --> 05:17:26.440 align:start position:0%
having to cut so deep yes if we bring it
 
05:17:30.750 --> 05:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
in more in fees that would make up for
 
05:17:32.150 --> 05:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
the general fund that we have to
 
05:17:34.948 --> 05:17:34.958 align:start position:0%
increase or I see you've already taken a
 
05:17:37.910 --> 05:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
considerable cut but it it would ease
 
05:17:40.990 --> 05:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
some of the pain for your agency if
 
05:17:42.830 --> 05:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
places you collected fees you went back
 
05:17:45.390 --> 05:17:45.400 align:start position:0%
and looked whoa that one's that's been
 
05:17:46.990 --> 05:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
the same since
 
05:17:50.670 --> 05:17:50.680 align:start position:0%
2010 well you you bring about up the the
 
05:17:53.310 --> 05:17:53.320 align:start position:0%
damn safety program so right now what's
 
05:17:55.548 --> 05:17:55.558 align:start position:0%
proposed there's going to be a very
 
05:17:57.708 --> 05:17:57.718 align:start position:0%
modest fee increase and it will be
 
05:17:59.548 --> 05:17:59.558 align:start position:0%
augmented with General funds to not have
 
05:18:01.670 --> 05:18:01.680 align:start position:0%
a big fee increase as an example I
 
05:18:03.070 --> 05:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
suspect that may be what you're getting
 
05:18:06.150 --> 05:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
at representative um the other thing
 
05:18:08.788 --> 05:18:08.798 align:start position:0%
we've we've been you'll see some
 
05:18:11.190 --> 05:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
language from us on you're right we have
 
05:18:13.030 --> 05:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
some fees for instance has increased
 
05:18:13.040 --> 05:18:14.110 align:start position:0%
some fees for instance has increased
since

05:18:14.110 --> 05:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
since
 
05:18:16.750 --> 05:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
2009 and things have cost more you know
 
05:18:18.708 --> 05:18:18.718 align:start position:0%
the cost of living so the other thing
 
05:18:20.670 --> 05:18:20.680 align:start position:0%
we've we've we have some language we've
 
05:18:24.788 --> 05:18:24.798 align:start position:0%
thrown out is okay set the fee and then
 
05:18:28.230 --> 05:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
have a a CPI attached to that and if
 
05:18:31.548 --> 05:18:31.558 align:start position:0%
there's and if if uh you know with
 
05:18:32.788 --> 05:18:32.798 align:start position:0%
approval from the commissioner we would
 
05:18:34.788 --> 05:18:34.798 align:start position:0%
go to the the uh fiscal committee for
 
05:18:37.150 --> 05:18:37.160 align:start position:0%
example to implement but it would at
 
05:18:38.948 --> 05:18:38.958 align:start position:0%
least allow
 
05:18:41.390 --> 05:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
not have that huge huge sticker shock
 
05:18:44.430 --> 05:18:44.440 align:start position:0%
from going from 2009 and then oh my God
 
05:18:46.070 --> 05:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
the fe's doubling we've already had the
 
05:18:48.510 --> 05:18:48.520 align:start position:0%
big sticker shock and gasoline eggs
 
05:18:50.510 --> 05:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
groceries everything
 
05:18:54.548 --> 05:18:54.558 align:start position:0%
so I mean if it means we don't have to
 
05:18:58.470 --> 05:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
reduce your operations as much and I'd
 
05:19:00.548 --> 05:19:00.558 align:start position:0%
appreciate it if you do an analysis of
 
05:19:02.990 --> 05:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
all your fees give us an idea if you
 
05:19:05.470 --> 05:19:05.480 align:start position:0%
went up by just
 
05:19:08.510 --> 05:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
CPI how much more would we bring in that
 
05:19:10.110 --> 05:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't have to worry about you got
 
05:19:12.708 --> 05:19:12.718 align:start position:0%
to cut this and you got to cut that okay
 
05:19:14.470 --> 05:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
that's people have got to expect it
 
05:19:16.350 --> 05:19:16.360 align:start position:0%
they' got it everywhere else yeah that's
 
05:19:18.390 --> 05:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
very much in line with what we'd be
 
05:19:20.390 --> 05:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
interested in I
 
05:19:23.030 --> 05:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
also for a later discussion we fit
 
05:19:24.670 --> 05:19:24.680 align:start position:0%
similar discussion on dams right now
 
05:19:26.548 --> 05:19:26.558 align:start position:0%
dams are not being funded in an
 
05:19:28.670 --> 05:19:28.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate way sustainable way in my
 
05:19:32.350 --> 05:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
opinion uh and and I think the answer is
 
05:19:34.270 --> 05:19:34.280 align:start position:0%
ultimately some kind of fee for service
 
05:19:35.948 --> 05:19:35.958 align:start position:0%
right I even saw a
 
05:19:38.190 --> 05:19:38.200 align:start position:0%
suggestion I know the Waterfront people
 
05:19:39.390 --> 05:19:39.400 align:start position:0%
would hate it
 
05:19:42.310 --> 05:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
but stick something on each of them you
 
05:19:44.230 --> 05:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
know they all want to get involved in
 
05:19:46.788 --> 05:19:46.798 align:start position:0%
hey you can't draw down my damn I won't
 
05:19:49.510 --> 05:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
be able to take my boat out you know so
 
05:19:52.830 --> 05:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
okay we may have heard that yes all
 
05:19:54.750 --> 05:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
right representative
 
05:19:57.390 --> 05:19:57.400 align:start position:0%
Ms thank you Mr chair and thank you uh
 
05:20:00.670 --> 05:20:00.680 align:start position:0%
for coming in again um how much how much
 
05:20:05.548 --> 05:20:05.558 align:start position:0%
money is there in this budget for pest
 
05:20:09.310 --> 05:20:09.320 align:start position:0%
remediation including at um at director
 
05:20:11.948 --> 05:20:11.958 align:start position:0%
wisit knows I'm um interested in
 
05:20:14.708 --> 05:20:14.718 align:start position:0%
landfills at at at
 
05:20:17.788 --> 05:20:17.798 align:start position:0%
landfills um and then my second question
 
05:20:21.910 --> 05:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
is uh related to that if we were to make
 
05:20:24.948 --> 05:20:24.958 align:start position:0%
significant Cuts in general funding uh
 
05:20:27.670 --> 05:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
resources available to you what would
 
05:20:30.590 --> 05:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
the implications be on the availability
 
05:20:32.830 --> 05:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
of federal funding to support those
 
05:20:36.030 --> 05:20:36.040 align:start position:0%
efforts so I'll let Sue I'll give I'll
 
05:20:38.390 --> 05:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
buy some time for Sue Carlson here to to
 
05:20:40.510 --> 05:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
to develop an answer but a few things
 
05:20:42.948 --> 05:20:42.958 align:start position:0%
and again as uh ripson of wer pointed
 
05:20:44.510 --> 05:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
out we do have I I would want to point
 
05:20:46.830 --> 05:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
to to our summary on page page 11 of our
 
05:20:48.708 --> 05:20:48.718 align:start position:0%
slide so that gives talks a little bit
 
05:20:52.470 --> 05:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
of past but other things also so you
 
05:20:57.390 --> 05:20:57.400 align:start position:0%
will see 55 million uh in 26 that's from
 
05:21:01.990 --> 05:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
a a nationwide settlement that's our
 
05:21:04.708 --> 05:21:04.718 align:start position:0%
expected amount coming to New Hampshire
 
05:21:06.708 --> 05:21:06.718 align:start position:0%
I will put as a caveat I know that's not
 
05:21:09.150 --> 05:21:09.160 align:start position:0%
where the representative was suggesting
 
05:21:10.350 --> 05:21:10.360 align:start position:0%
that money has kind of been pre-
 
05:21:13.350 --> 05:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
obligated to the water system so so the
 
05:21:16.470 --> 05:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
past uh it it'll go to Water Systems who
 
05:21:19.270 --> 05:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
have incurred a cost to remediate
 
05:21:22.670 --> 05:21:22.680 align:start position:0%
pasas uh the good news is between here's
 
05:21:24.788 --> 05:21:24.798 align:start position:0%
my commercial uh between the the good
 
05:21:26.390 --> 05:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
efforts of the depart Department of
 
05:21:30.350 --> 05:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
Justice here and and and my my staff
 
05:21:31.628 --> 05:21:31.638 align:start position:0%
proportionately New Hampshire is going
 
05:21:33.110 --> 05:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
to get more out of the settlement than
 
05:21:36.390 --> 05:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
any other state state that's the good
 
05:21:37.750 --> 05:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
news the bad news this is going to be
 
05:21:39.390 --> 05:21:39.400 align:start position:0%
Pennies on a dollar for what they've
 
05:21:40.990 --> 05:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
incurred so you you may hear some
 
05:21:43.030 --> 05:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
rumbling but at least we've you know
 
05:21:45.990 --> 05:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
we're trying we also you may remember in
 
05:21:48.750 --> 05:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
pass by anys uh we had uh we were
 
05:21:50.948 --> 05:21:50.958 align:start position:0%
allowed $55 million in
 
05:21:53.990 --> 05:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
bonding uh for for
 
05:21:59.070 --> 05:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
p uh that's still there uh but bottom
 
05:22:01.070 --> 05:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
line is we have a mix of General funds
 
05:22:03.590 --> 05:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
to address pasas uh drinking water
 
05:22:05.230 --> 05:22:05.240 align:start position:0%
ground water trust fund has has kicked
 
05:22:07.990 --> 05:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
in in some some places and some of the
 
05:22:09.510 --> 05:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
federal money I mentioned the the
 
05:22:11.910 --> 05:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure money uh under the title
 
05:22:13.670 --> 05:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
of emerging contaminants it's kind of a
 
05:22:16.150 --> 05:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
broad thing we're able to use also so
 
05:22:19.030 --> 05:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
there there is a mix of money I will add
 
05:22:21.390 --> 05:22:21.400 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the just like I mentioned
 
05:22:24.070 --> 05:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
for the Water Systems the the impact is
 
05:22:25.670 --> 05:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
still larger than the amount of money
 
05:22:27.150 --> 05:22:27.160 align:start position:0%
but there are there are some so I don't
 
05:22:29.150 --> 05:22:29.160 align:start position:0%
I don't have a figure for all the
 
05:22:31.390 --> 05:22:31.400 align:start position:0%
general funds I don't know if sue if I
 
05:22:32.788 --> 05:22:32.798 align:start position:0%
give you enough time if not I'll start
 
05:22:34.788 --> 05:22:34.798 align:start position:0%
tap dancing how's
 
05:22:34.798 --> 05:22:37.310 align:start position:0%
tap dancing how's
that

05:22:37.310 --> 05:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:22:39.310 --> 05:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
um um
 
05:22:55.868 --> 05:22:55.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:59.190 --> 05:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
717 um account
 
05:23:01.830 --> 05:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
4728 that is our emerging contaminate
 
05:23:05.390 --> 05:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
fund that is primarily um the one we're
 
05:23:07.350 --> 05:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
talking about and as you can see if you
 
05:23:10.868 --> 05:23:10.878 align:start position:0%
look at 26 you can um see it jumps up to
 
05:23:14.948 --> 05:23:14.958 align:start position:0%
$86 million that's primarily because
 
05:23:18.310 --> 05:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
we've we've asked and the governor and
 
05:23:20.110 --> 05:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
nicely included it in her operating
 
05:23:23.788 --> 05:23:23.798 align:start position:0%
budget to put in $55 million of the um
 
05:23:27.230 --> 05:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
potential set of the settlement funds we
 
05:23:29.910 --> 05:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
intend to receive on 3 A.M that's the
 
05:23:33.350 --> 05:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
biggest single piece uh but that is the
 
05:23:35.868 --> 05:23:35.878 align:start position:0%
program that where we do the majority of
 
05:23:39.628 --> 05:23:39.638 align:start position:0%
the PS work as the commissioner said um
 
05:23:44.868 --> 05:23:44.878 align:start position:0%
there is um under our um drinking water
 
05:23:48.868 --> 05:23:48.878 align:start position:0%
groundwater Bureau um we are getting
 
05:23:52.628 --> 05:23:52.638 align:start position:0%
approximately $9 million a year dealing
 
05:23:55.390 --> 05:23:55.400 align:start position:0%
with emerging
 
05:23:59.470 --> 05:23:59.480 align:start position:0%
contaminants um and
 
05:24:04.390 --> 05:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
um and um and if you look at if you flip
 
05:24:14.750 --> 05:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:18.948 --> 05:24:18.958 align:start position:0%
719 this is the account um this is our
 
05:24:21.470 --> 05:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
uh past response
 
05:24:24.910 --> 05:24:24.920 align:start position:0%
fund this is primarily being funded as
 
05:24:27.070 --> 05:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
as the commissioner said out of a $50
 
05:24:28.670 --> 05:24:28.680 align:start position:0%
million Capital
 
05:24:32.590 --> 05:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
appropriation um we have been granted um
 
05:24:34.430 --> 05:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
some additional funds over the past
 
05:24:36.670 --> 05:24:36.680 align:start position:0%
years of supplemental General funds put
 
05:24:39.150 --> 05:24:39.160 align:start position:0%
in here at this account what the budget
 
05:24:42.430 --> 05:24:42.440 align:start position:0%
is actually set based on what we have
 
05:24:44.868 --> 05:24:44.878 align:start position:0%
available of that Bond
 
05:24:47.910 --> 05:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
money so just so there's really no
 
05:24:51.430 --> 05:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
connection between either of these and
 
05:24:53.350 --> 05:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
kind of general fund Federal fund
 
05:24:58.390 --> 05:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
matching formulas no okay thank
 
05:25:06.110 --> 05:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:10.948 --> 05:25:10.958 align:start position:0%
three so just in in general
 
05:25:14.270 --> 05:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
um I don't remember when we budgeted the
 
05:25:18.190 --> 05:25:18.200 align:start position:0%
previous bium that that there was a two
 
05:25:22.910 --> 05:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
210 million increase from 70 24 to
 
05:25:25.868 --> 05:25:25.878 align:start position:0%
25 so things must have happened in the
 
05:25:29.510 --> 05:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
meantime right so this is the deceiving
 
05:25:32.948 --> 05:25:32.958 align:start position:0%
part of the way this budget is is
 
05:25:36.750 --> 05:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
structured 24 is actual expenditures
 
05:25:39.430 --> 05:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
it's not Appropriations and it also
 
05:25:42.868 --> 05:25:42.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't reflect incumbrances
 
05:25:46.070 --> 05:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
um when we ended fiscal year
 
05:25:49.548 --> 05:25:49.558 align:start position:0%
24 what is not reflected in this number
 
05:25:54.270 --> 05:25:54.280 align:start position:0%
is we had $44 million in encumbrances
 
05:25:59.788 --> 05:25:59.798 align:start position:0%
wow okay most of that in um grants and
 
05:26:04.510 --> 05:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
Loans okay and so new ones in 2024 or
 
05:26:08.470 --> 05:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
just total total combination and that's
 
05:26:10.590 --> 05:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
excluding ARA
 
05:26:14.390 --> 05:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
money um so it's very deceiving when you
 
05:26:17.190 --> 05:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
look at our budget versus our expend
 
05:26:20.910 --> 05:26:20.920 align:start position:0%
because our expend is is not keeping it
 
05:26:22.510 --> 05:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
it looks like we're not spending our
 
05:26:25.510 --> 05:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
budget but in reality we are using you
 
05:26:29.190 --> 05:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
know nearly 98% of our budget because we
 
05:26:29.200 --> 05:26:31.190 align:start position:0%
know nearly 98% of our budget because we
have

05:26:31.190 --> 05:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:26:34.788 --> 05:26:34.798 align:start position:0%
encumbrances um the the thing with
 
05:26:38.270 --> 05:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
loans um that most people are unaware of
 
05:26:41.310 --> 05:26:41.320 align:start position:0%
when we give out like a a a clean water
 
05:26:43.948 --> 05:26:43.958 align:start position:0%
loan or a drinking water loan the
 
05:26:45.910 --> 05:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
average time it takes from the time we
 
05:26:48.948 --> 05:26:48.958 align:start position:0%
issue that loan till it is spent by the
 
05:26:51.548 --> 05:26:51.558 align:start position:0%
communities averages between three to
 
05:26:51.558 --> 05:26:52.350 align:start position:0%
communities averages between three to
five

05:26:52.350 --> 05:26:52.360 align:start position:0%
five
 
05:26:55.708 --> 05:26:55.718 align:start position:0%
years so we have money you know we have
 
05:26:57.708 --> 05:26:57.718 align:start position:0%
to budget to be able to issue those
 
05:27:01.270 --> 05:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
loans but the spend doesn't match the
 
05:27:03.788 --> 05:27:03.798 align:start position:0%
year we issue you saying
 
05:27:06.230 --> 05:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
M okay if I collaborate it's not like we
 
05:27:07.868 --> 05:27:07.878 align:start position:0%
issue a check to a community and walk
 
05:27:10.548 --> 05:27:10.558 align:start position:0%
away they they you know especially if
 
05:27:12.708 --> 05:27:12.718 align:start position:0%
there's Federal feral strings attached
 
05:27:16.390 --> 05:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
you know uh by American Davis bacon wage
 
05:27:19.868 --> 05:27:19.878 align:start position:0%
Etc we have to monitor all that but also
 
05:27:21.590 --> 05:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
they have to meet their engineering
 
05:27:23.868 --> 05:27:23.878 align:start position:0%
design before we can we pay them so
 
05:27:26.628 --> 05:27:26.638 align:start position:0%
basically we pay they remit saying hey
 
05:27:28.910 --> 05:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
we've me this Milestone we have to have
 
05:27:30.590 --> 05:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
our engineering staff validated our
 
05:27:32.470 --> 05:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
accounting staff make sure all that
 
05:27:34.750 --> 05:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
things have been met and then we pay so
 
05:27:36.788 --> 05:27:36.798 align:start position:0%
it's it would be nice if it was just
 
05:27:38.910 --> 05:27:38.920 align:start position:0%
issue a check and and walk away but
 
05:27:40.230 --> 05:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
there's quite a tail to this and
 
05:27:42.470 --> 05:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
obviously loans that are 20 years or
 
05:27:45.390 --> 05:27:45.400 align:start position:0%
more have to be serviced also so it's so
 
05:27:47.430 --> 05:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
how about the way money comes from the
 
05:27:50.510 --> 05:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
federal government is
 
05:27:53.310 --> 05:27:53.320 align:start position:0%
it that we op you know you say you have
 
05:27:55.868 --> 05:27:55.878 align:start position:0%
400 million in incumbrances obviously a
 
05:27:57.788 --> 05:27:57.798 align:start position:0%
lot of that is going to be paid for with
 
05:27:59.070 --> 05:27:59.080 align:start position:0%
money that comes from the federal
 
05:28:01.030 --> 05:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
government is that the federal
 
05:28:02.670 --> 05:28:02.680 align:start position:0%
government has already sent us that
 
05:28:05.390 --> 05:28:05.400 align:start position:0%
money or that they're obligated to send
 
05:28:08.948 --> 05:28:08.958 align:start position:0%
us when when yes it comes due Etc the
 
05:28:11.070 --> 05:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
feds with the exception of ARA the feds
 
05:28:14.670 --> 05:28:14.680 align:start position:0%
never Advance US money okay um is and
 
05:28:16.708 --> 05:28:16.718 align:start position:0%
how we have our loans set up is As the
 
05:28:20.110 --> 05:28:20.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner said um the towns will draw
 
05:28:22.510 --> 05:28:22.520 align:start position:0%
on their loans when they've dispersed
 
05:28:24.548 --> 05:28:24.558 align:start position:0%
funds we always disperse on a
 
05:28:26.948 --> 05:28:26.958 align:start position:0%
reimbursement basis the federal
 
05:28:29.750 --> 05:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
government gen always disperses on a
 
05:28:33.350 --> 05:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
reimbursement basis okay so essentially
 
05:28:35.830 --> 05:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
when we cut a check let's say the city
 
05:28:37.628 --> 05:28:37.638 align:start position:0%
of Manchester they come in with a
 
05:28:41.430 --> 05:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
reimburse request for $1.2 million we're
 
05:28:43.590 --> 05:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
we're committing federal funds Federal
 
05:28:46.070 --> 05:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
Loan to that we will disperse them
 
05:28:48.470 --> 05:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
within 24 hours of dispersing that funds
 
05:28:50.070 --> 05:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
to the city of Manchester we've
 
05:28:51.910 --> 05:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
submitted a request to the feds to draw
 
05:28:53.830 --> 05:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
that money out of the federal government
 
05:28:59.190 --> 05:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
okay so the the actual from 2024 of 47
 
05:29:01.788 --> 05:29:01.798 align:start position:0%
million of federal funds that's what
 
05:29:05.110 --> 05:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
they actually sent us in 2024 yes yes
 
05:29:08.150 --> 05:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
okay plus or minus some receivables okay
 
05:29:09.030 --> 05:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
but the
 
05:29:12.430 --> 05:29:12.440 align:start position:0%
187 we're putting in here for fiscal
 
05:29:16.868 --> 05:29:16.878 align:start position:0%
year 25 25 includes some money that they
 
05:29:18.390 --> 05:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
won't send us in
 
05:29:22.750 --> 05:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
25 but they promis to send us later when
 
05:29:26.548 --> 05:29:26.558 align:start position:0%
the spending happens yes okay okay so
 
05:29:27.910 --> 05:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
the amount they they're actually going
 
05:29:31.390 --> 05:29:31.400 align:start position:0%
to send us in 25 is probably somewhere
 
05:29:34.030 --> 05:29:34.040 align:start position:0%
in between those two numbers yeah okay
 
05:29:36.350 --> 05:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
yeah it will as fast as we can spend it
 
05:29:38.350 --> 05:29:38.360 align:start position:0%
that's how how much we'll get back from
 
05:29:41.030 --> 05:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
them gotcha okay but but they are
 
05:29:44.430 --> 05:29:44.440 align:start position:0%
obligated so we can make promises to
 
05:29:47.390 --> 05:29:47.400 align:start position:0%
town we don't issue grants until we have
 
05:29:50.830 --> 05:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
an award in hand gotcha now I can't
 
05:29:52.310 --> 05:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
count for if the federal government
 
05:29:54.350 --> 05:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
decides to resend
 
05:29:54.360 --> 05:29:55.948 align:start position:0%
decides to resend
things

05:29:55.948 --> 05:29:55.958 align:start position:0%
things
 
05:29:57.590 --> 05:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
sure never heard of all right
 
05:29:59.750 --> 05:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative evil yeah so if you look
 
05:30:02.788 --> 05:30:02.798 align:start position:0%
at the general fund line on page
 
05:30:06.830 --> 05:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
733 the 2025 adjusted authorized took
 
05:30:10.670 --> 05:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
quite a dip there um so what accounted
 
05:30:14.990 --> 05:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
for that that is because the state aid
 
05:30:17.190 --> 05:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
grant money was not part of our
 
05:30:20.430 --> 05:30:20.440 align:start position:0%
appropriation for 25 that was the money
 
05:30:23.430 --> 05:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
we received actually appropriated in
 
05:30:27.350 --> 05:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
23 as you can see we spent $27 million
 
05:30:31.270 --> 05:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
in 24 that reflects actual um State a
 
05:30:33.510 --> 05:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
grant dispersements that aren't
 
05:30:36.150 --> 05:30:36.160 align:start position:0%
reflected in the budget it's that page
 
05:30:38.750 --> 05:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
we went over in detail
 
05:30:42.070 --> 05:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
yeah um but you basically held the line
 
05:30:46.788 --> 05:30:46.798 align:start position:0%
on general fund spending for
 
05:30:51.590 --> 05:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
2627 yes we've tried to right okay Mr my
 
05:30:55.110 --> 05:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
apologies back I understand yes he's not
 
05:30:57.750 --> 05:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
being Rudy at previous
 
05:31:01.230 --> 05:31:01.240 align:start position:0%
commitment okay all right so let's um
 
05:31:03.270 --> 05:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
why don't we go to the rest of your
 
05:31:05.590 --> 05:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
presentation if there's any oh that's
 
05:31:09.110 --> 05:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
right we were doing a presentation
 
05:31:10.708 --> 05:31:10.718 align:start position:0%
so now that we kind of got the big
 
05:31:12.590 --> 05:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
picture I think right so again if
 
05:31:14.948 --> 05:31:14.958 align:start position:0%
anything if page 11 of our presentation
 
05:31:16.948 --> 05:31:16.958 align:start position:0%
is probably the most important before I
 
05:31:18.590 --> 05:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
I let Sue go through this I do want to
 
05:31:21.670 --> 05:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
add that we will will be asking for
 
05:31:23.910 --> 05:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
probably next week I guess a technical
 
05:31:27.070 --> 05:31:27.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment to the fishing game portion of
 
05:31:30.350 --> 05:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
the governor's uh pering consolidation
 
05:31:32.190 --> 05:31:32.200 align:start position:0%
uh just just to put give you a heads up
 
05:31:36.030 --> 05:31:36.040 align:start position:0%
on that okay yeah I think we're doing um
 
05:31:38.590 --> 05:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
Friday Friday
 
05:31:40.190 --> 05:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
we have House Bill too well we might
 
05:31:44.150 --> 05:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
have it other days too but yeah
 
05:31:46.750 --> 05:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
okay um Mr chair do you think it would
 
05:31:49.150 --> 05:31:49.160 align:start position:0%
be possible to have the fees that uh
 
05:31:52.788 --> 05:31:52.798 align:start position:0%
chair Wier requested for potential
 
05:31:57.110 --> 05:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
increases by Friday so just to uh make
 
05:31:58.150 --> 05:31:58.160 align:start position:0%
sure we understand the homework
 
05:32:01.110 --> 05:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
assignment so it would be areas where
 
05:32:03.230 --> 05:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
General funds could we could alleviate
 
05:32:04.830 --> 05:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
General funds with a fee increase does
 
05:32:08.110 --> 05:32:08.120 align:start position:0%
that sound right yes
 
05:32:09.670 --> 05:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
I think we can have that by You Want by
 
05:32:13.590 --> 05:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
One well no I I just whatever these guys
 
05:32:13.600 --> 05:32:15.430 align:start position:0%
One well no I I just whatever these guys
say

05:32:15.430 --> 05:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
say
 
05:32:19.430 --> 05:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
Okay um and and just so you know um
 
05:32:21.990 --> 05:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
before I forget I do have a few minor
 
05:32:24.430 --> 05:32:24.440 align:start position:0%
technical corrections I would like to
 
05:32:26.548 --> 05:32:26.558 align:start position:0%
present before this committee um
 
05:32:28.350 --> 05:32:28.360 align:start position:0%
sometime House Bill one things House
 
05:32:30.310 --> 05:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
Bill one things yes okay are they in the
 
05:32:33.590 --> 05:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
here or no uh no they're I I separated
 
05:32:33.600 --> 05:32:34.430 align:start position:0%
here or no uh no they're I I separated
them

05:32:34.430 --> 05:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:32:37.030 --> 05:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
out um because I wanted to talk about
 
05:32:40.590 --> 05:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
them and then give the LBA the I see the
 
05:32:43.150 --> 05:32:43.160 align:start position:0%
pages gotcha
 
05:32:45.910 --> 05:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
um to make it easier all right well why
 
05:32:48.750 --> 05:32:48.760 align:start position:0%
don't we finish page 11 and then then we
 
05:32:52.070 --> 05:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:52.080 --> 05:32:54.190 align:start position:0%
 
that

05:32:54.190 --> 05:32:54.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:32:56.868 --> 05:32:56.878 align:start position:0%
um essentially what I would like to do
 
05:33:00.510 --> 05:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
is kind of back up to page
 
05:33:09.470 --> 05:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:11.310 --> 05:33:11.320 align:start position:0%
I gave you
 
05:33:15.030 --> 05:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
ex um I just I know we have presented
 
05:33:17.070 --> 05:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
this pie chart before but I wanted to
 
05:33:19.788 --> 05:33:19.798 align:start position:0%
give you this pie chart as it stands
 
05:33:22.110 --> 05:33:22.120 align:start position:0%
using the governor's budget numbers
 
05:33:24.628 --> 05:33:24.638 align:start position:0%
because um with the addition of the $55
 
05:33:27.510 --> 05:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
million our our funding splits have
 
05:33:30.548 --> 05:33:30.558 align:start position:0%
changed um as you can see in this source
 
05:33:33.788 --> 05:33:33.798 align:start position:0%
of funds the two blue pieces of the pie
 
05:33:35.788 --> 05:33:35.798 align:start position:0%
represent our state revolving loan
 
05:33:37.948 --> 05:33:37.958 align:start position:0%
programs both the federal funds and the
 
05:33:40.708 --> 05:33:40.718 align:start position:0%
repayment funds together they add up to
 
05:33:44.430 --> 05:33:44.440 align:start position:0%
37% of our entire operating budget all
 
05:33:47.190 --> 05:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
other federal funds at 57 million
 
05:33:48.548 --> 05:33:48.558 align:start position:0%
account for
 
05:33:52.350 --> 05:33:52.360 align:start position:0%
14% all all of our other fee accounts
 
05:33:54.868 --> 05:33:54.878 align:start position:0%
other than srf fees and drinking water
 
05:33:57.868 --> 05:33:57.878 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust add up to another 78
 
05:34:00.708 --> 05:34:00.718 align:start position:0%
million or 20% of our operating budget
 
05:34:03.548 --> 05:34:03.558 align:start position:0%
the trust fund is sitting now at $86
 
05:34:06.750 --> 05:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
million or 22% of our operating budget
 
05:34:09.548 --> 05:34:09.558 align:start position:0%
with our general fund down to 7% of our
 
05:34:11.548 --> 05:34:11.558 align:start position:0%
operating budget so I just wanted you to
 
05:34:14.990 --> 05:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
see the mix of funds that we have um if
 
05:34:17.788 --> 05:34:17.798 align:start position:0%
you flip over to page um so the the
 
05:34:19.750 --> 05:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
drinking water groundwater trust funds
 
05:34:23.270 --> 05:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
this 86 million we expect that to be
 
05:34:26.670 --> 05:34:26.680 align:start position:0%
mostly a one-time payment in 55 million
 
05:34:28.350 --> 05:34:28.360 align:start position:0%
of it is that onetime thing it's
 
05:34:31.750 --> 05:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
normally you know $20 million and that's
 
05:34:33.948 --> 05:34:33.958 align:start position:0%
not going to be repeated or if it is we
 
05:34:36.670 --> 05:34:36.680 align:start position:0%
have no idea that it would yeah we we do
 
05:34:38.548 --> 05:34:38.558 align:start position:0%
not know how much additional settlement
 
05:34:41.510 --> 05:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
money we might receive great I think you
 
05:34:45.708 --> 05:34:45.718 align:start position:0%
anticipate more lawsuits though yes this
 
05:34:48.110 --> 05:34:48.120 align:start position:0%
is only part of that
 
05:34:52.390 --> 05:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
settlement okay um as far as uses of
 
05:34:54.590 --> 05:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
funds go
 
05:34:59.910 --> 05:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
um 74% of our budget for 26 um is is
 
05:35:02.230 --> 05:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
literally going out the door in the form
 
05:35:04.670 --> 05:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
of Grants reimbursement loans and
 
05:35:07.708 --> 05:35:07.718 align:start position:0%
contracts only those three little blue
 
05:35:10.548 --> 05:35:10.558 align:start position:0%
devices add up to the operating expenses
 
05:35:13.628 --> 05:35:13.638 align:start position:0%
that literally stay in house and even a
 
05:35:17.150 --> 05:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
portion of those um go to the other
 
05:35:20.948 --> 05:35:20.958 align:start position:0%
state agencies uh in the um for our
 
05:35:23.670 --> 05:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
budget so um just to give you an idea
 
05:35:26.030 --> 05:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
how much of our budget does not stay in
 
05:35:26.040 --> 05:35:27.628 align:start position:0%
how much of our budget does not stay in
house

05:35:27.628 --> 05:35:27.638 align:start position:0%
house
 
05:35:30.868 --> 05:35:30.878 align:start position:0%
um what I've done on the following
 
05:35:34.948 --> 05:35:34.958 align:start position:0%
slide um is just to break down an
 
05:35:39.750 --> 05:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
analysis comparing um our 26 and 27
 
05:35:43.110 --> 05:35:43.120 align:start position:0%
budgets versus against the Baseline of
 
05:35:49.230 --> 05:35:49.240 align:start position:0%
25 as you can see um our grants are down
 
05:35:54.190 --> 05:35:54.200 align:start position:0%
um by a million in 26 and 2 million 27
 
05:35:57.750 --> 05:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
loans have dropped significantly by $46
 
05:36:00.910 --> 05:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
million um reimbursements overall
 
05:36:02.868 --> 05:36:02.878 align:start position:0%
because we have a number of programs
 
05:36:04.628 --> 05:36:04.638 align:start position:0%
that do reimbursements went up
 
05:36:07.110 --> 05:36:07.120 align:start position:0%
significantly which is primarily the $50
 
05:36:07.120 --> 05:36:08.470 align:start position:0%
significantly which is primarily the $50
million

05:36:08.470 --> 05:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
million
 
05:36:12.830 --> 05:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
$55 million um for um the pest
 
05:36:15.110 --> 05:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
reimbursements offset by decreases in
 
05:36:18.830 --> 05:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
other programs so what you mean here is
 
05:36:20.350 --> 05:36:20.360 align:start position:0%
this would be money going to Water
 
05:36:23.510 --> 05:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
Systems who would put in past filters is
 
05:36:25.470 --> 05:36:25.480 align:start position:0%
that a
 
05:36:29.830 --> 05:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
reimbursement past remediation work okay
 
05:36:32.150 --> 05:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
okay so it could be a water system it
 
05:36:33.430 --> 05:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
could be a water system putting
 
05:36:36.548 --> 05:36:36.558 align:start position:0%
treatment on or given extending water
 
05:36:38.590 --> 05:36:38.600 align:start position:0%
pipes to some
 
05:36:41.190 --> 05:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
well I see
 
05:36:43.150 --> 05:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
gotcha um
 
05:36:47.470 --> 05:36:47.480 align:start position:0%
contracts um went from 25 to 26 went up
 
05:36:51.190 --> 05:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
about $2 million in um 26 and then
 
05:36:55.030 --> 05:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
dropped $5 million in 27 the difference
 
05:36:56.548 --> 05:36:56.558 align:start position:0%
is because we front loaded some
 
05:36:58.070 --> 05:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
contracts into
 
05:37:00.910 --> 05:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
26 salary and benefits went up
 
05:37:03.510 --> 05:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
approximately 3% per year which is about
 
05:37:06.990 --> 05:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
the average we have um then inter agency
 
05:37:10.430 --> 05:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
transfer stayed relatively flat inter
 
05:37:12.670 --> 05:37:12.680 align:start position:0%
agency transfers for us is the payments
 
05:37:14.910 --> 05:37:14.920 align:start position:0%
we make to administrative services for
 
05:37:17.670 --> 05:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
building rent um
 
05:37:23.190 --> 05:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
doit um for services T justice EAP those
 
05:37:26.590 --> 05:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
types of EX those types of cost okay so
 
05:37:28.708 --> 05:37:28.718 align:start position:0%
let's um as long as we're on salary and
 
05:37:31.750 --> 05:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
benefits here of these 500 employees how
 
05:37:33.390 --> 05:37:33.400 align:start position:0%
many are
 
05:37:38.350 --> 05:37:38.360 align:start position:0%
vacant we have 47 vacant full-time
 
05:37:42.708 --> 05:37:42.718 align:start position:0%
positions okay and um funded or unfunded
 
05:37:42.718 --> 05:37:45.628 align:start position:0%
positions okay and um funded or unfunded
funded

05:37:45.628 --> 05:37:45.638 align:start position:0%
funded
 
05:37:48.548 --> 05:37:48.558 align:start position:0%
okay and you're so you're but you're in
 
05:37:51.590 --> 05:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
a hiring freeze right so you're not
 
05:37:56.510 --> 05:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
yes corre yes yeah okay not actively
 
05:37:56.520 --> 05:38:04.548 align:start position:0%
yes corre yes yeah okay not actively
looking

05:38:04.548 --> 05:38:04.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:10.548 --> 05:38:10.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:13.070 --> 05:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
general which it might I guess you know
 
05:38:16.030 --> 05:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
on some cases anyway okay obviously to
 
05:38:18.110 --> 05:38:18.120 align:start position:0%
the extent we make large Cuts we'll do
 
05:38:20.070 --> 05:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
less with less right so that'll mean
 
05:38:22.070 --> 05:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
less services so I just you know state
 
05:38:23.270 --> 05:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
in the
 
05:38:23.280 --> 05:38:35.788 align:start position:0%
in the
obvious

05:38:35.788 --> 05:38:35.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:38.190 --> 05:38:38.200 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
05:38:40.390 --> 05:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
but the bottom line here is that you've
 
05:38:44.350 --> 05:38:44.360 align:start position:0%
re your percent change is minus
 
05:38:46.868 --> 05:38:46.878 align:start position:0%
18% on your page that you just went
 
05:38:49.310 --> 05:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
through here I mean so you've already
 
05:38:50.788 --> 05:38:50.798 align:start position:0%
done some
 
05:38:50.798 --> 05:38:52.670 align:start position:0%
done some
cutting

05:38:52.670 --> 05:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
cutting
 
05:38:56.270 --> 05:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
um yeah yes 27 is down over
 
05:38:59.548 --> 05:38:59.558 align:start position:0%
26 um if I was to go back to the
 
05:39:01.390 --> 05:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
presentation from the agency phase you
 
05:39:04.190 --> 05:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
would have seen a cut in both years um
 
05:39:06.788 --> 05:39:06.798 align:start position:0%
26 is actually showing an increase but
 
05:39:12.310 --> 05:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:12.320 --> 05:39:13.948 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:39:13.948 --> 05:39:13.958 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:39:16.750 --> 05:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
okay um I guess it would be interesting
 
05:39:19.670 --> 05:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
to us to have this kind of
 
05:39:24.390 --> 05:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
detail but on the general fund part
 
05:39:51.030 --> 05:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:51.040 --> 05:39:59.830 align:start position:0%
 
January

05:39:59.830 --> 05:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:04.310 --> 05:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
MH um we we do have some part-time staff
 
05:40:08.670 --> 05:40:08.680 align:start position:0%
not a great deal um it also fluctuates
 
05:40:13.150 --> 05:40:13.160 align:start position:0%
um to by you know vacancy rates as well
 
05:40:16.230 --> 05:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
yeah well you can yeah so representative
 
05:40:19.750 --> 05:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
Griffin has a has a
 
05:40:23.548 --> 05:40:23.558 align:start position:0%
request yeah I wonder if you could um
 
05:40:25.110 --> 05:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
get us a list
 
05:40:28.590 --> 05:40:28.600 align:start position:0%
of the uh federal funds that require
 
05:40:33.030 --> 05:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
matching funds yep and the source or
 
05:40:36.030 --> 05:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
possible sources of those matching funds
 
05:40:39.628 --> 05:40:39.638 align:start position:0%
MH and in other words if if uh matching
 
05:40:43.190 --> 05:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
funds could be paid by other revenues or
 
05:40:45.590 --> 05:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
agency revenues rather than
 
05:40:49.070 --> 05:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
General revenues general fund revenues
 
05:40:51.990 --> 05:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
yep I think it would be helpful to
 
05:41:03.390 --> 05:41:03.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:07.910 --> 05:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
you um on the next slide um it's
 
05:41:10.590 --> 05:41:10.600 align:start position:0%
we what I did was re um slice and dice
 
05:41:13.590 --> 05:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
the information just by sources of funds
 
05:41:17.910 --> 05:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
so using 25 is the Baseline um as you
 
05:41:21.868 --> 05:41:21.878 align:start position:0%
can see 26 General funds went up by 7.9
 
05:41:25.270 --> 05:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
million obviously that is nearly all of
 
05:41:27.868 --> 05:41:27.878 align:start position:0%
the majority of that is because we put
 
05:41:30.070 --> 05:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
state aid grants back on the budget yes
 
05:41:33.670 --> 05:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
yes okay um federal funds the srf
 
05:41:37.230 --> 05:41:37.240 align:start position:0%
programs um we lowered the funding from
 
05:41:38.750 --> 05:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
25 to
 
05:41:43.190 --> 05:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
26 um for the F srf what we did was kind
 
05:41:46.150 --> 05:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
of what I did was kind of right siiz the
 
05:41:49.670 --> 05:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
budget for 26 27 bringing it down we had
 
05:41:52.230 --> 05:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
received a lot of extra bill money in 24
 
05:41:56.548 --> 05:41:56.558 align:start position:0%
and 25 so I brought those budgets down
 
05:42:01.150 --> 05:42:01.160 align:start position:0%
um for 26 27 all other federal funds we
 
05:42:03.510 --> 05:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
is that because of the loan requests
 
05:42:08.110 --> 05:42:08.120 align:start position:0%
weren't as big is that what you mean or
 
05:42:10.750 --> 05:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
I was trying to adhere to what the
 
05:42:13.510 --> 05:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
governor asked us to do to rze the
 
05:42:16.230 --> 05:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
budget so I brought those down knowing
 
05:42:18.830 --> 05:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
that if
 
05:42:22.430 --> 05:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
we if we actually um end up spending
 
05:42:25.390 --> 05:42:25.400 align:start position:0%
higher than what we have budgeted we can
 
05:42:26.910 --> 05:42:26.920 align:start position:0%
go back in front of fiscal to ask for
 
05:42:30.230 --> 05:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
additional funds okay um um
 
05:42:33.310 --> 05:42:33.320 align:start position:0%
other Federal all other Federal programs
 
05:42:34.670 --> 05:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
had a small
 
05:42:40.708 --> 05:42:40.718 align:start position:0%
change um the srf fee count um it was
 
05:42:42.948 --> 05:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
basically we had a very small change we
 
05:42:46.350 --> 05:42:46.360 align:start position:0%
flatlined it pretty well the trust fund
 
05:42:49.948 --> 05:42:49.958 align:start position:0%
obviously saw a big spike in 26 and an
 
05:42:51.270 --> 05:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
offset in
 
05:42:55.548 --> 05:42:55.558 align:start position:0%
27 and all other of our fee accounts we
 
05:42:58.670 --> 05:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
took a reduction of $8 million each
 
05:43:03.150 --> 05:43:03.160 align:start position:0%
year and a lot of that is because of the
 
05:43:07.350 --> 05:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
mtbe program is that particular program
 
05:43:11.708 --> 05:43:11.718 align:start position:0%
is is ending its funding oh okay um I
 
05:43:13.670 --> 05:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
did as a matter of course on the next
 
05:43:17.070 --> 05:43:17.080 align:start position:0%
slide show you what the changes were
 
05:43:19.468 --> 05:43:19.478 align:start position:0%
from our agency phase to the governor's
 
05:43:21.430 --> 05:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
phase I thought that might be
 
05:43:24.270 --> 05:43:24.280 align:start position:0%
interesting information for
 
05:43:27.510 --> 05:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
you um as you can see we lowered some
 
05:43:31.468 --> 05:43:31.478 align:start position:0%
Grant lines primarily that was um in the
 
05:43:35.150 --> 05:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
the side grants we also lowered the the
 
05:43:37.830 --> 05:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
grants for the lake restoration
 
05:43:41.270 --> 05:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
program loans didn't change
 
05:43:43.350 --> 05:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
reimbursements obviously went up by the
 
05:43:43.360 --> 05:43:44.868 align:start position:0%
reimbursements obviously went up by the
55

05:43:44.868 --> 05:43:44.878 align:start position:0%
55
 
05:43:48.350 --> 05:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
million contracts and operating expenses
 
05:43:52.190 --> 05:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
changed slightly because um in the
 
05:43:55.430 --> 05:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
governor's phase we took the two new
 
05:43:58.708 --> 05:43:58.718 align:start position:0%
programs um from fishing game and Dancer
 
05:44:01.948 --> 05:44:01.958 align:start position:0%
we added those that also increased our
 
05:44:04.230 --> 05:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
salary and benefits because it was eight
 
05:44:07.708 --> 05:44:07.718 align:start position:0%
positions we were putting on um um and
 
05:44:10.948 --> 05:44:10.958 align:start position:0%
it also increased slightly inter agency
 
05:44:13.708 --> 05:44:13.718 align:start position:0%
transfers and you'll note the uh the air
 
05:44:16.110 --> 05:44:16.120 align:start position:0%
permit fee so we were in the time of
 
05:44:18.510 --> 05:44:18.520 align:start position:0%
surplus uh we were getting a general
 
05:44:21.230 --> 05:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
fund contribution so we didn't need to
 
05:44:23.430 --> 05:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
raise our the fees on air
 
05:44:26.948 --> 05:44:26.958 align:start position:0%
permitting uh the uh stationary sources
 
05:44:28.910 --> 05:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
in the State
 
05:44:32.270 --> 05:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
uh that's being removed and will you
 
05:44:34.750 --> 05:44:34.760 align:start position:0%
know that will go into the fee increases
 
05:44:36.830 --> 05:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
instead which sounds like it's in line
 
05:44:40.110 --> 05:44:40.120 align:start position:0%
with the questions ask
 
05:44:44.590 --> 05:44:44.600 align:start position:0%
right and on the next slide again this
 
05:44:47.390 --> 05:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
shows based on funding category it's the
 
05:44:49.190 --> 05:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
difference between the H andc phase and
 
05:44:52.750 --> 05:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
the governor's phase as you can see um
 
05:44:55.708 --> 05:44:55.718 align:start position:0%
we did another $2 million reduction in
 
05:44:59.468 --> 05:44:59.478 align:start position:0%
general funds overall our srf federal
 
05:45:02.270 --> 05:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
changed just slightly some of these very
 
05:45:05.150 --> 05:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
small dollars um changes occurred
 
05:45:07.468 --> 05:45:07.478 align:start position:0%
because um in the governor's phas
 
05:45:09.788 --> 05:45:09.798 align:start position:0%
there was a revamping of the benefit
 
05:45:13.110 --> 05:45:13.120 align:start position:0%
rates and this hit across all
 
05:45:18.070 --> 05:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
agencies um and we saw um and that's
 
05:45:19.910 --> 05:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
what the small dollars and other the
 
05:45:23.030 --> 05:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
trust obviously was rounding that's 55
 
05:45:26.510 --> 05:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
million we did move um between the
 
05:45:28.708 --> 05:45:28.718 align:start position:0%
agency and the governor's phase we did
 
05:45:31.868 --> 05:45:31.878 align:start position:0%
move one of our major programs from
 
05:45:34.590 --> 05:45:34.600 align:start position:0%
General funds to fees and that was the
 
05:45:37.788 --> 05:45:37.798 align:start position:0%
wetlands Administration program um we
 
05:45:39.590 --> 05:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
took that off the general fund entirely
 
05:45:44.948 --> 05:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:48.190 --> 05:45:48.200 align:start position:0%
fee um the commissioner has already gone
 
05:45:52.750 --> 05:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
over um this um the next the two slides
 
05:45:55.150 --> 05:45:55.160 align:start position:0%
one is the the overall changes that we
 
05:46:01.230 --> 05:46:01.240 align:start position:0%
have had um and then slide um slide 11
 
05:46:03.868 --> 05:46:03.878 align:start position:0%
was the we've already discussed which
 
05:46:07.310 --> 05:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
was the change in the state aid grants
 
05:46:10.670 --> 05:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
um I did hand out to Jack the few
 
05:46:13.230 --> 05:46:13.240 align:start position:0%
technical Corrections um we are asking
 
05:46:14.670 --> 05:46:14.680 align:start position:0%
for in this
 
05:46:20.070 --> 05:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
budget um one of them is our L is our
 
05:46:22.468 --> 05:46:22.478 align:start position:0%
account called River restoration dam
 
05:46:25.430 --> 05:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
removal we just were notified that we
 
05:46:28.868 --> 05:46:28.878 align:start position:0%
are getting some um grant money from
 
05:46:32.350 --> 05:46:32.360 align:start position:0%
charitable foundations to do um removal
 
05:46:35.468 --> 05:46:35.478 align:start position:0%
on the gonik dam and getting some Grant
 
05:46:39.430 --> 05:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
funds to do some stre Crossing fixtur um
 
05:46:45.030 --> 05:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
fixes so that we'd like to add about 233
 
05:46:48.230 --> 05:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
$236,000 a year for that program that
 
05:46:50.310 --> 05:46:50.320 align:start position:0%
none of that is General
 
05:46:54.468 --> 05:46:54.478 align:start position:0%
funds the second request is the lrm data
 
05:46:54.478 --> 05:46:55.310 align:start position:0%
funds the second request is the lrm data
check

05:46:55.310 --> 05:46:55.320 align:start position:0%
check
 
05:46:59.990 --> 05:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
tool as dncr talked to you earlier this
 
05:47:02.070 --> 05:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
afternoon about
 
05:47:05.868 --> 05:47:05.878 align:start position:0%
positions in the governor's budget there
 
05:47:08.510 --> 05:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
were four positions from dncr that was
 
05:47:10.990 --> 05:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
moved to our
 
05:47:14.430 --> 05:47:14.440 align:start position:0%
budget the way we um three of the
 
05:47:17.070 --> 05:47:17.080 align:start position:0%
original four positions that were sent
 
05:47:20.670 --> 05:47:20.680 align:start position:0%
to us we are sending back to dncr and we
 
05:47:24.430 --> 05:47:24.440 align:start position:0%
are getting one nobody wants them dncr
 
05:47:27.468 --> 05:47:27.478 align:start position:0%
wants them um okay and and dncr is
 
05:47:31.190 --> 05:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
sending us one position the net change
 
05:47:35.590 --> 05:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
to that account is a a reduction of
 
05:47:39.990 --> 05:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
$212,000 in in um 26 and
 
05:47:43.948 --> 05:47:43.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:47.350 --> 05:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
27 um and then my last request for a
 
05:47:50.510 --> 05:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
change is on the $55
 
05:47:53.390 --> 05:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
million um I forgot to ask the
 
05:47:55.230 --> 05:47:55.240 align:start position:0%
governor's office if they would kindly
 
05:47:57.830 --> 05:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
put a footnote on this one particular
 
05:48:00.270 --> 05:48:00.280 align:start position:0%
class line to make it the appropriation
 
05:48:02.628 --> 05:48:02.638 align:start position:0%
non laap for the
 
05:48:05.310 --> 05:48:05.320 align:start position:0%
bium we hope just we hope to disperse it
 
05:48:07.788 --> 05:48:07.798 align:start position:0%
all in 26 but in case we can't disperse
 
05:48:10.110 --> 05:48:10.120 align:start position:0%
it all in 26 I'd like to roll that class
 
05:48:10.120 --> 05:48:14.628 align:start position:0%
it all in 26 I'd like to roll that class
into

05:48:14.628 --> 05:48:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:18.350 --> 05:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
27 yes that is my number
 
05:48:20.590 --> 05:48:20.600 align:start position:0%
two yeah and as I mentioned we'll have
 
05:48:23.468 --> 05:48:23.478 align:start position:0%
an additional one if we'd like to do
 
05:48:25.830 --> 05:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
regarding the the governor's permitting
 
05:48:27.548 --> 05:48:27.558 align:start position:0%
consolidation similar to what we're
 
05:48:29.270 --> 05:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
doing with dmtr we have similar
 
05:48:31.628 --> 05:48:31.638 align:start position:0%
discussions going on with with fishing
 
05:48:33.990 --> 05:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
game uh and we should be able to do that
 
05:48:36.110 --> 05:48:36.120 align:start position:0%
early next week where right where would
 
05:48:39.310 --> 05:48:39.320 align:start position:0%
it lapse too if it's not a lapse per se
 
05:48:42.430 --> 05:48:42.440 align:start position:0%
it would roll into the fund it's not a
 
05:48:45.390 --> 05:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
lapse it's not a lapse lapse I didn't
 
05:48:48.230 --> 05:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
know what how exactly how to word it I
 
05:48:50.548 --> 05:48:50.558 align:start position:0%
just needed the appropriation not
 
05:48:54.150 --> 05:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
to expire at the end in June 30th
 
05:48:57.788 --> 05:48:57.798 align:start position:0%
26 yes it's just good for the banum if
 
05:49:00.150 --> 05:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
you have better language I would clearly
 
05:49:02.590 --> 05:49:02.600 align:start position:0%
take it don't SP it
 
05:49:05.030 --> 05:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
in6 yes
 
05:49:08.110 --> 05:49:08.120 align:start position:0%
yes I just didn't want to have to come
 
05:49:09.230 --> 05:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
back in
 
05:49:12.310 --> 05:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
27 because we do not know the exact date
 
05:49:15.270 --> 05:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
we will be receiving this money um I
 
05:49:18.350 --> 05:49:18.360 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure well what the
 
05:49:21.788 --> 05:49:21.798 align:start position:0%
what the restrictions are on this from
 
05:49:25.468 --> 05:49:25.478 align:start position:0%
the federal government and how we spend
 
05:49:28.468 --> 05:49:28.478 align:start position:0%
it we're talking the lawsuit so yes the
 
05:49:29.948 --> 05:49:29.958 align:start position:0%
laws the federal government's not
 
05:49:32.110 --> 05:49:32.120 align:start position:0%
involved with this so this is this is uh
 
05:49:34.070 --> 05:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
individual State and states and Water
 
05:49:37.788 --> 05:49:37.798 align:start position:0%
Systems have sued uh 3M and and Pont
 
05:49:39.750 --> 05:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
this is part of the a global settlement
 
05:49:42.510 --> 05:49:42.520 align:start position:0%
through the court so this I'm not sure I
 
05:49:44.270 --> 05:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
see any way the federal government does
 
05:49:47.670 --> 05:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
anything with but but then the court is
 
05:49:50.468 --> 05:49:50.478 align:start position:0%
there some settlement agreement yes yeah
 
05:49:52.788 --> 05:49:52.798 align:start position:0%
yes and that tells you how to spend it
 
05:49:56.230 --> 05:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
right so there's a complex formula of
 
05:49:58.230 --> 05:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
impacted Water Systems which is what
 
05:50:02.390 --> 05:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
staff and and doj orchestrated with them
 
05:50:05.110 --> 05:50:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh and the dispers it's being dispersed
 
05:50:08.590 --> 05:50:08.600 align:start position:0%
over in in in blocks over a time frame
 
05:50:10.948 --> 05:50:10.958 align:start position:0%
so it's it's and the money has yet to
 
05:50:13.430 --> 05:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
move so we're still not quite sure when
 
05:50:15.468 --> 05:50:15.478 align:start position:0%
and how it's going to get to us but I
 
05:50:17.510 --> 05:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
mean have those Water Systems already
 
05:50:20.510 --> 05:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
put in the equipment to solve the
 
05:50:23.230 --> 05:50:23.240 align:start position:0%
problem or is it were we giving them
 
05:50:25.310 --> 05:50:25.320 align:start position:0%
money ahead of time uh we're only giving
 
05:50:27.910 --> 05:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
money to those who expense had expenses
 
05:50:30.270 --> 05:50:30.280 align:start position:0%
related to remediating so so if that
 
05:50:33.868 --> 05:50:33.878 align:start position:0%
makes sense yeah so so some may not even
 
05:50:36.708 --> 05:50:36.718 align:start position:0%
know or or I guess everybody is testing
 
05:50:39.030 --> 05:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
right now so everybody knows we in the
 
05:50:42.270 --> 05:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
past year year and a half we've had to
 
05:50:45.350 --> 05:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
do all new rounds of testing with water
 
05:50:47.110 --> 05:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
systems more than you want to know
 
05:50:50.230 --> 05:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
probably but we proactively tested work
 
05:50:52.350 --> 05:50:52.360 align:start position:0%
with all the Water Systems to get this
 
05:50:54.510 --> 05:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
data because normally we're in our
 
05:50:56.590 --> 05:50:56.600 align:start position:0%
regulatory scheme we require certain
 
05:50:59.590 --> 05:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
testing and We Gather that the court and
 
05:51:01.948 --> 05:51:01.958 align:start position:0%
I think well meaning but they didn't
 
05:51:03.708 --> 05:51:03.718 align:start position:0%
quite understand how that's normally
 
05:51:06.110 --> 05:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
gathered want needed it in a different
 
05:51:08.150 --> 05:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
way and a different format so we had to
 
05:51:10.670 --> 05:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
do all new testing in order to gather
 
05:51:12.468 --> 05:51:12.478 align:start position:0%
all this data for all our water systems
 
05:51:15.110 --> 05:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
that have had even uh detections of
 
05:51:17.230 --> 05:51:17.240 align:start position:0%
pasas which was a huge amount of work by
 
05:51:19.708 --> 05:51:19.718 align:start position:0%
the way um I I don't know if I answered
 
05:51:21.270 --> 05:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
your question or confused well and some
 
05:51:23.510 --> 05:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
of it some of this money is going to go
 
05:51:26.750 --> 05:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
to people with individual Wells yes or
 
05:51:29.390 --> 05:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
no no this this particular settlement is
 
05:51:31.110 --> 05:51:31.120 align:start position:0%
just for Public Water Systems as
 
05:51:33.070 --> 05:51:33.080 align:start position:0%
representative Vil mentioned we are
 
05:51:35.390 --> 05:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
still in court and I think this will be
 
05:51:37.350 --> 05:51:37.360 align:start position:0%
years away with the Department of
 
05:51:42.150 --> 05:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
Justice on our actions in to address
 
05:51:44.468 --> 05:51:44.478 align:start position:0%
contamination for private Wells so
 
05:51:46.230 --> 05:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
that's still out there kind of sort of
 
05:51:48.788 --> 05:51:48.798 align:start position:0%
maybe someday this settlement is for
 
05:51:50.910 --> 05:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
Public Water Systems only because I've
 
05:51:54.468 --> 05:51:54.478 align:start position:0%
heard some people say they've gotten
 
05:51:57.750 --> 05:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
systems for their homes from uh from
 
05:51:59.788 --> 05:51:59.798 align:start position:0%
some kind of programs that you have yes
 
05:52:01.830 --> 05:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
there's multiple for for homes there's
 
05:52:05.750 --> 05:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
multiple two major programs so uh within
 
05:52:10.510 --> 05:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
the St Goan consent decree area it's
 
05:52:12.430 --> 05:52:12.440 align:start position:0%
incumbent upon stco Bain to provide
 
05:52:14.788 --> 05:52:14.798 align:start position:0%
those type of services or water lines
 
05:52:17.868 --> 05:52:17.878 align:start position:0%
outside that area we've provided uh with
 
05:52:19.510 --> 05:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
some of this past money we've talked
 
05:52:21.670 --> 05:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
about we've made available a rebate
 
05:52:23.868 --> 05:52:23.878 align:start position:0%
program where if your private private
 
05:52:25.948 --> 05:52:25.958 align:start position:0%
well has been contaminated you can get
 
05:52:28.548 --> 05:52:28.558 align:start position:0%
up to $5,000 to put a point of entry
 
05:52:31.270 --> 05:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
treatment in a home treatment system or
 
05:52:32.830 --> 05:52:32.840 align:start position:0%
if you're near enough to a water line
 
05:52:34.230 --> 05:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
where it makes sense will give you up to
 
05:52:37.030 --> 05:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
10 you can get up to $110,000 rebate
 
05:52:39.190 --> 05:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
to connect to that water water line so
 
05:52:40.788 --> 05:52:40.798 align:start position:0%
that's those are the two programs you're
 
05:52:43.350 --> 05:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
probably heard of and where did that
 
05:52:46.750 --> 05:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
money come from again the that money is
 
05:52:49.628 --> 05:52:49.638 align:start position:0%
a combination of uh general fund
 
05:52:52.468 --> 05:52:52.478 align:start position:0%
Appropriations from pass by inum uh
 
05:52:54.510 --> 05:52:54.520 align:start position:0%
again in the capital budget we were we
 
05:52:57.110 --> 05:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
we got uh bonding Authority for up to
 
05:53:00.230 --> 05:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
$50 million to address that uh there has
 
05:53:01.948 --> 05:53:01.958 align:start position:0%
been some drinking water groundwater
 
05:53:03.910 --> 05:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
trust fund money put into that as well
 
05:53:06.070 --> 05:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
so there's kind of a combination there I
 
05:53:06.080 --> 05:53:06.990 align:start position:0%
so there's kind of a combination there I
see

05:53:06.990 --> 05:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
see
 
05:53:09.948 --> 05:53:09.958 align:start position:0%
okay um and what about that includes
 
05:53:13.230 --> 05:53:13.240 align:start position:0%
testing too or no yes we we've covered
 
05:53:15.150 --> 05:53:15.160 align:start position:0%
some testing costs also but there's
 
05:53:16.510 --> 05:53:16.520 align:start position:0%
there's again there's a lot of putts of
 
05:53:20.350 --> 05:53:20.360 align:start position:0%
money is also and then not for actually
 
05:53:22.868 --> 05:53:22.878 align:start position:0%
it is now we have again this bill money
 
05:53:25.230 --> 05:53:25.240 align:start position:0%
I I talked about this huge influx of
 
05:53:27.350 --> 05:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
money for infrastructure that emerging
 
05:53:29.628 --> 05:53:29.638 align:start position:0%
contaminant monies it's technically a
 
05:53:31.468 --> 05:53:31.478 align:start position:0%
loan but you you can get a a loan if
 
05:53:33.310 --> 05:53:33.320 align:start position:0%
you're contaminated but you get
 
05:53:36.310 --> 05:53:36.320 align:start position:0%
100% forgiveness so it's a loan I guess
 
05:53:37.910 --> 05:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
but but anyways to me it's a grant but
 
05:53:40.070 --> 05:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
anyway so so there's funds on that too
 
05:53:41.628 --> 05:53:41.638 align:start position:0%
and we've been able to work with Senator
 
05:53:43.830 --> 05:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
Shaheen's office to get that to apply
 
05:53:45.948 --> 05:53:45.958 align:start position:0%
this last round to private Wells as well
 
05:53:48.590 --> 05:53:48.600 align:start position:0%
so that was we really pushed for that
 
05:53:49.948 --> 05:53:49.958 align:start position:0%
because we have so we have you know
 
05:53:51.468 --> 05:53:51.478 align:start position:0%
roughly half our population is on
 
05:53:53.270 --> 05:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
private Wells and we wanted to make sure
 
05:53:54.468 --> 05:53:54.478 align:start position:0%
we're taking care of them also I would
 
05:53:56.310 --> 05:53:56.320 align:start position:0%
assume very small fraction of them have
 
05:53:58.510 --> 05:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
ever tested right so I don't have those
 
05:54:00.750 --> 05:54:00.760 align:start position:0%
figures I don't know I mean probably
 
05:54:02.628 --> 05:54:02.638 align:start position:0%
they've tested for our but we have our
 
05:54:04.948 --> 05:54:04.958 align:start position:0%
whole program that we've been reaching
 
05:54:07.070 --> 05:54:07.080 align:start position:0%
out if we have if we have CA believe
 
05:54:09.190 --> 05:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
people are above the state standard
 
05:54:10.948 --> 05:54:10.958 align:start position:0%
we've proactively gone out we've done a
 
05:54:13.070 --> 05:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
lot of lot of testing over the years uh
 
05:54:15.990 --> 05:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
to the point where I'll brag on my staff
 
05:54:18.590 --> 05:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
a little bit if you look at we've seen
 
05:54:20.230 --> 05:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
maps of the country where testing has
 
05:54:22.548 --> 05:54:22.558 align:start position:0%
been done in some areas of the countries
 
05:54:24.670 --> 05:54:24.680 align:start position:0%
it's just spots here and there New
 
05:54:27.708 --> 05:54:27.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is basically filled in and
 
05:54:28.788 --> 05:54:28.798 align:start position:0%
we're literally more than the rest of
 
05:54:30.468 --> 05:54:30.478 align:start position:0%
the country combined so that's the
 
05:54:32.590 --> 05:54:32.600 align:start position:0%
amount of sampling we've done so I see
 
05:54:34.868 --> 05:54:34.878 align:start position:0%
okay representative Ms just a quick
 
05:54:36.830 --> 05:54:36.840 align:start position:0%
question on that um
 
05:54:39.670 --> 05:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
that 3M U settlement fund you you
 
05:54:42.150 --> 05:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned that it's uh intended
 
05:54:45.030 --> 05:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
primarily for publicly owned Water
 
05:54:48.590 --> 05:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
Systems does that mean a system owned by
 
05:54:51.670 --> 05:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
the town or city I mean in in the on the
 
05:54:54.750 --> 05:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
Sea Coast I mean our water system is
 
05:54:56.510 --> 05:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
privately owned it's a it's a company
 
05:54:58.390 --> 05:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
that owns it it's actually again this is
 
05:55:00.868 --> 05:55:00.878 align:start position:0%
an EPA definition so it's it's a water
 
05:55:02.788 --> 05:55:02.798 align:start position:0%
system that serves the public serves the
 
05:55:04.788 --> 05:55:04.798 align:start position:0%
public okay so it it could be actually
 
05:55:08.310 --> 05:55:08.320 align:start position:0%
it could be uh aquar your Dunkin Donuts
 
05:55:10.270 --> 05:55:10.280 align:start position:0%
for instance gotcha okay thank you but
 
05:55:12.948 --> 05:55:12.958 align:start position:0%
it also includes those
 
05:55:16.110 --> 05:55:16.120 align:start position:0%
also other questions represent LE I just
 
05:55:18.150 --> 05:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
had a question for you one of your
 
05:55:20.230 --> 05:55:20.240 align:start position:0%
questions was you wanted a better
 
05:55:23.350 --> 05:55:23.360 align:start position:0%
breakdown of the general fund use but I
 
05:55:25.110 --> 05:55:25.120 align:start position:0%
I don't think I get Jerry's correct for
 
05:55:27.390 --> 05:55:27.400 align:start position:0%
the minutes did you want a breakdown of
 
05:55:29.990 --> 05:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
General funds to get federal funds or
 
05:55:31.670 --> 05:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
matching funds was that party that's a
 
05:55:37.070 --> 05:55:37.080 align:start position:0%
secondary question yeah okay okay I just
 
05:55:40.070 --> 05:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I had that
 
05:55:46.430 --> 05:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:49.590 --> 05:55:49.600 align:start position:0%
thanks representative evil well just
 
05:55:52.628 --> 05:55:52.638 align:start position:0%
because we've had so many conversations
 
05:55:56.150 --> 05:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
I just want to go back to what your your
 
05:55:59.310 --> 05:55:59.320 align:start position:0%
beginning points were you've already cut
 
05:56:03.708 --> 05:56:03.718 align:start position:0%
General funds coming into this by 11% is
 
05:56:06.948 --> 05:56:06.958 align:start position:0%
that correct and then what you said was
 
05:56:08.628 --> 05:56:08.638 align:start position:0%
that when going through the governor's
 
05:56:11.310 --> 05:56:11.320 align:start position:0%
phase she added some money for the for
 
05:56:13.030 --> 05:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
the dams
 
05:56:16.190 --> 05:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
and was one of fishing game fishing game
 
05:56:19.788 --> 05:56:19.798 align:start position:0%
for the fishing game um how just how
 
05:56:23.548 --> 05:56:23.558 align:start position:0%
much for the dams I'm just curious um
 
05:56:26.750 --> 05:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
they gave us
 
05:56:26.760 --> 05:56:29.430 align:start position:0%
they gave us
um

05:56:29.430 --> 05:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:56:32.390 --> 05:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
approximately me it was 10 million in
 
05:56:35.590 --> 05:56:35.600 align:start position:0%
the capital get the exact number um in
 
05:56:39.150 --> 05:56:39.160 align:start position:0%
20 six they gave it
 
05:56:42.868 --> 05:56:42.878 align:start position:0%
68,000 and in 27 they gave us 670,000
 
05:56:46.708 --> 05:56:46.718 align:start position:0%
and that was in Le of a fee increase Yes
 
05:56:48.468 --> 05:56:48.478 align:start position:0%
And to clarify for representative
 
05:56:50.548 --> 05:56:50.558 align:start position:0%
leechman that the we're not talking the
 
05:56:52.190 --> 05:56:52.200 align:start position:0%
capital budget to repair dams we were
 
05:56:53.868 --> 05:56:53.878 align:start position:0%
talking the dam safety program to
 
05:56:56.390 --> 05:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
monitor in the operating budget but you
 
05:56:58.868 --> 05:56:58.878 align:start position:0%
just got 10 in the
 
05:57:01.670 --> 05:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
capital yeah the capital is repair these
 
05:57:03.788 --> 05:57:03.798 align:start position:0%
are for the folks that go out and
 
05:57:05.150 --> 05:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
inspect all
 
05:57:08.350 --> 05:57:08.360 align:start position:0%
days so the way I heard it is when you
 
05:57:11.708 --> 05:57:11.718 align:start position:0%
claim to cut General funds it's from the
 
05:57:15.708 --> 05:57:15.718 align:start position:0%
agency phase right to the governor's
 
05:57:19.590 --> 05:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
phase so so it's from what you wanted to
 
05:57:22.750 --> 05:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
what you got as opposed to from last
 
05:57:24.468 --> 05:57:24.478 align:start position:0%
year or from you
 
05:57:27.390 --> 05:57:27.400 align:start position:0%
know we were we were given a a set
 
05:57:29.548 --> 05:57:29.558 align:start position:0%
dollar amount in the in the for the
 
05:57:32.390 --> 05:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
agency phase and we brought our funding
 
05:57:35.548 --> 05:57:35.558 align:start position:0%
down to that level um and then we
 
05:57:37.350 --> 05:57:37.360 align:start position:0%
received an ADD additional reduction in
 
05:57:40.708 --> 05:57:40.718 align:start position:0%
the governor's pH right okay and then
 
05:57:43.030 --> 05:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
they gave us new things to do follow
 
05:57:45.230 --> 05:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
represent yeah the chair because I was
 
05:57:47.150 --> 05:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
looking at the same thing because under
 
05:57:51.548 --> 05:57:51.558 align:start position:0%
the um comparison on page 10 it shows a
 
05:57:55.350 --> 05:57:55.360 align:start position:0%
7% reduction in general funds but then
 
05:58:00.590 --> 05:58:00.600 align:start position:0%
over on page 11 it shows a 10% so I no
 
05:58:04.030 --> 05:58:04.040 align:start position:0%
you just said 11% to representative evil
 
05:58:07.070 --> 05:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
so just a little curious how those all
 
05:58:07.080 --> 05:58:09.788 align:start position:0%
so just a little curious how those all
work

05:58:09.788 --> 05:58:09.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:13.070 --> 05:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
together see on page 10 it talks about a
 
05:58:17.110 --> 05:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
7% change and then on the budget changes
 
05:58:22.830 --> 05:58:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:27.708 --> 05:58:27.718 align:start position:0%
10% all right um the agency agency phase
 
05:58:30.270 --> 05:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
right yeah
 
05:58:32.468 --> 05:58:32.478 align:start position:0%
um that
 
05:58:37.070 --> 05:58:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:43.070 --> 05:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
the table on page um 10 is the net
 
05:58:46.310 --> 05:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
number we what we did was we took this
 
05:58:48.548 --> 05:58:48.558 align:start position:0%
cut and then we were
 
05:58:51.070 --> 05:58:51.080 align:start position:0%
offset we took a cut on our
 
05:58:53.468 --> 05:58:53.478 align:start position:0%
Appropriations and then the governor
 
05:58:56.670 --> 05:58:56.680 align:start position:0%
then gave us back some money in terms of
 
05:59:00.350 --> 05:59:00.360 align:start position:0%
the um lrm Wildlife program and then
 
05:59:03.030 --> 05:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
additional funding for dam for the dams
 
05:59:06.150 --> 05:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
so you and then you went with her
 
05:59:08.310 --> 05:59:08.320 align:start position:0%
additions you went to seven yes corre
 
05:59:10.628 --> 05:59:10.638 align:start position:0%
okay right I didn't it wasn't that clear
 
05:59:12.590 --> 05:59:12.600 align:start position:0%
to me but I'm a little slow on the take
 
05:59:14.708 --> 05:59:14.718 align:start position:0%
up sometimes
 
05:59:19.070 --> 05:59:19.080 align:start position:0%
M all right I think it's four o'clock we
 
05:59:20.948 --> 05:59:20.958 align:start position:0%
should get some
 
05:59:23.548 --> 05:59:23.558 align:start position:0%
sleep yeah especially you Mr especially
 
05:59:26.230 --> 05:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
me y have a nice weekend and we're gonna
 
05:59:32.180 --> 05:59:32.190 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:32.190 --> 05:59:36.670 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

05:59:36.670 --> 05:59:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:40.190 --> 05:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
53 years I think we already did that a
 
05:59:41.430 --> 05:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
few weeks
 
05:59:48.868 --> 05:59:48.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:51.590 --> 05:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
you yeah we we we saw somebody else
 
05:59:55.310 --> 05:59:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:59.990 --> 06:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
chasing yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah a
