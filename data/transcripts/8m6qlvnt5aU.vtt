and I'm introducing Senate Bill
 
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
33 this bill will provide municipalities

restore historically accurate and
 
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
documented names to geographical
 
00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
features and sites it is entirely
 
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
enabling legisl ation i' like to speak
 
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 align:start position:0%
briefly as to um why this is necessary
 
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
and how naming is actually uh done in
 
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and in United States uh
 
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
naming is governed by the United States
 
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 align:start position:0%
Council on Geographic names Authority
 
00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
through its United States board on
 
00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
Geographic names they have the final say
 
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 align:start position:0%
each state has a representative to the
 
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
board for New Hampshire that's Ken
 
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 align:start position:0%
gallager and we have a New Hampshire
 
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 align:start position:0%
Geographic uh names
 
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
Authority now of course the municipality
 
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
can do some naming of streets and things
 
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
um but for any name to be officially
 
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
recognized and appear on maps it needs
 
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 align:start position:0%
to go to the
 
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
board I want to note that some naming
 
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
powers in New Hampshire are reserved to
 
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
the state legislature in statute
 
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
mountains and rivers that pass through
 
00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
more than one
 
00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
municipality are governed by separate
 
00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 align:start position:0%
state statutory Authority and this bill
 
00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:05.319 align:start position:0%
has no effect whatsoever on that
 
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
Authority well why do this um
 
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:10.280 align:start position:0%
increasingly there is an interest in
 
00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities and among Native American
 
00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
tribal groups in restoring historical
 
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 align:start position:0%
names and why do we need the
 
00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639 align:start position:0%
bill well in New Hampshire uh has no
 
00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:24.790 align:start position:0%
bill well in New Hampshire uh has no
federally

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
federally
 
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
recognized uh
 
00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 align:start position:0%
tribes uh if we had a federally
 
00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:31.960 align:start position:0%
recognized tribe the United States board
 
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
is required to consult with it so we do
 
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
need a process to ensure that Native
 
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
American tribal groups have the
 
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
authority to review and work with
 
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities who want to bring forward
 
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
proposals for
 
00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:51.759 align:start position:0%
names concern about this uh nationally
 
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
is growing uh it was raised in a very
 
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
influential article last week last year
 
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
in Indian Country uh news and I was on a
 
00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:02.759 align:start position:0%
call late last year um with national
 
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
Native American
 
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
leaders and I asked Raina theel who uh
 
00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.120 align:start position:0%
was the head of tribal government issues
 
00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
in a previous administration and
 
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
currently is the tribal liaison and
 
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
adviser for the Biden Administration
 
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
about you know what what to do in a
 
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
state that doesn't have federally
 
00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:21.479 align:start position:0%
recognized tribes and she felt there
 
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:23.960 align:start position:0%
really did need to be a state uh
 
00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
process I took the prepared uh Bill
 
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:28.360 align:start position:0%
language to the New Hampshire Commission
 
00:07:30.869 --> 00:07:30.879 align:start position:0%
on Native American American fairs and to
 
00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
others and attempted to address uh
 
00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
concerns during the Senate process based
 
00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:39.560 align:start position:0%
on their advice I did see the letter uh
 
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:42.680 align:start position:0%
yesterday which you received from uh the
 
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:45.560 align:start position:0%
commission on Native American Affairs uh
 
00:07:48.749 --> 00:07:48.759 align:start position:0%
raising a couple of uh remaining issues
 
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:53.720 align:start position:0%
and so um when I saw that letter um I I
 
00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
wrote an amendment uh which addresses
 
00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
completely addresses completely the
 
00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:01.240 align:start position:0%
concerns raised by inserting their
 
00:08:04.589 --> 00:08:04.599 align:start position:0%
proposed language into the bill now I
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
sent committee members a uh version of
 
00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
that revised bill um and maybe you have
 
00:08:13.589 --> 00:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
that but if you have the uh original
 
00:08:15.749 --> 00:08:15.759 align:start position:0%
language passed by the Senate and I I
 
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
should mention it came out of um the
 
00:08:19.629 --> 00:08:19.639 align:start position:0%
senate committee five to zero and then
 
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
23 to1 on the four of the of the Senate
 
00:08:24.869 --> 00:08:24.879 align:start position:0%
I'll just um you know if you have that
 
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
earlier version I will uh just make the
 
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:29.720 align:start position:0%
references to the Future changes that
 
00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:32.919 align:start position:0%
are there so the way the bill um works
 
00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:34.919 align:start position:0%
is first you'll see some findings which
 
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:37.320 align:start position:0%
basically repeats current language in
 
00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
statute around the establishment of the
 
00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
uh n Commission on Native American
 
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
Affairs um but it adds therefore the
 
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
general court finds that Native American
 
00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
place names are a rich Legacy that ought
 
00:08:52.389 --> 00:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
to be valued and visible and as such the
 
00:08:52.399 --> 00:08:54.790 align:start position:0%
to be valued and visible and as such the
general

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
court uh local and state initiatives to
 
00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
restore and assign and here's that key
 
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
phrase that the commission wanted
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
historically accurate and documented
 
00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:07.640 align:start position:0%
abnaki names to places and
 
00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
features um so then the bill read to US
 
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:13.720 align:start position:0%
senator we're all literate and on this
 
00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
committee I appreciate that and I
 
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
certainly know you
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
are um the next portion of the
 
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
bill um assigns authority to the Native
 
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
American to the commission Native
 
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
American Affairs uh to have the
 
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
authority to review the recommendations
 
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.389 align:start position:0%
authority to review the recommendations
for

00:09:31.389 --> 00:09:31.399 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh and um when requested
 
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
they might assist the
 
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:38.240 align:start position:0%
municipality in determining the
 
00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:39.800 align:start position:0%
historically accurate and documented
 
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
names um I put that um when requested
 
00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
there because the commission pointed out
 
00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:47.720 align:start position:0%
that it it really has no staff and it's
 
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
a volunteer commission so that it didn't
 
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
feel that it needed it should be um
 
00:09:55.509 --> 00:09:55.519 align:start position:0%
burdened with the necessity of doing all
 
00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
the research and so forth um they may
 
00:09:59.949 --> 00:09:59.959 align:start position:0%
decide to take some of that on but uh
 
00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:01.640 align:start position:0%
here it really is they have the
 
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
authority to review the research that
 
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
has been brought forward uh by um by
 
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
municipality and then you'll see U both
 
00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
for towns and for um cities uh the same
 
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
kind of language that if a town consults
 
00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:21.560 align:start position:0%
with the commission Native American
 
00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:23.519 align:start position:0%
Affairs and
 
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
informs other uh appropriate groups um
 
00:10:29.949 --> 00:10:29.959 align:start position:0%
such as historical resource
 
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
then there is a list of um Native
 
00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:35.720 align:start position:0%
American organizations uh consultation
 
00:10:37.949 --> 00:10:37.959 align:start position:0%
list that the the Hampshire division of
 
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:40.720 align:start position:0%
historical resources has and that those
 
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
everybody on that list ought to be
 
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
informed as well and uh the point of
 
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
that is that there are some groups that
 
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
may not at a given moment be represented
 
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:53.800 align:start position:0%
on the uh on on the commission and then
 
00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
um I think importantly in either case
 
00:10:59.430 --> 00:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
that any proposal uh for historically
 
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
accurate and documented abnaki names um
 
00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
needs to go to a vote needs to go to a
 
00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
vote of the town and uh then it can be
 
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
submitted um to the New Hampshire
 
00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
Geographic names Authority uh and then
 
00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:18.959 align:start position:0%
onward onward uh from there uh so it
 
00:11:20.629 --> 00:11:20.639 align:start position:0%
does it for both of the cities and the
 
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
and the towns and then um finally it
 
00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:27.519 align:start position:0%
makes it uh clear explicitly that this
 
00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:30.440 align:start position:0%
function uh is something for the um
 
00:11:33.949 --> 00:11:33.959 align:start position:0%
Geographic naming Authority in the State
 
00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
uh that they they do have this function
 
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
um to receive these requests and then to
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
pass them along um so uh as I said I'm
 
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
I'm very grateful to the guidance of the
 
00:11:48.629 --> 00:11:48.639 align:start position:0%
commission on Native American Affairs
 
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
and attempting to address every concern
 
00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:54.040 align:start position:0%
that they raised and grateful to the
 
00:11:56.629 --> 00:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
advice and support of of others whom
 
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:00.200 align:start position:0%
you'll be hearing from and uh I think
 
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
it's a good step for New Hampshire to
 
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
give this enabling legislation to the um
 
00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:08.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities to assert The Authority
 
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
that the uh commission has over the
 
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:12.680 align:start position:0%
process and I I really hope it' be a
 
00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
good educational opportunity to promote
 
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
interest in New Hampshire's history and
 
00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam
 
00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:21.240 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Senator are there any
 
00:12:26.189 --> 00:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
committee uh representative o looks like
 
00:12:31.389 --> 00:12:31.399 align:start position:0%
is trying to
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
L thank you uh Madam chair I probably
 
00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
should use the hand instead of the real
 
00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:40.120 align:start position:0%
hand uh but uh thank you and Senator
 
00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question uh I
 
00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:44.680 align:start position:0%
think members of this committee have
 
00:12:47.189 --> 00:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
been contacted by other members of the a
 
00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:51.240 align:start position:0%
abanaki tribe that may not uh seem so
 
00:12:54.509 --> 00:12:54.519 align:start position:0%
enthused with your support and coming
 
00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
from uh the transportation committee
 
00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
we've had similar circumstance ances
 
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
particularly with uh things such as uh
 
00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
license plates when uh veterans uh group
 
00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:09.959 align:start position:0%
organizations did not totally agree uh
 
00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:11.800 align:start position:0%
one and it's particularly shameful when
 
00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
we see stuff like that where it's
 
00:13:16.509 --> 00:13:16.519 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned one group comes up with
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
one particular concept and another group
 
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
does not agree and it seems like you get
 
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
to t uh Cat by the tail on this
 
00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:27.839 align:start position:0%
particular issue uh so uh are you
 
00:13:30.189 --> 00:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
Unified my question is directly are you
 
00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
unified in this front by the a abanaki
 
00:13:36.629 --> 00:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
nation on this particular issue well
 
00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question uh
 
00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
representative and um let me just say I
 
00:13:45.069 --> 00:13:45.079 align:start position:0%
never would uh suppose you know propose
 
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:47.480 align:start position:0%
to speak for Native American groups um
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
they speak for themselves I was very
 
00:13:53.629 --> 00:13:53.639 align:start position:0%
very deeply involved in the uh Bill to
 
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
establish the the uh commission Native
 
00:13:59.629 --> 00:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
American Affairs um I was was at the
 
00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire for decades
 
00:14:04.829 --> 00:14:04.839 align:start position:0%
the uh Native American Graves protection
 
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
repatriation act officer so I I've had
 
00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
um with with great respect a lot of uh
 
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
interaction with the uh Native uh
 
00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:17.839 align:start position:0%
community and um you know it is their it
 
00:14:21.389 --> 00:14:21.399 align:start position:0%
is their voice I would say that that I I
 
00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:25.160 align:start position:0%
listen very carefully and um I that's
 
00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
why I wrote the amendment because I I
 
00:14:28.829 --> 00:14:28.839 align:start position:0%
saw the letter that came from the
 
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
commission that raised the two issues
 
00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
about making sure historically accurate
 
00:14:37.749 --> 00:14:37.759 align:start position:0%
and documented and then wanting to Ure
 
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
that the commission had Authority here
 
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
and that proper information would be
 
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
given and potentially consultation with
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
any group may agree or disagree and um
 
00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:52.600 align:start position:0%
so I I think I wouldn't expect
 
00:14:55.949 --> 00:14:55.959 align:start position:0%
unanimity but I think that what the bill
 
00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
now does is it has explicitly addressed
 
00:15:01.749 --> 00:15:01.759 align:start position:0%
every issue that has been been raised
 
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
and um it's just an opportunity to make
 
00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
a process work I mean here it is and um
 
00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
it's a process it's enabling um some
 
00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities interested in doing this
 
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
and so um now we'd have a a process that
 
00:15:19.509 --> 00:15:19.519 align:start position:0%
would I think work for the the state but
 
00:15:22.269 --> 00:15:22.279 align:start position:0%
um again finally whether I've been
 
00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:24.680 align:start position:0%
entirely successful is is is not for me
 
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.430 align:start position:0%
entirely successful is is is not for me
to

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:26.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
say thank you Senator thank you Madam
 
00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
chair all right representative Roy thank
 
00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:34.120 align:start position:0%
you madam chair thank you for taking my
 
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
question Senator could you just um just
 
00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
because I'm really new to this bill and
 
00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
the concepts it proposes could you walk
 
00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:43.240 align:start position:0%
me through a a hypothetical scenario of
 
00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
this bill in action like what what
 
00:15:48.829 --> 00:15:48.839 align:start position:0%
someone would do what can you just help
 
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
me out with that what it would look like
 
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
oh sure and thanks for your question
 
00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
representative um so there's an awful
 
00:15:59.230 --> 00:15:59.240 align:start position:0%
lot of historical research search and
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
knowledge about Native American place
 
00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
names I mean certainly we've got some
 
00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
now don't we wnab basaki right coo River
 
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
and do um and you know our maps and our
 
00:16:12.509 --> 00:16:12.519 align:start position:0%
Landscapes uh reflect a lot of that a
 
00:16:14.309 --> 00:16:14.319 align:start position:0%
lot of that history but there are many
 
00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:17.480 align:start position:0%
other sites um that we we do uh have
 
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
have names for and um so a uh group May
 
00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
um be interested in a municipality uh
 
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
having done some research on place names
 
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
historically in the community and it may
 
00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
be that a Native American tribal group
 
00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:37.720 align:start position:0%
in a region is interested in working
 
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
with the community so um let's say it's
 
00:16:42.949 --> 00:16:42.959 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a it's a great geographic
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
feature A Gathering Place was an
 
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:49.880 align:start position:0%
encampment or um a spring or um a trail
 
00:16:51.949 --> 00:16:51.959 align:start position:0%
or other other feature that there is
 
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
documented so it would bring It Forward
 
00:16:57.189 --> 00:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
it do the research uh it would go to the
 
00:16:59.910 --> 00:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
Native American uh the commission Native
 
00:17:02.189 --> 00:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
American Affairs and say this is this is
 
00:17:05.309 --> 00:17:05.319 align:start position:0%
what we are interested in um we need you
 
00:17:08.029 --> 00:17:08.039 align:start position:0%
to review the research to ensure that
 
00:17:11.189 --> 00:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
this is historically documented um and
 
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
and accurate which is important um and
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh then it would go back to the town and
 
00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
the town would have to or municipality
 
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
would have to have a vote of the
 
00:17:23.789 --> 00:17:23.799 align:start position:0%
governing body that they wanted to do
 
00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
this um in in that process also other
 
00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
folks would be informed that the
 
00:17:32.789 --> 00:17:32.799 align:start position:0%
municipality was thinking about this and
 
00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:35.480 align:start position:0%
here is their research that informing
 
00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:38.840 align:start position:0%
could I think be handled through the um
 
00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
division of historical resources because
 
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
they are the liaison they have the the
 
00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
the contact list that they they already
 
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
work with on things like um you know if
 
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
there's a highway project and they find
 
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
a grave site or something so they they
 
00:17:53.549 --> 00:17:53.559 align:start position:0%
have they have that list already um and
 
00:17:56.149 --> 00:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
then if the town body votes to do this
 
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
it would be forwarded on to Ken
 
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:00.280 align:start position:0%
Gallagher um and then they they're the
 
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
body that when anything comes out of a
 
00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
state can put it on to the the national
 
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:08.440 align:start position:0%
board so I mean that's kind of how
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
things are done now we do some naming
 
00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:13.480 align:start position:0%
and renaming all the time and uh um this
 
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:15.880 align:start position:0%
is just developing a process that makes
 
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
sure that we get accurate names and that
 
00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
the Native American tribal groups in the
 
00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:23.080 align:start position:0%
commission you know have the appropriate
 
00:18:24.789 --> 00:18:24.799 align:start position:0%
authority over
 
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
it follow up thank you um that that a
 
00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:34.280 align:start position:0%
lot um quick follow-ups um first would
 
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh town be able to change a name to
 
00:18:39.789 --> 00:18:39.799 align:start position:0%
something with just the vote of a
 
00:18:41.669 --> 00:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
governing body without putting it to the
 
00:18:45.029 --> 00:18:45.039 align:start position:0%
voters and second of all is it would
 
00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
this enable towns to actually change
 
00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:49.480 align:start position:0%
their their name of the town or the city
 
00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:51.220 align:start position:0%
um through this
 
00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:54.029 align:start position:0%
um through this
[Music]

00:18:54.029 --> 00:18:54.039 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:18:57.149 --> 00:18:57.159 align:start position:0%
legislation well I
 
00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
you have just thank you representative
 
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
you have two parts to your um question
 
00:19:04.669 --> 00:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
I'm just kind of going back into the
 
00:19:10.029 --> 00:19:10.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:12.789 --> 00:19:12.799 align:start position:0%
um I have for the the town the
 
00:19:12.799 --> 00:19:14.990 align:start position:0%
um I have for the the town the
legislative

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
body so that's the town meeting
 
00:19:20.549 --> 00:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
right and then for the municipality I've
 
00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
got the governing
 
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
body because they don't have town
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
meeting it would be the select board um
 
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
and of course those process both have to
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
have you know fully public notice public
 
00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
hearing and so forth um in terms of
 
00:19:38.669 --> 00:19:38.679 align:start position:0%
renaming municipality I I don't have it
 
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
right in front of me but I think that
 
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
that would require I'm I'm quite sure
 
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
that require uh the a legislative act
 
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:49.240 align:start position:0%
the mountains rivers and I'm quite sure
 
00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:51.320 align:start position:0%
the the name of municipalities would
 
00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
require a legislative act and this this
 
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
bill does not um cover that you'll not
 
00:19:58.350 --> 00:19:58.360 align:start position:0%
the language of the bill says geog
 
00:19:59.950 --> 00:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
graphic features and
 
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
sites and uh that's different from a
 
00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:14.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
representa you're muted unmute yourself
 
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
please thank you good morning um we have
 
00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
a process now for this and I'm just
 
00:20:28.549 --> 00:20:28.559 align:start position:0%
wondering why what we what what's the
 
00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
Improvement that you seek to
 
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
gain well thank you for the excuse me
 
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank thank you for your question and um
 
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
the reason we need to have this is that
 
00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:43.720 align:start position:0%
yes there's a process now somebody can
 
00:20:46.909 --> 00:20:46.919 align:start position:0%
make a proposal to the United States
 
00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
board if they
 
00:20:53.149 --> 00:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
wish but such a proposal um would not
 
00:20:55.029 --> 00:20:55.039 align:start position:0%
really be looked upon as having come
 
00:20:57.029 --> 00:20:57.039 align:start position:0%
through a process in the state so it' be
 
00:20:58.710 --> 00:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
highly unlikely
 
00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:21:02.909 --> 00:21:02.919 align:start position:0%
accepted the real reason we need this
 
00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
though is that we are dealing with you
 
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
know culturally
 
00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
historical um issues that are of great
 
00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
importance to Native
 
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
people and so the state because we don't
 
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
have a federally recognized
 
00:21:22.269 --> 00:21:22.279 align:start position:0%
tribe um if we don't have a process like
 
00:21:23.909 --> 00:21:23.919 align:start position:0%
this we can't
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
ensure that we have historically
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
accurate in a document
 
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
proposals um nor can we ensure that the
 
00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate review by the commission and
 
00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
nor can we ensure that um there that the
 
00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:42.200 align:start position:0%
town you know the legislative process is
 
00:21:44.149 --> 00:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
respected in the town or the
 
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
city um
 
00:21:48.909 --> 00:21:48.919 align:start position:0%
and the uh so anyways I mean I think we
 
00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:51.400 align:start position:0%
really need the bill I I I I I I don't
 
00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
think it really is actually quite
 
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
possible to do this without the
 
00:21:59.149 --> 00:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
bill follow up follow up
 
00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
it um in terms of the uh historically
 
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
accurate and documented names uh I'm not
 
00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:13.240 align:start position:0%
aware of any successful attempt to do
 
00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
this um I know in my community there was
 
00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:18.559 align:start position:0%
an effort a few years ago to try to
 
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
change the spelling of the coico
 
00:22:25.549 --> 00:22:25.559 align:start position:0%
river uh and that did not succeed at the
 
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
federal level and I think in part
 
00:22:31.029 --> 00:22:31.039 align:start position:0%
because that was not a proposal that had
 
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
consultation thank you representative
 
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you madam chair good morning
 
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
Senator um I'm curious um if there
 
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
apparently appears to be some
 
00:22:56.669 --> 00:22:56.679 align:start position:0%
disagreement among um groups involved if
 
00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
00:23:01.789 --> 00:23:01.799 align:start position:0%
disagrees with name that's put forward
 
00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:04.600 align:start position:0%
by one group would they have I don't
 
00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:07.480 align:start position:0%
know if you'd call it veto
 
00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:10.360 align:start position:0%
power I believe that the language in the
 
00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
bill now essentially ensures
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
that because it puts that review
 
00:23:19.549 --> 00:23:19.559 align:start position:0%
Authority in the commission not anywhere
 
00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:23.480 align:start position:0%
else I also would say that I think that
 
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
the likelihood of any
 
00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
successful of any naming propos Al going
 
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
forward and up the chain that does not
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
have their approval has just no
 
00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:37.960 align:start position:0%
likelihood of
 
00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
succeeding for for all the reasons that
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
we would we would we would think um and
 
00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
as I said I I cannot speak for the
 
00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
commission or for any other tribal
 
00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
entities um what the bill does is the
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
the the language that was objectionable
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
to the commission I mean the the the
 
00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
additions that the commission found
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
necessary um are now in the bill
 
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
completely in the bill so that's the
 
00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
best I could
 
00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:13.240 align:start position:0%
do Senator that's if we adopt your
 
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment correct yes thank you yeah
 
00:24:19.149 --> 00:24:19.159 align:start position:0%
thanks for the correction M
 
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
chair okay represent
 
00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
lro thank you madam chair what may I ask
 
00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:26.559 align:start position:0%
what are the primary forms of
 
00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:28.559 align:start position:0%
documentation you use to ensure
 
00:24:28.559 --> 00:24:30.750 align:start position:0%
documentation you use to ensure
historical

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
historical
 
00:24:33.029 --> 00:24:33.039 align:start position:0%
accuracy I I know it must be a lot of
 
00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
different sources depending on the
 
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
situation but would you say the couple
 
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
of few that
 
00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:40.799 align:start position:0%
you well well thank thank you for your
 
00:24:43.149 --> 00:24:43.159 align:start position:0%
question um you know I love historical
 
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
research that's I spent my career uh
 
00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
doing and um you always have to evaluate
 
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
sources right I mean there are lots of
 
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
deed documents there are early
 
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
Maps um there are early uh treaty
 
00:24:59.070 --> 00:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
instruments um um there is there are
 
00:25:01.269 --> 00:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
Town histories there are many many
 
00:25:04.909 --> 00:25:04.919 align:start position:0%
places in which names might appear and
 
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
so with any
 
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
historical um valuation of those you you
 
00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:12.440 align:start position:0%
have to valuate um and I think that the
 
00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
importance here particularly of the the
 
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
review of the uh commission Native
 
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
American Affairs and others is that um
 
00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
spelling is really complicated uh you
 
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
know you've got you have English English
 
00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
language speakers who were trying to
 
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
transliterate what they were hearing
 
00:25:32.669 --> 00:25:32.679 align:start position:0%
from native people and um that's why the
 
00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
you know contemporary uh abnis really
 
00:25:39.269 --> 00:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
have the uh ability the best ability to
 
00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:41.720 align:start position:0%
determine what was what the actual word
 
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
is and what an appropriate um spelling
 
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
would be it's a process it's a process
 
00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:48.440 align:start position:0%
and and that's why it's important that
 
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
the commission of Native American
 
00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
Affairs uh be involved because they're
 
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
they're going to be able they're going
 
00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
to have the best um available resources
 
00:25:59.830 --> 00:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
uh to re review um what is being brought
 
00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:02.120 align:start position:0%
forward as a proposed um historically
 
00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
accurate and documented abnaki name
 
00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:05.830 align:start position:0%
accurate and documented abnaki name

I as co-sponsor of the bill I don't have
 
00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to ask questions today
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
so I've chosen to uh testify a little
 
00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:28.510 align:start position:0%
so I've chosen to uh testify a little
bit

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
bit
 
00:26:30.389 --> 00:26:30.399 align:start position:0%
uh and I want to thank Senator waters
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
for his long-standing efforts uh to
 
00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:37.039 align:start position:0%
advance the cause of the recognition and
 
00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
the honoring of the indigenous peoples
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh of our area um I I'm late Comer to uh
 
00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
this topic having uh had
 
00:26:54.669 --> 00:26:54.679 align:start position:0%
only semiconscious awareness of names uh
 
00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
around the area that clearly are not Ang
 
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
names um and the East Coast has a lot of
 
00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
state names that are clearly referenced
 
00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
uh know New York New Jersey and so forth
 
00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:09.919 align:start position:0%
reference uh European Heritage some
 
00:27:11.909 --> 00:27:11.919 align:start position:0%
names like Pennsylvania are constructed
 
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
names uh I come from the Midwest
 
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
originally where uh the names of states
 
00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:17.789 align:start position:0%
originally where uh the names of states
are

00:27:17.789 --> 00:27:17.799 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:27:21.549 --> 00:27:21.559 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly uh so-called Indian names
 
00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
as an 80-year-old I've used the wrong
 
00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
term all my life uh until learning of
 
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
course that
 
00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
the name Indian is completely
 
00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:32.360 align:start position:0%
inappropriate uh but the indigenous
 
00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
people of this area the abanaki have
 
00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
been here for something like 13,000
 
00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:40.600 align:start position:0%
years uh and they're still here they
 
00:27:42.389 --> 00:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
never went anywhere they were never
 
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
driven out like many um many of the
 
00:27:49.149 --> 00:27:49.159 align:start position:0%
Southern Coastal tribes uh they've been
 
00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
here all these all these thousands of
 
00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
years and they're still here uh and and
 
00:27:56.669 --> 00:27:56.679 align:start position:0%
and and I am fully in support of
 
00:27:59.590 --> 00:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
promoting and and fostering greater
 
00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:01.720 align:start position:0%
Consciousness on the part of our
 
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
citizens about uh the Heritage that we
 
00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
have the rich rich Heritage that we have
 
00:28:12.029 --> 00:28:12.039 align:start position:0%
uh wonderful names think of names like
 
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
pem jaset uh the marac itself uh is an
 
00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:20.440 align:start position:0%
uh is an indigenous name uh nasua is an
 
00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:23.480 align:start position:0%
indigenous name unlike names like Dover
 
00:28:25.509 --> 00:28:25.519 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth and so forth and I think
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
there is no attempt whatsoever ever on
 
00:28:29.789 --> 00:28:29.799 align:start position:0%
the part of any one reasonable and
 
00:28:33.389 --> 00:28:33.399 align:start position:0%
certainly no significant effort to to to
 
00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
abandon ex existing Town names uh but I
 
00:28:40.389 --> 00:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
think it's important that uh that names
 
00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
that have an indigenous background uh to
 
00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
the degree that they are attested and
 
00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:49.960 align:start position:0%
historic and authentic uh that to the
 
00:28:54.269 --> 00:28:54.279 align:start position:0%
degree that they are uh not yet used um
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
that it would be advantageous uh I'll
 
00:29:00.029 --> 00:29:00.039 align:start position:0%
just cite one example it's not a local
 
00:29:02.549 --> 00:29:02.559 align:start position:0%
example but uh Lake
 
00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
Superior uh I believe in the song of
 
00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:10.799 align:start position:0%
fawaa and uh the The Wreck of the Edmund
 
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald the name gugi is named uh and
 
00:29:17.549 --> 00:29:17.559 align:start position:0%
that is the original name and I think
 
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
that our children should be educated to
 
00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
learn the names uh of uh areas or towns
 
00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
lakes rivers whatever um and to the
 
00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:31.960 align:start position:0%
degree that uh that we uh discover uh
 
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
because I'm told that the original
 
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
settlers were very
 
00:29:39.909 --> 00:29:39.919 align:start position:0%
industrious uh in recording uh at least
 
00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
the best version they could come up with
 
00:29:44.909 --> 00:29:44.919 align:start position:0%
but Senator water's already talked about
 
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
trying to transl trying to transliterate
 
00:29:51.789 --> 00:29:51.799 align:start position:0%
a name which was not written down uh the
 
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:54.440 align:start position:0%
the abanaki were
 
00:29:56.509 --> 00:29:56.519 align:start position:0%
pre-literate uh and did not have a
 
00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
writing system so it was left to the
 
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
settlers to attempt to um you know to
 
00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:05.000 align:start position:0%
record a name but they were very
 
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
industrious in doing so and we have you
 
00:30:09.389 --> 00:30:09.399 align:start position:0%
know naragansett
 
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
and uh and kukuk uh and so forth names
 
00:30:17.789 --> 00:30:17.799 align:start position:0%
of rivers uh and and look and and
 
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
mountains to some degree I'm not in
 
00:30:22.149 --> 00:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
favor of
 
00:30:25.509 --> 00:30:25.519 align:start position:0%
naming uh geographical features and so
 
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
forth that don't have
 
00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:31.039 align:start position:0%
original uh indigenous names and
 
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be in favor of adding a name or
 
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
creating a name it has to be a
 
00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:38.120 align:start position:0%
historical name uh but there are some
 
00:30:41.549 --> 00:30:41.559 align:start position:0%
situations where U I've been told
 
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:44.240 align:start position:0%
something about the baker River uh that
 
00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
is a that is a a source of of uh
 
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
unhappiness on the part of the
 
00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
indigenous people that that name is
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
applied to the that River uh but
 
00:30:58.590 --> 00:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
basically I think that Senator Waters
 
00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
Bill uh which I'm proud to be a
 
00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor is a very good first step but
 
00:31:05.549 --> 00:31:05.559 align:start position:0%
it certainly has to be done within the
 
00:31:07.549 --> 00:31:07.559 align:start position:0%
existing structure there's a federal
 
00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
structure there's a state structure we
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
have the commission which is uh is
 
00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:16.360 align:start position:0%
active and very involved we have to be
 
00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:20.200 align:start position:0%
guided by uh by the council the
 
00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
knowledge the experience of the
 
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
indigenous people who are still here as
 
00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
I said and they're more of them we may
 
00:31:30.909 --> 00:31:30.919 align:start position:0%
be aware of many many New Hampshire
 
00:31:35.389 --> 00:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
natives have indigenous uh uh DNA in
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
their in their blood uh in their system
 
00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:42.559 align:start position:0%
and and there is an existing uh
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
mechanism so uh it may be that there's
 
00:31:47.789 --> 00:31:47.799 align:start position:0%
some aspects of the bill that need to be
 
00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
improved or whatever uh so I don't like
 
00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:54.200 align:start position:0%
the word renaming for example it we
 
00:31:56.029 --> 00:31:56.039 align:start position:0%
would be to the degree that it's
 
00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh uh
 
00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:01.919 align:start position:0%
restoring uh an indigenous name to some
 
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
kind of a geographical feature uh that's
 
00:32:09.509 --> 00:32:09.519 align:start position:0%
at and maybe uh uh there's a mountain
 
00:32:12.909 --> 00:32:12.919 align:start position:0%
so-called a big hill called Blue job uh
 
00:32:16.149 --> 00:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
north of Dover uh it may well have an
 
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
indigenous name and and that name should
 
00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:22.120 align:start position:0%
be displayed and recorded blue job would
 
00:32:25.629 --> 00:32:25.639 align:start position:0%
um would remain but but the S this our
 
00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
children should be aware of the fact
 
00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
when it is the case of an indigenous
 
00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
name so uh I won't take any questions
 
00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
because I have no expertise in this uh
 
00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:39.320 align:start position:0%
but I'm I I have an awareness and I'm a
 
00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
big supporter of the idea that we honor
 
00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
and support and recognize the tremendous
 
00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:48.760 align:start position:0%
contribution uh of the indigenous PE
 
00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
people to the state of New Hampshire and
 
00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
more than just names but names are an
 
00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
important very important aspect of this
 
00:32:58.750 --> 00:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
bill so with that I I'll end my
 
00:33:01.389 --> 00:33:01.399 align:start position:0%
testimony and look forward to working
 
00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
together with the committee and uh with
 
00:33:07.029 --> 00:33:07.039 align:start position:0%
the indigenous people who are uh on the
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
who are in attendance today and will'll
 
00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
will guide us in their testimony
 
00:33:12.629 --> 00:33:12.639 align:start position:0%
upcoming so thank you very much Madam
 
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative Schmidt I
 
00:33:24.629 --> 00:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
foran thank you very much Madam chair
 
00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
I'm Timothy Oregon from um Trafford
 
00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:31.919 align:start position:0%
County district 6 the towns of Durham
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
and Madbury um and I just since I signed
 
00:33:37.909 --> 00:33:37.919 align:start position:0%
on as responsibility I learned for
 
00:33:39.789 --> 00:33:39.799 align:start position:0%
example that the Oyster River which run
 
00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
through my community originally original
 
00:33:45.789 --> 00:33:45.799 align:start position:0%
name was shank C and it apparently um it
 
00:33:47.909 --> 00:33:47.919 align:start position:0%
apparently is the oy river is apparently
 
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
a translation of a chantastic means like
 
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
a river with many shellfish on it so
 
00:33:56.549 --> 00:33:56.559 align:start position:0%
there's um and representative Schmidt
 
00:33:58.509 --> 00:33:58.519 align:start position:0%
and especially Senator Waters have
 
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
covered a lot of the ground so I don't
 
00:34:04.029 --> 00:34:04.039 align:start position:0%
need to go on too long but um this bill
 
00:34:06.269 --> 00:34:06.279 align:start position:0%
does recognize that names are important
 
00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:09.320 align:start position:0%
and this will um this will create a
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
process whereby um new names that new
 
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
names that are based in the abanaki
 
00:34:18.109 --> 00:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
culture um will be historically accurate
 
00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
ones so we don't want to on the one hand
 
00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
we would like to have more abanaki names
 
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
to represent their um past and
 
00:34:27.869 --> 00:34:27.879 align:start position:0%
continuing in future cont ution to our
 
00:34:30.109 --> 00:34:30.119 align:start position:0%
community there are the stewards of the
 
00:34:33.149 --> 00:34:33.159 align:start position:0%
land that we all cherish so much um but
 
00:34:35.869 --> 00:34:35.879 align:start position:0%
also make sure that those are
 
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate and historically accurate
 
00:34:41.589 --> 00:34:41.599 align:start position:0%
names um so like there's a so just to
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
make sure we're not just arbitrarily
 
00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
making up making so on the one hand we
 
00:34:47.069 --> 00:34:47.079 align:start position:0%
want to have the real historically
 
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
accurate abanaki names in place but we
 
00:34:50.589 --> 00:34:50.599 align:start position:0%
also just don't want to make up fake
 
00:34:54.589 --> 00:34:54.599 align:start position:0%
names this doesn't uh affect any uh
 
00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
affect any existing names um although
 
00:34:58.990 --> 00:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
there is controversy over the baker
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
river which actually my uncle had a farm
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
was on the baker River so I'm like
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
shamed to say I do nothing of the uh
 
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
history of it that's um also doesn't
 
00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:11.720 align:start position:0%
affect uh Native uh Native American
 
00:35:14.829 --> 00:35:14.839 align:start position:0%
inspired place names which either aren't
 
00:35:16.589 --> 00:35:16.599 align:start position:0%
necessarily historically accurate like
 
00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:19.720 align:start position:0%
Shakur um so certainly Mount Shakur the
 
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
village of Shakur Lake Shakur the river
 
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
Shakur can all continue to be called
 
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
that even though there's no evidence
 
00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:27.839 align:start position:0%
that Shakur there's no hard evidence
 
00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:30.680 align:start position:0%
that Shakur actually existed or even um
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
things named after uh you know Indian
 
00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
Native Americans from tribes uh outside
 
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
the uh you know other than the abanaki
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
like Mount Duma which is uh the mountain
 
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
where the Waterfield Valley ski resort
 
00:35:47.829 --> 00:35:47.839 align:start position:0%
is for example is named after a famous
 
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
Shaunie Shaunie remember the Shaunie
 
00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
Nation so this is a this creates a so he
 
00:35:56.309 --> 00:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
this creates a process which makes sure
 
00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
we have you know appropriate and
 
00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:01.160 align:start position:0%
historically accurate names and um so I
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
think it may need some more tweaking I I
 
00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
I certainly um I I have a copy of
 
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
Senator water suggested amendments and
 
00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:09.839 align:start position:0%
that's something I think we should go
 
00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:13.720 align:start position:0%
for that would improve the bill and
 
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
um that's about all I have to that's I
 
00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
all about say say about it um I'm
 
00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:21.800 align:start position:0%
tempted to bring up the fact is separate
 
00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:24.760 align:start position:0%
paragraphs for both um
 
00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities for for both towns and
 
00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
cities but I guess I'll leave that out
 
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
that that was a bill that we debated on
 
00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:32.680 align:start position:0%
the floor last week which was didn't
 
00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
even go through your committee so that
 
00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
I'll leave that out of it so anyway I
 
00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
think this is a it's a matter of some
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
controversy but um I I'm uh glad I
 
00:36:44.349 --> 00:36:44.359 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored with co-spon and uh I hope
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
the even committee um doesn't move
 
00:36:49.109 --> 00:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
forward the bill we have raised
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
awareness of of an important issue so if
 
00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:53.480 align:start position:0%
you have to take any
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:58.069 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
forgan

00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
forgan
 
00:37:02.109 --> 00:37:02.119 align:start position:0%
seeing none I call Chief pce excuse me
 
00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
represent I have one quick question were
 
00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:06.200 align:start position:0%
you suggesting we should change the name
 
00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:07.400 align:start position:0%
of the baker
 
00:37:10.109 --> 00:37:10.119 align:start position:0%
River I uh I just said there's some
 
00:37:13.589 --> 00:37:13.599 align:start position:0%
controversy over that Baker was a uh
 
00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
well first of all he was from
 
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um but um he was a he was
 
00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
a leader of a band of uh you know a band
 
00:37:22.829 --> 00:37:22.839 align:start position:0%
of white people who killed a large
 
00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
number of native people back when we're
 
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
taking over New Hampshire so he's uh
 
00:37:29.309 --> 00:37:29.319 align:start position:0%
he'll probably he's an historical figure
 
00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:31.960 align:start position:0%
who in retrospect uh doesn't look quite
 
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599 align:start position:0%
as worthy of having a geographical
 
00:37:36.109 --> 00:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
feature named after him as as seemed the
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
case when the river was named um I uh I
 
00:37:43.109 --> 00:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
mean I didn't know I didn't know why
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
it's named The Baker River until just a
 
00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
few months ago myself and I've been uh
 
00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
visiting that uh visiting visiting that
 
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
River for you know over 50 years so I I
 
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
didn't know it so that's local that's
 
00:37:59.150 --> 00:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
something the people in grafting County
 
00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:01.880 align:start position:0%
will have to debate amongst themselves
 
00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:05.030 align:start position:0%
will have to debate amongst themselves
so

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:09.069 --> 00:38:09.079 align:start position:0%
yeah um Madam chairman uh if we could uh
 
00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:12.200 align:start position:0%
we'd like to allow Ken Gallagher from
 
00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:13.720 align:start position:0%
you know Department of strategic
 
00:38:16.309 --> 00:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
initiatives than he was the next person
 
00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
but if you prefer to be after him and
 
00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:20.680 align:start position:0%
then I would prefer that Kathleen Blake
 
00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
representing the Native American
 
00:38:24.309 --> 00:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
commission go after him and then we'll
 
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
follow if we could
 
00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:29.390 align:start position:0%
follow if we could
Mr

00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
00:38:33.109 --> 00:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
Gallagher yes uh thank you madam chair
 
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:36.200 align:start position:0%
um so yes I'm Ken gallager I am a
 
00:38:37.829 --> 00:38:37.839 align:start position:0%
principal planner at the office of
 
00:38:40.349 --> 00:38:40.359 align:start position:0%
strategic initiatives and among my other
 
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
duties I am the designated contact for
 
00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire with the federal board on
 
00:38:46.589 --> 00:38:46.599 align:start position:0%
Geographic names so I just thought it
 
00:38:48.349 --> 00:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
would be helpful if I describ to you the
 
00:38:51.309 --> 00:38:51.319 align:start position:0%
current process uh that we use um for
 
00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
proposing reviewing new Geographic names
 
00:38:57.069 --> 00:38:57.079 align:start position:0%
in the state um we are basically a
 
00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
reactive body at this point um I reive
 
00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
notice from the board on Geographic
 
00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
names for any proposals for new names in
 
00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
the state and I review those proposals
 
00:39:10.589 --> 00:39:10.599 align:start position:0%
with input from members of the Council
 
00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:13.640 align:start position:0%
on resources and development um which
 
00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
serves as the state's Geographic names
 
00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
Authority at this
 
00:39:20.069 --> 00:39:20.079 align:start position:0%
point um we do this review with cord
 
00:39:23.589 --> 00:39:23.599 align:start position:0%
normally um via blind copy emails we
 
00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
don't actually do it in our cord
 
00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.109 align:start position:0%
don't actually do it in our cord
meetings

00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
um each member of court is given time to
 
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
review the naming Proposal with
 
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
colleagues in their departments and
 
00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
that's usually about a six- week
 
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
period um I then review and summarize
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
the positions of the Departments and I
 
00:39:42.589 --> 00:39:42.599 align:start position:0%
send the resulting information to the
 
00:39:46.829 --> 00:39:46.839 align:start position:0%
BGN and um the board of geographic names
 
00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:49.400 align:start position:0%
will also have directly solicited
 
00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
responses from Municipal and County
 
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
governments and any other interested
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
parties um for any any of those
 
00:39:58.950 --> 00:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
particular um names that are proposed um
 
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
as Senator Waters noted the um board on
 
00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:04.520 align:start position:0%
Geographic names does not reach out to
 
00:40:06.349 --> 00:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
Native American groups in New Hampshire
 
00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:07.480 align:start position:0%
because there are no federally
 
00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
recognized tribes in the state so I have
 
00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
therefore on occasion consulted with
 
00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
members of the commission on Native
 
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
American Affairs on certain naming
 
00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:19.240 align:start position:0%
proposals and I am open to Consulting
 
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
with uh the commission on all naming
 
00:40:25.309 --> 00:40:25.319 align:start position:0%
proposals going forward um just for a
 
00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
little history since 2007 um when I
 
00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
became the geographic names contact we
 
00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
have only reviewed 24 naming proposals
 
00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
so a little around two a year and um in
 
00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:41.720 align:start position:0%
addition to that I've corresponded with
 
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
about the same number of members of the
 
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
public on Geographic names that did not
 
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
go forward to a proposal so that's
 
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
that's just the background on the
 
00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
current uh state of how we do things
 
00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
with the names and I'll be happy to take
 
00:40:55.309 --> 00:40:55.319 align:start position:0%
any questions thank
 
00:40:55.319 --> 00:40:58.470 align:start position:0%
any questions thank
you

00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:01.150 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:01.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:03.720 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you madam chair uh good
 
00:41:08.109 --> 00:41:08.119 align:start position:0%
morning Mr Gallagher um I'm curious um
 
00:41:10.349 --> 00:41:10.359 align:start position:0%
it seems that there would be
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
instances where for example differing
 
00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
tribes would prefer different names for
 
00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
the same
 
00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
places um how would an instance like
 
00:41:22.589 --> 00:41:22.599 align:start position:0%
that be
 
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
resolved well really the the the status
 
00:41:30.349 --> 00:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
of our board is not to make a decision
 
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
at this point anyway um we're not we're
 
00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:35.640 align:start position:0%
not sending proposals of Our Own in now
 
00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:37.400 align:start position:0%
that that will change if this bill is
 
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
passed we could certainly do that and
 
00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
other states do that but at the moment
 
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
we are simply One Voice among many um uh
 
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
sending our comments back to the board
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
on Geographic names so for instance if
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
there is disagreement and we're able to
 
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
identify that there's different groups
 
00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:55.960 align:start position:0%
with different you know different um you
 
00:41:59.630 --> 00:41:59.640 align:start position:0%
know perspectives we would send all that
 
00:42:03.069 --> 00:42:03.079 align:start position:0%
information in to the federal board um
 
00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:05.599 align:start position:0%
and there may we you know we may as a
 
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
group have have a particular sense of
 
00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
what we want to do but we we do send in
 
00:42:14.109 --> 00:42:14.119 align:start position:0%
all of the um dissenting information as
 
00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:18.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:20.440 align:start position:0%
ourselves thank
 
00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
you all
 
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.160 align:start position:0%

uh late yesterday afternoon by Senator
 
00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
Waters um at because I I have
 
00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:15.040 align:start position:0%

planning on their part all but two of us
 
00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:21.870 align:start position:0%
planning on their part all but two of us
are

00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:21.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:43:25.549 --> 00:43:25.559 align:start position:0%
employed uh and I must have a 24hour
 
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
meeting notice um sent out I could not
 
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
speak with my members of my commission
 
00:43:36.589 --> 00:43:36.599 align:start position:0%
um because there was not time so the
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
statement that I submitted yesterday on
 
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
behalf of the commission remains Our
 
00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
advice and um despite the the the um
 
00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
amendment that has been submitted so I
 
00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:55.720 align:start position:0%
couldn't meet with them um however I I
 
00:43:58.109 --> 00:43:58.119 align:start position:0%
would like to make um a couple of
 
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
remarks as an individual and a resident
 
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
of New
 
00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:05.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I personally still have
 
00:44:08.829 --> 00:44:08.839 align:start position:0%
serious concerns about this bill and I
 
00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
went through the language carefully of
 
00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:13.640 align:start position:0%
the Amendments and here are some
 
00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
examples of things that concern me it
 
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
the phrase May recommend the naming or
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
raming is not the same language language
 
00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
as to restore the actual traditional
 
00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
abanaki word for that
 
00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
location um the word review to me means
 
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
that I might read something look at it
 
00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
um it does not say to me that I may have
 
00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:44.920 align:start position:0%
input on upon it in any way or to render
 
00:44:48.829 --> 00:44:48.839 align:start position:0%
an opinion review is doesn't say that to
 
00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
me perhaps that's my lack of knowledge
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
about the law I don't know the words and
 
00:44:59.190 --> 00:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
May when requested are concerning
 
00:45:03.309 --> 00:45:03.319 align:start position:0%
because um if there is no request from
 
00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
during that process then there's no
 
00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:10.079 align:start position:0%
input um The Words the town shall inform
 
00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:12.920 align:start position:0%
the commission just means to me what it
 
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
says they'll tell us that does not say
 
00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
to me and you have um the ability to do
 
00:45:22.829 --> 00:45:22.839 align:start position:0%
anything with that um
 
00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:26.200 align:start position:0%
knowledge I also am concerned about the
 
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
13 tribes bands and organizations that
 
00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
are listed on the contact list and
 
00:45:36.069 --> 00:45:36.079 align:start position:0%
giving all of them all of us an
 
00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have input um whether
 
00:45:43.549 --> 00:45:43.559 align:start position:0%
each band chooses to have input or not
 
00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
is irrelevant they should still be given
 
00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
the opportunity no one band has any more
 
00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
right to say um their opinion than any
 
00:45:56.069 --> 00:45:56.079 align:start position:0%
other so I think it's really important
 
00:45:58.910 --> 00:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
that all of the local peoples have the
 
00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:02.720 align:start position:0%
ability to um make statements and and
 
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
have input the original names of the
 
00:46:08.309 --> 00:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
places in New Hampshire um that were
 
00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:10.760 align:start position:0%
used and shared by the first people of
 
00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:14.440 align:start position:0%
this land are important to to all of us
 
00:46:17.069 --> 00:46:17.079 align:start position:0%
they are still used in many locations as
 
00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
people have pointed out despite the fact
 
00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
much of the history of the people who
 
00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:24.920 align:start position:0%
have called this place home for many
 
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
millennia has been falsely created to
 
00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:29.640 align:start position:0%
represent the narratives that the
 
00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
writers wished to project in legislative
 
00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
hearings and I see many of you um the
 
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
same the same people that I've seen and
 
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
met before I I've heard some of these
 
00:46:46.109 --> 00:46:46.119 align:start position:0%
um these erroneous Concepts listed as
 
00:46:48.589 --> 00:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
fact you know indigenous people never
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
lived here for
 
00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
example so we can do better and and we
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
really must do better my personal
 
00:46:59.309 --> 00:46:59.319 align:start position:0%
objection to this bill is not about the
 
00:47:03.309 --> 00:47:03.319 align:start position:0%
concept of it per se the restoration of
 
00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
many original indigenous names is not as
 
00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:09.160 align:start position:0%
difficult as it might sound many Town
 
00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
histories include the original place
 
00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
names of their communities there have
 
00:47:16.589 --> 00:47:16.599 align:start position:0%
been books written that detail um what
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
the original names were so that there is
 
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
a lot that is known and what is not
 
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
known in my opinion should not be
 
00:47:28.829 --> 00:47:28.839 align:start position:0%
created that merely adds more false
 
00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
history into the mix and we have been
 
00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
working very hard to to bring to light
 
00:47:37.309 --> 00:47:37.319 align:start position:0%
the actual real history of this place
 
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
and don't need any more challenges um
 
00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:40.990 align:start position:0%
and don't need any more challenges um
for

00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:45.640 align:start position:0%
that the so the creation of names even
 
00:47:48.349 --> 00:47:48.359 align:start position:0%
if they are in the abanaki
 
00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:51.720 align:start position:0%
language makes a problem in that
 
00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:54.280 align:start position:0%
regard uh it continues to muddy the
 
00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
Waters of the sad history of our First
 
00:47:59.589 --> 00:47:59.599 align:start position:0%
Citizens and the truth needs to be told
 
00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
it's very important truth
 
00:48:04.349 --> 00:48:04.359 align:start position:0%
matters I I will answer any questions
 
00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.240 align:start position:0%

lived here I'd like to listen to that it
 
00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:25.880 align:start position:0%

00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:05.160 align:start position:0%

of the kak band of the Penacook abnaki
 
00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
people there's a lot of confusion about
 
00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
um tribal identities and tribal status
 
00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:52.640 align:start position:0%
within States in 1994 our tribe uh filed
 
00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
a petition with the Bureau of Indian
 
00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
Affairs uh uh and it was put in the
 
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
Federal Register on April 6th 1995
 
00:50:05.069 --> 00:50:05.079 align:start position:0%
volume 6 number page 66 uh number 66
 
00:50:05.079 --> 00:50:06.789 align:start position:0%
volume 6 number page 66 uh number 66
page

00:50:06.789 --> 00:50:06.799 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
17614 the Bia has assigned us the number
 
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
151 our petition is still pending and
 
00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:15.720 align:start position:0%
it's operational all tribes of petition
 
00:50:18.829 --> 00:50:18.839 align:start position:0%
are protected under USC title 25 which
 
00:50:20.789 --> 00:50:20.799 align:start position:0%
is Indian law whether you are federally
 
00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:23.240 align:start position:0%
recognized state recognized unrecognized
 
00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
or never even
 
00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
petitioned hence because of our petition
 
00:50:29.829 --> 00:50:29.839 align:start position:0%
filing we're considered Consultants on
 
00:50:32.349 --> 00:50:32.359 align:start position:0%
all matters whether we're federal or not
 
00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
federal regulations cfrs usually only
 
00:50:37.870 --> 00:50:37.880 align:start position:0%
apply to Federal tribes and not state or
 
00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
other categories of tribes over half of
 
00:50:42.829 --> 00:50:42.839 align:start position:0%
the tribal communities in our country
 
00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
are unrecognized only 574 actually are
 
00:50:48.670 --> 00:50:48.680 align:start position:0%
and there's at least 600 that fit in the
 
00:50:52.349 --> 00:50:52.359 align:start position:0%
other categories so keeping to use these
 
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
phrases there's no tribe here we are on
 
00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
record with the Secretary of State in
 
00:50:58.270 --> 00:50:58.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and the attorney general
 
00:51:00.309 --> 00:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
and the Bia knows where headquarters is
 
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
so let's just put the rest that there's
 
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
no tribe or no indigenous people living
 
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
here what um we've heard today is quite
 
00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:09.720 align:start position:0%
interesting because we've been working
 
00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
with strategic initiatives and the US
 
00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:15.400 align:start position:0%
Geological Survey you know the mapping
 
00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:18.280 align:start position:0%
people for decades since the 90s and
 
00:51:20.349 --> 00:51:20.359 align:start position:0%
these issues come up all the time about
 
00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
geographical place names many of them uh
 
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
go back to the Algonquin language
 
00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
especially in New England abnaki was a
 
00:51:30.109 --> 00:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
prevalent language and a language is a
 
00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
root word language so every place name
 
00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
you see there's a root word in there
 
00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
that actually physically describes
 
00:51:39.309 --> 00:51:39.319 align:start position:0%
location or what was done there I can
 
00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:41.720 align:start position:0%
give you many many examples of how this
 
00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:43.640 align:start position:0%
works but there are constructs that say
 
00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
it's a a river feature or a mountain
 
00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
feature or an occupation feature or a
 
00:51:49.589 --> 00:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
feature where we did something in
 
00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
particular so when we look at place
 
00:51:54.630 --> 00:51:54.640 align:start position:0%
names like garik which got shortened it
 
00:51:57.390 --> 00:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
actually was Maman which meant a place
 
00:52:00.910 --> 00:52:00.920 align:start position:0%
where we spear fish salmon just like uh
 
00:52:04.069 --> 00:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
Manchester is now show signs of amisk it
 
00:52:06.549 --> 00:52:06.559 align:start position:0%
was neisig meaning a place where we fish
 
00:52:09.390 --> 00:52:09.400 align:start position:0%
for fish we have no intentions of saying
 
00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
Manchester has to roll back to that old
 
00:52:13.069 --> 00:52:13.079 align:start position:0%
name but there are already high highway
 
00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
signs that identify that old pass so
 
00:52:17.589 --> 00:52:17.599 align:start position:0%
we're quite content with that we've been
 
00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
working with Ken gallaga uh since he's
 
00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
been in that office and we've pushed
 
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
back on on on inappropriate
 
00:52:26.589 --> 00:52:26.599 align:start position:0%
inappropriate things like there was an
 
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
effort in holderness to name part of uh
 
00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
sarm Lake pahas squ squar Cove to call
 
00:52:36.030 --> 00:52:36.040 align:start position:0%
it Pocahontas Cove well Holiness didn't
 
00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
want that tribal people didn't want it
 
00:52:40.750 --> 00:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
we brought that to the commission and
 
00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:43.880 align:start position:0%
they voted not to accept it so Ken and
 
00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
us and all these agencies all worked in
 
00:52:49.309 --> 00:52:49.319 align:start position:0%
Partnership already um all we can see
 
00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
that this bill would codify what he
 
00:52:54.750 --> 00:52:54.760 align:start position:0%
actually does dayto day and like Ken
 
00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
said I I've dealt with this issue for
 
00:52:59.950 --> 00:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
over 20 years I and just like him I say
 
00:53:01.950 --> 00:53:01.960 align:start position:0%
it's a very small number of communities
 
00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
that want to change things I give you a
 
00:53:06.190 --> 00:53:06.200 align:start position:0%
case in point Warren New Hampshire got
 
00:53:08.109 --> 00:53:08.119 align:start position:0%
into this controversy about Baker River
 
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
and Indigenous groups really want to
 
00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:13.880 align:start position:0%
change that well Warren on its Municipal
 
00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
level already voted not to change it so
 
00:53:18.549 --> 00:53:18.559 align:start position:0%
that's dead it doesn't get to can at
 
00:53:19.789 --> 00:53:19.799 align:start position:0%
this point because you don't have the
 
00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
municipal support so that's being said
 
00:53:25.349 --> 00:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
it's fine uh we are constantly being
 
00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:26.680 align:start position:0%
asked to change the names of the
 
00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
president range we know this is a major
 
00:53:32.750 --> 00:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
issue with the US Geological Survey so
 
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
this process to change Mountain names or
 
00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
to name unnamed features in the White
 
00:53:39.549 --> 00:53:39.559 align:start position:0%
Mountains the presidential range is a
 
00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
bigger and bigger thing and quite
 
00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
frankly the abnaki do not have names for
 
00:53:46.270 --> 00:53:46.280 align:start position:0%
many of these features let me just tell
 
00:53:48.549 --> 00:53:48.559 align:start position:0%
you what we do have we've been we have

00:53:57.549 --> 00:53:57.559 align:start position:0%
we have records back to the
 
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
1700s several of your towns already have
 
00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
these narratives of what the place names
 
00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
were called we've taken all these
 
00:54:06.789 --> 00:54:06.799 align:start position:0%
resources and we have with the Fiscal
 
00:54:11.109 --> 00:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
Agent for incc which stands for uh
 
00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
indigenous New Hampshire Collective
 
00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:15.160 align:start position:0%
collaborative we started this with a lot
 
00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
of alumni and uh exh professors at UNH
 
00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
and historians and other interested
 
00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
parties archaeologists anthropologists
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
and others we have an public domain
 
00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
right now an OJs map it's an interactive
 
00:54:31.789 --> 00:54:31.799 align:start position:0%
map we already have all the trails ABI
 
00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
Trails already digitized on this map and
 
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
what did we find they all follow our
 
00:54:39.829 --> 00:54:39.839 align:start position:0%
highways and our riverways and they also
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
lead to each one of the villages where
 
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
we had a place so this this data is
 
00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
already in there not to mention the fact
 
00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
the department of historical resources
 
00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
already did the same thing we
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
independently because of copyright
 
00:54:54.549 --> 00:54:54.559 align:start position:0%
issues we independently recreated these
 
00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
trail map app s they were originally
 
00:55:00.109 --> 00:55:00.119 align:start position:0%
identified in 1950 by a guy named
 
00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:03.400 align:start position:0%
Chester price who was one of the leading
 
00:55:05.309 --> 00:55:05.319 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire archaeologists who did
 
00:55:07.789 --> 00:55:07.799 align:start position:0%
a lot of research back in the day we
 
00:55:10.030 --> 00:55:10.040 align:start position:0%
validated and vetted almost all of his
 
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
work and right now we're looking at
 
00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:14.720 align:start position:0%
records back to the 1700s from numerous
 
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
records including other tribal records
 
00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
oral traditions and we have a layer
 
00:55:23.069 --> 00:55:23.079 align:start position:0%
that's called um a sites Village sites
 
00:55:25.829 --> 00:55:25.839 align:start position:0%
place name features and what we found
 
00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:27.880 align:start position:0%
with this is uh we're going to roll this
 
00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
out very soon any town could just go in
 
00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
there and look what happened in your
 
00:55:34.190 --> 00:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
location the only problem we're dealing
 
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
with right now there's so much data in
 
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
this map we have to figure out how it
 
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
can be actually used uh you know in
 
00:55:43.349 --> 00:55:43.359 align:start position:0%
research with people it it's it's
 
00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:45.160 align:start position:0%
daunting because there are so many
 
00:55:47.349 --> 00:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
features in the state that are named by
 
00:55:51.029 --> 00:55:51.039 align:start position:0%
us so why did we've we've we've gone in
 
00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
a position to it elist and the reason is
 
00:55:56.990 --> 00:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
as Kathleen has said we find amb
 
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
ambiguous language like and May and when
 
00:56:02.470 --> 00:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
requested and as necessary there's
 
00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
several of those and May and may what it
 
00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:07.960 align:start position:0%
does when you start putting ambiguous
 
00:56:10.829 --> 00:56:10.839 align:start position:0%
alternatives on how you look at this it
 
00:56:14.349 --> 00:56:14.359 align:start position:0%
it blows up the whole system we expected
 
00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
this to be an all- inclusionary Bill
 
00:56:18.430 --> 00:56:18.440 align:start position:0%
where all participants whether it's the
 
00:56:21.630 --> 00:56:21.640 align:start position:0%
DHR uh the Strategic initiatives the
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh we figured all the
 
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
tribes of consult
 
00:56:27.309 --> 00:56:27.319 align:start position:0%
that are already like I said protected
 
00:56:30.069 --> 00:56:30.079 align:start position:0%
under us title 25 that's why the state
 
00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
has so many people on that list these
 
00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
are all entities that are protected
 
00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
under a self-determination Clause of the
 
00:56:38.829 --> 00:56:38.839 align:start position:0%
of the federal government so we said you
 
00:56:40.589 --> 00:56:40.599 align:start position:0%
know this would be great if this was
 
00:56:43.630 --> 00:56:43.640 align:start position:0%
just a a codification of procedure but
 
00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:45.960 align:start position:0%
when you start throwing in Ma and ws and
 
00:56:48.309 --> 00:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
then if necessary and if requested these
 
00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
all have to be removed uh so we say it
 
00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:54.200 align:start position:0%
it we already have a process uh we
 
00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
didn't ask for this
 
00:56:58.910 --> 00:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
um we can all work together and draft a
 
00:57:01.710 --> 00:57:01.720 align:start position:0%
new bill for next session that will be
 
00:57:04.029 --> 00:57:04.039 align:start position:0%
inclusive with the input of everyone who
 
00:57:06.589 --> 00:57:06.599 align:start position:0%
actually works within this process and
 
00:57:08.309 --> 00:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
come up with a pro you know a bill that
 
00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:10.720 align:start position:0%
would work better for everybody involved
 
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
the only thing I heard from Ken is that
 
00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
there are some areas where he doesn't
 
00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
have the authority but I think this
 
00:57:18.349 --> 00:57:18.359 align:start position:0%
could be codified if that's what you
 
00:57:20.069 --> 00:57:20.079 align:start position:0%
really want to do and I think it' be
 
00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
word Smith so that it's very clear what
 
00:57:24.309 --> 00:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
the procedure looks like uh I think this
 
00:57:25.789 --> 00:57:25.799 align:start position:0%
is more of a procedural thing and I
 
00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:27.640 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's a legislative issue
 
00:57:30.029 --> 00:57:30.039 align:start position:0%
bluntly I don't think it's legislation I
 
00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
think it's a procedural thing that could
 
00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
easily be documented elsewhere but
 
00:57:35.589 --> 00:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
that's why I say I I'd prefer to see
 
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
this itl I think it opens up what we
 
00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
call an exclusionary process a town
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
could create a Disneyland feature we
 
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
already had this happen once in the
 
00:57:47.390 --> 00:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
state eloa is not a true traditional AB
 
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
necki name that was a state contest to
 
00:57:52.349 --> 00:57:52.359 align:start position:0%
name the beach and that that should have
 
00:57:54.029 --> 00:57:54.039 align:start position:0%
never happened we just don't want that
 
00:57:55.789 --> 00:57:55.799 align:start position:0%
to happen again we don't want to see
 
00:57:58.029 --> 00:57:58.039 align:start position:0%
where somebody uh comes up with a great
 
00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
scheme and changes something uh we also
 
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
know there's a lot of romanticized place
 
00:58:06.589 --> 00:58:06.599 align:start position:0%
names that were created uh in that W uh
 
00:58:08.069 --> 00:58:08.079 align:start position:0%
the thorough time period you know the
 
00:58:10.990 --> 00:58:11.000 align:start position:0%
Romanticism of of you know poetry some
 
00:58:13.549 --> 00:58:13.559 align:start position:0%
of those uh We've we've had to accept
 
00:58:15.069 --> 00:58:15.079 align:start position:0%
because they're so deeply ingrained in
 
00:58:17.470 --> 00:58:17.480 align:start position:0%
our culture like Shakura did Shakura
 
00:58:19.589 --> 00:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
actually occur but you know what we're
 
00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:21.400 align:start position:0%
not pushing back on that that's that's
 
00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
another narrative another time so we
 
00:58:25.630 --> 00:58:25.640 align:start position:0%
just say if this was was meant to be a
 
00:58:28.309 --> 00:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
codification of a process it needs to be
 
00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
very carefully word smithed with no maze
 
00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
or requested or as necessary or you know
 
00:58:36.309 --> 00:58:36.319 align:start position:0%
these just make it ambiguous so with
 
00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
that being said I'm willing to take any
 
00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
questions anybody
 
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
has thank you representative
 
00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you madam chair good morning
 
00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
uh I guess it's Mr and Mrs pulia um I um
 
00:58:54.829 --> 00:58:54.839 align:start position:0%
first I would like to assure you that I
 
00:58:58.589 --> 00:58:58.599 align:start position:0%
don't believe anyone currently serving
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
committee denies the existence of Native
 
00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
Americans in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:59:07.950 --> 00:59:07.960 align:start position:0%
uh I think my committee members would
 
00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
back me up that um we do have a method
 
00:59:18.109 --> 00:59:18.119 align:start position:0%
of retaining a bill for future work and
 
00:59:20.789 --> 00:59:20.799 align:start position:0%
I was wondering if you felt this piece
 
00:59:25.069 --> 00:59:25.079 align:start position:0%
of legislation would be worth using that
 
00:59:27.829 --> 00:59:27.839 align:start position:0%
process that you could perhaps work with
 
00:59:31.309 --> 00:59:31.319 align:start position:0%
the sponsors on what would better
 
00:59:34.029 --> 00:59:34.039 align:start position:0%
satisfy your
 
00:59:36.910 --> 00:59:36.920 align:start position:0%
needs I I agree we've actually taken
 
00:59:39.349 --> 00:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
each one of the re well we started with
 
00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
the original and then there was a a
 
00:59:42.549 --> 00:59:42.559 align:start position:0%
revision of that Amendment and another
 
00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
amendment another amendment we've
 
00:59:46.109 --> 00:59:46.119 align:start position:0%
actually uh looked at each one of them
 
00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
it's minimal uh work has to be done is
 
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
striking out a May here or an or there
 
00:59:53.309 --> 00:59:53.319 align:start position:0%
and and make it very clear that there's
 
00:59:55.349 --> 00:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
a consultation process that's all we we
 
00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
say needs to be done because as it's
 
01:00:00.309 --> 01:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
written the consultation process seems
 
01:00:03.309 --> 01:00:03.319 align:start position:0%
to be a little misleading at each step
 
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
so when you talk to municipalities it's
 
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
very clear that they have their own
 
01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
self-governance issues and they can they
 
01:00:11.069 --> 01:00:11.079 align:start position:0%
can make their recommendations they can
 
01:00:12.549 --> 01:00:12.559 align:start position:0%
have votes depending on you know they
 
01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
could have Town meetings they could put
 
01:00:15.870 --> 01:00:15.880 align:start position:0%
ballots and petitions there's a whole
 
01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
process for them to to put that on you
 
01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:20.920 align:start position:0%
know in their form but when it comes to
 
01:00:24.589 --> 01:00:24.599 align:start position:0%
Ken Gallagher and and the DHHR and the
 
01:00:27.069 --> 01:00:27.079 align:start position:0%
commission I think it should be all
 
01:00:29.549 --> 01:00:29.559 align:start position:0%
integrated as a Consulting party group
 
01:00:31.309 --> 01:00:31.319 align:start position:0%
right and all tribes should be consulted
 
01:00:34.510 --> 01:00:34.520 align:start position:0%
no um One Tribe should not be picked
 
01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
just because they happen to be singing
 
01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
the song the town is looking for um all
 
01:00:41.029 --> 01:00:41.039 align:start position:0%
tribes should be consulted and if a
 
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
project is truly righteous then there
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be an
 
01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
argument we we've actually I'll give you
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
another case and point a couple of towns
 
01:00:51.829 --> 01:00:51.839 align:start position:0%
have actually had mascot issues and this
 
01:00:54.029 --> 01:00:54.039 align:start position:0%
is kind of off the track but and they
 
01:00:55.589 --> 01:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
they canell with a tribe outside the
 
01:00:58.750 --> 01:00:58.760 align:start position:0%
region to get approval on a on an an you
 
01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
know an offensive name uh that's
 
01:01:03.069 --> 01:01:03.079 align:start position:0%
inappropriate you you go to your local
 
01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
community and find out if it offends us
 
01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:07.240 align:start position:0%
I don't care if it doesn't offend
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
somebody in the west coast that's a
 
01:01:11.349 --> 01:01:11.359 align:start position:0%
tribe so we we want this to kind of keep
 
01:01:13.589 --> 01:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
it local we think this is granite state
 
01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
issues and we want to keep it within the
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
granite state if we can so that being
 
01:01:20.349 --> 01:01:20.359 align:start position:0%
said we do see outside influences which
 
01:01:23.069 --> 01:01:23.079 align:start position:0%
sometimes can screw up things and uh
 
01:01:25.069 --> 01:01:25.079 align:start position:0%
like Pocahontas had nothing to do with
 
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire how did that get
 
01:01:28.349 --> 01:01:28.359 align:start position:0%
interjected into our narrative uh
 
01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
Pocahontas is from you know the Virginia
 
01:01:31.710 --> 01:01:31.720 align:start position:0%
so that's the kind of thing we try to
 
01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
push back out and oh by the way there
 
01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
are Pocahontas renamings all over the
 
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
country Ken Galla could could tell you
 
01:01:40.109 --> 01:01:40.119 align:start position:0%
there we just was shocked how many
 
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
people have changed places to Pocahontas
 
01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
just because they felt warm and fuzzy
 
01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
about it any more
 
01:01:48.990 --> 01:01:49.000 align:start position:0%
questions uh not from the committee
 
01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
thank you oh excuse me represent site Mr
 
01:01:55.789 --> 01:01:55.799 align:start position:0%
F does anyone speak abanaki to today is
 
01:01:59.510 --> 01:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
it SP is there a language spoken uh well
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
it's an interesting thing we we still
 
01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
I'll be blunt we we speak like little
 
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
children because all of our um language
 
01:02:09.069 --> 01:02:09.079 align:start position:0%
has been well documented back to the
 
01:02:13.349 --> 01:02:13.359 align:start position:0%
1700s unfortunately um it's not like
 
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
this we don't have first language people
 
01:02:16.510 --> 01:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
that can actually like converse with one
 
01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
another in a living language actually
 
01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
needs children you need like the Youth
 
01:02:22.589 --> 01:02:22.599 align:start position:0%
of your community to speak it and
 
01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:25.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we're now all adults
 
01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
and and what we do is we speak it and we
 
01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:31.240 align:start position:0%
can write documents in it but it's it's
 
01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
more of a labor of love it's like it's
 
01:02:35.309 --> 01:02:35.319 align:start position:0%
like trying to write in Latin today you
 
01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
know it's like if you had to write
 
01:02:38.710 --> 01:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
something in Latin You' you'd be you'd
 
01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
be scratching your head trying to put
 
01:02:41.309 --> 01:02:41.319 align:start position:0%
the sentence together but we can still
 
01:02:43.549 --> 01:02:43.559 align:start position:0%
do it right with determination and love
 
01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
comes success yeah and and abnaki is
 
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
much like Latin in the Algonquin
 
01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
language I'm going to give you a lesson
 
01:02:51.549 --> 01:02:51.559 align:start position:0%
here all the root words of all the other
 
01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
alanan speaking uh uh groups all the way
 
01:02:57.269 --> 01:02:57.279 align:start position:0%
from Main to to the West Coast are all
 
01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:00.680 align:start position:0%
derived from abnaki root words we're
 
01:03:02.990 --> 01:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
like the Latin of the Algonquin language
 
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
all the ancient words embedded in our
 
01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
language so we know the word for Kansas
 
01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:09.640 align:start position:0%
means the place of the Willows we know
 
01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
the Mississippi what that word means
 
01:03:14.349 --> 01:03:14.359 align:start position:0%
because that was another Algonquin word
 
01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
uh Michigan there's a long list a long
 
01:03:18.750 --> 01:03:18.760 align:start position:0%
list of these names actually are derived
 
01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
from abnaki language narratives
 
01:03:24.430 --> 01:03:24.440 align:start position:0%
representative scitec teaches uh Latin
 
01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:26.520 align:start position:0%

remote practice permanent through a

waiver to the Board of Pharmacy however
 
01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:06.480 align:start position:0%

have clear statutory authority to do so
 
01:08:13.549 --> 01:08:13.559 align:start position:0%

01:08:32.070 --> 01:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
passing this legislation will help to
 
01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
ensure that these opportunities can
 
01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
continue after the state of emergency
 
01:08:40.110 --> 01:08:40.120 align:start position:0%
ends codifying this emergency order now
 
01:08:42.669 --> 01:08:42.679 align:start position:0%
will also allow the Board of Pharmacy
 
01:08:45.269 --> 01:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
ample time to create rules needed to
 
01:08:47.550 --> 01:08:47.560 align:start position:0%
address technical details without
 
01:08:50.110 --> 01:08:50.120 align:start position:0%
disrupting the workflow of pharmacies
 
01:08:53.149 --> 01:08:53.159 align:start position:0%
utilizing remote pharmacy technicians
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
bottom line is that it is good for
 
01:08:58.030 --> 01:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
consumers good for employees and good
 
01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:00.880 align:start position:0%

emergency ends we would like to thank
 
01:11:47.790 --> 01:11:47.800 align:start position:0%

before you today includes the Senate
 
01:11:57.310 --> 01:11:57.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment crafted to address stakeholder
 
01:11:59.790 --> 01:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
concerns and ensuring that all quality
 
01:12:01.910 --> 01:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
and patient safety standards continue to
 
01:12:04.270 --> 01:12:04.280 align:start position:0%
be met making the language fit better
 
01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
into existing statute the amendment also
 
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
changes the effective date to upon
 
01:12:11.709 --> 01:12:11.719 align:start position:0%
passage to ensure these practices can
 
01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
continue without interruption when the
 
01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
state of emergency ends we would also
 
01:12:17.709 --> 01:12:17.719 align:start position:0%
like to thank governor sonunu and the
 
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
Board of Pharmacy for their leadership
 
01:12:21.310 --> 01:12:21.320 align:start position:0%
on this issue last March when they
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
approved this practice during an
 
01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
emergency meeting and through emergency
 
01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
order number 13 these emergency actions
 
01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
allowed pillpack to continue to process
 
01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
and deliver critical medications to
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
patients in their homes while maximizing
 
01:12:36.110 --> 01:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
the number of pillpack employees who
 
01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
could work safely from their own homes
 
01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
now let me be clear pharmacy technicians
 
01:12:44.590 --> 01:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
and interns are and should be supervised
 
01:12:47.470 --> 01:12:47.480 align:start position:0%
by licensed pharmacists technology makes
 
01:12:50.030 --> 01:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
remote supervision not only possible but
 
01:12:53.149 --> 01:12:53.159 align:start position:0%
also safe and effective this is why even
 
01:12:56.350 --> 01:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
PRI prior to the covid-19 pandemic 11
 
01:12:58.510 --> 01:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
states had allowed pharmacy technicians
 
01:13:00.990 --> 01:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
to perform certain tasks from home under
 
01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
remote pharmacist supervision this
 
01:13:05.310 --> 01:13:05.320 align:start position:0%
practice has expanded significantly
 
01:13:07.709 --> 01:13:07.719 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic with 34 States
 
01:13:09.629 --> 01:13:09.639 align:start position:0%
including New Hampshire currently
 
01:13:11.390 --> 01:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
allowing some form of remote work for
 
01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:12.550 align:start position:0%
allowing some form of remote work for
pharmacy

01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
pharmacy
 
01:13:14.830 --> 01:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
technicians as far as we are aware the
 
01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
expansion of remote supervision has been
 
01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
safely implemented across the country as
 
01:13:21.390 --> 01:13:21.400 align:start position:0%
well as right here in New Hampshire the
 
01:13:22.990 --> 01:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
National Association of boards of
 
01:13:26.430 --> 01:13:26.440 align:start position:0%
pharmacist and ABP developed remote work
 
01:13:28.709 --> 01:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
model language for pharmacy technicians
 
01:13:31.390 --> 01:13:31.400 align:start position:0%
which this Senate bill Senate Bill 57
 
01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
reflects since implementing the remote
 
01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
work program we have seen positive
 
01:13:38.110 --> 01:13:38.120 align:start position:0%
Trends in employee job satisfaction
 
01:13:40.990 --> 01:13:41.000 align:start position:0%
productivity and prescription accuracy
 
01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
all technicians and interns continue to
 
01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
be supervised by licensed Pharmacists
 
01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
and have access to their supervisors by
 
01:13:50.629 --> 01:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
email phone and secure instant message
 
01:13:53.310 --> 01:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
Chat including video screen share for
 
01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
support and guidance as needed
 
01:13:57.229 --> 01:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
consistent with pillpack's existing
 
01:13:59.350 --> 01:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
operations we have seen a sustained
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
increase in job satisfaction and our
 
01:14:03.149 --> 01:14:03.159 align:start position:0%
quality data has remained very strong
 
01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
throughout the remote work period we're
 
01:14:07.189 --> 01:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
continuously monitoring these important
 
01:14:09.070 --> 01:14:09.080 align:start position:0%
metrics to ensure that we are meeting or
 
01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
exceeding our strict patient safety
 
01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
standards our remote work program has
 
01:14:15.790 --> 01:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
also allowed pillpack to hire additional
 
01:14:17.669 --> 01:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
technicians from different parts of the
 
01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
state many of whom are specifically
 
01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:21.800 align:start position:0%
seeking remote work pillpack is
 
01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
continuing to grow and we plant to
 
01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
increase our Workforce in New Hampshire
 
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 57 will provide us and other
 
01:14:30.629 --> 01:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
pharmacies the certainty that our remote
 
01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
work program can continue after the
 
01:14:34.790 --> 01:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
state of emergency concludes this will
 
01:14:36.870 --> 01:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
allow us to continue to grow and higher
 
01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire where we process and
 
01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
fulfill orders for customers across the
 
01:14:43.830 --> 01:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
country we previously sought a waiver
 
01:14:45.310 --> 01:14:45.320 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Board of Pharmacy
 
01:14:47.310 --> 01:14:47.320 align:start position:0%
to make remote work permanent that
 
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
request was denied by the board not on
 
01:14:51.790 --> 01:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
substance but because the board did not
 
01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
believe it had sufficient clear
 
01:14:56.070 --> 01:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
statutory authority to Grant such a
 
01:14:58.510 --> 01:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
waiver in its denial the board
 
01:15:00.149 --> 01:15:00.159 align:start position:0%
recommended that pillpack and other
 
01:15:03.149 --> 01:15:03.159 align:start position:0%
interested parties pursue legislation
 
01:15:04.669 --> 01:15:04.679 align:start position:0%
that would provide the necessary
 
01:15:07.550 --> 01:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority as a result we are
 
01:15:09.870 --> 01:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
testifying before you today to ask for
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
your support to allow pharmacy
 
01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
technicians and interns to continue to
 
01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
perform non-dispensing tasks remotely
 
01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
codifying this practice would create
 
01:15:19.550 --> 01:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
much needed business certainty for
 
01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
pharmacies in this state and for our
 
01:15:24.030 --> 01:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
patients across the country

thank you again for considering this
 
01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
important piece of Legislation during
 
01:15:28.950 --> 01:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
these unprecedented times and I urge you
 
01:15:32.229 --> 01:15:32.239 align:start position:0%

morning uh I have seen uh packaging
 
01:15:48.910 --> 01:15:48.920 align:start position:0%
operations such as I believe you've been
 
01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
describing uh and they're pretty
 
01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
astonishing in terms of the
 
01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:54.189 align:start position:0%
astonishing in terms of the
sophistication

01:15:54.189 --> 01:15:54.199 align:start position:0%
sophistication
 
01:15:56.709 --> 01:15:56.719 align:start position:0%
of the uh the technology and of the
 
01:15:59.270 --> 01:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
people involved so I'm just my question
 
01:16:02.189 --> 01:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
is whether there was any opposition to
 
01:16:07.669 --> 01:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:09.669 --> 01:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
Senate thank you for your question
 
01:16:12.510 --> 01:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt uh the the bill
 
01:16:14.750 --> 01:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
was passed unan unanimously in the
 
01:16:16.590 --> 01:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
Senate and I am unaware of any
 
01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
opposition at this
 
01:16:21.149 --> 01:16:21.159 align:start position:0%
point thank you that's what I
 
01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
suspected any other questions
 
01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
Ron representative saite did I uh Mr
 
01:16:30.750 --> 01:16:30.760 align:start position:0%
Rashon did I hear something about an
 
01:16:34.709 --> 01:16:34.719 align:start position:0%
amendment involved in I looked at sb57 I
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
didn't see one Amed by the it has been
 
01:16:41.070 --> 01:16:41.080 align:start position:0%
amended by the
 
01:16:43.149 --> 01:16:43.159 align:start position:0%
sorry representative
 
01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
fellow um thank you Mr chair I from Mr
 
01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
ran I have a question um in the
 
01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
bill let's see
 
01:16:57.950 --> 01:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
it's on line 11 if you have a copy like
 
01:17:00.790 --> 01:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh 10 and 11 it's the non-dispensing
 
01:17:03.390 --> 01:17:03.400 align:start position:0%
activities and one of those activities
 
01:17:06.270 --> 01:17:06.280 align:start position:0%
is product verification
 
01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:08.030 align:start position:0%
is product verification
tasks

01:17:08.030 --> 01:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
tasks
 
01:17:13.350 --> 01:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
which my limited knowledge of this um
 
01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
makes me suspect that that's looking at
 
01:17:19.229 --> 01:17:19.239 align:start position:0%
the the the pill or whatever it is to
 
01:17:22.149 --> 01:17:22.159 align:start position:0%
make sure that it's it's um
 
01:17:22.159 --> 01:17:23.910 align:start position:0%
make sure that it's it's um
characteristics

01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
characteristics
 
01:17:27.470 --> 01:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
match what what it should be for
 
01:17:30.910 --> 01:17:30.920 align:start position:0%
whatever kind of pill it is and how do
 
01:17:33.030 --> 01:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
they do that
 
01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
remotely thank you for your question
 
01:17:37.390 --> 01:17:37.400 align:start position:0%
representative fellows uh product
 
01:17:39.790 --> 01:17:39.800 align:start position:0%
verification can be done remotely via
 
01:17:41.950 --> 01:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
high-tech Imaging of the container and
 
01:17:44.669 --> 01:17:44.679 align:start position:0%
its contents so those images are
 
01:17:46.470 --> 01:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
actually produced by the pharmacy
 
01:17:48.310 --> 01:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
automation equipment and with this
 
01:17:50.709 --> 01:17:50.719 align:start position:0%
automation there's also multiple barcode
 
01:17:53.189 --> 01:17:53.199 align:start position:0%
scans Upstream to reduce defect effects
 
01:17:54.750 --> 01:17:54.760 align:start position:0%
and ensure the product is selected
 
01:17:57.229 --> 01:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
correctly the images of the dispense
 
01:17:59.910 --> 01:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
medication the container and the label
 
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
are then compared to the reference image
 
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
by the pharmacist to verify the
 
01:18:05.950 --> 01:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
correctness similar to what would be
 
01:18:08.590 --> 01:18:08.600 align:start position:0%
happening in person but they're looking
 
01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:12.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from the
 
01:18:18.650 --> 01:18:18.660 align:start position:0%
committee for Mr
 
01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:21.910 align:start position:0%
committee for Mr
[Music]

01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:24.430 --> 01:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
Oran representative
 
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
sh thank you Mr chair um Mr my my
 
01:18:34.270 --> 01:18:34.280 align:start position:0%
question is involving basically line 10
 
01:18:37.590 --> 01:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh which says non-dispensing activities
 
01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
include but are not limited
 
01:18:45.709 --> 01:18:45.719 align:start position:0%
to uh so that means that you or some
 
01:18:48.430 --> 01:18:48.440 align:start position:0%
other group would be looking for some
 
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
tasks other than those that are spelled
 
01:18:56.310 --> 01:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:57.270 --> 01:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
01:18:59.590 --> 01:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
representative Shu the purpose of this
 
01:19:03.310 --> 01:19:03.320 align:start position:0%
bill is to uh codify the potential for
 
01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
those remote non-dispensing tasks and
 
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
the Board of Pharmacy once they have
 
01:19:10.149 --> 01:19:10.159 align:start position:0%
clear statutory Authority can also go
 
01:19:12.590 --> 01:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
through normal rulemaking processes to
 
01:19:14.189 --> 01:19:14.199 align:start position:0%
further Define those technical
 
01:19:16.430 --> 01:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
components and build out guards that
 
01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
they see fit uh in order for them to do
 
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
that they requested that they have this
 
01:19:22.910 --> 01:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
clear statutory authority to begin with
 
01:19:24.910 --> 01:19:24.920 align:start position:0%
all right so this basically would just
 
01:19:28.189 --> 01:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
allow um for them to put forward in
 
01:19:31.830 --> 01:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
administrative rules further
 
01:19:34.110 --> 01:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
techniques that is correct as they see
 
01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
fit thank you someone who serves on jel
 
01:19:39.510 --> 01:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
car I appreciate
 
01:19:41.870 --> 01:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
01:19:44.629 --> 01:19:44.639 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you um I have another
 
01:19:48.270 --> 01:19:48.280 align:start position:0%
question how how do you know if the in
 
01:19:50.229 --> 01:19:50.239 align:start position:0%
in this kind of remote operation how do
 
01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
you know the person who's doing the work
 
01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
is actually the person who's hired and
 
01:19:59.310 --> 01:19:59.320 align:start position:0%
qualified to do the
 
01:20:01.510 --> 01:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
work thank you for your follow-up
 
01:20:03.750 --> 01:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
question representative fellows so we
 
01:20:07.030 --> 01:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
have a um well documented policy for
 
01:20:09.229 --> 01:20:09.239 align:start position:0%
remote work which was attached to our
 
01:20:10.629 --> 01:20:10.639 align:start position:0%
original waiver request of the Board of
 
01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy includes a number of safeguards
 
01:20:14.669 --> 01:20:14.679 align:start position:0%
in place to ensure that employees
 
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
logging into our system to perform work
 
01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
are their credentials are verified and
 
01:20:22.149 --> 01:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
validated additionally we actually have
 
01:20:26.669 --> 01:20:26.679 align:start position:0%
a team dedicated to uh following up on
 
01:20:28.189 --> 01:20:28.199 align:start position:0%
work from homework and closely
 
01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
monitoring that quality as well as
 
01:20:33.189 --> 01:20:33.199 align:start position:0%
through two-way video uh video
 
01:20:35.070 --> 01:20:35.080 align:start position:0%
conferencing seeing the person who's
 
01:20:41.470 --> 01:20:41.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:44.030 --> 01:20:44.040 align:start position:0%

followup well yeah thanks I just
 
01:20:53.550 --> 01:20:53.560 align:start position:0%
wondered you you're saying when
 
01:20:56.030 --> 01:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
necessary I'm just wondering how often
 
01:20:59.550 --> 01:20:59.560 align:start position:0%
do you actually see an image of who's
 
01:21:02.189 --> 01:21:02.199 align:start position:0%
actually doing the
 
01:21:05.669 --> 01:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
work so today for our technicians who
 
01:21:08.470 --> 01:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
are performing data entry tasks remotely
 
01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
as part of their regular meetings with
 
01:21:13.110 --> 01:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
their supervisors which occur weekly
 
01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
those would be two-way video meetings
 
01:21:17.149 --> 01:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
where you would see the person doing the
 
01:21:19.550 --> 01:21:19.560 align:start position:0%

of that work from home policy that I
 
01:22:10.990 --> 01:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
referenced previously there are a number
 
01:22:13.310 --> 01:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
of technological safeguards that are
 
01:22:16.030 --> 01:22:16.040 align:start position:0%
included we provide the equipment for
 
01:22:18.310 --> 01:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
our uh employees who are performing
 
01:22:20.510 --> 01:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
remote non-dispensing tasks that
 
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
equipment includes the necessary encryp
 
01:22:25.510 --> 01:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
as defined by Hippa and other related
 
01:22:28.350 --> 01:22:28.360 align:start position:0%
rules to ensure that data security and
 
01:22:29.669 --> 01:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
particularly protected health

information or Phi is kept uh secure
 
01:22:37.629 --> 01:22:37.639 align:start position:0%
additionally um we require that our
 
01:22:40.709 --> 01:22:40.719 align:start position:0%
employees are actually hardwired into
 
01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
internet as part of that policy as
 
01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:44.639 align:start position:0%
opposed to being connected through Wi-Fi
 
01:22:46.390 --> 01:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
further contributing to the security of
 
01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:49.310 align:start position:0%
further contributing to the security of
those

01:22:49.310 --> 01:22:49.320 align:start position:0%

01:23:22.070 --> 01:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
yes have there been any issues as a
 
01:23:26.110 --> 01:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:28.669 --> 01:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
order as far as we involving this
 
01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
involving this procedure as far as we
 
01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
are aware there have not been any issues
 
01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
from our perspective at pillpack in
 
01:23:38.510 --> 01:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
Manchester we have seen um similar or
 
01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
improved quality and prescription
 
01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
accuracy as well as improved job
 
01:23:44.390 --> 01:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
satisfaction as
 
01:23:48.149 --> 01:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
well no issues that we're aware of thank
 
01:23:51.350 --> 01:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
you I have a question myself uh of the
 
01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
employees since this is is all remote
 
01:23:56.070 --> 01:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
how many do you have employees that are
 
01:23:57.910 --> 01:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
not working in the Hampshire or are they
 
01:24:02.510 --> 01:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:04.629 --> 01:24:04.639 align:start position:0%
employees thank you for your question Mr
 
01:24:07.629 --> 01:24:07.639 align:start position:0%
Vice chair we do have some non- New
 
01:24:10.270 --> 01:24:10.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire based remote
 
01:24:13.950 --> 01:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
employees could you give me a ratio
 
01:24:17.149 --> 01:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
roughly unfortunately I don't have that
 
01:24:18.990 --> 01:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
that statistic immediately available
 
01:24:20.189 --> 01:24:20.199 align:start position:0%
it's something that I can take as a
 
01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
followup if you would like it I
 
01:24:26.669 --> 01:24:26.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
Schmid thank you Mr Vice chair uh so Mr
 
01:24:33.270 --> 01:24:33.280 align:start position:0%
roson uh your testimony seems to
 
01:24:35.310 --> 01:24:35.320 align:start position:0%
indicate that this is kind of an
 
01:24:37.550 --> 01:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
Innovative process that started here in
 
01:24:39.550 --> 01:24:39.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but I'm wondering and it
 
01:24:42.030 --> 01:24:42.040 align:start position:0%
is spreading Nationwide through your
 
01:24:44.709 --> 01:24:44.719 align:start position:0%
company's expansion but I'm wondering
 
01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
whether any other states have it this
 
01:24:50.070 --> 01:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
point codified as you are asking us to
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
do thank you for your question
 
01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:53.030 align:start position:0%
do thank you for your question
representative

01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:24:56.149 --> 01:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh even prior to the covid-19 pandemic
 
01:24:59.310 --> 01:24:59.320 align:start position:0%
there were 11 states that previously had
 
01:25:01.070 --> 01:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
allowed Pharmacy Technics to perform
 
01:25:03.629 --> 01:25:03.639 align:start position:0%
these tasks that we're asking for uh
 
01:25:05.950 --> 01:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic that's increased the
 
01:25:08.310 --> 01:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
34 States including New Hampshire with
 
01:25:10.950 --> 01:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
many states considering codification um
 
01:25:13.350 --> 01:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
but outside of those original 11 I'm not
 
01:25:15.390 --> 01:25:15.400 align:start position:0%
aware of what other states have
 
01:25:17.189 --> 01:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
successfully codified
 
01:25:20.750 --> 01:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
today follow up Mr chair uh and and are
 
01:25:26.430 --> 01:25:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:28.470 --> 01:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
that is information that I actually do
 
01:25:30.070 --> 01:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
not have immediately in front of me I
 
01:25:32.109 --> 01:25:32.119 align:start position:0%
don't have the list of states but um if
 
01:25:33.669 --> 01:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
interested I can certainly take that as
 
01:25:33.679 --> 01:25:34.790 align:start position:0%
interested I can certainly take that as
a

01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
followup I think that would be
 
01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
appreciated by the
 
01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:47.950 --> 01:25:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:50.550 --> 01:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
again I understand that the pharmacy
 
01:25:52.350 --> 01:25:52.360 align:start position:0%
board is going to be responsible to
 
01:25:54.350 --> 01:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
ensure that staff has the Required
 
01:25:58.270 --> 01:25:58.280 align:start position:0%
licensing and training how will um the
 
01:26:02.149 --> 01:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
pharmacy board inspect uh local home
 
01:26:02.159 --> 01:26:05.390 align:start position:0%
pharmacy board inspect uh local home
home

01:26:05.390 --> 01:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:07.350 --> 01:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
locations thank you for your follow-up
 
01:26:09.629 --> 01:26:09.639 align:start position:0%
question representative um I can't
 
01:26:11.430 --> 01:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
speculate on what the New Hampshire
 
01:26:13.470 --> 01:26:13.480 align:start position:0%
Board of Pharmacy would do to to do
 
01:26:15.310 --> 01:26:15.320 align:start position:0%
those inspections as I'm not a board
 
01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
representative so I unfortunately I
 
01:26:19.990 --> 01:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
don't have a comment on that at this
 
01:26:23.229 --> 01:26:23.239 align:start position:0%
time thank you perhaps someone in will
 
01:26:25.070 --> 01:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
be able to answer
 
01:26:30.270 --> 01:26:30.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:32.709 --> 01:26:32.719 align:start position:0%
call I I have one more question myself
 
01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
regarding um what I asked you already
 
01:26:38.470 --> 01:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
how would this affect this Bill affect
 
01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
if you have employees working outside of
 
01:26:43.189 --> 01:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire doing this how would this
 
01:26:46.870 --> 01:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
Bill affect their um their ability if
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:54.719 align:start position:0%
statue thank you Mr Vice chair um that
 
01:26:55.990 --> 01:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
would be something that would be
 
01:26:58.109 --> 01:26:58.119 align:start position:0%
considered on a state-by-state basis so
 
01:27:00.310 --> 01:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
we would have to look at the the rules
 
01:27:02.669 --> 01:27:02.679 align:start position:0%
or statutes in the Resident state where
 
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
they're living as well as ours um as New
 
01:27:07.189 --> 01:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire licensed technicians
 
01:27:09.270 --> 01:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
regardless of where they're living they
 
01:27:10.910 --> 01:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
are licensed by the New Hampshire Board
 
01:27:13.109 --> 01:27:13.119 align:start position:0%
of Pharmacy and therefore subject to New
 
01:27:16.390 --> 01:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rules uh as as enforced by the
 
01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
board so we'd be obligated to uh still
 
01:27:21.790 --> 01:27:21.800 align:start position:0%
follow those New Hampshire rules and
 
01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
cons it on a state byst state basis
 
01:27:24.910 --> 01:27:24.920 align:start position:0%
depending on what state they might be
 
01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:26.189 align:start position:0%
depending on what state they might be
living

01:27:26.189 --> 01:27:26.199 align:start position:0%
living
 
01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
in okay thank you I still would like
 
01:27:30.669 --> 01:27:30.679 align:start position:0%
that information that I asked for if you
 
01:27:33.109 --> 01:27:33.119 align:start position:0%
could get it to me later um any other
 
01:27:35.910 --> 01:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr
 
01:27:38.350 --> 01:27:38.360 align:start position:0%
ran seeing none thank you for your
 
01:27:40.669 --> 01:27:40.679 align:start position:0%
testimony Mr ran anyone else wishing to
 
01:27:42.629 --> 01:27:42.639 align:start position:0%
testify on this bill I only had two
 
01:27:49.669 --> 01:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:51.910 --> 01:27:51.920 align:start position:0%

ahead and close the public
 
01:28:00.790 --> 01:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:03.870 --> 01:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
chair before we go on to the next bill
 
01:28:07.030 --> 01:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
I've just been informed that the Senate
 
01:28:09.430 --> 01:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
has requested that the house not hold
 
01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
hearings on
 
01:28:15.189 --> 01:28:15.199 align:start position:0%
Thursday so is there a strong preference
 
01:28:17.350 --> 01:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
among members of the committee for
 
01:28:20.310 --> 01:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
Tuesday or Wednesday of next week since
 
01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
they don't want us to do it on Thursday
 
01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:31.310 --> 01:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:35.590 --> 01:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
me Tuesday is not okay Tuesday is also
 
01:28:37.750 --> 01:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
not the best for me either Wednesday's
 
01:28:40.669 --> 01:28:40.679 align:start position:0%
good all right Wednesday would be better
 
01:28:40.679 --> 01:28:41.990 align:start position:0%

13p part licensing bill I don't think
 
01:30:01.550 --> 01:30:01.560 align:start position:0%

introduce Senate Bill
 
01:31:47.270 --> 01:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
114 this bill is a public safety bill
 
01:31:49.470 --> 01:31:49.480 align:start position:0%
that ensures everyone who uses and
 
01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
enjoys New Hampshire's public cultural
 
01:31:54.149 --> 01:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
and natural resources can do so without
 
01:31:56.590 --> 01:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
fear or threat of discrimination or
 
01:31:58.790 --> 01:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
violence we all know that our beautiful
 
01:32:00.750 --> 01:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
public places are a huge reason why so
 
01:32:02.229 --> 01:32:02.239 align:start position:0%
many people come to New Hampshire to
 
01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
live work and play safe beautiful open
 
01:32:08.229 --> 01:32:08.239 align:start position:0%
space is the legacy of the Granite State
 
01:32:10.109 --> 01:32:10.119 align:start position:0%
and ensuring that everyone feels safe in
 
01:32:13.070 --> 01:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
these spaces is critical to creating a
 
01:32:15.310 --> 01:32:15.320 align:start position:0%
welcoming and robust recreational
 
01:32:17.910 --> 01:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
economy in the granite state now you'll
 
01:32:20.070 --> 01:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
note that the original version of this
 
01:32:22.830 --> 01:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
bill as introduced simply required that
 
01:32:25.550 --> 01:32:25.560 align:start position:0%
the state agencies who Patrol public
 
01:32:27.950 --> 01:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
areas uh required them to establish a
 
01:32:29.870 --> 01:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
protocol for addressing incidents of
 
01:32:32.229 --> 01:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
racial discrimination and bigotry uh
 
01:32:35.270 --> 01:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
record and then log those incidents it
 
01:32:37.470 --> 01:32:37.480 align:start position:0%
also in section five codified the
 
01:32:40.189 --> 01:32:40.199 align:start position:0%
training portion of Governor sununu's
 
01:32:43.030 --> 01:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
executive order creating the um
 
01:32:44.470 --> 01:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
executive order that created the
 
01:32:45.669 --> 01:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
commission on law enforcement
 
01:32:47.350 --> 01:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
accountability a community and
 
01:32:50.470 --> 01:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
transparency commission so um what
 
01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
remains in the bill um is what you have
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
before you uh the remaining section is
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
Section Five and this is a compromis
 
01:33:00.510 --> 01:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
position that ended up passing the
 
01:33:04.070 --> 01:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
Senate unanimously and a 24 to zero vote
 
01:33:06.669 --> 01:33:06.679 align:start position:0%
so this version retains only the
 
01:33:08.470 --> 01:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
language that was worked on with the
 
01:33:11.109 --> 01:33:11.119 align:start position:0%
bill sponsors with Chief skippa of the
 
01:33:12.750 --> 01:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire police standards and
 
01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
training Council regarding the training
 
01:33:17.070 --> 01:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
that that all law enforcement in New
 
01:33:19.470 --> 01:33:19.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should undergo we worked
 
01:33:21.910 --> 01:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
closely with Chief skippa toensure sure
 
01:33:24.350 --> 01:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
that the language was consistent with
 
01:33:27.070 --> 01:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
their already in motion plans to provide
 
01:33:29.430 --> 01:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
this training and that the language was
 
01:33:31.830 --> 01:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
consistent with a key recommendation of
 
01:33:34.109 --> 01:33:34.119 align:start position:0%
the leak commission and the governor's
 
01:33:37.030 --> 01:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
order establishing the commission it is
 
01:33:40.270 --> 01:33:40.280 align:start position:0%
worth noting that over the course of 10
 
01:33:43.310 --> 01:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
weeks this summer The Lea commission met
 
01:33:47.430 --> 01:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
26 times uh and after all this work and
 
01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
public input the leak commission
 
01:33:51.229 --> 01:33:51.239 align:start position:0%
established by the governor's executive
 
01:33:53.950 --> 01:33:53.960 align:start position:0%
order issued a report full of
 
01:33:55.950 --> 01:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
legislative recommendations that were
 
01:33:58.070 --> 01:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
agreed on by all members of the
 
01:34:01.229 --> 01:34:01.239 align:start position:0%
commission now this is no small feat uh
 
01:34:03.950 --> 01:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
there were diverse uh stakeholders at
 
01:34:06.149 --> 01:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
the table and I really do commend each
 
01:34:08.709 --> 01:34:08.719 align:start position:0%
and every member of the leat commission
 
01:34:10.830 --> 01:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
for devoting their time and energy to
 
01:34:13.149 --> 01:34:13.159 align:start position:0%
this difficult but important work so
 
01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
again what remains in this bill is a
 
01:34:16.990 --> 01:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
compromise position that's coming over
 
01:34:18.109 --> 01:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:34:20.830 --> 01:34:20.840 align:start position:0%
Senate establishing this training for
 
01:34:23.590 --> 01:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
all lawn enforcement um and it's fully
 
01:34:25.350 --> 01:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
in line with the leak commission and the
 
01:34:27.350 --> 01:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
governor's executive order so there are
 
01:34:28.830 --> 01:34:28.840 align:start position:0%
folks behind me that will testify but
 
01:34:30.830 --> 01:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any
 
01:34:33.629 --> 01:34:33.639 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
01:34:39.870 --> 01:34:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:42.430 --> 01:34:42.440 align:start position:0%
questions uh Madame chair representative
 
01:34:46.109 --> 01:34:46.119 align:start position:0%
O'Brien if I may please thank you uh
 
01:34:48.870 --> 01:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
Madam chair thank you uh senator for uh
 
01:34:52.390 --> 01:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh I I get to jist
 
01:34:55.350 --> 01:34:55.360 align:start position:0%
and I agree with this uh it seems uh
 
01:34:59.990 --> 01:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
particularly now timely uh but however
 
01:35:02.990 --> 01:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
which course are the police going to
 
01:35:06.030 --> 01:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
take uh is this going to be like a state
 
01:35:08.950 --> 01:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
requirement course so what is taught in
 
01:35:12.950 --> 01:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
nashar is taught in cobbrook and or what
 
01:35:15.229 --> 01:35:15.239 align:start position:0%
happens if a community such as Nash
 
01:35:16.990 --> 01:35:17.000 align:start position:0%
because Nash is a great City we're ahead
 
01:35:19.070 --> 01:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
of the game on a lot of things if I
 
01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
could brag about my hometown but what
 
01:35:23.870 --> 01:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
happens if they have a curent program
 
01:35:26.990 --> 01:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
that may not match exactly the state so
 
01:35:29.910 --> 01:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
where does that lie on this subject
 
01:35:30.910 --> 01:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:35:32.430 --> 01:35:32.440 align:start position:0%
representative and I agree Nashville is
 
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
a great Community you have a wonderful
 
01:35:37.229 --> 01:35:37.239 align:start position:0%
police chief so that's why we were you
 
01:35:39.470 --> 01:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
know the very essence of your question
 
01:35:40.870 --> 01:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
that you know the differences in
 
01:35:42.629 --> 01:35:42.639 align:start position:0%
communities is why we worked really
 
01:35:45.270 --> 01:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
closely with Chief skippa so he runs
 
01:35:47.550 --> 01:35:47.560 align:start position:0%
Chief skippa runs the New Hampshire
 
01:35:49.629 --> 01:35:49.639 align:start position:0%
police standards and training Council
 
01:35:52.510 --> 01:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
people call it the police academy so all
 
01:35:54.910 --> 01:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
law enforcement um look to the police
 
01:35:58.990 --> 01:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
academy to train their officers and to
 
01:36:01.629 --> 01:36:01.639 align:start position:0%
um to help them with annual inservice
 
01:36:03.590 --> 01:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
training so this won't add any
 
01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
additional burden to local uh big or
 
01:36:10.229 --> 01:36:10.239 align:start position:0%
small agencies but um they'll it'll just
 
01:36:14.109 --> 01:36:14.119 align:start position:0%
uh enable the police academy to support
 
01:36:16.870 --> 01:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
the agencies and providing this
 
01:36:20.310 --> 01:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
training okay follow up if I may Madam
 
01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:22.350 align:start position:0%
training okay follow up if I may Madam
chair

01:36:22.350 --> 01:36:22.360 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:36:25.030 --> 01:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
follow up uh thank you madam chair uh
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
Senator uh I I think you might have hit
 
01:36:29.709 --> 01:36:29.719 align:start position:0%
it but just for my clarification make
 
01:36:32.229 --> 01:36:32.239 align:start position:0%
sure I heard correctly uh what I'm
 
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
saying would the state program be the
 
01:36:37.629 --> 01:36:37.639 align:start position:0%
rule that every Community would have to
 
01:36:39.149 --> 01:36:39.159 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm getting at in other
 
01:36:40.750 --> 01:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
words the community could not come up
 
01:36:41.790 --> 01:36:41.800 align:start position:0%
with their
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
own correct correct it right that's
 
01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
correct it is the it is the police
 
01:36:48.950 --> 01:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
academy the State Police Academy run by
 
01:36:50.870 --> 01:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
Chief skippa that would provide this
 
01:36:53.629 --> 01:36:53.639 align:start position:0%
training and then also support um the
 
01:36:56.430 --> 01:36:56.440 align:start position:0%
local agencies you're correct okay thank
 
01:36:58.310 --> 01:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
you senator for taking my question thank
 
01:36:58.320 --> 01:36:59.470 align:start position:0%
you senator for taking my question thank
you

01:36:59.470 --> 01:36:59.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:01.790 align:start position:0%
you
madam

01:37:01.790 --> 01:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
madam
 
01:37:05.229 --> 01:37:05.239 align:start position:0%
representative um thank you madam chair
 
01:37:07.750 --> 01:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
I I think I figured it out
 
01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:10.470 align:start position:0%
I I think I figured it out
but

01:37:10.470 --> 01:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:37:13.070 --> 01:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
this I think I was confused by the
 
01:37:15.510 --> 01:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
analysis that's on the bill that still
 
01:37:18.189 --> 01:37:18.199 align:start position:0%
still ref refers to the Department of
 
01:37:20.669 --> 01:37:20.679 align:start position:0%
Natural and cultural resources but this
 
01:37:23.910 --> 01:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
actually has nothing to do with them as
 
01:37:26.510 --> 01:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
anymore with the amendment correct thank
 
01:37:29.229 --> 01:37:29.239 align:start position:0%
you for the question um and you correct
 
01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
so this the what you have before you is
 
01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh only section five of the bill is
 
01:37:37.390 --> 01:37:37.400 align:start position:0%
introduced so the previous sections um
 
01:37:39.189 --> 01:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
were removed by the Senate so what you
 
01:37:41.229 --> 01:37:41.239 align:start position:0%
have before you is the compromise
 
01:37:44.310 --> 01:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
commiss uh position from the Senate and
 
01:37:47.510 --> 01:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
you're correct that um the analysis uh
 
01:37:49.070 --> 01:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
is not applicable to what remains in the
 
01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you for that clarifying
 
01:37:53.149 --> 01:37:53.159 align:start position:0%
question thank you actually
 
01:37:56.229 --> 01:37:56.239 align:start position:0%
representative fellows the department of
 
01:37:58.870 --> 01:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
cultural resources has some employees
 
01:38:00.990 --> 01:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
who are law
 
01:38:03.910 --> 01:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement the Rangers or what you
 
01:38:05.990 --> 01:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
might you might consider them and they
 
01:38:07.589 --> 01:38:07.599 align:start position:0%
go through the police standards and
 
01:38:09.790 --> 01:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
training and they they're affected in
 
01:38:12.109 --> 01:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
that way that is correct yeah thank you
 
01:38:13.830 --> 01:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
for that clarification that is correct
 
01:38:15.430 --> 01:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
both the Department of Natural and
 
01:38:17.550 --> 01:38:17.560 align:start position:0%
cultural resources and fishing game do
 
01:38:19.229 --> 01:38:19.239 align:start position:0%
have law enforcement that do go through
 
01:38:20.830 --> 01:38:20.840 align:start position:0%
the police academy that is correct thank
 
01:38:22.830 --> 01:38:22.840 align:start position:0%
you so so
 
01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:24.910 align:start position:0%
you so so
followup

01:38:24.910 --> 01:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
followup
 
01:38:29.870 --> 01:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
please um so this applies to those uh
 
01:38:32.550 --> 01:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
few employees that that are in those two
 
01:38:37.030 --> 01:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
departments but it applies to all all
 
01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
police all police officers correct and
 
01:38:41.910 --> 01:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
so this
 
01:38:45.430 --> 01:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
is were they not having any kind of um
 
01:38:48.830 --> 01:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
training for these issues
 
01:38:50.950 --> 01:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
before thank you for that thank you for
 
01:38:55.750 --> 01:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
that question um so this actually um no
 
01:38:57.430 --> 01:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
well I you know I can't speak to with
 
01:38:58.950 --> 01:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
the training that they were having
 
01:39:00.790 --> 01:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
before but this
 
01:39:03.790 --> 01:39:03.800 align:start position:0%
codifies um a requirement for doing this
 
01:39:05.550 --> 01:39:05.560 align:start position:0%
training this new training that it was
 
01:39:07.350 --> 01:39:07.360 align:start position:0%
in the governor's executive order
 
01:39:11.550 --> 01:39:11.560 align:start position:0%
creating the leak commission and then um
 
01:39:14.229 --> 01:39:14.239 align:start position:0%
the police academy was already starting
 
01:39:16.390 --> 01:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
the process to create this training so
 
01:39:18.470 --> 01:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
this just codifies the governor's
 
01:39:21.189 --> 01:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
executive order and the requirement to
 
01:39:22.709 --> 01:39:22.719 align:start position:0%
do this training that was recommended by
 
01:39:23.870 --> 01:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
the leak
 
01:39:26.950 --> 01:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
commission okay thank you thank you
 
01:39:30.189 --> 01:39:30.199 align:start position:0%
representative leus uh thank you madam
 
01:39:33.189 --> 01:39:33.199 align:start position:0%
chair is uh anyone from the police
 
01:39:34.390 --> 01:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
standards and training going to be
 
01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:36.280 align:start position:0%
testifying if so I'll ask this question
 
01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:40.229 align:start position:0%
testifying if so I'll ask this question
of

01:39:40.229 --> 01:39:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:43.390 --> 01:39:43.400 align:start position:0%
them okay I've been informed no one's
 
01:39:44.750 --> 01:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
here from there
 
01:39:47.709 --> 01:39:47.719 align:start position:0%
so uh my question is
 
01:39:50.790 --> 01:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
around what is the training going to be
 
01:39:54.990 --> 01:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
around um especially implicit bias um
 
01:39:57.270 --> 01:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
you know my concern is that there' be
 
01:40:00.830 --> 01:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
nothing included uh that would have been
 
01:40:03.910 --> 01:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
prohibited in the uh House Bill we heard
 
01:40:06.750 --> 01:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
earlier House Bill 544 concerning
 
01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:09.030 align:start position:0%
earlier House Bill 544 concerning
devices

01:40:09.030 --> 01:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
devices
 
01:40:11.189 --> 01:40:11.199 align:start position:0%
Concepts you know sometimes called
 
01:40:15.149 --> 01:40:15.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
whatever yeah I I'm sorry I can't answer
 
01:40:19.070 --> 01:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
that question that would uh something
 
01:40:21.550 --> 01:40:21.560 align:start position:0%
that would be directed to Chief skippa
 
01:40:24.550 --> 01:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
um but the again the language that uh is
 
01:40:25.990 --> 01:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
in the bill was in the governor's
 
01:40:27.950 --> 01:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
executive order and in the in the
 
01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations from the leak commission
 
01:40:31.669 --> 01:40:31.679 align:start position:0%
thank you so I can't speak to the
 
01:40:33.470 --> 01:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
specifics I apologize for
 
01:40:37.070 --> 01:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
that representative C what Senator what
 
01:40:39.189 --> 01:40:39.199 align:start position:0%
was the executive order number do you
 
01:40:41.870 --> 01:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
know oh that's a good question I can
 
01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:58.870 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:40:58.870 --> 01:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:00.750 --> 01:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
it was he had two different executive
 
01:41:03.270 --> 01:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
orders the the first one was
 
01:41:05.390 --> 01:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
202011 and the second one adding
 
01:41:07.870 --> 01:41:07.880 align:start position:0%
additional uh parties I think to the
 
01:41:11.189 --> 01:41:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:19.189 --> 01:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:22.070 --> 01:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
01:41:24.149 --> 01:41:24.159 align:start position:0%
other than the governor's executive
 
01:41:27.870 --> 01:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
order have there been any instances
 
01:41:31.430 --> 01:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:35.990 --> 01:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
have shown requirement for this
 
01:41:38.790 --> 01:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you for the question so we
 
01:41:40.629 --> 01:41:40.639 align:start position:0%
did have an incident in conquer
 
01:41:42.550 --> 01:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
conquer's within my district there was
 
01:41:45.950 --> 01:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
an incident on some Trails um you know
 
01:41:49.790 --> 01:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
some uh graffiti some really hateful uh
 
01:41:52.830 --> 01:41:52.840 align:start position:0%
racially directed graffiti and also in
 
01:41:55.709 --> 01:41:55.719 align:start position:0%
the in the hearing in the Senate we did
 
01:41:57.510 --> 01:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
have a number of folks different folks
 
01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
representing different communities of
 
01:42:01.189 --> 01:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
color who uh testified to their own
 
01:42:04.109 --> 01:42:04.119 align:start position:0%
experience um so you know we don't
 
01:42:06.229 --> 01:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
collect this data in New Hampshire and
 
01:42:09.229 --> 01:42:09.239 align:start position:0%
so a lot of the information was shared
 
01:42:11.430 --> 01:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
by individuals who had experienced their
 
01:42:15.790 --> 01:42:15.800 align:start position:0%
own um you know uh discrimination uh but
 
01:42:17.470 --> 01:42:17.480 align:start position:0%
again this is not documented in we don't
 
01:42:19.750 --> 01:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
collect this data in New
 
01:42:24.430 --> 01:42:24.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire follow up follow up so this
 
01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
the these this these incidences though
 
01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
are caused by New Hampshire citizens not
 
01:42:35.990 --> 01:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
by our state or local employees
 
01:42:39.629 --> 01:42:39.639 align:start position:0%
correct so uh well correct I mean the
 
01:42:42.470 --> 01:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
one right so this is just to make sure
 
01:42:46.070 --> 01:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
that our law enforcement are able to
 
01:42:48.550 --> 01:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
respond to incidents in a way that makes
 
01:42:50.750 --> 01:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
everyone feel safe so this isn't
 
01:42:53.189 --> 01:42:53.199 align:start position:0%
targeting law enforcement this uh this
 
01:42:55.589 --> 01:42:55.599 align:start position:0%
is helping them support the community to
 
01:42:58.510 --> 01:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
make sure everyone feels
 
01:43:01.070 --> 01:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
safe thank you thank
 
01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:04.109 align:start position:0%
safe thank you thank
you

01:43:04.109 --> 01:43:04.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:06.390 --> 01:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
representative good morning and thank
 
01:43:08.629 --> 01:43:08.639 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
01:43:11.950 --> 01:43:11.960 align:start position:0%
question what do training have done to
 
01:43:14.430 --> 01:43:14.440 align:start position:0%
prevent the graffiti that you're talking
 
01:43:16.950 --> 01:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
about in the single
 
01:43:19.149 --> 01:43:19.159 align:start position:0%
incidence so thank thank you for that
 
01:43:22.390 --> 01:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
question um I can't I can't speak to how
 
01:43:23.950 --> 01:43:23.960 align:start position:0%
it would have prevented it but certainly
 
01:43:26.550 --> 01:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
it would support all law enforcement to
 
01:43:29.109 --> 01:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
know what to do when this happens and to
 
01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
respond in a way that makes everyone
 
01:43:33.470 --> 01:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
feel safe um it's also really a public
 
01:43:35.430 --> 01:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
message right that that New Hampshire is
 
01:43:37.750 --> 01:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
a place that's welcoming for all right
 
01:43:40.550 --> 01:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
so it's important you know as I said in
 
01:43:42.709 --> 01:43:42.719 align:start position:0%
our my introduction of the bill you know
 
01:43:45.149 --> 01:43:45.159 align:start position:0%
so many people come to New Hampshire to
 
01:43:47.550 --> 01:43:47.560 align:start position:0%
play and live and work and we want to
 
01:43:49.430 --> 01:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
make sure that we make everyone feel
 
01:43:52.149 --> 01:43:52.159 align:start position:0%
safe right and so you know I was so uh
 
01:43:54.030 --> 01:43:54.040 align:start position:0%
happy to work with Chief skippa who also
 
01:43:55.589 --> 01:43:55.599 align:start position:0%
recognized the importance of community
 
01:43:57.390 --> 01:43:57.400 align:start position:0%
policing building those relationships
 
01:43:58.870 --> 01:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
with Community to make sure everyone
 
01:44:00.750 --> 01:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
feels safe and you know there is this
 
01:44:02.350 --> 01:44:02.360 align:start position:0%
really important economic side of our
 
01:44:04.390 --> 01:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
Recreation right in New Hampshire so
 
01:44:06.750 --> 01:44:06.760 align:start position:0%
many folks cross the border to you know
 
01:44:09.149 --> 01:44:09.159 align:start position:0%
go to our beautiful uh Open Spaces our
 
01:44:11.629 --> 01:44:11.639 align:start position:0%

Hampshire is a place that welcomes
 
01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:17.669 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a place that welcomes
everyone

01:44:17.669 --> 01:44:17.679 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
01:44:19.870 --> 01:44:19.880 align:start position:0%
uh well you should remember
 
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
representative that that testimony might
 
01:44:24.629 --> 01:44:24.639 align:start position:0%
have been to the towards the sections
 
01:44:26.350 --> 01:44:26.360 align:start position:0%
that were deleted by the Senate
 
01:44:28.270 --> 01:44:28.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment and not necessarily the
 
01:44:30.750 --> 01:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
sections that's left please follow
 
01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:32.790 align:start position:0%
sections that's left please follow
that's

01:44:32.790 --> 01:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:44:35.669 --> 01:44:35.679 align:start position:0%
search actually representative Whitley I
 
01:44:38.950 --> 01:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
have a question on that Senator Whitley
 
01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:40.629 align:start position:0%
have a question on that Senator Whitley
excuse

01:44:40.629 --> 01:44:40.639 align:start position:0%
excuse
 
01:44:44.830 --> 01:44:44.840 align:start position:0%
me it appears that after the amendment
 
01:44:47.629 --> 01:44:47.639 align:start position:0%
the title is no longer correct because
 
01:44:49.229 --> 01:44:49.239 align:start position:0%
what it's really dealing with is
 
01:44:51.669 --> 01:44:51.679 align:start position:0%
training for our Law Enforcement
 
01:44:54.070 --> 01:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
Officers would you agree with that I
 
01:44:57.189 --> 01:44:57.199 align:start position:0%
would yep thank
 
01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:05.510 --> 01:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you Senator
 
01:45:09.790 --> 01:45:09.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:13.430 --> 01:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
ofia thank you madam chair um really
 
01:45:16.430 --> 01:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
happy to be here with the committee I
 
01:45:20.589 --> 01:45:20.599 align:start position:0%
um I I you know for me this bill SB has
 
01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
114 is a is I think from the Senate over
 
01:45:25.510 --> 01:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
to the house side it's good comp it's a
 
01:45:27.470 --> 01:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
compromise it's uh you know I think it
 
01:45:29.350 --> 01:45:29.360 align:start position:0%
focuses on one of the main issues which
 
01:45:31.390 --> 01:45:31.400 align:start position:0%
is making sure our law enforcement are
 
01:45:34.229 --> 01:45:34.239 align:start position:0%
just uniformly trained on just some
 
01:45:37.390 --> 01:45:37.400 align:start position:0%
implicit bias trainings I think it's um
 
01:45:38.669 --> 01:45:38.679 align:start position:0%
it's nothing that you know it's
 
01:45:40.709 --> 01:45:40.719 align:start position:0%
important for us to have uniform
 
01:45:43.109 --> 01:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
training across um across departments
 
01:45:45.270 --> 01:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
whether it's fishing game whether it's
 
01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh or state troopers and making sure
 
01:45:49.750 --> 01:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
everyone you know uh is following you
 
01:45:51.950 --> 01:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
know somewh the same safety protocols
 
01:45:54.750 --> 01:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
especially when making um others
 
01:45:56.669 --> 01:45:56.679 align:start position:0%
primarily people of color like myself
 
01:46:00.229 --> 01:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
feel safe in in the outdoors um and we
 
01:46:01.870 --> 01:46:01.880 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that you know the
 
01:46:03.870 --> 01:46:03.880 align:start position:0%
outdoors are a space where everyone
 
01:46:06.790 --> 01:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
feels welcome um where everyone feels
 
01:46:09.109 --> 01:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
like um where everyone can enjoy you
 
01:46:12.390 --> 01:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
know the fresh air and um and and bask
 
01:46:15.149 --> 01:46:15.159 align:start position:0%
in the Sun that we all get to so um I'm
 
01:46:17.030 --> 01:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
really I'm really hopeful that everyone
 
01:46:20.550 --> 01:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
will support this support this bill um I
 
01:46:21.990 --> 01:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
think like I said it's a good compromise
 
01:46:23.870 --> 01:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
to making sure that we all just get all
 
01:46:26.310 --> 01:46:26.320 align:start position:0%
the trainings um uniformly across the
 
01:46:29.109 --> 01:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
board so um with that I'll take any
 
01:46:31.870 --> 01:46:31.880 align:start position:0%
questions as well by thank you
 
01:46:35.350 --> 01:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:37.750 --> 01:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:46:40.149 --> 01:46:40.159 align:start position:0%
schelz thank you for taking my question
 
01:46:44.510 --> 01:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
and thank you madam chair um knowing the
 
01:46:47.910 --> 01:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
issues around divisive Concepts do you
 
01:46:51.870 --> 01:46:51.880 align:start position:0%
see this as being anything other than
 
01:46:55.149 --> 01:46:55.159 align:start position:0%
equipping all of our um enforcement
 
01:46:57.629 --> 01:46:57.639 align:start position:0%
officers in learning how to respond to
 
01:46:57.639 --> 01:46:58.830 align:start position:0%
officers in learning how to respond to
racist

01:46:58.830 --> 01:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
racist
 
01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:00.990 align:start position:0%
racist
incidents

01:47:00.990 --> 01:47:01.000 align:start position:0%
incidents
 
01:47:04.510 --> 01:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
or um isn't isn't that the main
 
01:47:09.149 --> 01:47:09.159 align:start position:0%
purpose and did I hear that it was unan
 
01:47:12.709 --> 01:47:12.719 align:start position:0%
unanimously supported in the Senate yeah
 
01:47:14.709 --> 01:47:14.719 align:start position:0%
yes so this was you know following the
 
01:47:16.910 --> 01:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
amendment it was unanimously supported
 
01:47:21.149 --> 01:47:21.159 align:start position:0%
in the Senate and I think um I think
 
01:47:23.950 --> 01:47:23.960 align:start position:0%
every you know with with whatever we all
 
01:47:26.790 --> 01:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
do I think having the tools we need um
 
01:47:28.830 --> 01:47:28.840 align:start position:0%
to address any situation across any
 
01:47:30.870 --> 01:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
occupation is important so I just think
 
01:47:32.030 --> 01:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
you know I think this is just another
 
01:47:34.270 --> 01:47:34.280 align:start position:0%
tool for law enforcement to be able to
 
01:47:36.070 --> 01:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
properly equip themselves and feel you
 
01:47:37.589 --> 01:47:37.599 align:start position:0%
know feel like they can address it
 
01:47:39.390 --> 01:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
because there's you know there's no such
 
01:47:41.830 --> 01:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
thing as a one-size fits-all but I think
 
01:47:43.149 --> 01:47:43.159 align:start position:0%
there's you know there are tools that
 
01:47:45.470 --> 01:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
will help make sure that we can help as
 
01:47:48.470 --> 01:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
many folks as we can
 
01:47:52.109 --> 01:47:52.119 align:start position:0%
so other questions
 
01:47:56.189 --> 01:47:56.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:02.550 --> 01:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:05.070 --> 01:48:05.080 align:start position:0%
pz thank you Madame shair for giving me
 
01:48:07.669 --> 01:48:07.679 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to uh speak in support
 
01:48:11.189 --> 01:48:11.199 align:start position:0%
of this bill uh my name is Maria Perez
 
01:48:12.629 --> 01:48:12.639 align:start position:0%
I'm a state representative for district
 
01:48:17.030 --> 01:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
23 in Milford um I believe this bill is
 
01:48:20.990 --> 01:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
needed now more than anything we try uh
 
01:48:24.030 --> 01:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
have a good relationship with our police
 
01:48:26.109 --> 01:48:26.119 align:start position:0%
officers with anybody who works in the
 
01:48:29.550 --> 01:48:29.560 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and for people like
 
01:48:31.629 --> 01:48:31.639 align:start position:0%
myself people of color and people who
 
01:48:35.870 --> 01:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
look different in all because of the
 
01:48:37.550 --> 01:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
religion because of the culture will
 
01:48:40.589 --> 01:48:40.599 align:start position:0%
look different this bill would um make
 
01:48:43.910 --> 01:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
us feel more uh welcome and supported
 
01:48:47.950 --> 01:48:47.960 align:start position:0%
and especially when we like me I enjoy
 
01:48:50.790 --> 01:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
hiking I enjoy the parks I enjoy doing a
 
01:48:54.669 --> 01:48:54.679 align:start position:0%
lot of working myself and
 
01:48:57.470 --> 01:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
um this bill will make me more
 
01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
comfortable knowing that if anything
 
01:49:03.550 --> 01:49:03.560 align:start position:0%
like what I experienc last year walk in
 
01:49:05.229 --> 01:49:05.239 align:start position:0%
my dog around my neighborhood one of the
 
01:49:07.910 --> 01:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
TRS around my neighborhood and I was uh
 
01:49:11.510 --> 01:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
harassed by someone and told me that um
 
01:49:12.830 --> 01:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
I wasn't
 
01:49:15.390 --> 01:49:15.400 align:start position:0%
welcome um they told me that I I was an
 
01:49:17.149 --> 01:49:17.159 align:start position:0%
immigrant and I need to go back to my
 
01:49:19.030 --> 01:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
country and my family doesn't belong in
 
01:49:20.790 --> 01:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
a neighborhood
 
01:49:23.950 --> 01:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
um and um when I called the police
 
01:49:25.109 --> 01:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
department they didn't know how to
 
01:49:28.430 --> 01:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
handle it um to be honest this kind of
 
01:49:31.510 --> 01:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
Bill is needed uh we need to the police
 
01:49:33.750 --> 01:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
department to be training to see how to
 
01:49:36.550 --> 01:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
handle this kind of situation because I
 
01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:37.550 align:start position:0%
handle this kind of situation because I
I

01:49:37.550 --> 01:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:49:40.830 --> 01:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
feel a lot of people going through the
 
01:49:44.149 --> 01:49:44.159 align:start position:0%
same things and um it's necessary for
 
01:49:46.229 --> 01:49:46.239 align:start position:0%
all of us to feel
 
01:49:50.470 --> 01:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
welcome um and I respect anyone no
 
01:49:52.109 --> 01:49:52.119 align:start position:0%
matter what color you are no matter what
 
01:49:54.669 --> 01:49:54.679 align:start position:0%
language you speak I feel so like part
 
01:49:57.510 --> 01:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
of this community I feel like I've been
 
01:50:00.550 --> 01:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
here 33 years and I've been working so
 
01:50:03.149 --> 01:50:03.159 align:start position:0%
hard to learn the language to learn the
 
01:50:06.189 --> 01:50:06.199 align:start position:0%
laws to to learn to be part of these
 
01:50:09.229 --> 01:50:09.239 align:start position:0%
communities um so to be honest I I
 
01:50:11.870 --> 01:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
believe that this bill will uh help us
 
01:50:14.189 --> 01:50:14.199 align:start position:0%
to continue that relationship that we
 
01:50:15.950 --> 01:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
try to build with the police departments
 
01:50:19.189 --> 01:50:19.199 align:start position:0%
and uh make people feel more welcome and
 
01:50:20.589 --> 01:50:20.599 align:start position:0%

been on a long journey um and it is very
 
01:52:43.830 --> 01:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
different um than the way it

uh the work that the Senate did um in
recognizing

01:53:01.109 --> 01:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
recognizing
 
01:53:06.870 --> 01:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
the that the um state agencies that work

uh that have jurisdiction on our public
 
01:53:12.990 --> 01:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
lands and public Trails um need to have

the the same
 
01:53:18.350 --> 01:53:18.360 align:start position:0%
training um but what is and I appreciate

the work that the Senate did but we we
 
01:53:24.629 --> 01:53:24.639 align:start position:0%
felt that this bill still was worthy of
 
01:53:29.950 --> 01:53:29.960 align:start position:0%
our support um in addressing uh the
 
01:53:34.629 --> 01:53:34.639 align:start position:0%

01:53:45.750 --> 01:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
um and uh if members of the committee
 
01:53:48.589 --> 01:53:48.599 align:start position:0%
are interested in that uh it is
 
01:53:52.189 --> 01:53:52.199 align:start position:0%
there and and um the the three main
 
01:53:56.270 --> 01:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
points here are that um this bill did
 
01:54:00.870 --> 01:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
pass 24 to zero in the Senate as amended
 
01:54:03.830 --> 01:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
um that there were over a hundred people
 
01:54:06.550 --> 01:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
who signed in support of the bill at the
 
01:54:10.550 --> 01:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
Senate hearing and a petition um that
 
01:54:13.510 --> 01:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
went um that addressed the original bill
 
01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:14.390 align:start position:0%
went um that addressed the original bill
which

01:54:14.390 --> 01:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:54:20.069 --> 01:54:20.079 align:start position:0%
included uh the Lea um training and um
 
01:54:23.910 --> 01:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
to go to the uh Governor's executive
 
01:54:28.350 --> 01:54:28.360 align:start position:0%
orders um and uh the senator was right
 
01:54:31.030 --> 01:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
it was uh
 
01:54:33.510 --> 01:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
20201 and
 
01:54:39.550 --> 01:54:39.560 align:start position:0%
20203 um they it it it includes um it
 
01:54:42.510 --> 01:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
expands the training at the police
 
01:54:44.830 --> 01:54:44.840 align:start position:0%
training and standards Council to
 
01:54:48.669 --> 01:54:48.679 align:start position:0%
include three new nonviolent training
 
01:54:53.069 --> 01:54:53.079 align:start position:0%
sessions and um that those nonviolent
 
01:54:58.350 --> 01:54:58.360 align:start position:0%
trainings those sessions um do include
 
01:55:02.709 --> 01:55:02.719 align:start position:0%
deescalation uh ethics and uh implicit
 
01:55:05.390 --> 01:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
bias and those are really important
 
01:55:09.030 --> 01:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
tools for our law enforcement to have in
 
01:55:12.470 --> 01:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
dealing with the public um these
 
01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:14.669 align:start position:0%
dealing with the public um these
are

01:55:14.669 --> 01:55:14.679 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:55:18.310 --> 01:55:18.320 align:start position:0%
uh and and it applies to law enforcement
 
01:55:22.950 --> 01:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
in um game as well as uh the Department
 
01:55:25.350 --> 01:55:25.360 align:start position:0%
of Natural and cultural
 
01:55:29.870 --> 01:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
resources uh any all of the um the
 
01:55:32.790 --> 01:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
policing agencies go through the police
 
01:55:36.910 --> 01:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
academy and we we support the report uh
 
01:55:39.310 --> 01:55:39.320 align:start position:0%
from the leak commission and and the
 
01:55:42.790 --> 01:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
hard work um that they did in a short
 
01:55:46.310 --> 01:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
amount of time and lastly the the
 
01:55:50.870 --> 01:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
nonviolent training um as I said it is
 
01:55:53.990 --> 01:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
critical to maintain peaceful and safe
 
01:55:57.149 --> 01:55:57.159 align:start position:0%
community relations um there is a lot of
 
01:55:59.589 --> 01:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
conversation about that in the leak
 
01:56:04.109 --> 01:56:04.119 align:start position:0%
commission and um we do and lastly uh we
 
01:56:07.270 --> 01:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
ask uh New Hampshire CER Club asked the
 
01:56:11.550 --> 01:56:11.560 align:start position:0%
committee to pass S sp114 as as amended
 
01:56:14.669 --> 01:56:14.679 align:start position:0%
and um I'm happy and available to assist
 
01:56:18.510 --> 01:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
the committee in any uh further
 
01:56:21.750 --> 01:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
discussions thank you are there any
 
01:56:25.430 --> 01:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:28.629 --> 01:56:28.639 align:start position:0%
kker seeing none thank you very
 
01:56:41.790 --> 01:56:41.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:45.149 --> 01:56:45.159 align:start position:0%
elone hello can you hear me yes thank
 
01:56:47.470 --> 01:56:47.480 align:start position:0%
you yeah my name is as honei and I'm the
 
01:56:48.870 --> 01:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
movement politics director for rights
 
01:56:51.030 --> 01:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
and democracy New Hampshire I am
 
01:56:53.030 --> 01:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
speaking in support of this bill I just
 
01:56:54.390 --> 01:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
um want to start off by saying I am a
 
01:56:57.109 --> 01:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
Muslim woman who wears hijab um and it's
 
01:56:58.830 --> 01:56:58.840 align:start position:0%
vital that we're tracking verbal and
 
01:57:00.629 --> 01:57:00.639 align:start position:0%
physical violence that happens in our
 
01:57:03.069 --> 01:57:03.079 align:start position:0%
parks in our communities in our state in
 
01:57:05.430 --> 01:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
general um and I share the story of a
 
01:57:07.149 --> 01:57:07.159 align:start position:0%
Muslim woman who was walking with her
 
01:57:09.550 --> 01:57:09.560 align:start position:0%
baby and was stopped by police officers
 
01:57:11.629 --> 01:57:11.639 align:start position:0%
because people thought you know just her
 
01:57:13.709 --> 01:57:13.719 align:start position:0%
presence U was a threat to them that's
 
01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
just an example of implicit bias um I
 
01:57:18.350 --> 01:57:18.360 align:start position:0%
also think it's quite sad and scary that
 
01:57:20.109 --> 01:57:20.119 align:start position:0%
police officers are not trained in
 
01:57:22.350 --> 01:57:22.360 align:start position:0%
deescalation and anti-bias training
 
01:57:25.189 --> 01:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
already um police officers have power to
 
01:57:26.790 --> 01:57:26.800 align:start position:0%
stop people and they walk around with
 
01:57:29.109 --> 01:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
tools that kill and unfortunately
 
01:57:30.950 --> 01:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
because of implicit bias and the way
 
01:57:32.390 --> 01:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
we're portrayed particularly in the
 
01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
media um we could be a Target um again
 
01:57:37.430 --> 01:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
even unintentionally so I want to make
 
01:57:39.229 --> 01:57:39.239 align:start position:0%
it clear I support this bill because it
 
01:57:41.709 --> 01:57:41.719 align:start position:0%
does not have a fiscal note um I
 
01:57:44.149 --> 01:57:44.159 align:start position:0%
staunchly oppose more funding towards
 
01:57:46.310 --> 01:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
police agency I see this bill though as
 
01:57:48.750 --> 01:57:48.760 align:start position:0%
harm reduction because I do believe we
 
01:57:50.350 --> 01:57:50.360 align:start position:0%
need to use police Less in our
 
01:57:52.510 --> 01:57:52.520 align:start position:0%
communities um but it is important that
 
01:57:54.629 --> 01:57:54.639 align:start position:0%
any funding that being that's being used
 
01:57:56.390 --> 01:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
for this is coming from the current
 
01:57:58.229 --> 01:57:58.239 align:start position:0%
police budgets and that our police are
 
01:58:01.030 --> 01:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
being trained to deescalate um in terms
 
01:58:03.030 --> 01:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
of implicit bias training it is vital
 
01:58:04.510 --> 01:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
that everyone understands that
 
01:58:06.669 --> 01:58:06.679 align:start position:0%
stereotypes um can lead people to
 
01:58:08.510 --> 01:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
criminalize people and there was a
 
01:58:10.430 --> 01:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
representative who said if implicit bias
 
01:58:13.750 --> 01:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
training is similar to HB 544 bill I
 
01:58:16.870 --> 01:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
would say that HB 544 would would have
 
01:58:19.750 --> 01:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
prohibited people from speaking about it
 
01:58:22.910 --> 01:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
bias as systemic racism so essentially
 
01:58:24.750 --> 01:58:24.760 align:start position:0%
teaching that we should not be treating
 
01:58:26.990 --> 01:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
People based on the negative stereotypes
 
01:58:28.709 --> 01:58:28.719 align:start position:0%
that we could be just internalizing
 
01:58:31.109 --> 01:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
ourselves everyone should be able to
 
01:58:33.550 --> 01:58:33.560 align:start position:0%
live safely and freely and enjoy the
 
01:58:36.510 --> 01:58:36.520 align:start position:0%
outdoors white black and brown people so
 
01:58:38.990 --> 01:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
please do support this
 
01:58:41.109 --> 01:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
Bill thank
 
01:58:45.270 --> 01:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
you will you take questions sure
 
01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:46.390 align:start position:0%
you will you take questions sure
representative

01:58:46.390 --> 01:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:58:49.830 --> 01:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
schz thank you madam chair um first of
 
01:58:53.030 --> 01:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
all Ramadan Mubarak I hope I said that
 
01:58:57.109 --> 01:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
correctly I'm learning um so as I
 
01:58:58.470 --> 01:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
understand it you have a lot of
 
01:59:01.470 --> 01:59:01.480 align:start position:0%
experience around these issues that the
 
01:59:04.350 --> 01:59:04.360 align:start position:0%
leak commission has been discussing and
 
01:59:07.069 --> 01:59:07.079 align:start position:0%
about implicit bias training have you
 
01:59:11.830 --> 01:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
found that to be um well accepted in
 
01:59:15.270 --> 01:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
conversations with law enforcement and
 
01:59:17.870 --> 01:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
um something that they have embraced and
 
01:59:20.950 --> 01:59:20.960 align:start position:0%
found to be mainstream
 
01:59:22.910 --> 01:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um representative I
 
01:59:26.189 --> 01:59:26.199 align:start position:0%
really can't speak in terms of policing
 
01:59:27.870 --> 01:59:27.880 align:start position:0%
um but I can just speak in general
 
01:59:29.069 --> 01:59:29.079 align:start position:0%
people do want to have these
 
01:59:30.910 --> 01:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
conversations because I don't think
 
01:59:32.550 --> 01:59:32.560 align:start position:0%
people realize the ways we've
 
01:59:34.589 --> 01:59:34.599 align:start position:0%
internalized say when we see certain
 
01:59:36.270 --> 01:59:36.280 align:start position:0%
groups of people portrayed in the media
 
01:59:38.589 --> 01:59:38.599 align:start position:0%
a certain way and then we could behave a
 
01:59:40.990 --> 01:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
certain way in public or the fact that
 
01:59:44.189 --> 01:59:44.199 align:start position:0%
you know racism is basically in in in
 
01:59:46.709 --> 01:59:46.719 align:start position:0%
our systems and so in order to really
 
01:59:48.709 --> 01:59:48.719 align:start position:0%
address them we need to talk about them
 
01:59:51.270 --> 01:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
and so that they know like oh um if I
 
01:59:53.390 --> 01:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
see a Muslim woman wearing hijab it
 
01:59:55.510 --> 01:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that she's a terrorist so I
 
01:59:57.390 --> 01:59:57.400 align:start position:0%
should you know not approach in that
 
01:59:59.870 --> 01:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
manner as well so I think uh it's well
 
02:00:01.830 --> 02:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
accepted by everyone in the community
 
02:00:03.550 --> 02:00:03.560 align:start position:0%
and definitely something that needs to
 
02:00:05.189 --> 02:00:05.199 align:start position:0%
happen so we can get to a better place
 
02:00:08.030 --> 02:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:11.629 --> 02:00:11.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:13.790 --> 02:00:13.800 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
02:00:16.870 --> 02:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
you see any other questions is there
 
02:00:19.270 --> 02:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
anyone else who wishes to testify
 
02:00:19.280 --> 02:00:24.830 align:start position:0%
anyone else who wishes to testify
representative

02:00:24.830 --> 02:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:27.310 --> 02:00:27.320 align:start position:0%
oron representative
 
02:00:29.589 --> 02:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
Horgan thank you very much Madam chair
 
02:00:31.189 --> 02:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
so I'm represent Timothy Horgan I
 
02:00:33.750 --> 02:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
represent the towns of uh dur and
 
02:00:38.149 --> 02:00:38.159 align:start position:0%
Madbury um Durham is a uh somewhat more
 
02:00:40.510 --> 02:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
diverse than the rest of New Hampshire U
 
02:00:41.870 --> 02:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
because of the University of New
 
02:00:44.030 --> 02:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which has more persons of
 
02:00:47.069 --> 02:00:47.079 align:start position:0%
color than the stage as a whole and even
 
02:00:49.109 --> 02:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
though we have a very well-trained
 
02:00:51.350 --> 02:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
very fair police force there is um you
 
02:00:54.750 --> 02:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
know there's racial tension even between
 
02:00:58.830 --> 02:00:58.840 align:start position:0%
uh people the people of color who reside
 
02:01:01.669 --> 02:01:01.679 align:start position:0%
in Durham and the police force and there
 
02:01:03.109 --> 02:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
um haven't been
 
02:01:06.310 --> 02:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
any major racially charged incidents in
 
02:01:08.270 --> 02:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
Durham that I can remember but they have
 
02:01:09.910 --> 02:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
H they do happen in New Hampshire and
 
02:01:12.629 --> 02:01:12.639 align:start position:0%
then there's also I think there's a
 
02:01:15.470 --> 02:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
level of mistrust even between the uh
 
02:01:17.470 --> 02:01:17.480 align:start position:0%
White community and the police force
 
02:01:19.589 --> 02:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
because for example large percent of the
 
02:01:22.350 --> 02:01:22.360 align:start position:0%
homicides in Hampshire are officer
 
02:01:25.550 --> 02:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
involved incidents um usually they're
 
02:01:27.870 --> 02:01:27.880 align:start position:0%
rarely if ever convicted a crime in fact
 
02:01:30.310 --> 02:01:30.320 align:start position:0%
most cases probably their actions were
 
02:01:33.990 --> 02:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
justifiable but there is even even so
 
02:01:35.910 --> 02:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
this even between the white community
 
02:01:38.030 --> 02:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
and police force there's a level of
 
02:01:41.350 --> 02:01:41.360 align:start position:0%
mistrust and certainly um we haven't had
 
02:01:43.830 --> 02:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
anything like what's going on in uh in
 
02:01:46.750 --> 02:01:46.760 align:start position:0%
Minnesota which is uh disgraceful but
 
02:01:48.550 --> 02:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
Minnesota is also a peaceful white state
 
02:01:50.790 --> 02:01:50.800 align:start position:0%
so like you know it happened
 
02:01:54.069 --> 02:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
there could you could you speak as to
 
02:01:55.790 --> 02:01:55.800 align:start position:0%
whether you're in favor or opposed to
 
02:01:57.589 --> 02:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
the bill oh I'm sorry oh well I'm
 
02:01:59.470 --> 02:01:59.480 align:start position:0%
imposed I'm very much in favor of the
 
02:02:01.830 --> 02:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
bill and it's pretty simple common sense
 
02:02:04.470 --> 02:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
and it just codifies what the police
 
02:02:07.270 --> 02:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
academy should be and I think um is
 
02:02:10.189 --> 02:02:10.199 align:start position:0%
trying to do already so like this is U
 
02:02:12.750 --> 02:02:12.760 align:start position:0%
so certainly um you know the police
 
02:02:15.030 --> 02:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
officers I don't think um police
 
02:02:16.629 --> 02:02:16.639 align:start position:0%
officers you know they they should be
 
02:02:18.189 --> 02:02:18.199 align:start position:0%
de-escalating incidents you know they
 
02:02:19.870 --> 02:02:19.880 align:start position:0%
should not be killing civilians when
 
02:02:21.030 --> 02:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
they don't have to you know they should
 
02:02:23.149 --> 02:02:23.159 align:start position:0%
be treating everyone fairly regardless
 
02:02:24.709 --> 02:02:24.719 align:start position:0%
of the color their skin or whatever the
 
02:02:27.350 --> 02:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
other characteristics this is very very
 
02:02:31.390 --> 02:02:31.400 align:start position:0%
common sense and um it's almost like a
 
02:02:33.470 --> 02:02:33.480 align:start position:0%
it's almost uh pretty it's almost
 
02:02:35.229 --> 02:02:35.239 align:start position:0%
unfortunate this bill is necessary but I
 
02:02:37.510 --> 02:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
believe it is necessary and also um the
 
02:02:41.350 --> 02:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
topic of HP 544 came up i' be represent
 
02:02:45.390 --> 02:02:45.400 align:start position:0%
HP 544 anymore it is related in the
 
02:02:47.830 --> 02:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
sense that um there is a possible
 
02:02:49.149 --> 02:02:49.159 align:start position:0%
conflict between these two builds
 
02:02:51.550 --> 02:02:51.560 align:start position:0%
although I think uh you know you should
 
02:02:55.030 --> 02:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
pass this s to the Senate and HB 544 has
 
02:02:58.390 --> 02:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
in fact not been passed by the by the
 
02:03:01.750 --> 02:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
house anyway so that's it was table 347
 
02:03:06.550 --> 02:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
184 anymore thank um do you have
 
02:03:09.270 --> 02:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
anything else to say about Senate Bill
 
02:03:12.709 --> 02:03:12.719 align:start position:0%
114 oh it's a it's it's an excellent
 
02:03:16.550 --> 02:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
bill it's uh so common sensical it it's
 
02:03:18.950 --> 02:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
so common sensible it shouldn't be NE
 
02:03:21.189 --> 02:03:21.199 align:start position:0%
necessary but yes it is necessary and um
 
02:03:24.430 --> 02:03:24.440 align:start position:0%
so I I I I think this should be passed
 
02:03:27.310 --> 02:03:27.320 align:start position:0%
it's excellent thank you and whatever
 
02:03:29.109 --> 02:03:29.119 align:start position:0%
else other member of the public that
 
02:03:34.510 --> 02:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:39.430 --> 02:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:42.149 --> 02:03:42.159 align:start position:0%

nobody um to speak to us from police
 
02:03:56.669 --> 02:03:56.679 align:start position:0%
standards and training is there some way
 
02:03:59.709 --> 02:03:59.719 align:start position:0%

03:32:27.510 --> 03:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
included in one of the Omnibus bills and
 
03:32:30.750 --> 03:32:30.760 align:start position:0%
that Omnibus Bill was vetoed so in
 
03:32:33.429 --> 03:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
speaking with Senator GAA this year we
 
03:32:36.510 --> 03:32:36.520 align:start position:0%
both talked about um how important it
 
03:32:39.630 --> 03:32:39.640 align:start position:0%
was that we refile this bill but what we
 
03:32:42.189 --> 03:32:42.199 align:start position:0%
did was we divided into two separate
 
03:32:45.030 --> 03:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
packages a policy package and a fiscal
 
03:32:47.189 --> 03:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
package what you have in front of you
 
03:32:51.309 --> 03:32:51.319 align:start position:0%
today is the F uh is the policy packet
 
03:32:53.790 --> 03:32:53.800 align:start position:0%
and Senator GAA um is sponsoring the
 
03:32:58.349 --> 03:32:58.359 align:start position:0%
fiscal package um we uh we took our time
 
03:33:00.870 --> 03:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
with this bill in Senate Ed and day and
 
03:33:02.750 --> 03:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
looked it over very very carefully
 
03:33:05.110 --> 03:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
because as you can tell there are a
 
03:33:08.189 --> 03:33:08.199 align:start position:0%
number of pages to this bill um and it
 
03:33:10.950 --> 03:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
really makes some good changes but we
 
03:33:13.269 --> 03:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that we were um we
 
03:33:16.269 --> 03:33:16.279 align:start position:0%
were all on the same page on this the
 
03:33:19.510 --> 03:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
only thing that we did do is we file I
 
03:33:21.750 --> 03:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
filed an amendment we had received a
 
03:33:24.469 --> 03:33:24.479 align:start position:0%
request from the vice chair of the
 
03:33:27.910 --> 03:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
electricians board to include um
 
03:33:32.189 --> 03:33:32.199 align:start position:0%
criminal background checks for um for
 
03:33:35.590 --> 03:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
electricians that was adopted and I
 
03:33:38.150 --> 03:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
believe um Miss Courtney is going to be
 
03:33:40.790 --> 03:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
speaking to the need for another
 
03:33:43.830 --> 03:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment we did adopt part of that
 
03:33:47.030 --> 03:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
language which states that the board um
 
03:33:49.150 --> 03:33:49.160 align:start position:0%
shall retain the authority to determine
 
03:33:52.870 --> 03:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
the criteria necessary for licensing
 
03:33:56.110 --> 03:33:56.120 align:start position:0%
applications um the other part of it um
 
03:33:58.150 --> 03:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
really dealt with an issue that was
 
03:34:01.830 --> 03:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
brought by uh representative Merchant as
 
03:34:03.870 --> 03:34:03.880 align:start position:0%
you know representative Merchant used to
 
03:34:07.030 --> 03:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
sit on the pharmacy board and the
 
03:34:09.710 --> 03:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
amendment that uh Miss Courtney is going
 
03:34:11.349 --> 03:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
to that's going to going to ask you to
 
03:34:13.910 --> 03:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
bring forward is a comp uh some
 
03:34:16.590 --> 03:34:16.600 align:start position:0%
compromise language that they both um
 
03:34:19.189 --> 03:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
felt was appropriate so at this point
 
03:34:24.030 --> 03:34:24.040 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I will um seize my testimony
 
03:34:26.389 --> 03:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
and just say that um I know that um Miss
 
03:34:28.710 --> 03:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
Courtney is here and she will be able to
 
03:34:31.150 --> 03:34:31.160 align:start position:0%
walk you through this extensive bill and
 
03:34:33.389 --> 03:34:33.399 align:start position:0%
I thank you all very much for your time
 
03:34:35.750 --> 03:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
and your consideration this
 
03:34:38.349 --> 03:34:38.359 align:start position:0%
afternoon thank you
 
03:34:41.510 --> 03:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
Senator uh will you take questions
 
03:34:44.590 --> 03:34:44.600 align:start position:0%
um I can try to but again it's it's
 
03:34:47.309 --> 03:34:47.319 align:start position:0%
pretty extensive so um I will try to
 
03:34:49.830 --> 03:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
answer a question representative Shu do
 
03:34:52.070 --> 03:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
you wish to ask Senator Carson or
 
03:34:54.910 --> 03:34:54.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps Miss Courtney yes this isn't
 
03:34:57.790 --> 03:34:57.800 align:start position:0%
anything technical I don't think uh just
 
03:35:01.389 --> 03:35:01.399 align:start position:0%
a clarification Senator uh you
 
03:35:05.870 --> 03:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh approval um of applications
 
03:35:08.510 --> 03:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
by the board was that referring
 
03:35:11.150 --> 03:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
specifically to the electricians board
 
03:35:14.590 --> 03:35:14.600 align:start position:0%
not all the boards no This was um
 
03:35:18.269 --> 03:35:18.279 align:start position:0%
specific to the pharmacy board um at the
 
03:35:20.550 --> 03:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
at that time we uh Miss Courtney and I
 
03:35:22.550 --> 03:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
had had a discussion with M uh
 
03:35:25.710 --> 03:35:25.720 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant this was some uh
 
03:35:28.790 --> 03:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
language that we had all agreed on but
 
03:35:31.030 --> 03:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
since then there have been subsequent
 
03:35:33.110 --> 03:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
conversations and there she's bringing
 
03:35:36.710 --> 03:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
forward more language um I do have um
 
03:35:39.750 --> 03:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
the language but um I didn't think it
 
03:35:41.590 --> 03:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
was appropriate that I present the
 
03:35:43.870 --> 03:35:43.880 align:start position:0%
committee with an amendment so that's
 
03:35:46.630 --> 03:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
okay I just wasn't sure who you were
 
03:35:49.349 --> 03:35:49.359 align:start position:0%

58 uh this is a bill that is really
 
03:36:17.870 --> 03:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
needed uh as you may recall the office
 
03:36:20.790 --> 03:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
of profess professional lure and
 
03:36:23.070 --> 03:36:23.080 align:start position:0%
certification uh was established uh by
 
03:36:25.229 --> 03:36:25.239 align:start position:0%
the legislature about six years ago
 
03:36:28.870 --> 03:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
maybe seven now uh and it is it has uh
 
03:36:33.590 --> 03:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
suffered uh from um uh changes in
 
03:36:35.510 --> 03:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
leadership numerous changes of the
 
03:36:38.630 --> 03:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
executive director uh has suffered from
 
03:36:42.630 --> 03:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
covid uh and the the the uh Omnibus Bill
 
03:36:47.950 --> 03:36:47.960 align:start position:0%
um problem uh and and it is in in great
 
03:36:50.910 --> 03:36:50.920 align:start position:0%
need uh of being implemented uh I've
 
03:36:53.630 --> 03:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
been through it as has director Courtney
 
03:36:55.389 --> 03:36:55.399 align:start position:0%
uh and of course Senator Carson and the
 
03:36:58.590 --> 03:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
committee uh this is a bill that
 
03:37:01.910 --> 03:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
directly affects how our state boards
 
03:37:04.510 --> 03:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
interact with the businesses the doctors
 
03:37:07.030 --> 03:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
the nurses the pharmacists acupuncture
 
03:37:09.990 --> 03:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
all of those professions um and and what
 
03:37:11.710 --> 03:37:11.720 align:start position:0%
we have found in the past and one of the
 
03:37:15.070 --> 03:37:15.080 align:start position:0%
reasons this this oplc was established
 
03:37:18.750 --> 03:37:18.760 align:start position:0%
uh was to standardize and streamline the
 
03:37:18.760 --> 03:37:20.150 align:start position:0%
uh was to standardize and streamline the
application

03:37:20.150 --> 03:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
application
 
03:37:23.590 --> 03:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
processes uh oplc is taking that on with
 
03:37:25.830 --> 03:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
the most recent uh uh addition of the
 
03:37:29.710 --> 03:37:29.720 align:start position:0%
mechanical licensing board to its um
 
03:37:35.229 --> 03:37:35.239 align:start position:0%
purview uh the the the uh oplc will not
 
03:37:38.070 --> 03:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
be stipulating conditions of lure those
 
03:37:39.950 --> 03:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
are left to the professional boards but
 
03:37:41.349 --> 03:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
what this does it
 
03:37:43.790 --> 03:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
streamlines uh and significantly
 
03:37:46.469 --> 03:37:46.479 align:start position:0%
accelerates uh both the process for
 
03:37:46.479 --> 03:37:47.830 align:start position:0%
accelerates uh both the process for
application

03:37:47.830 --> 03:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
application
 
03:37:49.870 --> 03:37:49.880 align:start position:0%
relicensing uh and of course in the
 
03:37:51.349 --> 03:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
instance where there may be problems
 
03:37:54.150 --> 03:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
with a person uh in violation of rules
 
03:37:56.349 --> 03:37:56.359 align:start position:0%
or ethics or so forth that also
 
03:37:58.189 --> 03:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
standardizes the procedures between the
 
03:38:00.990 --> 03:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
many boards that are under its purview
 
03:38:03.269 --> 03:38:03.279 align:start position:0%
uh I've worked closely with now
 
03:38:04.870 --> 03:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
executive director Courtney for about
 
03:38:07.469 --> 03:38:07.479 align:start position:0%
the last three years uh working on this
 
03:38:09.990 --> 03:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
bill uh it will greatly assist our
 
03:38:13.389 --> 03:38:13.399 align:start position:0%
business es uh in in the Rel lier
 
03:38:15.590 --> 03:38:15.600 align:start position:0%

03:38:42.590 --> 03:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
uh bill with the Financial aspects could

Schmidt thank you madam chair good
 
03:39:01.670 --> 03:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
afternoon Senator
 
03:39:04.429 --> 03:39:04.439 align:start position:0%
uh I certainly agree with your
 
03:39:08.830 --> 03:39:08.840 align:start position:0%
assessment of the uh problems that o
 
03:39:11.510 --> 03:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
oplc has gone through during its the
 
03:39:14.030 --> 03:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
years of his existence it has been
 
03:39:16.950 --> 03:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
plagued by numerous leadership changes
 
03:39:21.750 --> 03:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
um and uh I wonder what kind of uh push
 
03:39:23.630 --> 03:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
back have any you've had from the boards
 
03:39:25.630 --> 03:39:25.640 align:start position:0%
or at least response you've had from the
 
03:39:29.229 --> 03:39:29.239 align:start position:0%
boards in the process of your uh your
 
03:39:32.550 --> 03:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
work on the on redoing everything or not
 
03:39:38.150 --> 03:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:40.030 --> 03:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
lot thank you representative for the
 
03:39:43.750 --> 03:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
question question um I have not
 
03:39:46.469 --> 03:39:46.479 align:start position:0%
had any P push back I've observed if you
 
03:39:49.110 --> 03:39:49.120 align:start position:0%
will imaginations of numbers of boards
 
03:39:52.389 --> 03:39:52.399 align:start position:0%
um that um are
 
03:39:55.590 --> 03:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh unhappy with the fact that
 
03:39:57.550 --> 03:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
standardization of procedures is coming
 
03:40:00.950 --> 03:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
it must come um we have had significant
 
03:40:02.590 --> 03:40:02.600 align:start position:0%
problems as an example with the nursing
 
03:40:05.950 --> 03:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
board uh which uh was a significant
 
03:40:08.070 --> 03:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
obstacle during the covid crisis to
 
03:40:10.309 --> 03:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
getting uh licensed nurses from
 
03:40:13.189 --> 03:40:13.199 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions into our state um we have
 
03:40:17.189 --> 03:40:17.199 align:start position:0%
had uh uh some uh you know again
 
03:40:17.199 --> 03:40:18.309 align:start position:0%
had uh uh some uh you know again
concerns

03:40:18.309 --> 03:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
03:40:21.550 --> 03:40:21.560 align:start position:0%
with the boards not perhaps wanting to
 
03:40:24.429 --> 03:40:24.439 align:start position:0%
relinquish the administrative processes
 
03:40:25.910 --> 03:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
but they're not manned they're not
 
03:40:27.389 --> 03:40:27.399 align:start position:0%
they're not they don't have the
 
03:40:30.189 --> 03:40:30.199 align:start position:0%
Personnel uh or the skill sets frankly
 
03:40:31.830 --> 03:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
to do the administrative part of
 
03:40:34.429 --> 03:40:34.439 align:start position:0%
Licensing and certification much better
 
03:40:37.030 --> 03:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
done uniformly across the board uh to
 
03:40:39.070 --> 03:40:39.080 align:start position:0%
the benefit both of the state and of the
 
03:40:40.790 --> 03:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
of the businesses and individuals that
 
03:40:44.630 --> 03:40:44.640 align:start position:0%

03:40:48.469 --> 03:40:48.479 align:start position:0%
um well if I might Madam chair so the
 
03:40:51.910 --> 03:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
the house CNA also has been very
 
03:40:54.590 --> 03:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
concerned over the over the years about
 
03:40:56.189 --> 03:40:56.199 align:start position:0%
the situation and we have been
 
03:40:59.309 --> 03:40:59.319 align:start position:0%
monitoring it as as closely as you can
 
03:41:01.110 --> 03:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
without being on the other side of the
 
03:41:04.469 --> 03:41:04.479 align:start position:0%
wall um so I and I don't mean the wall
 
03:41:05.830 --> 03:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
between the Senate and the house I mean
 
03:41:08.910 --> 03:41:08.920 align:start position:0%

oplc uh so uh we certainly look at your
 
03:41:16.189 --> 03:41:16.199 align:start position:0%

oplc has been working diligently to
 
03:42:40.349 --> 03:42:40.359 align:start position:0%
establish efficiencies with within the
 
03:42:42.229 --> 03:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
office in order to assist all of our
 
03:42:45.189 --> 03:42:45.199 align:start position:0%
boards in their very important work this
 
03:42:48.110 --> 03:42:48.120 align:start position:0%
really is just a cleanup Bill and as
 
03:42:51.189 --> 03:42:51.199 align:start position:0%
such it is a crucial way to pave off it
 
03:42:52.990 --> 03:42:53.000 align:start position:0%
is a crucial step to pave the way for
 
03:42:55.710 --> 03:42:55.720 align:start position:0%
oplc to achieve its mission of promoting
 
03:42:57.429 --> 03:42:57.439 align:start position:0%
the efficiency and economy in the
 
03:43:00.070 --> 03:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
administration of its licensing boards
 
03:43:02.030 --> 03:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
there are a number of objectives in this
 
03:43:05.309 --> 03:43:05.319 align:start position:0%
bill um primarily though um to remove
 
03:43:07.710 --> 03:43:07.720 align:start position:0%
requirement in certain practice practice
 
03:43:10.550 --> 03:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
acts that require Court stenographer
 
03:43:13.070 --> 03:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
uh to be present for all hearings number
 
03:43:15.429 --> 03:43:15.439 align:start position:0%
two to Grant to the executive director
 
03:43:17.910 --> 03:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
the authority to set PDM rates for board
 
03:43:20.510 --> 03:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
members uh three we want to standardize
 
03:43:23.469 --> 03:43:23.479 align:start position:0%
Quorum requirements to enable boards to
 
03:43:25.870 --> 03:43:25.880 align:start position:0%
to meet and fulfill their statutory
 
03:43:28.990 --> 03:43:29.000 align:start position:0%
applications we'd like to repeal RSA
 
03:43:32.389 --> 03:43:32.399 align:start position:0%
332h um five at the board of veterinary
 
03:43:34.750 --> 03:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
medicine which came over to us with hb4
 
03:43:35.990 --> 03:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
of the last
 
03:43:40.630 --> 03:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
bium um to our uh statute which is 310a
 
03:43:42.550 --> 03:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
we'd like to remove references to the
 
03:43:43.830 --> 03:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of Health
 
03:43:45.670 --> 03:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
and Human Services which seems to be a
 
03:43:47.870 --> 03:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
carryover um from when several of the
 
03:43:49.790 --> 03:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
boards and councils were part of or
 
03:43:51.550 --> 03:43:51.560 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to
 
03:43:54.349 --> 03:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
DHHS remove the requirement um that
 
03:43:56.950 --> 03:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
boards provide a roster of lenes for a
 
03:43:59.630 --> 03:43:59.640 align:start position:0%
fee permit the agency to adopt a
 
03:44:02.389 --> 03:44:02.399 align:start position:0%
retention policy across the agency
 
03:44:04.670 --> 03:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
clarify that the agency itself does not
 
03:44:06.389 --> 03:44:06.399 align:start position:0%
have any reporting requirements under
 
03:44:06.399 --> 03:44:07.990 align:start position:0%
have any reporting requirements under
RSA

03:44:07.990 --> 03:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
03:44:11.630 --> 03:44:11.640 align:start position:0%
332g um 13 and 14 for boards that do not
 
03:44:13.630 --> 03:44:13.640 align:start position:0%
fall within the agency such as
 
03:44:15.830 --> 03:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
mechanical um licensing which likely
 
03:44:17.790 --> 03:44:17.800 align:start position:0%
will come over but um there are boards
 
03:44:19.349 --> 03:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
that are part of title
 
03:44:22.229 --> 03:44:22.239 align:start position:0%
30 um Grant the executive director the
 
03:44:23.950 --> 03:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
authority to promulgate rules for all
 
03:44:25.510 --> 03:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
boards that participate in our
 
03:44:27.950 --> 03:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
professional health program set term
 
03:44:29.870 --> 03:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
limits for the board of family mediator
 
03:44:32.510 --> 03:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
certification and clarify that the
 
03:44:34.550 --> 03:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
executive director and not the pdmp
 
03:44:36.710 --> 03:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
program administrator has certain um
 
03:44:38.630 --> 03:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
statutory authority of discretionary
 
03:44:40.750 --> 03:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
tasks and I do want to just go through
 
03:44:42.790 --> 03:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
those briefly to just highlight the
 
03:44:45.750 --> 03:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
reasons um therefore um these are not
 
03:44:47.670 --> 03:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
intended to be substantive changes but
 
03:44:50.269 --> 03:44:50.279 align:start position:0%
again cleanup changes that have resulted
 
03:44:52.110 --> 03:44:52.120 align:start position:0%
from modifications to the various
 
03:44:55.070 --> 03:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
practice acts over the years
 
03:44:57.870 --> 03:44:57.880 align:start position:0%
um that um make it difficult to provide
 
03:45:00.710 --> 03:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
efficiencies in the office I do want to
 
03:45:03.110 --> 03:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
be clear that um the boards councils and
 
03:45:04.750 --> 03:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
commissions within the office have their
 
03:45:06.870 --> 03:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
own independent regulatory Authority as
 
03:45:08.510 --> 03:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
you know to establish standards for
 
03:45:10.670 --> 03:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
their respective profession
 
03:45:12.670 --> 03:45:12.680 align:start position:0%
this bill does not propose to change
 
03:45:14.550 --> 03:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
those standards or the board's authority
 
03:45:16.670 --> 03:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
to set such standards and I do believe
 
03:45:18.389 --> 03:45:18.399 align:start position:0%
it it does make clear that the boards
 
03:45:20.830 --> 03:45:20.840 align:start position:0%
retain that Authority but there are
 
03:45:22.349 --> 03:45:22.359 align:start position:0%
certain administrative functions that
 
03:45:24.429 --> 03:45:24.439 align:start position:0%
are unrelated to standards of practice
 
03:45:26.429 --> 03:45:26.439 align:start position:0%
that must be standardized for all boards
 
03:45:28.469 --> 03:45:28.479 align:start position:0%
within the office this is really
 
03:45:30.189 --> 03:45:30.199 align:start position:0%
necessary in order to ensure that we're
 
03:45:32.229 --> 03:45:32.239 align:start position:0%
not creating inefficient uh
 
03:45:34.110 --> 03:45:34.120 align:start position:0%
inefficiencies in the licensing process
 
03:45:37.469 --> 03:45:37.479 align:start position:0%
and unnecessary unnecessary barriers uh
 
03:45:40.149 --> 03:45:40.159 align:start position:0%
to Workforce entry which is a huge
 
03:45:43.830 --> 03:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
problem in the state s sp58 would assist
 
03:45:47.870 --> 03:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
um the intent of 310a by granting the
 
03:45:49.830 --> 03:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
office the ability to streamline certain
 
03:45:51.469 --> 03:45:51.479 align:start position:0%
administrative functions across all
 
03:45:53.750 --> 03:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
boards making the licensing and
 
03:45:56.870 --> 03:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
disciplinary processes more efficient in
 
03:45:59.070 --> 03:45:59.080 align:start position:0%
terms of um the first requirement or the
 
03:46:01.510 --> 03:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
first elimination that we'd like to um
 
03:46:03.269 --> 03:46:03.279 align:start position:0%
to accomplish is the stenographer
 
03:46:04.910 --> 03:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
requirement there are just a few
 
03:46:07.030 --> 03:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
practice acts that do require a steno to
 
03:46:08.990 --> 03:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
be present at a hearing this is
 
03:46:11.110 --> 03:46:11.120 align:start position:0%
expensive for the agency and not not
 
03:46:12.990 --> 03:46:13.000 align:start position:0%
really necessary given that we do have
 
03:46:16.110 --> 03:46:16.120 align:start position:0%
the ability to record and transcribe um
 
03:46:18.429 --> 03:46:18.439 align:start position:0%
at A party's expense so we'd like to
 
03:46:20.269 --> 03:46:20.279 align:start position:0%
standardize this requirement across all
 
03:46:22.510 --> 03:46:22.520 align:start position:0%
board and reduce the cost to the agency
 
03:46:24.309 --> 03:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
by proposing to eliminate the
 
03:46:25.950 --> 03:46:25.960 align:start position:0%
requirement that a stenographer be
 
03:46:28.269 --> 03:46:28.279 align:start position:0%
present at hearings all boards would
 
03:46:29.790 --> 03:46:29.800 align:start position:0%
just have to comply with the records
 
03:46:31.189 --> 03:46:31.199 align:start position:0%
requirement in the administrative
 
03:46:34.590 --> 03:46:34.600 align:start position:0%
procedures act RSA
 
03:46:38.429 --> 03:46:38.439 align:start position:0%
54831 terms of the pum um this is a huge
 
03:46:40.269 --> 03:46:40.279 align:start position:0%
problem for the agency there is no
 
03:46:43.910 --> 03:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
standardized perdum rates sp58 proposes
 
03:46:46.189 --> 03:46:46.199 align:start position:0%
to Grant to the agency the authority to
 
03:46:47.950 --> 03:46:47.960 align:start position:0%
establish perdum rates for all boards
 
03:46:50.309 --> 03:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
councils and commissions some boards
 
03:46:52.510 --> 03:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
right now receive a perdm rate um many
 
03:46:55.189 --> 03:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
do not some boards receive a perdm rate
 
03:46:58.429 --> 03:46:58.439 align:start position:0%
for any work performed at any time um
 
03:47:02.189 --> 03:47:02.199 align:start position:0%
this has resulted in some um some claims
 
03:47:05.110 --> 03:47:05.120 align:start position:0%
for prium that are just really not
 
03:47:07.429 --> 03:47:07.439 align:start position:0%
appropriate um others are required to
 
03:47:08.990 --> 03:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
perform work for a certain number of
 
03:47:10.269 --> 03:47:10.279 align:start position:0%
hours or
 
03:47:14.469 --> 03:47:14.479 align:start position:0%
um only only receive pdms for um a for a
 
03:47:17.950 --> 03:47:17.960 align:start position:0%
particular meeting um some receive a
 
03:47:20.590 --> 03:47:20.600 align:start position:0%
rate of $25 others $100 I could go on
 
03:47:22.189 --> 03:47:22.199 align:start position:0%
and on and on but it's very difficult
 
03:47:24.510 --> 03:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
for us to effectively administer and
 
03:47:27.870 --> 03:47:27.880 align:start position:0%
also to budget um so we'd like to do
 
03:47:29.910 --> 03:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
this in the form of rul making by
 
03:47:31.950 --> 03:47:31.960 align:start position:0%
granting the agency the authority to
 
03:47:35.710 --> 03:47:35.720 align:start position:0%
establish perdum rates by um by rule
 
03:47:37.510 --> 03:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
we'd also like to standardize the quum
 
03:47:39.510 --> 03:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
requirements most practice Acts
 
03:47:40.990 --> 03:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
established a quorum of the majority of
 
03:47:42.469 --> 03:47:42.479 align:start position:0%
members appointed and confirmed by
 
03:47:44.950 --> 03:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
governor and Council um but there are a
 
03:47:46.309 --> 03:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
couple of practice acts that
 
03:47:48.229 --> 03:47:48.239 align:start position:0%
specifically Define a set number of
 
03:47:50.550 --> 03:47:50.560 align:start position:0%
board members who constitute a quorum
 
03:47:52.469 --> 03:47:52.479 align:start position:0%
this becomes a problem when vacancies
 
03:47:55.750 --> 03:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
are not filled um as oftentimes boards
 
03:47:57.469 --> 03:47:57.479 align:start position:0%
are not able to meet conduct board
 
03:47:59.389 --> 03:47:59.399 align:start position:0%
business approve applications then there
 
03:48:02.550 --> 03:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
are barriers for lure as an example um
 
03:48:04.189 --> 03:48:04.199 align:start position:0%
the board of hearing care providers did
 
03:48:06.389 --> 03:48:06.399 align:start position:0%
not meet uh for about two years due to
 
03:48:09.469 --> 03:48:09.479 align:start position:0%
lack of a quum and so licenses were
 
03:48:11.510 --> 03:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
being issued and approved by operation
 
03:48:14.269 --> 03:48:14.279 align:start position:0%
of law consistent with 54
 
03:48:17.309 --> 03:48:17.319 align:start position:0%
a29a regardless of whether or not um
 
03:48:19.830 --> 03:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
they met their requirements so obviously
 
03:48:21.550 --> 03:48:21.560 align:start position:0%
that's a problem from a public safety
 
03:48:23.830 --> 03:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
standpoint and we'd like to U modify the
 
03:48:23.840 --> 03:48:25.030 align:start position:0%
standpoint and we'd like to U modify the
quum

03:48:25.030 --> 03:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
quum
 
03:48:27.830 --> 03:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
requirements um we'd also like to uh
 
03:48:31.229 --> 03:48:31.239 align:start position:0%
repeal RSA 332h which requires boards to
 
03:48:33.389 --> 03:48:33.399 align:start position:0%
distribute printed rules to
 
03:48:35.630 --> 03:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
lenses uh frankly this is just an
 
03:48:37.950 --> 03:48:37.960 align:start position:0%
outdated statutory provision uh given
 
03:48:40.429 --> 03:48:40.439 align:start position:0%
that the rules are on our website which
 
03:48:42.429 --> 03:48:42.439 align:start position:0%
was recently updated you may have
 
03:48:45.469 --> 03:48:45.479 align:start position:0%
observed um all of our rules Now link
 
03:48:47.990 --> 03:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
directly to the Gen Court website um
 
03:48:49.630 --> 03:48:49.640 align:start position:0%
boards we're we're not complying with
 
03:48:51.229 --> 03:48:51.239 align:start position:0%
this rule so we'd like to eliminate that
 
03:48:51.239 --> 03:48:52.590 align:start position:0%
this rule so we'd like to eliminate that
statutory

03:48:52.590 --> 03:48:52.600 align:start position:0%
statutory
 
03:48:54.950 --> 03:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
requirement um this bill also proposes
 
03:48:56.630 --> 03:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
to add the board of veterinary medicine
 
03:48:57.990 --> 03:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
to RSA
 
03:49:00.229 --> 03:49:00.239 align:start position:0%
3101a I think that was just an oversight
 
03:49:03.670 --> 03:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
in the last um Budget Trailer this bill
 
03:49:05.510 --> 03:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
also proposes to remove references to
 
03:49:06.750 --> 03:49:06.760 align:start position:0%
the Commissioner of Health and Human
 
03:49:10.070 --> 03:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
Services specifically um Mid council is
 
03:49:11.990 --> 03:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
one of them that used to be a part of
 
03:49:15.229 --> 03:49:15.239 align:start position:0%
DHHS and still references um the
 
03:49:17.110 --> 03:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner of
 
03:49:19.910 --> 03:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
DHHS uh this bill also proposes to
 
03:49:21.710 --> 03:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
eliminate the requirement of providing
 
03:49:23.990 --> 03:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
rosters for a fee some practice acts
 
03:49:25.750 --> 03:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
require boards to provide a roster of
 
03:49:29.030 --> 03:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
lenses and to do so at a cost upon
 
03:49:32.269 --> 03:49:32.279 align:start position:0%
request um however all of all of our
 
03:49:34.030 --> 03:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
licensing information is available
 
03:49:37.110 --> 03:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
online additionally anyone can file a
 
03:49:39.910 --> 03:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
right to no request and obtain a roster
 
03:49:41.670 --> 03:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
um I'll bet not with the personal
 
03:49:45.429 --> 03:49:45.439 align:start position:0%
information as as determined um uh
 
03:49:48.110 --> 03:49:48.120 align:start position:0%
through legal counsel but um it's the
 
03:49:49.469 --> 03:49:49.479 align:start position:0%
agency's position that we really
 
03:49:51.389 --> 03:49:51.399 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be charging people in excess
 
03:49:53.269 --> 03:49:53.279 align:start position:0%
of what it cost to actually produce the
 
03:49:54.830 --> 03:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
roster and so we'd like to eliminate
 
03:49:54.840 --> 03:49:56.149 align:start position:0%
roster and so we'd like to eliminate
this

03:49:56.149 --> 03:49:56.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:49:59.790 --> 03:49:59.800 align:start position:0%
requirement um probably most importantly
 
03:50:02.149 --> 03:50:02.159 align:start position:0%
for our current purposes um given our
 
03:50:05.110 --> 03:50:05.120 align:start position:0%
recent relocation to S Eagle Square um
 
03:50:07.229 --> 03:50:07.239 align:start position:0%
it's become quite obvious that we need
 
03:50:10.429 --> 03:50:10.439 align:start position:0%
an agency-wide retention policy
 
03:50:13.349 --> 03:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately we do not have that
 
03:50:15.349 --> 03:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
capability at present some of the
 
03:50:17.349 --> 03:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
practice acts establish a time frame in
 
03:50:19.830 --> 03:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
which certain documents must be retained
 
03:50:21.550 --> 03:50:21.560 align:start position:0%
other boards have already worked in the
 
03:50:23.550 --> 03:50:23.560 align:start position:0%
past prior to opl's Creation with the
 
03:50:26.030 --> 03:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office to adopt a
 
03:50:27.510 --> 03:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
retention policy and all of these
 
03:50:31.309 --> 03:50:31.319 align:start position:0%
policies conflict um so effectively the
 
03:50:34.229 --> 03:50:34.239 align:start position:0%
office has been um essentially required
 
03:50:37.189 --> 03:50:37.199 align:start position:0%
to maintain documents um indefinitely
 
03:50:38.750 --> 03:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
which has become quite a problem from a
 
03:50:41.950 --> 03:50:41.960 align:start position:0%
storage standpoint so um this bill
 
03:50:44.830 --> 03:50:44.840 align:start position:0%
proposes to permit the agency to adopt a
 
03:50:47.910 --> 03:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
state an agency-wide retention policy
 
03:50:49.269 --> 03:50:49.279 align:start position:0%
and obviously we'd work with the boards
 
03:50:50.990 --> 03:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
to determine what's what's appropriate
 
03:50:52.030 --> 03:50:52.040 align:start position:0%
based on the
 
03:50:54.950 --> 03:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
documents Bill also clarifies that oplc
 
03:50:56.550 --> 03:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
does not have reporting requirements for
 
03:50:59.309 --> 03:50:59.319 align:start position:0%
non oplc boards I could go on and on and
 
03:51:02.349 --> 03:51:02.359 align:start position:0%
on about the ways that the statutes um
 
03:51:04.070 --> 03:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
the statutory framework for occupational
 
03:51:08.510 --> 03:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
licensing is just um probably not ideal
 
03:51:10.389 --> 03:51:10.399 align:start position:0%
um one of those is the fact that not all
 
03:51:12.750 --> 03:51:12.760 align:start position:0%
all of our boards are fall within title
 
03:51:16.429 --> 03:51:16.439 align:start position:0%
30 um 332g is drafted in such a way that
 
03:51:18.950 --> 03:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
is supposed to apply I think primarily
 
03:51:21.070 --> 03:51:21.080 align:start position:0%
to the office but there are boards that
 
03:51:22.630 --> 03:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
are not within the office that are part
 
03:51:24.870 --> 03:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
of title 30 so we'd like to clarify that
 
03:51:27.710 --> 03:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
we do not have um obligations statutory
 
03:51:30.030 --> 03:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
obligations for boards that are not um
 
03:51:31.269 --> 03:51:31.279 align:start position:0%
within the
 
03:51:33.870 --> 03:51:33.880 align:start position:0%
office this bill also permits the agency
 
03:51:36.389 --> 03:51:36.399 align:start position:0%
to adopt rules for PHP if you don't know
 
03:51:38.630 --> 03:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
PHP is the professionals health program
 
03:51:40.870 --> 03:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
that we contract with in order to
 
03:51:43.030 --> 03:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
provide um specifically Healthcare
 
03:51:46.590 --> 03:51:46.600 align:start position:0%
lienes with access to um monitoring but
 
03:51:49.550 --> 03:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
also services to make sure that if they
 
03:51:51.429 --> 03:51:51.439 align:start position:0%
do develop a substance use disorder that
 
03:51:52.990 --> 03:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
they can get the appropriate treatment
 
03:51:55.830 --> 03:51:55.840 align:start position:0%
and and possibly seek a re-entry to
 
03:51:58.309 --> 03:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
Workforce um the boards presently there
 
03:52:00.550 --> 03:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
are 13 of them have the ability to adopt
 
03:52:03.429 --> 03:52:03.439 align:start position:0%
rules and um this has become an issue
 
03:52:05.229 --> 03:52:05.239 align:start position:0%
for the vendor obviously it's difficult
 
03:52:06.950 --> 03:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
to effectively administer a program with
 
03:52:10.229 --> 03:52:10.239 align:start position:0%
13 sets of rules to follow so so um this
 
03:52:12.670 --> 03:52:12.680 align:start position:0%
bill proposes to authorize the agency to
 
03:52:12.680 --> 03:52:13.670 align:start position:0%
bill proposes to authorize the agency to
adopt

03:52:13.670 --> 03:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
adopt
 
03:52:13.680 --> 03:52:15.349 align:start position:0%
adopt
rules

03:52:15.349 --> 03:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
rules
 
03:52:19.110 --> 03:52:19.120 align:start position:0%
um and then um one of the last uh
 
03:52:21.149 --> 03:52:21.159 align:start position:0%
changes in this bill this very lengthy
 
03:52:23.189 --> 03:52:23.199 align:start position:0%
bill um is to set term limits for the
 
03:52:25.590 --> 03:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
family mediator certification board this
 
03:52:27.990 --> 03:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
is really just a cleanup um because all
 
03:52:30.149 --> 03:52:30.159 align:start position:0%
boards have term limits with this one
 
03:52:32.070 --> 03:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
board's exception so the agency is
 
03:52:35.110 --> 03:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
proposing to create term limits and
 
03:52:38.349 --> 03:52:38.359 align:start position:0%
finally um this bill proposes to clarify
 
03:52:40.070 --> 03:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
that uh the the executive director and
 
03:52:43.429 --> 03:52:43.439 align:start position:0%
not the pdmp um State classified staff
 
03:52:46.990 --> 03:52:47.000 align:start position:0%
has a discretionary Authority um to uh
 
03:52:48.790 --> 03:52:48.800 align:start position:0%
perform certain functions like issue
 
03:52:51.750 --> 03:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
waivers um Senator Carson did mention
 
03:52:54.349 --> 03:52:54.359 align:start position:0%
the potential for an amendment if um
 
03:52:57.349 --> 03:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
there was interest I have assisted um
 
03:52:59.710 --> 03:52:59.720 align:start position:0%
and I have worked to draft language uh
 
03:53:02.189 --> 03:53:02.199 align:start position:0%
with representative Merchants there was
 
03:53:04.710 --> 03:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
concern um regarding this bill's
 
03:53:06.830 --> 03:53:06.840 align:start position:0%
language that it didn't necessarily make
 
03:53:09.110 --> 03:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
clear that Pharmacy inspectors in
 
03:53:12.110 --> 03:53:12.120 align:start position:0%
particular must be Pharmacists and or
 
03:53:14.550 --> 03:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
qualified pharmacy technicians this is
 
03:53:17.830 --> 03:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
something that the agency fully supports
 
03:53:20.790 --> 03:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
um and so um if the committee were so
 
03:53:24.790 --> 03:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
inclined um one of the um proposed
 
03:53:26.550 --> 03:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
amendments that I would recommend would
 
03:53:29.229 --> 03:53:29.239 align:start position:0%
be to um offer language to make it clear
 
03:53:30.990 --> 03:53:31.000 align:start position:0%
that the pharmacy inspectors must be
 
03:53:33.030 --> 03:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
qualified in
 
03:53:35.469 --> 03:53:35.479 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy thank you very very much for
 
03:53:36.990 --> 03:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to provide comments I
 
03:53:39.429 --> 03:53:39.439 align:start position:0%
apologize it was so lengthy um but I'm
 
03:53:40.990 --> 03:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions you may
 
03:53:43.830 --> 03:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
have thank you I have one question
 
03:53:46.389 --> 03:53:46.399 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson mentioned that that you
 
03:53:48.990 --> 03:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
added in the in the Senate Amendment
 
03:53:51.149 --> 03:53:51.159 align:start position:0%
criminal background checks for
 
03:53:53.750 --> 03:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
electricians I'm looking at the
 
03:53:57.630 --> 03:53:57.640 align:start position:0%
electricians which is section 164 on
 
03:53:57.640 --> 03:53:58.790 align:start position:0%
electricians which is section 164 on
page

03:53:58.790 --> 03:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
page
 
03:54:01.790 --> 03:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
46 and it doesn't I can't see where it
 
03:54:05.269 --> 03:54:05.279 align:start position:0%
calls for criminal background
 
03:54:07.389 --> 03:54:07.399 align:start position:0%
checks yeah so the background checks
 
03:54:09.830 --> 03:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
were requested by the board not by the
 
03:54:14.429 --> 03:54:14.439 align:start position:0%
agency um and so that I think what it
 
03:54:17.349 --> 03:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
the Senate did amend um fif Senate Bill
 
03:54:19.870 --> 03:54:19.880 align:start position:0%
58 it's in the amendment to require
 
03:54:21.870 --> 03:54:21.880 align:start position:0%
background checks for electricians this
 
03:54:24.510 --> 03:54:24.520 align:start position:0%
was not part of the original Bill well
 
03:54:26.870 --> 03:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the bill as amended by
 
03:54:26.880 --> 03:54:28.469 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the bill as amended by
the

03:54:28.469 --> 03:54:28.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:54:32.229 --> 03:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
Senate and I don't see any it just
 
03:54:36.110 --> 03:54:36.120 align:start position:0%
says um qualifications or satisfactory
 
03:54:39.670 --> 03:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
evidence of good professional character
 
03:54:41.309 --> 03:54:41.319 align:start position:0%
there's nothing about criminal
 
03:54:44.429 --> 03:54:44.439 align:start position:0%
background checks Madam chair I think uh
 
03:54:47.750 --> 03:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
Senator GAO wants to speak on that uh
 
03:54:50.149 --> 03:54:50.159 align:start position:0%
yes okay Senator GA can you answer that
 
03:54:52.309 --> 03:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
question yes Madam chair and members of
 
03:54:53.950 --> 03:54:53.960 align:start position:0%
the committee uh that amendment was
 
03:54:58.590 --> 03:54:58.600 align:start position:0%
defeated in the Senate um and as
 
03:55:01.469 --> 03:55:01.479 align:start position:0%
well respect to the the question I think
 
03:55:03.910 --> 03:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
from representative Shu regarding the
 
03:55:06.030 --> 03:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
fines and fees and so forth that is part
 
03:55:09.349 --> 03:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
four of omnus bill Senate Bill 13 which
 
03:55:11.550 --> 03:55:11.560 align:start position:0%
is which has been uh tabled by the
 
03:55:14.910 --> 03:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
Senate uh so we may see that later uh as
 
03:55:17.469 --> 03:55:17.479 align:start position:0%
we progress through the legislative
 
03:55:21.389 --> 03:55:21.399 align:start position:0%
process act or more likely it'll be if
 
03:55:23.670 --> 03:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
it's anywhere it'll be in House Bill
 
03:55:25.870 --> 03:55:25.880 align:start position:0%
too representative Pearson you have a
 
03:55:28.710 --> 03:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
question I do thank you madam chair and
 
03:55:30.189 --> 03:55:30.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator guer representative
 
03:55:33.309 --> 03:55:33.319 align:start position:0%
Pearson here um you you talked about
 
03:55:34.309 --> 03:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
earlier in the beginning about the
 
03:55:36.189 --> 03:55:36.199 align:start position:0%
policy package and the fiscal
 
03:55:38.990 --> 03:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
package is that what you just mentioned
 
03:55:40.269 --> 03:55:40.279 align:start position:0%
is that the fiscal package you're
 
03:55:42.070 --> 03:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
talking about that was
 
03:55:44.469 --> 03:55:44.479 align:start position:0%
tabled it
 
03:55:47.469 --> 03:55:47.479 align:start position:0%
is representative yes um there were four
 
03:55:50.110 --> 03:55:50.120 align:start position:0%
parts that ominous Bill part four was
 
03:55:54.110 --> 03:55:54.120 align:start position:0%
the very lengthy similar to this bill uh
 
03:55:56.990 --> 03:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
piece uh of the original one piece
 
03:55:58.469 --> 03:55:58.479 align:start position:0%
legislation it was so large that we
 
03:56:00.149 --> 03:56:00.159 align:start position:0%
broke it up into two one if you will the
 
03:56:03.229 --> 03:56:03.239 align:start position:0%
administrative processes that uh that
 
03:56:04.790 --> 03:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
executive director Courtney has spoken
 
03:56:06.790 --> 03:56:06.800 align:start position:0%
to in this bill and the other one is
 
03:56:09.030 --> 03:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
fees and fines and that Authority uh for
 
03:56:11.790 --> 03:56:11.800 align:start position:0%
oplc and that other Bill and so uh
 
03:56:13.710 --> 03:56:13.720 align:start position:0%
that's that's how the decision was made
 
03:56:16.389 --> 03:56:16.399 align:start position:0%
to to uh if you will bifurcate this this
 
03:56:20.189 --> 03:56:20.199 align:start position:0%
legislation and and to follow up the the
 
03:56:22.070 --> 03:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
Senate chose to take that section that
 
03:56:23.950 --> 03:56:23.960 align:start position:0%
was split off and combine it with other
 
03:56:27.149 --> 03:56:27.159 align:start position:0%
things into an non us yes it's part of
 
03:56:30.149 --> 03:56:30.159 align:start position:0%
that bill is the BET BPT
 
03:56:32.910 --> 03:56:32.920 align:start position:0%
reductions um a number of
 
03:56:37.269 --> 03:56:37.279 align:start position:0%
other represent okay so so Senator we're
 
03:56:38.830 --> 03:56:38.840 align:start position:0%
we're looking at an axle here that's got
 
03:56:40.710 --> 03:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
a a wheel on one side and a wheel on the
 
03:56:42.189 --> 03:56:42.199 align:start position:0%
other and they're coming from two
 
03:56:44.710 --> 03:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
different areas if one if the fiscal
 
03:56:46.950 --> 03:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
package part never comes
 
03:56:49.670 --> 03:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
out and we we were to go ahead with the
 
03:56:51.950 --> 03:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
policy part is that going to cause a big
 
03:56:54.670 --> 03:56:54.680 align:start position:0%
conundrum here with with redoing policy
 
03:56:56.630 --> 03:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
without having the fiscal part of it to
 
03:56:59.429 --> 03:56:59.439 align:start position:0%
go with it no I will not but I'd be
 
03:57:02.269 --> 03:57:02.279 align:start position:0%
happy to uh to allow if you would
 
03:57:03.670 --> 03:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
executive director Courtney to address
 
03:57:06.670 --> 03:57:06.680 align:start position:0%
that it will not be problematic
 
03:57:11.070 --> 03:57:11.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:12.750 --> 03:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just a couple
 
03:57:16.710 --> 03:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
quick questions for Miss gording um in
 
03:57:19.349 --> 03:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
setting the perdum rates is this going
 
03:57:22.070 --> 03:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
to be a one-size fits all um as we know
 
03:57:24.950 --> 03:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
some boards uh pay a little more than
 
03:57:27.590 --> 03:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
others and there's reasons for that um
 
03:57:29.349 --> 03:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
having trouble finding people to fill
 
03:57:32.110 --> 03:57:32.120 align:start position:0%
the board positions or things of that
 
03:57:36.229 --> 03:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
nature um I question whether a one siiz
 
03:57:38.670 --> 03:57:38.680 align:start position:0%
fits all is the right approach and is is
 
03:57:41.349 --> 03:57:41.359 align:start position:0%
that what you're looking at no we're not
 
03:57:43.149 --> 03:57:43.159 align:start position:0%
looking at a one-size fits-all and the
 
03:57:44.830 --> 03:57:44.840 align:start position:0%
reason for that is because certain
 
03:57:48.469 --> 03:57:48.479 align:start position:0%
boards meet longer meet more frequently
 
03:57:50.630 --> 03:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
and frankly there's more work put into
 
03:57:53.309 --> 03:57:53.319 align:start position:0%
that um I think this is going to have to
 
03:57:55.510 --> 03:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
be done in consultation with the boards
 
03:57:57.070 --> 03:57:57.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to survey to see
 
03:57:58.830 --> 03:57:58.840 align:start position:0%
what you know how much time people are
 
03:58:02.070 --> 03:58:02.080 align:start position:0%
actually expected to contribute um in in
 
03:58:04.269 --> 03:58:04.279 align:start position:0%
being a board member one of the biggest
 
03:58:06.070 --> 03:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
issues that we're facing right now
 
03:58:09.389 --> 03:58:09.399 align:start position:0%
though is that certain boards um
 
03:58:12.630 --> 03:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
have the ability to um receive PMS for
 
03:58:16.030 --> 03:58:16.040 align:start position:0%
for any activity um that's really not
 
03:58:18.750 --> 03:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
defined and has created a huge problem
 
03:58:21.269 --> 03:58:21.279 align:start position:0%
fiscally for the agency we've received
 
03:58:26.630 --> 03:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
some pretty uh lofty bills and um and I
 
03:58:28.630 --> 03:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
I think it's just simply not because
 
03:58:30.550 --> 03:58:30.560 align:start position:0%
people are acting you know
 
03:58:31.950 --> 03:58:31.960 align:start position:0%
inappropriately I think it's just
 
03:58:34.229 --> 03:58:34.239 align:start position:0%
because the expectations are not clear
 
03:58:36.429 --> 03:58:36.439 align:start position:0%
by virtue of you know what constitutes a
 
03:58:39.149 --> 03:58:39.159 align:start position:0%
predium so I think we need to to survey
 
03:58:41.229 --> 03:58:41.239 align:start position:0%
the boards I think we need to understand
 
03:58:44.750 --> 03:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
the time commitments um and nursing
 
03:58:47.110 --> 03:58:47.120 align:start position:0%
medicine Pharmacy real estate those are
 
03:58:49.429 --> 03:58:49.439 align:start position:0%
ones that put in a lot of time there are
 
03:58:51.510 --> 03:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
boards that meet quarterly so obviously
 
03:58:53.309 --> 03:58:53.319 align:start position:0%
they would not be be anticipated to
 
03:58:55.269 --> 03:58:55.279 align:start position:0%
receive the same
 
03:58:58.110 --> 03:58:58.120 align:start position:0%
prum followup follow
 
03:59:00.309 --> 03:59:00.319 align:start position:0%
up then wouldn't it be in the best
 
03:59:02.030 --> 03:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
interest if you're going to consult with
 
03:59:05.269 --> 03:59:05.279 align:start position:0%
them to let them continue setting the
 
03:59:08.229 --> 03:59:08.239 align:start position:0%
rates in consultation with you instead
 
03:59:10.189 --> 03:59:10.199 align:start position:0%
of you as executive director taking
 
03:59:11.910 --> 03:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
overall boards that if you're going to
 
03:59:13.229 --> 03:59:13.239 align:start position:0%
consult with them they're better known
 
03:59:16.349 --> 03:59:16.359 align:start position:0%
to what time frame they put in and what
 
03:59:17.590 --> 03:59:17.600 align:start position:0%
they should be
 
03:59:20.070 --> 03:59:20.080 align:start position:0%
paid I don't think so representative
 
03:59:21.269 --> 03:59:21.279 align:start position:0%
because part of the problem that we're
 
03:59:24.510 --> 03:59:24.520 align:start position:0%
running into here is that it's it's very
 
03:59:28.110 --> 03:59:28.120 align:start position:0%
easy to spend other other people's money
 
03:59:31.349 --> 03:59:31.359 align:start position:0%
right um and and what's happening is
 
03:59:33.469 --> 03:59:33.479 align:start position:0%
that the boards by virtue of them no
 
03:59:35.110 --> 03:59:35.120 align:start position:0%
longer performing the administrative
 
03:59:37.030 --> 03:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
functions aren't really seeing the
 
03:59:39.189 --> 03:59:39.199 align:start position:0%
impact um that some of the decisions
 
03:59:42.189 --> 03:59:42.199 align:start position:0%
that they're making could have on the
 
03:59:45.630 --> 03:59:45.640 align:start position:0%
agency as a whole um I I really think
 
03:59:48.790 --> 03:59:48.800 align:start position:0%
that uh the agency does the budgeting
 
03:59:51.710 --> 03:59:51.720 align:start position:0%
and so the agency needs to determine how
 
03:59:54.710 --> 03:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
it's going to um allocate its
 
03:59:58.070 --> 03:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
resources with consultation from the
 
04:00:02.149 --> 04:00:02.159 align:start position:0%
boards follow up follow up uh Al got a
 
04:00:04.469 --> 04:00:04.479 align:start position:0%
question about the setting the changing
 
04:00:07.110 --> 04:00:07.120 align:start position:0%
the quorums I'm I'm concerned about that
 
04:00:09.189 --> 04:00:09.199 align:start position:0%
as well when
 
04:00:11.630 --> 04:00:11.640 align:start position:0%
um most things are in statute or in
 
04:00:15.429 --> 04:00:15.439 align:start position:0%
place a quum is of those that have uh
 
04:00:18.630 --> 04:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
the open not open positions included
 
04:00:22.110 --> 04:00:22.120 align:start position:0%
it's of the board as a whole um I
 
04:00:23.670 --> 04:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
understand the problem with a position
 
04:00:26.309 --> 04:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
being left open for two years but I
 
04:00:27.830 --> 04:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
guess my question is why was that left
 
04:00:29.189 --> 04:00:29.199 align:start position:0%
open for two years was it because they
 
04:00:31.189 --> 04:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
couldn't find anybody or because it was
 
04:00:34.349 --> 04:00:34.359 align:start position:0%
just never done and whose fault is that
 
04:00:35.750 --> 04:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
um I don't think we should be making
 
04:00:39.110 --> 04:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
policy changes based on one in incident
 
04:00:42.389 --> 04:00:42.399 align:start position:0%
um I just don't think a board members
 
04:00:44.389 --> 04:00:44.399 align:start position:0%
the board position should be left open
 
04:00:46.070 --> 04:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
for two
 
04:00:49.149 --> 04:00:49.159 align:start position:0%
years um so how why just because of that
 
04:00:50.189 --> 04:00:50.199 align:start position:0%
instance I don't understand why we
 
04:00:52.389 --> 04:00:52.399 align:start position:0%
should change a quum requirement so that
 
04:00:54.550 --> 04:00:54.560 align:start position:0%
was just one example representative but
 
04:00:56.710 --> 04:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
actually this uh statutory change is
 
04:00:59.110 --> 04:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
widely supported by the boards um who
 
04:01:01.590 --> 04:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
are impacted leak is one of them leak
 
04:01:03.950 --> 04:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
has a statute that sets the specific
 
04:01:06.110 --> 04:01:06.120 align:start position:0%
Quorum requirement at four
 
04:01:08.389 --> 04:01:08.399 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the fact that um you
 
04:01:09.950 --> 04:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
know I think they have seven board
 
04:01:12.070 --> 04:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
members and I think they may have eight
 
04:01:14.229 --> 04:01:14.239 align:start position:0%
board me U maybe nine um but in any
 
04:01:16.309 --> 04:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
event they have a set number of board
 
04:01:18.950 --> 04:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
members whereas the majority of board's
 
04:01:21.469 --> 04:01:21.479 align:start position:0%
practice acts established a quorum to be
 
04:01:23.229 --> 04:01:23.239 align:start position:0%
the majority of those appointed and
 
04:01:24.990 --> 04:01:25.000 align:start position:0%
confirmed by governor and Council so
 
04:01:27.309 --> 04:01:27.319 align:start position:0%
even if you have nine seats if you only
 
04:01:28.870 --> 04:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
have seven appointed obviously your
 
04:01:32.670 --> 04:01:32.680 align:start position:0%
Quorum would be four um but certain
 
04:01:35.030 --> 04:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
boards aren't able to obtain a quorum
 
04:01:37.429 --> 04:01:37.439 align:start position:0%
and it's not just by not being able to
 
04:01:38.830 --> 04:01:38.840 align:start position:0%
fill the seat
 
04:01:41.349 --> 04:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
representative there are many times
 
04:01:44.429 --> 04:01:44.439 align:start position:0%
where board members um have to recuse
 
04:01:47.229 --> 04:01:47.239 align:start position:0%
themselves and that poses a a quum
 
04:01:49.269 --> 04:01:49.279 align:start position:0%
problem as well so this is actually a
 
04:01:51.630 --> 04:01:51.640 align:start position:0%
provision widely supported by the boards
 
04:01:56.110 --> 04:01:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:01.990 --> 04:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:04.309 --> 04:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
followup but if someone has to recuse
 
04:02:05.950 --> 04:02:05.960 align:start position:0%
thems one or two people have to recuse
 
04:02:07.990 --> 04:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
them the language is still there stating
 
04:02:10.910 --> 04:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
that it's of those appointed and present
 
04:02:13.469 --> 04:02:13.479 align:start position:0%
so that wouldn't change that scenario by
 
04:02:16.269 --> 04:02:16.279 align:start position:0%
recusing because they'd still be present
 
04:02:19.910 --> 04:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
no actually if if the if if it requires
 
04:02:22.309 --> 04:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
if the statutory language like like the
 
04:02:24.189 --> 04:02:24.199 align:start position:0%
statutory language that we're seeking to
 
04:02:28.229 --> 04:02:28.239 align:start position:0%
change in this bill requires four for a
 
04:02:31.070 --> 04:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
quorum um to make decisions you need
 
04:02:34.269 --> 04:02:34.279 align:start position:0%
four you need four people who can
 
04:02:37.149 --> 04:02:37.159 align:start position:0%
vote and that's the
 
04:02:37.159 --> 04:02:39.349 align:start position:0%
vote and that's the
problem

04:02:39.349 --> 04:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
problem
 
04:02:42.149 --> 04:02:42.159 align:start position:0%
I think I think that the question was if
 
04:02:44.710 --> 04:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
there are seven members appointed but
 
04:02:47.469 --> 04:02:47.479 align:start position:0%
two of them have recused themselves is
 
04:02:50.110 --> 04:02:50.120 align:start position:0%
the Quorum still
 
04:02:50.120 --> 04:02:56.429 align:start position:0%
the Quorum still
for

04:02:56.429 --> 04:02:56.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:59.469 --> 04:02:59.479 align:start position:0%
yesk thank you do it give talks about
 
04:03:03.950 --> 04:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:07.349 --> 04:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you madam chair um I'm not
 
04:03:08.950 --> 04:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
sure if this is
 
04:03:12.189 --> 04:03:12.199 align:start position:0%
a question for Miss Courtney or actually
 
04:03:16.229 --> 04:03:16.239 align:start position:0%
for uh you madam chair or perhaps
 
04:03:19.269 --> 04:03:19.279 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt I see several
 
04:03:23.229 --> 04:03:23.239 align:start position:0%
different areas in the bill uh and the
 
04:03:27.229 --> 04:03:27.239 align:start position:0%
final phrase in that section is
 
04:03:29.830 --> 04:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
something of the nature consistent with
 
04:03:34.550 --> 04:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
the retention policy established by the
 
04:03:38.269 --> 04:03:38.279 align:start position:0%
oplc um who's going to oversee the
 
04:03:42.149 --> 04:03:42.159 align:start position:0%
policy that oplc establishes is that
 
04:03:44.990 --> 04:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
something that would be uh Incorporated
 
04:03:48.189 --> 04:03:48.199 align:start position:0%
by administrative rules or who would you
 
04:03:50.910 --> 04:03:50.920 align:start position:0%
get approval of I mean just you're just
 
04:03:54.710 --> 04:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
going to be the executive director and
 
04:03:56.510 --> 04:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
king or queen and this is the way it's
 
04:04:00.670 --> 04:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:03.389 --> 04:04:03.399 align:start position:0%
determined yeah so agencies in order to
 
04:04:06.750 --> 04:04:06.760 align:start position:0%
adopt um I mean theyd have to we'd have
 
04:04:08.710 --> 04:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
to engage in Ru making and traditionally
 
04:04:10.469 --> 04:04:10.479 align:start position:0%
retention policies also have to be
 
04:04:12.309 --> 04:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
approved by the Secretary of State's
 
04:04:15.510 --> 04:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
office so um so that's how we would go
 
04:04:18.070 --> 04:04:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:21.710 --> 04:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
process you're saying that the retention
 
04:04:24.349 --> 04:04:24.359 align:start position:0%
policy will be an agency policy and it
 
04:04:25.790 --> 04:04:25.800 align:start position:0%
is reviewed and approved by the
 
04:04:29.110 --> 04:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State correct um just to
 
04:04:30.710 --> 04:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
make sure it's appropriate so for
 
04:04:33.469 --> 04:04:33.479 align:start position:0%
example we may have one um rule
 
04:04:35.309 --> 04:04:35.319 align:start position:0%
pertaining to disciplinary files how
 
04:04:36.830 --> 04:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
long you have to keep a disciplinary
 
04:04:38.590 --> 04:04:38.600 align:start position:0%
file you may have a rule R pertaining to
 
04:04:41.910 --> 04:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
lure files as it stands we have boards
 
04:04:43.990 --> 04:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
that have approved retention policies
 
04:04:45.950 --> 04:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
for the same types of files that are
 
04:04:49.189 --> 04:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
vastly different um some boards have
 
04:04:50.349 --> 04:04:50.359 align:start position:0%
stated that you need to keep
 
04:04:52.990 --> 04:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
disciplinary files forever some have
 
04:04:54.670 --> 04:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
stated that you only need to keep um
 
04:04:56.590 --> 04:04:56.600 align:start position:0%
certain portions of a disciplinary file
 
04:04:59.550 --> 04:04:59.560 align:start position:0%
forever some say only seven years I I
 
04:05:01.149 --> 04:05:01.159 align:start position:0%
think you can appreciate that it's it's
 
04:05:02.750 --> 04:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
very difficult for us to
 
04:05:05.030 --> 04:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
administratively um support different
 
04:05:06.750 --> 04:05:06.760 align:start position:0%
retention policies 54 different
 
04:05:09.070 --> 04:05:09.080 align:start position:0%
retention policies particularly we have
 
04:05:13.469 --> 04:05:13.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:18.269 --> 04:05:18.279 align:start position:0%
66 question question
 
04:05:21.429 --> 04:05:21.439 align:start position:0%
um that as an example I wasn't referring
 
04:05:25.469 --> 04:05:25.479 align:start position:0%
specifically to hential although that is
 
04:05:28.110 --> 04:05:28.120 align:start position:0%
one of the areas but there are several
 
04:05:29.910 --> 04:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
other things
 
04:05:34.070 --> 04:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
um that's that basically just reverts
 
04:05:36.630 --> 04:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
back to we're going to tell you this is
 
04:05:39.630 --> 04:05:39.640 align:start position:0%
what you have to do and that's my
 
04:05:42.389 --> 04:05:42.399 align:start position:0%
concern um and I don't know for example
 
04:05:45.510 --> 04:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
with the retention does there need to be
 
04:05:48.389 --> 04:05:48.399 align:start position:0%
uh a site to approval by the Secretary
 
04:05:52.469 --> 04:05:52.479 align:start position:0%
of State's office or some of these other
 
04:05:52.479 --> 04:05:55.269 align:start position:0%
of State's office or some of these other
statements

04:05:55.269 --> 04:05:55.279 align:start position:0%
statements
 
04:05:59.149 --> 04:05:59.159 align:start position:0%
um there need to be a site to a
 
04:06:02.269 --> 04:06:02.279 align:start position:0%
Consulting Authority or
 
04:06:04.910 --> 04:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
whatever so the language as drafted
 
04:06:06.710 --> 04:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
grants the office the authority to
 
04:06:08.790 --> 04:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
establish um
 
04:06:10.990 --> 04:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
policies through this retention
 
04:06:13.590 --> 04:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
basically retention schedule through
 
04:06:16.389 --> 04:06:16.399 align:start position:0%
rulemaking I believe representative and
 
04:06:18.750 --> 04:06:18.760 align:start position:0%
I could I believe having researched this
 
04:06:21.950 --> 04:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
about a year ago that there is another
 
04:06:24.830 --> 04:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
statute that sets forth what state
 
04:06:26.790 --> 04:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
agencies and public bodies have to do in
 
04:06:29.149 --> 04:06:29.159 align:start position:0%
order to approve or Implement a
 
04:06:31.990 --> 04:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
retention schedule and it's specif so I
 
04:06:33.510 --> 04:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
so obviously we would be expected to
 
04:06:36.870 --> 04:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
comply with that statute as well but um
 
04:06:39.950 --> 04:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
I will do that res search and and follow
 
04:06:42.110 --> 04:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
up with you after that um because I just
 
04:06:43.550 --> 04:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
don't know the statutory citation off
 
04:06:47.590 --> 04:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
the top of my head okay followup Madam
 
04:06:51.070 --> 04:06:51.080 align:start position:0%
chair follow up as I said I wasn't
 
04:06:54.510 --> 04:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
referring only to retention I see
 
04:06:56.710 --> 04:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
another one uh talking about an
 
04:06:58.389 --> 04:06:58.399 align:start position:0%
applicant for
 
04:07:01.389 --> 04:07:01.399 align:start position:0%
registration um so on and so forth using
 
04:07:04.710 --> 04:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
the method prescribed and furnished by
 
04:07:09.229 --> 04:07:09.239 align:start position:0%
the office of oplc uh so like I said
 
04:07:11.189 --> 04:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
there are several different sites in
 
04:07:16.149 --> 04:07:16.159 align:start position:0%
here that basically reverts the policy
 
04:07:19.269 --> 04:07:19.279 align:start position:0%
decision back to the head off rather
 
04:07:21.309 --> 04:07:21.319 align:start position:0%
than the individual
 
04:07:25.070 --> 04:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
board yeah yeah and that's purposeful um
 
04:07:27.269 --> 04:07:27.279 align:start position:0%
you know if I may just briefly explain
 
04:07:29.590 --> 04:07:29.600 align:start position:0%
what's going on in the office my
 
04:07:31.389 --> 04:07:31.399 align:start position:0%
assessment is that the reason the agency
 
04:07:31.399 --> 04:07:32.870 align:start position:0%
assessment is that the reason the agency
hasn't

04:07:32.870 --> 04:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
hasn't
 
04:07:35.830 --> 04:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
really aside from probably ineffective
 
04:07:38.149 --> 04:07:38.159 align:start position:0%
leadership hasn't uh been been able to
 
04:07:40.630 --> 04:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
really do what it's been asked to do in
 
04:07:42.349 --> 04:07:42.359 align:start position:0%
terms of promote efficiencies is because
 
04:07:44.510 --> 04:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
it hasn't had the authority to adopt
 
04:07:46.510 --> 04:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
procedures and streamlined application
 
04:07:48.670 --> 04:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
processes across the board I'm not
 
04:07:50.309 --> 04:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
talking about standards I'm not talking
 
04:07:53.269 --> 04:07:53.279 align:start position:0%
about criteria as to you know what
 
04:07:55.630 --> 04:07:55.640 align:start position:0%
somebody needs to accomplish in order to
 
04:07:58.710 --> 04:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
obtain a license as a nurse we've got 54
 
04:08:01.309 --> 04:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
boards councils and commissions um most
 
04:08:03.830 --> 04:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
of them have many different licensing
 
04:08:07.109 --> 04:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
types and we've got to effectively
 
04:08:07.119 --> 04:08:08.550 align:start position:0%
types and we've got to effectively
administer

04:08:08.550 --> 04:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
administer
 
04:08:11.750 --> 04:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh hundreds of different forms um
 
04:08:13.870 --> 04:08:13.880 align:start position:0%
hundreds of different workflow and
 
04:08:18.670 --> 04:08:18.680 align:start position:0%
processes with 66 full-time people uh
 
04:08:20.469 --> 04:08:20.479 align:start position:0%
that just doesn't work and we've seen
 
04:08:22.910 --> 04:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
that and that's one of the reasons why
 
04:08:24.710 --> 04:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
the way occupational licensing is set up
 
04:08:26.349 --> 04:08:26.359 align:start position:0%
in the state it's a barrier it's a
 
04:08:28.510 --> 04:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
barrier to Workforce entry just based on
 
04:08:31.950 --> 04:08:31.960 align:start position:0%
the process not the standards so I think
 
04:08:33.990 --> 04:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
that we really need to standardize and
 
04:08:36.389 --> 04:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
streamline and I think that's what 310a
 
04:08:38.389 --> 04:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
was intended to accomplish by giving
 
04:08:41.510 --> 04:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
oplc that Authority but unfortunately
 
04:08:43.750 --> 04:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
when oplc did obtain that Authority and
 
04:08:45.469 --> 04:08:45.479 align:start position:0%
I do believe we do have the authority to
 
04:08:47.950 --> 04:08:47.960 align:start position:0%
adopt streamlined procedures there
 
04:08:50.229 --> 04:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
remain statutory Provisions that don't
 
04:08:52.349 --> 04:08:52.359 align:start position:0%
allow us to effectuate that intent and
 
04:08:54.550 --> 04:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
these are the statutory Provisions for
 
04:08:58.070 --> 04:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
example when we say um you know in the
 
04:08:58.080 --> 04:09:00.189 align:start position:0%
example when we say um you know in the
bill

04:09:00.189 --> 04:09:00.199 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:09:02.870 --> 04:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
um they have to follow the procedures
 
04:09:04.630 --> 04:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
and that were established by the office
 
04:09:05.870 --> 04:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
of professional Li Insurance
 
04:09:08.710 --> 04:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
certification that's a procedure process
 
04:09:10.510 --> 04:09:10.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect the substance but we do
 
04:09:12.990 --> 04:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
need one process to follow otherwise
 
04:09:15.309 --> 04:09:15.319 align:start position:0%
we're never going to be competitive um
 
04:09:16.630 --> 04:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
with other states in terms of
 
04:09:19.830 --> 04:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
Occupational licensing and um it's
 
04:09:20.910 --> 04:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to continue to see the
 
04:09:23.030 --> 04:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
turnover in the agency because it's just
 
04:09:25.750 --> 04:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
not an effective way um to to administer
 
04:09:27.590 --> 04:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
state government just my opinion and I'm
 
04:09:29.990 --> 04:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
off on a tangent but that's just that's
 
04:09:32.070 --> 04:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
the intent of this
 
04:09:33.870 --> 04:09:33.880 align:start position:0%
Bill thank
 
04:09:36.510 --> 04:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:09:36.520 --> 04:09:41.149 align:start position:0%
you representative
Schmidt

04:09:41.149 --> 04:09:41.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:44.070 --> 04:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so
 
04:09:46.469 --> 04:09:46.479 align:start position:0%
uh what youve been talking about Miss
 
04:09:46.479 --> 04:09:47.790 align:start position:0%
uh what youve been talking about Miss
Courtney

04:09:47.790 --> 04:09:47.800 align:start position:0%
Courtney
 
04:09:50.229 --> 04:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
is the kind of thing that I think some
 
04:09:53.630 --> 04:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
of us senior members of the of house
 
04:09:56.590 --> 04:09:56.600 align:start position:0%
Edna have been wrestling with or at
 
04:09:59.710 --> 04:09:59.720 align:start position:0%
least pondering for years believing that
 
04:10:03.269 --> 04:10:03.279 align:start position:0%
the structure of oplc is
 
04:10:06.790 --> 04:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
dysfunctional uh is just not designed to
 
04:10:06.800 --> 04:10:08.149 align:start position:0%
dysfunctional uh is just not designed to
work

04:10:08.149 --> 04:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:10:10.750 --> 04:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
um or the way it is designed it can't
 
04:10:13.269 --> 04:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
work anyway so there there's some of
 
04:10:15.710 --> 04:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
these some aspects of this bill that are
 
04:10:17.830 --> 04:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward that I think we
 
04:10:19.750 --> 04:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
can probably agree on some of the other
 
04:10:21.590 --> 04:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
stuff I think we're going to have to
 
04:10:26.429 --> 04:10:26.439 align:start position:0%
wrestle with I'm wondering um have you
 
04:10:30.229 --> 04:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
prioritized uh the various components of
 
04:10:33.550 --> 04:10:33.560 align:start position:0%
of the bill uh with regard to that
 
04:10:36.429 --> 04:10:36.439 align:start position:0%
specific aspect that I've just
 
04:10:36.439 --> 04:10:37.990 align:start position:0%
specific aspect that I've just
discussed

04:10:37.990 --> 04:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
04:10:40.790 --> 04:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean certain things are are um
 
04:10:43.070 --> 04:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
higher priorities than others um I would
 
04:10:45.189 --> 04:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
say PDM is pretty top of the list
 
04:10:47.670 --> 04:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
because it's blowing our budget um as
 
04:10:49.469 --> 04:10:49.479 align:start position:0%
soon as we run out of money you know I
 
04:10:50.910 --> 04:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
had somebody submit a bill the other day
 
04:10:50.920 --> 04:10:51.550 align:start position:0%
had somebody submit a bill the other day
for

04:10:51.550 --> 04:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:10:53.710 --> 04:10:53.720 align:start position:0%
$8,000 as soon as the money's gone the
 
04:10:55.710 --> 04:10:55.720 align:start position:0%
money's gone and I legally can't spend
 
04:10:58.790 --> 04:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
it so um so I think that's a high
 
04:11:01.790 --> 04:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
priority um but the other thing um that
 
04:11:03.510 --> 04:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
I think is a high priority is the quum
 
04:11:05.469 --> 04:11:05.479 align:start position:0%
requirement I think because that really
 
04:11:08.109 --> 04:11:08.119 align:start position:0%
impacts lure honestly doesn't have an
 
04:11:11.149 --> 04:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
impact to oplc as an agency um we
 
04:11:13.109 --> 04:11:13.119 align:start position:0%
observed that this was a problem for the
 
04:11:14.790 --> 04:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
boards and the boards supported this
 
04:11:16.510 --> 04:11:16.520 align:start position:0%
change with the Quorum requirements
 
04:11:18.469 --> 04:11:18.479 align:start position:0%
because they're not able to to timely
 
04:11:20.269 --> 04:11:20.279 align:start position:0%
license people all the time because they
 
04:11:22.630 --> 04:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
can't obtain a quorum and I agree with
 
04:11:24.429 --> 04:11:24.439 align:start position:0%
representative goal that in an Ideal
 
04:11:26.630 --> 04:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
World all seats would be filled all the
 
04:11:30.070 --> 04:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
time um we've we we do our best um to
 
04:11:32.389 --> 04:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
try to obtain uh qualified candidates
 
04:11:34.429 --> 04:11:34.439 align:start position:0%
obviously it's not up to the agency to
 
04:11:36.469 --> 04:11:36.479 align:start position:0%
appoint them um the governor's office
 
04:11:38.109 --> 04:11:38.119 align:start position:0%
typically nominates
 
04:11:39.790 --> 04:11:39.800 align:start position:0%
um but I have great relationship with a
 
04:11:41.990 --> 04:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
lot of professional associations but you
 
04:11:44.590 --> 04:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
know we've got a Midwifery council with
 
04:11:47.269 --> 04:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
I think seven people on it and only 30
 
04:11:50.830 --> 04:11:50.840 align:start position:0%
lenses so at some point everybody who's
 
04:11:53.070 --> 04:11:53.080 align:start position:0%
a l is going to cycle through that
 
04:11:55.510 --> 04:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
Council that it makes it difficult I
 
04:11:57.910 --> 04:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
think to to find Qualified people who
 
04:12:00.630 --> 04:12:00.640 align:start position:0%
are willing to to give up their time so
 
04:12:03.790 --> 04:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
that obviously would also be a priority
 
04:12:07.670 --> 04:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
and then um certainly the um the
 
04:12:10.030 --> 04:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
retention policy is a big priority we
 
04:12:13.030 --> 04:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
just have so much paper we are doing our
 
04:12:16.309 --> 04:12:16.319 align:start position:0%
best right now to um scan everything in
 
04:12:19.870 --> 04:12:19.880 align:start position:0%
um hopefully with hb2 we've proposed um
 
04:12:22.990 --> 04:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
not hb2 but um hb1 we've proposed and
 
04:12:24.349 --> 04:12:24.359 align:start position:0%
the governor has supported and the house
 
04:12:28.030 --> 04:12:28.040 align:start position:0%
has supported thus far um our ability to
 
04:12:31.070 --> 04:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
um spend funds for an electronic record
 
04:12:32.830 --> 04:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
keeping system a document management
 
04:12:36.030 --> 04:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
system that will help um but we have
 
04:12:39.469 --> 04:12:39.479 align:start position:0%
documents going back to the 30s that are
 
04:12:41.550 --> 04:12:41.560 align:start position:0%
just in boxes and storage all over the
 
04:12:43.309 --> 04:12:43.319 align:start position:0%
place we're really trying to get our
 
04:12:46.590 --> 04:12:46.600 align:start position:0%
hands around this issue um we've
 
04:12:48.990 --> 04:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
developed naming conventions we've um
 
04:12:51.349 --> 04:12:51.359 align:start position:0%
scanning things in we're trying our best
 
04:12:55.670 --> 04:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
not to accept paper documents but but
 
04:12:58.389 --> 04:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
this goes back to the authority of what
 
04:12:59.990 --> 04:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
the different statutes and the rules
 
04:13:03.910 --> 04:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
look like um to me I look at that as a
 
04:13:05.990 --> 04:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
procedure should should a board be able
 
04:13:07.950 --> 04:13:07.960 align:start position:0%
to dictate that we have to accept paper
 
04:13:10.510 --> 04:13:10.520 align:start position:0%
or can the agency adopt you know an
 
04:13:13.910 --> 04:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
online um portal process which would
 
04:13:15.510 --> 04:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
which is consistent with what other
 
04:13:18.269 --> 04:13:18.279 align:start position:0%
states have across the country um but if
 
04:13:19.990 --> 04:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
you allow boards to pick and choose how
 
04:13:22.229 --> 04:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
they're going to accept applications not
 
04:13:23.950 --> 04:13:23.960 align:start position:0%
the content of the applications but how
 
04:13:25.109 --> 04:13:25.119 align:start position:0%
they're going to accept it we're going
 
04:13:27.469 --> 04:13:27.479 align:start position:0%
to end up um with the process that we
 
04:13:28.870 --> 04:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
have which is that we just have to
 
04:13:32.309 --> 04:13:32.319 align:start position:0%
accept everything in perpetuity so that
 
04:13:34.429 --> 04:13:34.439 align:start position:0%
is a huge um problem for us right now is
 
04:13:38.469 --> 04:13:38.479 align:start position:0%
the retention policy we do have um we
 
04:13:40.830 --> 04:13:40.840 align:start position:0%
have been working as part of the grant
 
04:13:42.189 --> 04:13:42.199 align:start position:0%
that we received through the Department
 
04:13:45.630 --> 04:13:45.640 align:start position:0%
of Labor we had contracted with clear um
 
04:13:47.510 --> 04:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
to conduct an analysis of certain
 
04:13:50.429 --> 04:13:50.439 align:start position:0%
licensing categories um for the boards
 
04:13:52.630 --> 04:13:52.640 align:start position:0%
but we had amended that scope to conduct
 
04:13:54.870 --> 04:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
an analysis of the umbrella agencies as
 
04:13:57.510 --> 04:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
a whole um I don't yet have that
 
04:13:59.830 --> 04:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
analysis or that report I suspect I will
 
04:14:02.030 --> 04:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
have that next week but I do have the
 
04:14:05.349 --> 04:14:05.359 align:start position:0%
survey that was conducted um and over
 
04:14:08.389 --> 04:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
70% of the 23 umbrella agencies across
 
04:14:11.030 --> 04:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
the country responded and I can provide
 
04:14:13.030 --> 04:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
that to the committee um because it just
 
04:14:16.349 --> 04:14:16.359 align:start position:0%
may be um helpful um to have that data
 
04:14:18.070 --> 04:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
and that information as to what other
 
04:14:19.630 --> 04:14:19.640 align:start position:0%
states have
 
04:14:22.389 --> 04:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
done follow up follow
 
04:14:25.950 --> 04:14:25.960 align:start position:0%
up so I think this is frankly very
 
04:14:27.510 --> 04:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
useful because we've got a lot of new
 
04:14:29.630 --> 04:14:29.640 align:start position:0%
members on this committee who haven't
 
04:14:32.550 --> 04:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
had to deal with any of this craziness
 
04:14:36.349 --> 04:14:36.359 align:start position:0%
uh I I've been on for 15 years and and
 
04:14:38.910 --> 04:14:38.920 align:start position:0%
and uh oplc actually I think has been
 
04:14:41.550 --> 04:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
around more than the seeven six or seven
 
04:14:44.189 --> 04:14:44.199 align:start position:0%
years that Senator guer referenced I
 
04:14:49.189 --> 04:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
think it's more like 10 years um but uh
 
04:14:52.710 --> 04:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
it the the Quorum issue is one that you
 
04:14:56.469 --> 04:14:56.479 align:start position:0%
you've uh emphasized here uh do you
 
04:14:58.590 --> 04:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
recall it may have been before you came
 
04:15:02.109 --> 04:15:02.119 align:start position:0%
on board we had a quorum situation A
 
04:15:04.309 --> 04:15:04.319 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago where we shortened
 
04:15:07.429 --> 04:15:07.439 align:start position:0%
the Quorum requirements it the this has
 
04:15:11.309 --> 04:15:11.319 align:start position:0%
to be a problem Nationwide I would think
 
04:15:14.269 --> 04:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
uh so is there is there some kind of a
 
04:15:17.950 --> 04:15:17.960 align:start position:0%
workaround because this this committee
 
04:15:20.790 --> 04:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
can't function without a quorum it's not
 
04:15:23.590 --> 04:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
legal and I recognize that somebody who
 
04:15:28.870 --> 04:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
was recused um doesn't count uh so uh
 
04:15:30.870 --> 04:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
there there has to be some kind of an
 
04:15:34.269 --> 04:15:34.279 align:start position:0%
alternative uh have you explored that
 
04:15:37.349 --> 04:15:37.359 align:start position:0%
aspect with regard to the Corum situ
 
04:15:41.030 --> 04:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
which is crucial I agree with you yeah I
 
04:15:42.830 --> 04:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
I think what we've observed within the
 
04:15:44.950 --> 04:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
agency is that the boards that have a
 
04:15:47.429 --> 04:15:47.439 align:start position:0%
quum um that is simply the majority of
 
04:15:49.189 --> 04:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
those appointed by governor and Council
 
04:15:51.790 --> 04:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
don't typically run into Quorum problems
 
04:15:53.229 --> 04:15:53.239 align:start position:0%
It's usually the boards that have a
 
04:15:56.630 --> 04:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
specific number of people um like for
 
04:15:57.990 --> 04:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
example Hearing Care Providers their
 
04:15:59.590 --> 04:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
Quorum is four they only have four
 
04:16:01.670 --> 04:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
people can you can you repeat the the
 
04:16:04.590 --> 04:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
name again you got by me too fast yeah
 
04:16:07.109 --> 04:16:07.119 align:start position:0%
Hearing Care Providers is hearing okay
 
04:16:11.750 --> 04:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh leak is another one right I
 
04:16:14.309 --> 04:16:14.319 align:start position:0%
believe psych psychology may be one as
 
04:16:16.790 --> 04:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
well there are several um that are in
 
04:16:18.990 --> 04:16:19.000 align:start position:0%
this bill that have a specific set
 
04:16:21.070 --> 04:16:21.080 align:start position:0%
number regardless of how many people
 
04:16:23.870 --> 04:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
have actually filled the
 
04:16:26.750 --> 04:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
slots okay well
 
04:16:28.630 --> 04:16:28.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this frankly needs a
 
04:16:29.910 --> 04:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee but we can't do
 
04:16:32.349 --> 04:16:32.359 align:start position:0%
subcommittees during the pandemic but we
 
04:16:35.309 --> 04:16:35.319 align:start position:0%
we've got to sit down and and knock out
 
04:16:37.710 --> 04:16:37.720 align:start position:0%
uh individual aspects of this that
 
04:16:39.870 --> 04:16:39.880 align:start position:0%
because you're you're literally trying
 
04:16:41.870 --> 04:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
you I'm sure you're familiar with the
 
04:16:44.429 --> 04:16:44.439 align:start position:0%
the pl the jugglers and plate Spinners
 
04:16:46.870 --> 04:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
you've just got too many plates to spin
 
04:16:50.469 --> 04:16:50.479 align:start position:0%
as you know in Your Capacity um so thank
 
04:16:52.950 --> 04:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:16:57.469 --> 04:16:57.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:59.870 --> 04:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam chair just a
 
04:17:03.950 --> 04:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
quick question uh regarding uh you made
 
04:17:05.790 --> 04:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
a comment just a few minutes ago about
 
04:17:08.790 --> 04:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
some of these changes to be made to be
 
04:17:11.189 --> 04:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
competitive with other states can you
 
04:17:12.590 --> 04:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
elaborate a little bit about what you
 
04:17:14.030 --> 04:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
meant by
 
04:17:17.030 --> 04:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
that yeah I mean we're losing Workforce
 
04:17:20.510 --> 04:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
to Vermont Massachusetts Maine um when I
 
04:17:23.590 --> 04:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
talk to people seeking lure it's often
 
04:17:26.790 --> 04:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
times um you know they make comments to
 
04:17:28.309 --> 04:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
the effect of oh well I was able to get
 
04:17:31.030 --> 04:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
a license um from Vermont in 24 hours
 
04:17:33.910 --> 04:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
that is their policy um but it takes it
 
04:17:35.189 --> 04:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
takes like the board of mental health
 
04:17:37.550 --> 04:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
practice for example 60 days
 
04:17:39.670 --> 04:17:39.680 align:start position:0%
um for to issue a license and so I got a
 
04:17:41.590 --> 04:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
job offer in Vermont and so I'm going to
 
04:17:44.429 --> 04:17:44.439 align:start position:0%
Vermont and that um data became very
 
04:17:47.510 --> 04:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
clear um when the pandemic hit um by
 
04:17:49.149 --> 04:17:49.159 align:start position:0%
virtue of the governor issuing an
 
04:17:51.149 --> 04:17:51.159 align:start position:0%
emergency order authorizing the office
 
04:17:53.670 --> 04:17:53.680 align:start position:0%
not the boards to issue emergency orders
 
04:17:55.870 --> 04:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
and I was very surprised because I I
 
04:17:58.030 --> 04:17:58.040 align:start position:0%
fully anticipated I was the one manually
 
04:18:00.630 --> 04:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
issuing the licenses I expected them to
 
04:18:03.309 --> 04:18:03.319 align:start position:0%
be all Physicians and nurses it was
 
04:18:06.550 --> 04:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
mostly mental health providers and a lot
 
04:18:07.830 --> 04:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
of of them actually lived in New
 
04:18:09.149 --> 04:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they just didn't have a New
 
04:18:11.550 --> 04:18:11.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire license because they were
 
04:18:14.830 --> 04:18:14.840 align:start position:0%
working in another state um and when I
 
04:18:18.070 --> 04:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
talk to a lenes and when I talk to
 
04:18:20.990 --> 04:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
Providers along the border um one of the
 
04:18:24.389 --> 04:18:24.399 align:start position:0%
biggest um hurdles that I have heard
 
04:18:26.550 --> 04:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
about regardless of whether or not you
 
04:18:28.309 --> 04:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
know perception is everything is that
 
04:18:31.030 --> 04:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is slow for lure and just
 
04:18:33.630 --> 04:18:33.640 align:start position:0%
the time frame alone not the content the
 
04:18:36.309 --> 04:18:36.319 align:start position:0%
time frame as it relates to other states
 
04:18:37.349 --> 04:18:37.359 align:start position:0%
if we
 
04:18:40.550 --> 04:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
slow um we're going to lose those those
 
04:18:42.870 --> 04:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
applicants to other states that's what I
 
04:18:45.710 --> 04:18:45.720 align:start position:0%
mean by competitive in the process not
 
04:18:47.429 --> 04:18:47.439 align:start position:0%
the content but the
 
04:18:50.950 --> 04:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
process followup follow
 
04:18:53.109 --> 04:18:53.119 align:start position:0%
up so
 
04:18:56.349 --> 04:18:56.359 align:start position:0%
under current practice license share
 
04:18:58.149 --> 04:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
goes through the boards and under the
 
04:18:59.910 --> 04:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
executive order can you tell me how are
 
04:19:01.790 --> 04:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
you issuing the licenses just by getting
 
04:19:03.269 --> 04:19:03.279 align:start position:0%
information or is it still going the
 
04:19:06.870 --> 04:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
board still part of the process the
 
04:19:08.790 --> 04:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
boards are part of the permanent lure
 
04:19:11.189 --> 04:19:11.199 align:start position:0%
process the emergency order specifically
 
04:19:13.269 --> 04:19:13.279 align:start position:0%
authorize the agency not the boards to
 
04:19:16.109 --> 04:19:16.119 align:start position:0%
issue emergency licenses with provided
 
04:19:18.550 --> 04:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
certain criteria were established and
 
04:19:20.910 --> 04:19:20.920 align:start position:0%
that includes having a license in a in
 
04:19:22.510 --> 04:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
another jurisdiction that's in good
 
04:19:24.750 --> 04:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
standing so that's that's the only
 
04:19:27.550 --> 04:19:27.560 align:start position:0%
criteria that we're looking at and today
 
04:19:30.030 --> 04:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
I think we've issued about 25,000
 
04:19:30.040 --> 04:19:31.229 align:start position:0%
I think we've issued about 25,000
emergency

04:19:31.229 --> 04:19:31.239 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
04:19:34.630 --> 04:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
licenses um honestly the uh complaints
 
04:19:37.189 --> 04:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
that I've received have drastically
 
04:19:40.109 --> 04:19:40.119 align:start position:0%
declined since March because people are
 
04:19:42.349 --> 04:19:42.359 align:start position:0%
able to get an immediate temporary
 
04:19:44.349 --> 04:19:44.359 align:start position:0%
license while they pursue the permanent
 
04:19:44.359 --> 04:19:47.189 align:start position:0%
license while they pursue the permanent
application

04:19:47.189 --> 04:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:50.950 --> 04:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
process and that is that
 
04:19:52.990 --> 04:19:53.000 align:start position:0%
followup is that the direction we're
 
04:19:54.830 --> 04:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
looking to go is issue Temporaries until
 
04:19:58.189 --> 04:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
they can go through full lure and for a
 
04:20:00.590 --> 04:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
permanent solution here in New Hampshire
 
04:20:02.349 --> 04:20:02.359 align:start position:0%
yeah we already have that um there was a
 
04:20:04.389 --> 04:20:04.399 align:start position:0%
statutory change to
 
04:20:07.030 --> 04:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
310a um last year I think I forget which
 
04:20:09.269 --> 04:20:09.279 align:start position:0%
bill was tacked on to at the very end an
 
04:20:11.590 --> 04:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
Omnibus Bill but after the state of
 
04:20:14.309 --> 04:20:14.319 align:start position:0%
emergency ends it granted oplc the
 
04:20:16.149 --> 04:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
authority to issue temporary licenses
 
04:20:18.990 --> 04:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
for a period of up to 120 days um
 
04:20:20.550 --> 04:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
provided that the individual has a
 
04:20:22.109 --> 04:20:22.119 align:start position:0%
license in another
 
04:20:24.630 --> 04:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction um and I think it makes
 
04:20:26.469 --> 04:20:26.479 align:start position:0%
sense if you have a license in another
 
04:20:28.510 --> 04:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction that's in good standing
 
04:20:30.710 --> 04:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
you're most likely qualified and you
 
04:20:32.269 --> 04:20:32.279 align:start position:0%
have been working you're most likely
 
04:20:35.429 --> 04:20:35.439 align:start position:0%
qualified um to work um in terms of risk
 
04:20:37.910 --> 04:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis does it make sense to
 
04:20:41.149 --> 04:20:41.159 align:start position:0%
make those individuals uh wait months on
 
04:20:44.149 --> 04:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
end to obtain a license probably not and
 
04:20:45.670 --> 04:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
I think that's been reflected in the
 
04:20:49.309 --> 04:20:49.319 align:start position:0%
general Court's um work with the 330 uh
 
04:20:51.710 --> 04:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
332g regarding reciprocity and other
 
04:20:53.429 --> 04:20:53.439 align:start position:0%
statements regarding temp
 
04:20:55.109 --> 04:20:55.119 align:start position:0%
lure thank
 
04:20:59.269 --> 04:20:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:01.429 --> 04:21:01.439 align:start position:0%
br thank
 
04:21:04.790 --> 04:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
you comparing um the structure that
 
04:21:08.910 --> 04:21:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:11.109 --> 04:21:11.119 align:start position:0%
how would it compare to the structure
 
04:21:14.229 --> 04:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
that's being used for
 
04:21:17.910 --> 04:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
similar offices in other states that are
 
04:21:21.510 --> 04:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:24.990 --> 04:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so um in the report that I can
 
04:21:27.910 --> 04:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
Ser I can provide you has some states
 
04:21:29.349 --> 04:21:29.359 align:start position:0%
have released their organizational
 
04:21:33.630 --> 04:21:33.640 align:start position:0%
charts um the structure in terms of
 
04:21:36.030 --> 04:21:36.040 align:start position:0%
organizationally that's an hb2 that's
 
04:21:38.229 --> 04:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
very consistent with the structure and
 
04:21:42.630 --> 04:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
other offices um a large um a decent
 
04:21:45.590 --> 04:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
number of umbrella agencies their boards
 
04:21:47.670 --> 04:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
like Vermont their boards are advisory
 
04:21:49.630 --> 04:21:49.640 align:start position:0%
boards which is very different obviously
 
04:21:52.070 --> 04:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
than what we have in New Hampshire um
 
04:21:53.830 --> 04:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is the only state that has
 
04:21:56.349 --> 04:21:56.359 align:start position:0%
an umbrella agency that and that has
 
04:21:59.389 --> 04:21:59.399 align:start position:0%
policy autonomous boards that do not
 
04:22:02.790 --> 04:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
have someone or some oversight over the
 
04:22:06.030 --> 04:22:06.040 align:start position:0%
policies established by the boards um
 
04:22:10.149 --> 04:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
and many states uh the agency um has
 
04:22:12.030 --> 04:22:12.040 align:start position:0%
sort of like veto Authority in other
 
04:22:14.070 --> 04:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
states there's a legislative committee
 
04:22:17.189 --> 04:22:17.199 align:start position:0%
and other states it's the governor um so
 
04:22:19.149 --> 04:22:19.159 align:start position:0%
we do have four advisory boards in the
 
04:22:21.790 --> 04:22:21.800 align:start position:0%
office right now um but that's that's
 
04:22:23.950 --> 04:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
obviously a slight minority that's not
 
04:22:25.870 --> 04:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
what we're proposing by virtue of this
 
04:22:28.389 --> 04:22:28.399 align:start position:0%
legislation but but just globally that's
 
04:22:30.550 --> 04:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
how umbrella agencies are typically
 
04:22:32.550 --> 04:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
operating across the
 
04:22:35.109 --> 04:22:35.119 align:start position:0%
country so there isn't anybody that's
 
04:22:39.149 --> 04:22:39.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:41.950 --> 04:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
um well it depends on the function that
 
04:22:44.189 --> 04:22:44.199 align:start position:0%
we're talking about there are 23
 
04:22:46.349 --> 04:22:46.359 align:start position:0%
umbrella agencies across the country and
 
04:22:49.109 --> 04:22:49.119 align:start position:0%
there are certain aspects of what we do
 
04:22:51.550 --> 04:22:51.560 align:start position:0%
um that are very similar to other boards
 
04:22:54.630 --> 04:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
by and large um umbrella agencies do
 
04:22:57.550 --> 04:22:57.560 align:start position:0%
have the authority to adab to adopt
 
04:22:59.790 --> 04:22:59.800 align:start position:0%
procedures application processes
 
04:23:03.070 --> 04:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
contract for applications software and
 
04:23:04.510 --> 04:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
that's what we should have in New
 
04:23:06.550 --> 04:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I think that's what the
 
04:23:08.910 --> 04:23:08.920 align:start position:0%
intent is in 310a we haven't been able
 
04:23:11.030 --> 04:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
to implement it because of the statutory
 
04:23:13.670 --> 04:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
barriers that are reflected in
 
04:23:16.630 --> 04:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
sp58 um if we're talking about globally
 
04:23:19.149 --> 04:23:19.159 align:start position:0%
Authority that's a conversation that I
 
04:23:21.030 --> 04:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
think the state needs to have doesn't
 
04:23:24.429 --> 04:23:24.439 align:start position:0%
need to have in the context of sp58 but
 
04:23:27.109 --> 04:23:27.119 align:start position:0%
um that's that that is very different
 
04:23:29.189 --> 04:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
from what other states I think
 
04:23:34.349 --> 04:23:34.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:37.950 --> 04:23:37.960 align:start position:0%
chair if we if this implemented what
 
04:23:37.960 --> 04:23:39.910 align:start position:0%
chair if we if this implemented what
type

04:23:39.910 --> 04:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
type
 
04:23:43.070 --> 04:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
of it doesn't seem to me that some of
 
04:23:45.590 --> 04:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
the boards are going to
 
04:23:48.349 --> 04:23:48.359 align:start position:0%
be uh satisfied with
 
04:23:52.550 --> 04:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
this so how are you going to handle the
 
04:23:55.030 --> 04:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
conflicts there really isn't anything in
 
04:23:58.030 --> 04:23:58.040 align:start position:0%
sp58 that I think is controversial and
 
04:23:59.510 --> 04:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
um I do have a very good working
 
04:24:01.550 --> 04:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
relationship with the large majority of
 
04:24:05.189 --> 04:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
boards we don't always agree um but
 
04:24:07.870 --> 04:24:07.880 align:start position:0%
that's okay um we're all willing to come
 
04:24:11.030 --> 04:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
to the table and figure it out um and
 
04:24:12.910 --> 04:24:12.920 align:start position:0%
just the other day I was speaking to the
 
04:24:14.830 --> 04:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine specifically regarding
 
04:24:16.309 --> 04:24:16.319 align:start position:0%
the retention issues because they were
 
04:24:18.389 --> 04:24:18.399 align:start position:0%
concerned they they rely heavily on
 
04:24:20.349 --> 04:24:20.359 align:start position:0%
their investigative materials and I you
 
04:24:21.830 --> 04:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
know we worked it through and you know
 
04:24:24.349 --> 04:24:24.359 align:start position:0%
we're going to um establish a working
 
04:24:27.590 --> 04:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
group um my intent is not to come on
 
04:24:29.309 --> 04:24:29.319 align:start position:0%
come in here and not work with people
 
04:24:31.309 --> 04:24:31.319 align:start position:0%
and establish rules that are just non-w
 
04:24:33.109 --> 04:24:33.119 align:start position:0%
workable we have to work with each other
 
04:24:35.229 --> 04:24:35.239 align:start position:0%
I have 350 board members that I have to
 
04:24:36.710 --> 04:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
get along with
 
04:24:38.710 --> 04:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
but I have noticed that there are just
 
04:24:40.710 --> 04:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
certain barriers to getting anything
 
04:24:43.429 --> 04:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
done uh for anybody and that doesn't
 
04:24:46.710 --> 04:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
help any of the boards so um I don't
 
04:24:48.790 --> 04:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
believe it will be a problem um to work
 
04:24:50.550 --> 04:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
with the boards and actually I don't see
 
04:24:53.990 --> 04:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
anything within this legislation that is
 
04:24:56.189 --> 04:24:56.199 align:start position:0%
uh really remotely controversial the
 
04:24:58.429 --> 04:24:58.439 align:start position:0%
steno requirement is a problem for us
 
04:25:00.429 --> 04:25:00.439 align:start position:0%
because we have to pay money and often
 
04:25:02.670 --> 04:25:02.680 align:start position:0%
times we forget we forget which board
 
04:25:05.030 --> 04:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
has the center requirement the prum is
 
04:25:06.429 --> 04:25:06.439 align:start position:0%
an issue because certain boards feel
 
04:25:07.590 --> 04:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
like they should get one and other
 
04:25:10.309 --> 04:25:10.319 align:start position:0%
boards get one and maybe shouldn't get
 
04:25:13.710 --> 04:25:13.720 align:start position:0%
one um for that particular activity hor
 
04:25:16.269 --> 04:25:16.279 align:start position:0%
requirements it it hurts the boards they
 
04:25:19.550 --> 04:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
can't conduct their business um you know
 
04:25:20.910 --> 04:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
adding the board to the veterinary
 
04:25:22.670 --> 04:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
medicine to our statute that's just
 
04:25:25.070 --> 04:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
that's not substantive the roster
 
04:25:27.510 --> 04:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
requirement I mean that's that's
 
04:25:29.670 --> 04:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
difficult because you know it it can be
 
04:25:31.269 --> 04:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
difficult to manage okay who has a
 
04:25:33.189 --> 04:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
roster and and why do we charge them a
 
04:25:36.109 --> 04:25:36.119 align:start position:0%
100 bucks versus okay this is just
 
04:25:37.349 --> 04:25:37.359 align:start position:0%
something they should the public should
 
04:25:39.149 --> 04:25:39.159 align:start position:0%
be entitled to pursuing to
 
04:25:43.070 --> 04:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
91a um you know the PHP rules that's
 
04:25:45.990 --> 04:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
something that we desperately need um
 
04:25:48.030 --> 04:25:48.040 align:start position:0%
but uh our vendor we haven't been able
 
04:25:50.109 --> 04:25:50.119 align:start position:0%
to adopt them so I'm not seeing anything
 
04:25:52.630 --> 04:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
in here um unless there's somebody on
 
04:25:54.469 --> 04:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
the family mediator certification board
 
04:25:56.349 --> 04:25:56.359 align:start position:0%
that wants to serve for you know in
 
04:25:59.510 --> 04:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
perpetuity that is
 
04:26:01.830 --> 04:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
controversial thank
 
04:26:04.990 --> 04:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
you are there any other
 
04:26:05.000 --> 04:26:09.429 align:start position:0%
you are there any other
questions

04:26:09.429 --> 04:26:09.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:12.389 --> 04:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
right seeing none thank you very much
 
04:26:14.630 --> 04:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much is there anyone else
 
04:26:20.510 --> 04:26:20.520 align:start position:0%

04:26:35.000 --> 04:26:37.149 align:start position:0%
 
speak

04:26:37.149 --> 04:26:37.159 align:start position:0%
speak

me yes thank you very much um for the
 
04:26:46.710 --> 04:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
record Paula minihan Senior vice
 
04:26:48.309 --> 04:26:48.319 align:start position:0%
president state government relations
 
04:26:49.710 --> 04:26:49.720 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire Hospital
 
04:26:52.030 --> 04:26:52.040 align:start position:0%
Association representing all the
 
04:26:54.590 --> 04:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
hospitals in the state we are in strong
 
04:26:57.389 --> 04:26:57.399 align:start position:0%
support of Senate Bill 58 I did submit
 
04:27:00.389 --> 04:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
um brief testimony um so I won't read
 
04:27:04.109 --> 04:27:04.119 align:start position:0%
that but I am in again our hospitals
 
04:27:06.389 --> 04:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
work with many many of the clinical
 
04:27:09.189 --> 04:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
boards as you can imagine um under
 
04:27:12.670 --> 04:27:12.680 align:start position:0%
oplc and we have worked um for years to
 
04:27:14.990 --> 04:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
try to address some of the concerns that
 
04:27:17.109 --> 04:27:17.119 align:start position:0%
I believe are being addressed in Senate
 
04:27:21.189 --> 04:27:21.199 align:start position:0%
Bill 58 as outlined very succinctly and
 
04:27:24.389 --> 04:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
um clearly by um executive director
 
04:27:27.189 --> 04:27:27.199 align:start position:0%
Courtney as well as Senator GAA and
 
04:27:30.590 --> 04:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
Senator Carson um all those issues that
 
04:27:33.910 --> 04:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
she was outlining um our um VPS and
 
04:27:36.910 --> 04:27:36.920 align:start position:0%
directors of HR deal with all the time
 
04:27:39.550 --> 04:27:39.560 align:start position:0%
and have asked um Lindsay for help
 
04:27:42.149 --> 04:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
throughout the years to try to
 
04:27:44.630 --> 04:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
streamline these Quorum issues have
 
04:27:47.950 --> 04:27:47.960 align:start position:0%
caused true true problems with
 
04:27:49.950 --> 04:27:49.960 align:start position:0%
individuals not getting a license and
 
04:27:51.670 --> 04:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
not being able to practice in the state
 
04:27:54.750 --> 04:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and um just the mere
 
04:27:56.550 --> 04:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
reason is because they don't have a
 
04:27:59.550 --> 04:27:59.560 align:start position:0%
quorum to have a board meeting and we
 
04:28:02.149 --> 04:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
would show up at the just to find out
 
04:28:04.229 --> 04:28:04.239 align:start position:0%
that there is no meeting because they
 
04:28:05.510 --> 04:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
the folks were busy because they're
 
04:28:07.870 --> 04:28:07.880 align:start position:0%
clinici misss and they can't leave their
 
04:28:11.269 --> 04:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
offices so I just wanted to reiterate
 
04:28:15.590 --> 04:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
again how important this streamlining is
 
04:28:17.870 --> 04:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
um I know that this is a big change but
 
04:28:21.229 --> 04:28:21.239 align:start position:0%
so was I I was I was here when oplc was
 
04:28:23.990 --> 04:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
created and as as executive director
 
04:28:27.590 --> 04:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
Courtney indicated that it never really
 
04:28:29.870 --> 04:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
I mean that was established but but we
 
04:28:32.269 --> 04:28:32.279 align:start position:0%
have not really streamlined um
 
04:28:35.429 --> 04:28:35.439 align:start position:0%
appropriate protocols and and processes
 
04:28:38.910 --> 04:28:38.920 align:start position:0%
to make it actually function properly um
 
04:28:42.269 --> 04:28:42.279 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to um I'm I I'm happy
 
04:28:43.790 --> 04:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions but really I
 
04:28:46.229 --> 04:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
just wanted to um let you know that the
 
04:28:49.070 --> 04:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
hospitals are very supportive of this
 
04:28:54.189 --> 04:28:54.199 align:start position:0%
effort and um and we encourage you to um
 
04:28:57.309 --> 04:28:57.319 align:start position:0%
to pass the bill that's it thank
 
04:28:59.750 --> 04:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
04:29:02.229 --> 04:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
you representative fellow you have a
 
04:29:08.229 --> 04:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you um for Paula um
 
04:29:10.710 --> 04:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
can you tell me can you tell us which
 
04:29:15.229 --> 04:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
boards those were that were having the
 
04:29:18.109 --> 04:29:18.119 align:start position:0%
problem that you witnessed because I'm
 
04:29:22.109 --> 04:29:22.119 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you weren't going to see all 54
 
04:29:25.149 --> 04:29:25.159 align:start position:0%
boards so correct thank you
 
04:29:27.149 --> 04:29:27.159 align:start position:0%
representative for the question so of
 
04:29:29.189 --> 04:29:29.199 align:start position:0%
course um the hospitals focus on the
 
04:29:31.070 --> 04:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
clinical boards I don't have the list of
 
04:29:33.389 --> 04:29:33.399 align:start position:0%
boards in front of me but I think there
 
04:29:36.149 --> 04:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
are 20 some odd clinical boards um and
 
04:29:39.429 --> 04:29:39.439 align:start position:0%
they run the gamut of um all the Mental
 
04:29:42.870 --> 04:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
Health Professions Allied professions
 
04:29:46.750 --> 04:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
which is an Allied board but it has ptot
 
04:29:49.790 --> 04:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
speech um I feel like I'm forgetting a
 
04:29:52.750 --> 04:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
couple um the med tech registry they
 
04:29:54.710 --> 04:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
deal with they deal with the medical
 
04:29:57.189 --> 04:29:57.199 align:start position:0%
imaging radiation technology board is
 
04:29:59.149 --> 04:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
one of the newer boards that has we've
 
04:30:02.469 --> 04:30:02.479 align:start position:0%
had some um issues getting those rules
 
04:30:04.830 --> 04:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
um set up and again because the rules
 
04:30:07.030 --> 04:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
weren't didn't have a quorum they
 
04:30:09.389 --> 04:30:09.399 align:start position:0%
couldn't finalize rules and it went on
 
04:30:13.389 --> 04:30:13.399 align:start position:0%
for a really long time um we um I'm
 
04:30:15.469 --> 04:30:15.479 align:start position:0%
trying to think I obviously Board of
 
04:30:18.030 --> 04:30:18.040 align:start position:0%
Nursing they deal with Board of Medicine
 
04:30:21.189 --> 04:30:21.199 align:start position:0%
they deal with um I again I don't have I
 
04:30:23.550 --> 04:30:23.560 align:start position:0%
mean there are probably a dozen or so
 
04:30:26.309 --> 04:30:26.319 align:start position:0%
boards that they that the hospitals um
 
04:30:31.950 --> 04:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
work with and assist um in getting their
 
04:30:31.960 --> 04:30:34.630 align:start position:0%
work with and assist um in getting their
clinicians

04:30:34.630 --> 04:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
clinicians
 
04:30:36.469 --> 04:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
licensed so I don't think that was a
 
04:30:40.870 --> 04:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:45.229 --> 04:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
them followup yes followup yeah so just
 
04:30:46.990 --> 04:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to be clear so you're
 
04:30:49.389 --> 04:30:49.399 align:start position:0%
saying that it are you telling us that
 
04:30:52.590 --> 04:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
it's almost every board you deal with
 
04:30:55.670 --> 04:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
has this has had this issue and it's not
 
04:30:59.149 --> 04:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
just two or three or four boards that
 
04:31:01.189 --> 04:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
you deal
 
04:31:04.950 --> 04:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
with so what I think Executive Director
 
04:31:07.990 --> 04:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
Courtney was trying to outline is that
 
04:31:10.790 --> 04:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
because of the variation from board to
 
04:31:15.830 --> 04:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
board and the Quorum issues um for one
 
04:31:18.950 --> 04:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
example and then the proo the processes
 
04:31:21.149 --> 04:31:21.159 align:start position:0%
that they go through they vary from
 
04:31:25.990 --> 04:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
board to board and so it's it's hard for
 
04:31:30.030 --> 04:31:30.040 align:start position:0%
a Hospital HR person that is um has so
 
04:31:32.109 --> 04:31:32.119 align:start position:0%
many employees that they're trying to
 
04:31:35.030 --> 04:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
get licensed because effectively every
 
04:31:37.229 --> 04:31:37.239 align:start position:0%
clinician that works on in a hospital
 
04:31:40.790 --> 04:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
has to be licensed or certified um or
 
04:31:42.910 --> 04:31:42.920 align:start position:0%
registered under in the state of New
 
04:31:45.550 --> 04:31:45.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which is important for patient
 
04:31:49.510 --> 04:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
safety um because each board has their
 
04:31:53.710 --> 04:31:53.720 align:start position:0%
own processes and there is not
 
04:31:56.870 --> 04:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
uniformity we find that there is
 
04:31:59.309 --> 04:31:59.319 align:start position:0%
inefficiencies in that and it's
 
04:32:02.710 --> 04:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
difficult for the HR folks to
 
04:32:05.550 --> 04:32:05.560 align:start position:0%
follow what the requirements are for the
 
04:32:07.469 --> 04:32:07.479 align:start position:0%
various boards and that that's really my
 
04:32:09.750 --> 04:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
point I was not saying I was not naming
 
04:32:11.590 --> 04:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
all the issues that we have with the
 
04:32:15.950 --> 04:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
boards but the mirt and med tech are two
 
04:32:17.990 --> 04:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
that I personally have been involved in
 
04:32:20.429 --> 04:32:20.439 align:start position:0%
through the last three or four years
 
04:32:22.830 --> 04:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
that I have witnessed has been a
 
04:32:26.149 --> 04:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
challenge um but I think it's just um an
 
04:32:30.309 --> 04:32:30.319 align:start position:0%
indication of again separate boards
 
04:32:33.630 --> 04:32:33.640 align:start position:0%
separate processes and inefficiencies
 
04:32:35.950 --> 04:32:35.960 align:start position:0%
are result result from that I think the
 
04:32:38.030 --> 04:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
behavioral health uh Mental Health Board
 
04:32:40.229 --> 04:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
has um we've had a lot of issues
 
04:32:42.109 --> 04:32:42.119 align:start position:0%
throughout the years with that board as
 
04:32:45.950 --> 04:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
well because again um delays in um in
 
04:32:49.550 --> 04:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
getting licensed and um what executive
 
04:32:51.950 --> 04:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
director Courtney indicated is a real
 
04:32:55.309 --> 04:32:55.319 align:start position:0%
concern to the um Health Care Providers
 
04:32:58.590 --> 04:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
relative to losing clinicians because
 
04:33:00.429 --> 04:33:00.439 align:start position:0%
they can't get license quickly in the
 
04:33:04.070 --> 04:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire um and and one
 
04:33:05.590 --> 04:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
issue had to do with the criminal
 
04:33:07.830 --> 04:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
background check process which is not
 
04:33:10.510 --> 04:33:10.520 align:start position:0%
opl's responsibility but the department
 
04:33:14.109 --> 04:33:14.119 align:start position:0%
of safety has certainly um sped that
 
04:33:16.310 --> 04:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
process up by by creating their portal
 
04:33:20.869 --> 04:33:20.879 align:start position:0%
which is very very helpful um but we
 
04:33:24.150 --> 04:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
just yeah I was I was actually asking
 
04:33:24.160 --> 04:33:25.390 align:start position:0%
just yeah I was I was actually asking
specifically

04:33:25.390 --> 04:33:25.400 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
04:33:30.230 --> 04:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
about the the boards and the the Quorum
 
04:33:34.349 --> 04:33:34.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:34.359 --> 04:33:35.869 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:33:35.869 --> 04:33:35.879 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:33:39.670 --> 04:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
I can't I I am not probably um I mean
 
04:33:40.910 --> 04:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
I'd have to go through every single
 
04:33:43.109 --> 04:33:43.119 align:start position:0%
board rules to see what their Quorum
 
04:33:45.990 --> 04:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
requirements are but I can just I'm just
 
04:33:49.189 --> 04:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
asking about your ex your experience so
 
04:33:50.869 --> 04:33:50.879 align:start position:0%
did right you've
 
04:33:53.109 --> 04:33:53.119 align:start position:0%
experienced like trying to go to a
 
04:33:55.910 --> 04:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
meeting and there's no Quorum there and
 
04:33:58.070 --> 04:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if Zoom if they were
 
04:34:00.551 --> 04:34:00.561 align:start position:0%
doing meetings via Zoom if that
 
04:34:03.990 --> 04:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
would partly eliminate that issue make
 
04:34:05.709 --> 04:34:05.719 align:start position:0%
it a lot easier for everybody the
 
04:34:09.789 --> 04:34:09.799 align:start position:0%
meeting not right and I um I'm not sure
 
04:34:12.269 --> 04:34:12.279 align:start position:0%
of the answer to that but absolutely I
 
04:34:14.269 --> 04:34:14.279 align:start position:0%
have shown up at
 
04:34:17.830 --> 04:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
oplc just to find out because the board
 
04:34:21.189 --> 04:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
members are also practicing clinicians
 
04:34:23.869 --> 04:34:23.879 align:start position:0%
they are unable to um
 
04:34:25.709 --> 04:34:25.719 align:start position:0%
participate they cannot have they did
 
04:34:27.510 --> 04:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
not have a quorum for whatever the
 
04:34:29.230 --> 04:34:29.240 align:start position:0%
requirements were so they couldn't hold
 
04:34:32.029 --> 04:34:32.039 align:start position:0%
the meeting which delayed finalizing
 
04:34:35.429 --> 04:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
some licenses that okay I experience
 
04:34:37.750 --> 04:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
that thank thank you for that
 
04:34:39.510 --> 04:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
information you're welcome
 
04:34:41.789 --> 04:34:41.799 align:start position:0%
representative Schmid do you have a
 
04:34:43.470 --> 04:34:43.480 align:start position:0%
question this
 
04:34:45.750 --> 04:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
time I always have a question Madam
 
04:34:48.269 --> 04:34:48.279 align:start position:0%
chair I
 
04:34:52.150 --> 04:34:52.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes please ask 15 your M A 158
 
04:34:53.629 --> 04:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
year member of this committee I have
 
04:34:56.070 --> 04:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
some right to be heard so I object
 
04:34:58.750 --> 04:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
you're muting me you can discipline me
 
04:35:01.910 --> 04:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
but not muting me is is not allowed so
 
04:35:06.789 --> 04:35:06.799 align:start position:0%
in any case uh M Miss cour Mr Courtney
 
04:35:09.869 --> 04:35:09.879 align:start position:0%
uh how much has the pandemic uh
 
04:35:12.670 --> 04:35:12.680 align:start position:0%
complicated this
 
04:35:14.990 --> 04:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
situation um representative Schmidt this
 
04:35:17.910 --> 04:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
is Paul in aan is the question for me
 
04:35:20.429 --> 04:35:20.439 align:start position:0%
I'm the clinician issue that you've
 
04:35:22.949 --> 04:35:22.959 align:start position:0%
addressed obviously is a crucial one but
 
04:35:26.869 --> 04:35:26.879 align:start position:0%
how much is the pandemic uh uh made it
 
04:35:31.189 --> 04:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
worse and then as uh representative
 
04:35:34.310 --> 04:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
fellows was just asking how much has the
 
04:35:37.310 --> 04:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
zoom Al alternative made some things
 
04:35:37.320 --> 04:35:39.830 align:start position:0%
zoom Al alternative made some things
more

04:35:39.830 --> 04:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:44.109 --> 04:35:44.119 align:start position:0%
viable um I would say the pandemic has
 
04:35:48.310 --> 04:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
led to many many concerns um and and
 
04:35:51.551 --> 04:35:51.561 align:start position:0%
delays um throughout the um Hospital
 
04:35:54.709 --> 04:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
industry and and certainly trying to get
 
04:35:58.429 --> 04:35:58.439 align:start position:0%
um um addressing a lot of issues but the
 
04:36:01.949 --> 04:36:01.959 align:start position:0%
temporary licensure process that was um
 
04:36:05.349 --> 04:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
initiated with the emergency order that
 
04:36:07.029 --> 04:36:07.039 align:start position:0%
that executive director Courtney
 
04:36:10.750 --> 04:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
outlined has actually made a tremendous
 
04:36:12.349 --> 04:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
um difference and we actually were
 
04:36:16.390 --> 04:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
involved in and working with her and um
 
04:36:18.709 --> 04:36:18.719 align:start position:0%
to get that established and we were very
 
04:36:20.670 --> 04:36:20.680 align:start position:0%
supportive of that so that has been
 
04:36:23.750 --> 04:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
helpful um I would say zoom in general
 
04:36:26.189 --> 04:36:26.199 align:start position:0%
um makes it easier you know easier for
 
04:36:28.670 --> 04:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
people to testify at hearings like this
 
04:36:31.109 --> 04:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
and easier for people to attend board
 
04:36:33.470 --> 04:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
meetings no question I'm I'm sure of
 
04:36:36.789 --> 04:36:36.799 align:start position:0%
that okay followup so it one of the
 
04:36:39.189 --> 04:36:39.199 align:start position:0%
things is that the governor has issued a
 
04:36:41.629 --> 04:36:41.639 align:start position:0%
lot of emergency orders in view of the
 
04:36:45.590 --> 04:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
pandemic has he been uh engaged with
 
04:36:49.709 --> 04:36:49.719 align:start position:0%
regard to trying to um resolve some of
 
04:36:49.719 --> 04:36:52.429 align:start position:0%
regard to trying to um resolve some of
these

04:36:52.429 --> 04:36:52.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:56.230 --> 04:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
issues I I'm sorry I'm not clear I don't
 
04:37:00.551 --> 04:37:00.561 align:start position:0%
think I I understand your question um
 
04:37:03.269 --> 04:37:03.279 align:start position:0%
what very interesting question but I do
 
04:37:05.910 --> 04:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
not believe Miss menahan is the proper
 
04:37:10.269 --> 04:37:10.279 align:start position:0%
person to ask it of well she is she is
 
04:37:11.789 --> 04:37:11.799 align:start position:0%
certainly involved with the medical
 
04:37:13.590 --> 04:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
professions which is one of the most
 
04:37:15.670 --> 04:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
crucial aspects here so I'm just
 
04:37:18.470 --> 04:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
wondering how much the the hospital
 
04:37:21.029 --> 04:37:21.039 align:start position:0%
Association has tried to engage with the
 
04:37:22.869 --> 04:37:22.879 align:start position:0%
governor with regard to Expediting some
 
04:37:25.189 --> 04:37:25.199 align:start position:0%
things because the legal process and the
 
04:37:27.070 --> 04:37:27.080 align:start position:0%
legislative process are two separate
 
04:37:29.070 --> 04:37:29.080 align:start position:0%
things and the and the legislative
 
04:37:32.510 --> 04:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
process is notoriously slow and the
 
04:37:35.109 --> 04:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
governor's executive Authority is
 
04:37:37.629 --> 04:37:37.639 align:start position:0%
certainly faster and I'm wondering how
 
04:37:39.670 --> 04:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
much you guys have appealed to the
 
04:37:41.949 --> 04:37:41.959 align:start position:0%
governor for some relief if you see a
 
04:37:45.750 --> 04:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:49.070 --> 04:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
direction I there are so many executive
 
04:37:52.470 --> 04:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
or uh emergency orders I I'm not I can
 
04:37:54.470 --> 04:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
just address I'll I I don't know that I
 
04:37:56.310 --> 04:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
can truly answer the question but like
 
04:37:59.349 --> 04:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
tella Health that was an emergency order
 
04:38:01.830 --> 04:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
that was issued early on it was number
 
04:38:04.109 --> 04:38:04.119 align:start position:0%
eight so um that was very early on and
 
04:38:07.629 --> 04:38:07.639 align:start position:0%
that made a was a tremendous help as I
 
04:38:11.910 --> 04:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
think you all know um for um as the
 
04:38:14.189 --> 04:38:14.199 align:start position:0%
pandemic um hit and everything closed
 
04:38:16.551 --> 04:38:16.561 align:start position:0%
down so quickly so that's a good example
 
04:38:18.910 --> 04:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
of an import an emergency order that has
 
04:38:21.510 --> 04:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
been very helpful and the legislature
 
04:38:25.070 --> 04:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
fortunately agreed and um promulgated uh
 
04:38:26.670 --> 04:38:26.680 align:start position:0%
excuse me um
 
04:38:30.990 --> 04:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
implemented um the the statute um to
 
04:38:34.070 --> 04:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
make it permanent last year um so that
 
04:38:36.629 --> 04:38:36.639 align:start position:0%
that has been EX extremely beneficial
 
04:38:39.510 --> 04:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
and welcome um so that's an example I
 
04:38:42.429 --> 04:38:42.439 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that I can um add anything
 
04:38:44.869 --> 04:38:44.879 align:start position:0%
more to to that answer no you've already
 
04:38:46.510 --> 04:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
you've already answered my question the
 
04:38:47.670 --> 04:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
way you
 
04:38:53.990 --> 04:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:56.470 --> 04:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
go thank you madam chair thank you Paul
 
04:38:59.709 --> 04:38:59.719 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um just a quick
 
04:39:01.429 --> 04:39:01.439 align:start position:0%
question on some of these boards that
 
04:39:03.551 --> 04:39:03.561 align:start position:0%
you talked about that didn't have
 
04:39:06.429 --> 04:39:06.439 align:start position:0%
quorums um you St that because of time
 
04:39:09.150 --> 04:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
commitments or work conditions or
 
04:39:11.670 --> 04:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
whatever that people did not
 
04:39:15.109 --> 04:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
attend um was it because of vacancies
 
04:39:17.230 --> 04:39:17.240 align:start position:0%
that there wasn't a quum on the board or
 
04:39:20.310 --> 04:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
did they have a h full uh was their
 
04:39:22.109 --> 04:39:22.119 align:start position:0%
board filled up at the time with uh
 
04:39:23.590 --> 04:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
those permitted
 
04:39:27.709 --> 04:39:27.719 align:start position:0%
slots um I'm not 100% sure
 
04:39:29.390 --> 04:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
representative goalie um what the
 
04:39:32.990 --> 04:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances were um because again they
 
04:39:35.189 --> 04:39:35.199 align:start position:0%
vary and I can't recall which which
 
04:39:37.029 --> 04:39:37.039 align:start position:0%
exact because I attend a lot of board
 
04:39:38.830 --> 04:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
meetings so I can't remember exactly
 
04:39:41.750 --> 04:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
which board it was but it has happened
 
04:39:44.110 --> 04:39:44.120 align:start position:0%
um that they did not have a quorum um
 
04:39:50.030 --> 04:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:53.190 --> 04:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
honest just a quick followup so this may
 
04:39:55.350 --> 04:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
not this bill may
 
04:39:57.948 --> 04:39:57.958 align:start position:0%
not solve all the problems out there if
 
04:39:59.270 --> 04:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
there's some boards that are full still
 
04:40:02.270 --> 04:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:05.270 --> 04:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
correct I think the issue with
 
04:40:08.708 --> 04:40:08.718 align:start position:0%
having that particular number what um
 
04:40:12.190 --> 04:40:12.200 align:start position:0%
does does impact um their ability I do
 
04:40:13.948 --> 04:40:13.958 align:start position:0%
recall that happening once that they
 
04:40:16.670 --> 04:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
needed four I remember that number
 
04:40:18.750 --> 04:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
specifically and um they didn't have
 
04:40:22.310 --> 04:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
four so I I don't know um I don't know
 
04:40:27.948 --> 04:40:27.958 align:start position:0%
but um but as as Lindsay did indicate um
 
04:40:29.750 --> 04:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
when we find out that there and that was
 
04:40:33.470 --> 04:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
a new um procedure implemented by by
 
04:40:35.670 --> 04:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
executive director Courtney when um
 
04:40:38.030 --> 04:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
there are openings in on a board we are
 
04:40:41.470 --> 04:40:41.480 align:start position:0%
made aware as our other um stakeholder
 
04:40:43.788 --> 04:40:43.798 align:start position:0%
organizations to try and
 
04:40:46.990 --> 04:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
recruit um if there's a nurse needed or
 
04:40:51.350 --> 04:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
a med tech needed um a a radiologist
 
04:40:54.030 --> 04:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
needed um we are made aware along with
 
04:40:56.230 --> 04:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
the medical society and the Board of
 
04:40:57.990 --> 04:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
Nursing H excuse not the board of the
 
04:41:00.470 --> 04:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
Nurses Association Etc so that we can
 
04:41:03.270 --> 04:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
try and help to recruit individuals um
 
04:41:05.470 --> 04:41:05.480 align:start position:0%
so that we have a procedure now that was
 
04:41:07.510 --> 04:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
not in place before so I think that is
 
04:41:11.030 --> 04:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
actually has really helped um to to
 
04:41:14.788 --> 04:41:14.798 align:start position:0%
stimulate some interest um to be on a
 
04:41:17.270 --> 04:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
board and to go through that process so
 
04:41:19.150 --> 04:41:19.160 align:start position:0%
that that has been actually very
 
04:41:21.910 --> 04:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you
 
04:41:29.830 --> 04:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:29.840 --> 04:41:33.628 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:41:33.628 --> 04:41:33.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:33.638 --> 04:41:36.910 align:start position:0%
 
oops

04:41:36.910 --> 04:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:40.510 --> 04:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
representative fellows you're muted did
 
04:41:41.910 --> 04:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
you have a
 
04:41:45.470 --> 04:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
question thank you my question has to do
 
04:41:48.990 --> 04:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
with the hospitals that you represent so
 
04:41:50.830 --> 04:41:50.840 align:start position:0%
when they have one of these issues that
 
04:41:52.310 --> 04:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
you were just talking about you know
 
04:41:56.310 --> 04:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:59.270 --> 04:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
hire and there seems to be a delay do
 
04:42:01.190 --> 04:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
you know anything about the procedure
 
04:42:04.628 --> 04:42:04.638 align:start position:0%
that they use for for contacting the
 
04:42:07.230 --> 04:42:07.240 align:start position:0%
state to move this forward do they call
 
04:42:09.948 --> 04:42:09.958 align:start position:0%
is do they have a particular person that
 
04:42:14.868 --> 04:42:14.878 align:start position:0%
they that they call um at the OPC or how
 
04:42:16.270 --> 04:42:16.280 align:start position:0%
does that
 
04:42:16.280 --> 04:42:17.948 align:start position:0%
does that
work

04:42:17.948 --> 04:42:17.958 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:42:20.948 --> 04:42:20.958 align:start position:0%
um Lindsay Courtney has offered to
 
04:42:23.390 --> 04:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
assist so she usually just um has them
 
04:42:26.990 --> 04:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
call her um and and she looks into the
 
04:42:29.590 --> 04:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
issue works with the administrator for
 
04:42:32.230 --> 04:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
the various boards um to to the the
 
04:42:33.830 --> 04:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate board to find out what the
 
04:42:37.948 --> 04:42:37.958 align:start position:0%
delay is and someone gets back to the HR
 
04:42:41.948 --> 04:42:41.958 align:start position:0%
person um to try to um eliminate
 
04:42:44.670 --> 04:42:44.680 align:start position:0%
whatever delay whatever the cause of the
 
04:42:47.150 --> 04:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
delay is if they're missing information
 
04:42:50.868 --> 04:42:50.878 align:start position:0%
whatever it is um so actually um Lynsay
 
04:42:53.030 --> 04:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
has off has provided her contact
 
04:42:54.628 --> 04:42:54.638 align:start position:0%
information and that's typically what
 
04:42:58.390 --> 04:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:03.470 --> 04:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:03.480 --> 04:43:06.350 align:start position:0%
 
information

04:43:06.350 --> 04:43:06.360 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:43:07.708 --> 04:43:07.718 align:start position:0%
all right is there anyone else who
 
04:43:12.470 --> 04:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:17.868 --> 04:43:17.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:20.830 --> 04:43:20.840 align:start position:0%
hand and Miss Courtney while we're
 
04:43:23.948 --> 04:43:23.958 align:start position:0%
thinking about it could you you said you
 
04:43:28.110 --> 04:43:28.120 align:start position:0%
issued about 25,000 temporary licenses
 
04:43:31.070 --> 04:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
if you could give us a breakdown by
 
04:43:33.788 --> 04:43:33.798 align:start position:0%
which board I would very much appreciate
 
04:43:33.798 --> 04:43:38.030 align:start position:0%
which board I would very much appreciate
it

04:43:38.030 --> 04:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:41.670 --> 04:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
I I don't think she's been here for like
 
04:43:44.110 --> 04:43:44.120 align:start position:0%
seven or eight minutes at
 
04:43:46.910 --> 04:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
least okay in that case I'll I'll deal
 
04:43:49.868 --> 04:43:49.878 align:start position:0%
with her on my own all right no one else
 
04:43:53.230 --> 04:43:53.240 align:start position:0%
has raised their hand so I will close
 
04:43:55.070 --> 04:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
the public
 
04:43:59.670 --> 04:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:02.230 --> 04:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
represent yes represent
 
04:44:05.430 --> 04:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
fellow yes can um was not aware that
 
04:44:09.030 --> 04:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
they moved to Eagle Square do did anyone
 
04:44:12.628 --> 04:44:12.638 align:start position:0%
else know that or why they moved they we
 
04:44:17.510 --> 04:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
were notified months ago but so you just
 
04:44:17.520 --> 04:44:19.510 align:start position:0%
were notified months ago but so you just
missed

04:44:19.510 --> 04:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
missed
 
04:44:22.550 --> 04:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
it why did they move because someone
 
04:44:25.150 --> 04:44:25.160 align:start position:0%
else wanted that the uh the building
 
04:44:27.470 --> 04:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
they were in and it was more appropriate
 
04:44:30.150 --> 04:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
to be closer to other
 
04:44:32.830 --> 04:44:32.840 align:start position:0%
facilities exactly okay because I know
 
04:44:34.708 --> 04:44:34.718 align:start position:0%
where the building was I you that where
 
04:44:37.550 --> 04:44:37.560 align:start position:0%
I knew where they were so they moved 66
 
04:44:40.590 --> 04:44:40.600 align:start position:0%
plus people to Eagle Square rented
 
04:44:40.600 --> 04:44:42.708 align:start position:0%
plus people to Eagle Square rented
facility

04:44:42.708 --> 04:44:42.718 align:start position:0%
facility
 
04:44:46.910 --> 04:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
yes yes plus boxes and boxes and boxes
 
04:44:46.920 --> 04:44:49.350 align:start position:0%
yes yes plus boxes and boxes and boxes
of

04:44:49.350 --> 04:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:52.310 --> 04:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
paper uh representative Schmidt thank
 
04:44:54.910 --> 04:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
you for that information I would also
 
04:44:56.628 --> 04:44:56.638 align:start position:0%
like to say that I have muted you
 
04:44:58.750 --> 04:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
exactly once when you were trying to
 
04:45:01.350 --> 04:45:01.360 align:start position:0%
make speeches in a public hearing I'm
 
04:45:03.470 --> 04:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
not trying to make speeches Madam chair
 
04:45:05.590 --> 04:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to have a dialogue one of the
 
04:45:07.270 --> 04:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
things is and you know what it's like
 
04:45:08.830 --> 04:45:08.840 align:start position:0%
you've been on this committee for a long
 
04:45:11.750 --> 04:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
time that that how important
 
04:45:14.270 --> 04:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittees are and we're we're
 
04:45:16.150 --> 04:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
operating with one hand tied behind our
 
04:45:18.470 --> 04:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
back without the ability to make to
 
04:45:20.550 --> 04:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
working subcommittees I don't I don't
 
04:45:22.788 --> 04:45:22.798 align:start position:0%
dispute that we don't have enough staff
 
04:45:26.270 --> 04:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
to do it but it's it we're we're we're
 
04:45:28.350 --> 04:45:28.360 align:start position:0%
hopping in a race where everybody else
 
04:45:28.360 --> 04:45:29.510 align:start position:0%
hopping in a race where everybody else
is

04:45:29.510 --> 04:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:45:32.948 --> 04:45:32.958 align:start position:0%
running yes thank you I was however
 
04:45:35.270 --> 04:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
rather hurt when you implied that I was
 
04:45:37.948 --> 04:45:37.958 align:start position:0%
was in the practice of muting you no no
 
04:45:40.030 --> 04:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
I said I didn't say you're doing it all
 
04:45:42.310 --> 04:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
the time I never said anything except
 
04:45:45.030 --> 04:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
that's not quite kosher you can call me
 
04:45:47.708 --> 04:45:47.718 align:start position:0%
down but anyway the bottom line is we
 
04:45:49.390 --> 04:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
need to work on this this is a
 
04:45:51.868 --> 04:45:51.878 align:start position:0%
desperately important situation you know
 
04:45:53.190 --> 04:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
that because you've been around for a
 
04:45:56.110 --> 04:45:56.120 align:start position:0%
while and you you understand all of this
 
04:45:57.628 --> 04:45:57.638 align:start position:0%
and those of us who've been here for a
 
04:46:00.070 --> 04:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
while we also know that this is a very
 
04:46:02.868 --> 04:46:02.878 align:start position:0%
dysfunctional Agency for various reasons
 
04:46:06.590 --> 04:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
it was badly designed the beginning and
 
04:46:09.708 --> 04:46:09.718 align:start position:0%
the the failure leadership I think that
 
04:46:12.230 --> 04:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
Miss Courtney is doing a great job
 
04:46:15.430 --> 04:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
wrestling with this but she is also uh
 
04:46:17.510 --> 04:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
trying to spin too many plates
 
04:46:19.788 --> 04:46:19.798 align:start position:0%
simultaneously and the Quorum situation
 
04:46:21.470 --> 04:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
you can imagine what it would be like if
 
04:46:23.708 --> 04:46:23.718 align:start position:0%
we didn't have a quum to exec all our
 
04:46:27.030 --> 04:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
bills we'd be handy we'd be helpl us
 
04:46:29.830 --> 04:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate that I'm going to
 
04:46:32.548 --> 04:46:32.558 align:start position:0%
give you my policy on muting if I call
 
04:46:34.868 --> 04:46:34.878 align:start position:0%
someone's name three times and they
 
04:46:38.030 --> 04:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
still keep talking then I'll mute them
 
04:46:40.868 --> 04:46:40.878 align:start position:0%
okay okay it's just that I haven't
 
04:46:43.150 --> 04:46:43.160 align:start position:0%
complained about it before but I I did
 
04:46:45.150 --> 04:46:45.160 align:start position:0%
this time because I'm trying to have a
 
04:46:47.070 --> 04:46:47.080 align:start position:0%
dialogue where we can't have a
 
04:46:49.548 --> 04:46:49.558 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and and Lindsay is doing
 
04:46:52.590 --> 04:46:52.600 align:start position:0%
her damn this and I I I think she she's
 
04:46:54.628 --> 04:46:54.638 align:start position:0%
got she's gotten a lot of Praise from
 
04:46:59.310 --> 04:46:59.320 align:start position:0%
people okay uh represent you like to
 
04:47:01.510 --> 04:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
have a subcommittee meeting we we can
 
04:47:04.430 --> 04:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
standle one we have we have almost a
 
04:47:06.910 --> 04:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
month before we have to EXA this
 
04:47:08.948 --> 04:47:08.958 align:start position:0%
bill okay well I think that would
 
04:47:11.150 --> 04:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
helpful be helpful because we have to
 
04:47:13.470 --> 04:47:13.480 align:start position:0%
have a dialogue and the question and
 
04:47:17.310 --> 04:47:17.320 align:start position:0%
answer format of a hearing is not that
 
04:47:19.430 --> 04:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
functional with regard to some of these
 
04:47:21.708 --> 04:47:21.718 align:start position:0%
issues where we got to go back and forth
 
04:47:23.830 --> 04:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
so let's have a subcommittee we've got
 
04:47:26.430 --> 04:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
enough experienced people to to put
 
04:47:28.390 --> 04:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
together people who don't have to you
 
04:47:30.070 --> 04:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
know find out what's going on before
 
04:47:32.270 --> 04:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
they can make decisions I agreed with
 
04:47:35.750 --> 04:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
you we're I'll schedule a committee
 
04:47:35.760 --> 04:47:37.270 align:start position:0%
you we're I'll schedule a committee
meeting

04:47:37.270 --> 04:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
04:47:41.590 --> 04:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
okay great good representative has a
 
04:47:43.590 --> 04:47:43.600 align:start position:0%
has a comment or a
 
04:47:45.628 --> 04:47:45.638 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair you just
 
04:47:47.750 --> 04:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
answered my uh question and concern as
 
04:47:48.670 --> 04:47:48.680 align:start position:0%
to whether or not we're gonna have a
 
04:47:51.150 --> 04:47:51.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on this Bill thank you okay
 
04:47:52.310 --> 04:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
we will have a
 
04:47:52.320 --> 04:47:54.150 align:start position:0%
we will have a
subcommittee

04:47:54.150 --> 04:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
04:47:57.150 --> 04:47:57.160 align:start position:0%
representative subcommittee huh uh this
 
04:47:59.868 --> 04:47:59.878 align:start position:0%
has been looked at for three years now I
 
04:48:02.190 --> 04:48:02.200 align:start position:0%
even heard a single thing that was
 
04:48:04.070 --> 04:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
substantive this is a technical
 
04:48:06.670 --> 04:48:06.680 align:start position:0%
correction and you I guess I have why
 
04:48:09.230 --> 04:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
not have a subcommittee I suppose but
 
04:48:12.390 --> 04:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
nobody put their finger on any specific
 
04:48:15.868 --> 04:48:15.878 align:start position:0%
anything it was just general concern but
 
04:48:19.548 --> 04:48:19.558 align:start position:0%
nobody could say where it was hurting so
 
04:48:21.390 --> 04:48:21.400 align:start position:0%
if this what's the subcommittee going to
 
04:48:26.548 --> 04:48:26.558 align:start position:0%
do but be generally suspicious so I I
 
04:48:28.190 --> 04:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
trust the three years of work that's
 
04:48:30.470 --> 04:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
been done on the bill representative
 
04:48:32.430 --> 04:48:32.440 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam chair if I could
 
04:48:34.670 --> 04:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
just respond to represent
 
04:48:37.708 --> 04:48:37.718 align:start position:0%
sitech uh we received an approximately
 
04:48:41.430 --> 04:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
70 page Bill last year uh and an Omnibus
 
04:48:43.670 --> 04:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
package um that we could not have a full
 
04:48:46.750 --> 04:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
hearing on um and so we did not vet this
 
04:48:48.910 --> 04:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
fully over the last two years from what
 
04:48:48.920 --> 04:48:51.270 align:start position:0%
fully over the last two years from what
I

04:48:51.270 --> 04:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:53.910 --> 04:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
saw it's been worked in the Senate
 
04:48:55.510 --> 04:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
that's not quite the
 
04:48:59.788 --> 04:48:59.798 align:start position:0%
same sure I I have several suggestions
 
04:49:02.470 --> 04:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
but uh but but it's not appropriate to
 
04:49:05.708 --> 04:49:05.718 align:start position:0%
make them in in a hearing
 
04:49:08.868 --> 04:49:08.878 align:start position:0%
correct all right we will we will I will
 
04:49:12.150 --> 04:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:15.350 --> 04:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
meeting and I think at this point we
 
04:49:18.670 --> 04:49:18.680 align:start position:0%
will adjourn for the day since we've had
 
04:49:21.990 --> 04:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
our public hearing next Wednesday we
 
04:49:25.590 --> 04:49:25.600 align:start position:0%
have a hearing on an Omnibus on
 
04:49:29.868 --> 04:49:29.878 align:start position:0%
licensing I will try to do it section by
 
04:49:33.990 --> 04:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
section and uh I hope that we will ask
 
04:49:36.030 --> 04:49:36.040 align:start position:0%
we will all read the bill prior to the
 
04:49:39.390 --> 04:49:39.400 align:start position:0%
hearing That's My
 
04:49:42.590 --> 04:49:42.600 align:start position:0%
Hope thank you all and good night thank
 
04:49:44.788 --> 04:49:44.798 align:start position:0%
you thank
